as a member of the Commission on May 1, 1967, for the term expiring
June 5, 1967, and was reappointed to a 5-year term ending June 5,1972.

INTRODUcrION
The format for this Annual Report differs in an important way
from that used in previous years. It reflects the Commission's first
attempt to describe its work in accordance with the Planning-Programming-Budgeting System (PPBS) which has been prescribed for
agencies and departments of the Government. Whereas in the past
the Annual Report discussed the Commission's work under each of
the various Acts which the Commission administers, this Report
describes the Commission's activities in terms of the programs that
have been developed under these Acts but which may cut across them.
In its simplest terms PPBS is designed to produce for each agency
a precise definition of its goals and an explanation of how it is implementing those goals. This process requires an analysis of the alternative techniques available and the reasons why the agency chose the
alternatives it did. The principal objective of PPBS "is to improve the
basis for major program decisions, both in the operating agencies and
in the Executive Officeof the President." 1
The Report describes the four principal programs of the Commission. The first is that of full disclosure--to insure that there is adequate information available to the investing public about the issuers of
publicly offered or owned securities and their managements. The second program is market regulation-to
insure that the markets function in a fair and orderly fashion. The third is the anti-fraud program-to control improper practices in the securities markets. The
fourth major program is the regulation of investment companies-a
program which combines elements of the other three in a special context. In addition to these four principal programs, the Report discusses
the Commission's other programs dealing with public utility holding
companies and with corporate reorganizations and a program of
general support for all of the Commission's external activities.
To a great extent the structure of this Report simply represents an
articulation of how the Commission is already making decisions The
increased use of PPBS, however, will help the Commission improve
its effectiveness in implementing the underlying goal of all the Federal securities laws-public confidence in the securities markets.

IMPORTANT RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
MUTUAL FUND REPORT

AND LEGISLATIVE

PROPOSALS

On December 2, 1966, the Commission submitted to Congress its
Report evaluating the policy implications of the growth of the investment company industry since 1940 and recommending legislation designed to meet the major problems it found.' The Report was submitted
pursuant to a provision of the Investment Company Act authorizing
the Commission to make a study and investigation if it deems "that
any substantial further increase in the size of investment companies
creates any problem involving the protection of investors or the public
interest," and to report the results to Congress. The Report concluded
that mutual funds and other investment companies offer a sound and
useful investment medium for the public but that their dramatic
growth in recent years has created problems which require attention
by the Congress, the Commission, and the industry.
The Report had its genesis in 1958 when the Commission authorized
the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce of the University of
Pennsylvania to make a study of the mutual fund industry and to
submit a report to the Commission. The Wharton Report, which was
submitted to Congress in August 1962, found that the important current problems in the mutual fund industry involved potential conflicts
of interest between fund management and shareholders and the impact of fund growth and stock purchases on stock prices.
The Wharton Report was supplemented by the Report of the Special Study of Securities Markets, prepared by a staff group of the
Commission, which dealt with aspects of the mutual fund industry
outside the scope of the Wharton Report. The Special Study's Report,
which was published in 1962-1963, focused on sales of mutual fund
shares, the special problems raised by the front-end load in the sale
of contractual plans and allocations of mutual fund portfolio
brokerage.
Neither the Special Study Report nor the Wharton Report was a
report by the Commission as such. The Commission thereafter carelThe report has been printed as Report No. 2337 of the House Committee on
Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 89th Oong., 2d Bess. Copies may be purchased

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

fully evaluated the public policy questions which were raised by these
Reports and following further studies by its staff submitted its recommendations to Congress in December 1966.
On May 1, 1967, the Commission submitted to Congress its legislative proposals. These proposals were introduced in the Senate as S.
1659 and in the House of Representatives as H.R. 9510 and H.R. 9511.
Hearings were held in July and August 1967 by the Senate Committee
on Banking and Currency and in October 1967 by the House Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance of the Committee on Interstate
and Foreign Commerce. While the legislation was under consideration
by the Congress, the Commission and representatives of the mutual
fund industry discussed revision of certain of the proposals in an attempt to find a satisfactory solution to some of the objections expressed
by the industry.
In November 1967 Senator McIntyre introduced an amendment to
S. 1659 which would specifically authorize commercial banks to operate various types of collective investment funds: (1) collective funds
for managing agency accounts; (2) common trust funds for assets held
by banks in a bona fide fiduciary capacity; (3) collective investment
funds for corporate employee pension, profit-sharing or retirement
plans; and (4) collective funds for so-called H.R. 10 plans for selfemployed persons pursuant to the provisions of the Smathers-Keogh
Act. The amendment would also modify and clarify the application
of the securities laws to various types of activities in which banks engage. In response to a request by the Senate Banking and Currency
Committee, Chairman Cohen testified on the amendment. The Commission took no position on the provision of the amendment which
would authorize banks to operate commingled :funds for managing
agency accounts and for other purposes.
The principal conclusions and recommendations of the Report and
the legislative proposals implementing the recommendations are as
follows:
Mutual Fund Management and Its Cost

The Commission recommended that the Investment Company Act
be amended to provide expressly that all compensation received by investment advisers and other persons affiliated with a registered investment company for services to such company shall be reasonable and to
provide for judicial enforcement of this statutory standard. The standard of reasonableness would be applied in the light of all relevant
factors.
A requirement that the compensation be reasonable would appear
inherent in the fiduciary relationship between investment company
shareholders and an investment advisory organization which is in

THIRTY-THIRD

ANNUAL

REPORT

effective control of the fund. The existing provisions of the Investment
Company Act, however, provide no adequate means by which such a
requirement may be enforced.
Sales Charges Generally

In 1940 Congress determined to leave the question of sales loads
"for the present at least" to competition among principal underwriters
of the different funds. However, owing to the manner in which mutual
fund shares are sold, the underwriters have found it to their advantage
to keep sales loads high in order to compete for dealer interest. This
form of competition is facilitated by the provision of the Act which
prohibits a dealer from selling fund shares below the price specified
by the principal underwriter in the prospectus and thus prevents
price competition among dealers in the sale of shares of any particular fund. Some disparity between mutual fund sales loads and
the cost of investing in listed or unlisted securities may be warranted;
however, the Commission believes the existing disparity, which is
very great by any standard, is unwarranted.
The proposed legislation would place a 5 percent ceiling on charges
for mutual fund sales, subject to a power in the Commission to grant
exceptions where appropriate. This proposed maximum charge would
still be substantially greater than the sales charges generally prevailing in the securities markets.
The Front.End Load

The distinctive feature of so-called contractual plans is that as much
as 50 percent of the payments made by the investor during the first
year may be deducted for sales charges. This feature, known as the
"front-end load," is permitted under a specific provision of the Act.
While the Act limits the aggregate sales charge on a completed plan
to 9 percent of the amount invested, the front-end load feature
works to the disadvantage of all planholders, including those who
complete their plans on schedule. It is particularly to the disadvantage of those who fail to complete their plans since they may pay sales
charges ranging from 25 percent to 100 percent of the net amount
invested in plan shares.
The proposed legislation would eliminate the front-end load feature and require that sales charges be spread equally over all payments, thus reducing the undue loss suffered by those investors who
do not complete their plans, as well as making sure that a greater
proportion of the money paid by an investor is invested for his benefit.
Capital Gains Distributions

The Report concluded that normally there is no justification for
distribution of capital gains more than once a year. More frequent

4

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

distributions facilitate certain improper selling practices for mutual
fund shares and place undesirable pressures on managers of investment company portfolios to realize and distribute capital gains
irrespective of investment considerations.
Under the Commission's proposals, the Act would be amended generally to prohibit investment companies from distributing realized
capital gains to shareholders more than once a year. This proposal
would require all investment companies to conform to the practice
now followed by the majority.
Disqualification of Individuals From Association With an Investment Company

The Report contained recommendations designed to improve the
administration and enforcement of the Act. One of the most important
of these would strengthen the provisions of the Act which bar persons
who have willfully violated the securities laws from being affiliated
in officialcapacities with investment companies.
The Act, which presently disqualifies from association with an
investment company persons convicted or enjoined on the basis of
specified acts of misconduct, would be amended to conform to the
corresponding provisions of the Securities Exchange Act and the
Investment Advisers Act by authorizing administrative proceedings
before the Commission to determine whether or not any person
connected with an investment company has willfully violated the
Federal securities laws and, if so, what sanctions, if any, should be
imposed in the public interest.
Breach of Fiduciary Duty

Another recommendation of the Report which was designed to improve administration and enforcement of the Act concerns Section 36
of the Act, which presently permits the Commission to seek an injunction against investment company managers alleged to be guilty of
gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust. Under the legislative proposals, this Section would be amended to authorize action against such
persons for breach of fiduciary duty to the investment company and
to give the court greater flexibility in choosing remedies.
Insider Trading in Portfolio Seeurities

A new Section would be added to the Act to empower the Commission specifically to adopt rules and regulations with respect to trading
in securities held or being acquired by investment companies by
persons affiliated with such companies. This proposal would fill the
need indicated in the Report for better definitions of standards and
codes of ethics with respect to insider trading in investment company portfolio securities.

TEURTY-TEURD ~AL

REPORT

Fund Holding Companies

The Report found that one of the most striking recent developments in the investment company industry has been the emergence
of the "fund holding company," a mutual fund which invests primarily in the shares of other mutual funds. Fund holding companies
are in a position to exercise undue influence over the activities of their
portfolio companies because of the ever-present possibility that they
will redeem their relatively large holdings in those companies. Moreover, the fund holding company is a particularly expensive investment medium, of doubtful utility to investors.
Under the Commission's proposals, the Act would be amended to
prohibit the creation of new fund holding companies or the acquisition of additional securities of registered investment companies by
existing fund holding companies.
Disinterested Directors

The Commission proposed that the Act be amended to require that
persons acting as so-called independent directors of investment companies be entirely independent of and disinterested in the management. This would exclude persons having close family, business or
professional relationships with management from being classified as
independent directors.
Transfer of Investment Advisory Contracts

A new Section would be added to the Act to prohibit the transfer
of investment advisory or management contracts with investment
companies on terms which are burdensome or inequitable to the investment company. This proposal results from the Report's concern
that the present safeguards in the Act are inadequate to protect fund
shareholders in this area.
Other Matters

Other proposed amendments to the Investment Company Act are
designed to up-date its provisions by eliminating inconsistencies and
deleting certain exemptions. It is also proposed that the Investment
Advisers Act be amended to conform its provisions for disciplinary
action to the 1964 amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and to eliminate the exemptions from the Act for investment advisers
serving investment companies.
Other matters were discussed in the Report which did not result
in recommendations for additional legislation. The Report observed
that mutual funds incurred brokerage costs of more than $100 million
in effecting portfolio transactions during 1965 and that the use of
brokerage to provide additional compensation to dealers selling fund

6

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

shares has potentially adverse effects on mutual fund shareholders
and upon the structure of the securities business and the manner in
which its markets operate. For instance, it encourages fund managers
to direct their portfolio transactions in such a way as to produce the
greatest sales of fund shares, regardless of whether they produce the
best or most economical execution of portfolio transactions. It encourages dealers to recommend to their customers shares of the funds
which offer them the largest amount of income from portfolio business, regardless of whether the shares of these funds are the most
appropriate for the particular customer. The Report concluded that
these problems are rooted in the rules of the stock exchanges. The
Commission has advised the exchanges that re-examination and
changes in their commission rate structures and rules are necessary to
deal with these problems."
The Report also concluded that policy implications of investment
company growth, though not requiring legislative action at this time,
merit the attention of the Congress. The Report examined the market
impact of mutual fund growth and the increasing participation of other
types of institutional investors in the nation's stock markets. While the
markets on the whole have thus far responded to the changes wrought
by increasing strains on the ability of the auction market to handle the
relatively large transactions that are characteristic of institutional investors, these changes require a reappraisal of existing practices and
procedures by the Commission, the securities industry, and institutional investors themselves. Such a reappraisal requires more data than
is now available on the securities holdings and trading patterns of all
institutional investors, including the noninsured private pension funds.
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS
Take-Over

Bid Bill

On August 30,1967, S. 510,the so-called "Take-over Bid" legislation,
was passed by the Senate and is now pending before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. This legislation is designed to afford full disclosure and other protections to investors in
connection with purchases of substantial blocks of stock of publiclyheld corporations either through cash tender offers or private or open
market purchases and in connection with repurchases by corporations
of their own stock. On March 21, and again on :May4,1967, Chairman
Cohen had testified concerning S. 510 before the Subcommittee on
Securities of the Committee on Banking and Currency, United States
Senate. The bill which was passed included certain amendments suggested in the statement submitted by the Commission. The Commission
believes that on the whole the bill provides a workable means of dealing
with the problems which have arisen in these areas.
• See p. 8, infra.

THIRTY-THIRD

ANNUAL

REPORT

The bill would amend Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 to require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more
than 10 percent of any class of registered equity securities to file with
the appropriate exchange, the issuer, and the Commission promptly
after such acquisition a statement containing pertinent information
about his background and identity. It would further make it unlawful
for an issuer to purchase its own securities in contravention of Commission rules. The bill also would amend Section 14 of the Securities
Exchange Act to require any person making a tender offer for any class
of registered equity security which, if consummated, would result in
his owning more than 10 percent of such class, to file with the Commission, send to the issuer and provide to security holders pertinent
information about his background and identity. The bill would provide certain additional protections to shareholders in tender offers.
It would permit persons to withdraw tendered shares within a specified period, provide that tendered shares be taken up on a pro-rata
basis under certain circumstances, provide that subsequent price increases in the tender offer be paid to persons who have already tendered
their shares at lower prices, and prohibit persons soliciting tender offers
from making false, misleading or deceptive statements or engaging in
fraudulent or manipulative practices.
Broker-Dealer Financial Reports

For the past several years, the Commission has continued its research
into broker-dealer operations in an attempt to understand fully the
economic forces at work in the industry. In this connection, the Commission has met with various representatives of the exchanges and the
National Association of Securities Dealers to develop a system whereby
more adequate financial information would become available on a
periodic basis.
As reported in the annual report for 1966, the New York Stock
Exchange, at the Commission's urging, improved its income and
expense reports and made them mandatory for all members doing a
public commission business. The Commission is now engaged in an
effort to obtain reports from all segments of the industry with respect
to all aspects of the securities business. Its staff is working with the
various self-regulatory bodies to formulate a uniform reporting standard for all brokers and dealers. The information contained in these
reports is, of course, vital to the Commission's ability to make informed
decisions in many areas of its responsibilities including the structure of
commissions and other charges paid among the various segments of the
business and by the public. It is also essential to enable the Commission
to keep abreast of the economic trends in all sectors of the industry.
Finally, this information could make more effective the work of the
several self-regulatory institutions.

8

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Commission Level and Structure

The Commission staff has continued to review and study the level
and structure of commission rates on exchanges. In recent years the
growing influence of institutional investors, who typically buy and
sell in large blocks, has greatly complicated the question of the reasonableness of commission rates. It is apparent that a commission rate
structure which requires the same commission per share for large
blocks as for lOO-share blocks is unrelated to the cost of handling
transactions, a fact reflected in the willingness of exchange members
to forego a large proportion of their regular commissions derived
from mutual fund business, through "give-ups," "give-aways," and
reciprocal arrangements. These practices are not desirable. Among
other things, they create substantial conflicts of interest for the
managers of investment companies, since generally the give-ups and
similar practices are used to serve the interests of the managers rather
than the stockholders of the funds. Accordingly, the Commission has
given notice to all exchanges that it believes that exchange rules
must be changed so as to preclude customer-directed give-ups. The
Commission has also urged the exchanges to consider the adoption
of a volume discount. Pursuant to its responsibilities in this area, the
Commission has advised the various self-regulatory organizations
that, if customer-directed give-ups are not abolished, the Commission
itself may find it essential to exercise its rulemaking powers under
the Exchange Act.
Automation of l\larket Facilities

In fiscal year 1966 the Commission appointed an Electronic Data
Processing Committee composed of computer technologists, staff
attorneys and certain administrative personnel to keep abreast of the
increasing implementation of automation techniques and equipment
in the securities markets. During the past fiscal year this Committee and its individual members met with various exchanges, the
National Association of Securities Dealers, suppliers of stock market
data and other interested parties to discuss such matters as the establishment of central bookkeeping systems and central depositories for
securities, the improvement of quotations, the automation of surveillance procedures and the clearing operation, and the automation of
the execution of odd-lot transactions. These continuing conferences
have accomplished two ends. First, they have served to keep the
Commission informed of the many developments in this field and
secondly, they have enabled the Commission to make judgments on
the direction in which these developments have been moving and to
suggest changes, where necessary, for the protection of the public
investor.

THIRTY-TIDRD

ANNUAL REPORT

Extensive meetings and discussions IULYebeen held between the
Commission staff and representatives of the New York Stock Exchange
on the Exchange's development of a central hack office accounting
system and a centralized system for the handling and delivery of
securities through the use of automated procedures.
Review of Exchange Rules Regarding Off-Board Trading

In fiscal year 1966 the Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, requested the New York Stock
Exchange to amend its rules to allow its members to effect transactions
in listed securities off the Exchange. Prior to this request, Exchange
Rule 394 prohibited all off-board transactions in listed securities,
whether effected on a principal or agency basis, unless exempted by
the Exchange. The net effect of the rule was to restrict the public's
ready access to all markets and to limit competition between the
exchange market and the over-the-counter market.
On October 20, 1966, the Board of Governors of the New York
Stock Exchange, in compliance with the Commission's request,
amended Rule 394 to permit member broker-dealers to execute transactions with certain nonmember broker-dealers who maintain markets
in listed securities. In the past fiscal year the Commission has conducted studies to determine whether the rule change has had the
desired effect of promoting competition between the exchange specialist
and the nonmember market-maker and of providing the public customer with the benefits of the best available market. The initial studies
indicated that a relatively small number of exchange members were
making use of the amended rule. Accordingly the Commission has
been working with the Exohange to clarify the rule and certain
Exchange interpretations thereof and to fully educate member firms
to the availability and use of this new mechanism. These efforts are
continuing.

PART II
OPERATION OF THE SECURITIES
OF 1964

ACTS AMENDMENTS

Extension of Disclosure Requirements to Over-the-Counter Securities

The 1964 amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 extended to investors in many publicly held companies whose securities
are traded in the over-the-counter market the same fundamental
disclosure protections which that Act formerly afforded only to investors in companies with securities listed on a national securities
exchange. Generally speaking, Section 12(g), added to the Act in
1961, requires a company with total assets exceeding 1 million dollars
and a class of equity securities held of record by 500 or more persons
to register those securities with the Commission. Upon registration,
the periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and insider reporting and
trading provisions of the Act become applicable.
During the fiscal year, 562 registration statements were filed under
Section 12(g), making a total, together with those previously filed, of
2,746. Eight of these statements were withdrawn before they had become effective upon determination that they were not required to be
filed under the Act. In addition, 45 registrations have been terminated
pursuant to Section 12(g) (4) because the number of shareholders fell
below 300.
Of the 2,746 registration statements filed, 1,568 were those of issuers
already subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Act under
Section 13 or 15(d). This figure includes 135 registration statements
(78 in fiscal year 1965,28 in 1966,and 29 in 1967) filed by issuers with
another security registered on a national securities exchange and 1,433
(851 in fiscal year 1965,353 in 1966,and 229 in 1967) by issuers subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) as a result of having
registered securities under the Securities Act. These 15(d) companies
had, however, not been subject to the proxy solicitation and insider
reporting and trading provisions of the Exchange Act. The remaining
1,170 issuers which filed registration statements (not including those
withdrawn) had not been subject to any of the disclosure or insider
trading provisions and became subject to them through registration.
Issuers with securities registered under Section 12(g) filed 1,984
definitive proxy statements pursuant to Regulation 14A during the
fiscal year. In addition, 18 of the 37 proxy contests during the year
10

THIRTY-THIRD

ANNUAL

REPORT

11

which were subject to Regulation 14A involved securities registered
under Section 12(g). A total of 92 information statements in definitive
form was filed pursuant to Section 14(c), also added to the Act in
1964, and Regulation 14C adopted by the Commission thereunder.
Section 14(c) requires issuers of securities registered under Section 12
(both listed and unlisted), in accordance with rules and regulations
prescribed by the Commission, to transmit to security holders from
whom proxies are not solicited prior to a security holders' meeting
and to file with the Commission an information statement containing
information substantially equivalent to that which would be required
in a proxy statement,"
Exemptions From Registration

Section 12(h) of the Act authorizes the Commission, either by rules
and regulations or by order upon application of an interested person,
to grant a complete or partial exemption from the provisions of Sections 12(g), 13, 14, 15(d), or 16 if the Commission finds that because
of the number of public investors, the amount of trading interest in
the securities, the nature and extent of the activities of the issuer, the
income or assets of the issuer, or otherwise, the exemption is not inconsistent with the public interest or the protection of investors.
During the fiscal year, 13 applications for complete or partial exemptions were filed and 12 applications filed during prior years were
still pending. Of these 25 applications, 4 were granted," 3 were denied,
6 were withdrawn, and 12 were pending at the end of the year. Exemptions were granted for a variety of reasons. In one instance, a
temporary exemption from the Section 12(g) registration requirements was granted pending a determination whether the company
would be liquidated by the court-appointed receiver or its management returned to the stockholders. One issuer which became subject
to the registration requirements as of the end of its last fiscal year
was exempted because, as a result of a tender offer, the number of its
shareholders had subsequently been reduced below 300, and the company would have been entitled to termination of registration. In
another case, an exemption was granted to a broker-dealer and member of the New York Stock Exchange, whose stock is not publicly
traded, but is held mainly by key employees who may resell only to
the firm. Another issuer was exempted from Section 14(c) with respect to any stockholders meeting solely for the election of directors.
1 Complete statistics
with regard to proxy solicitations may be found at p. 89,
infra.
• As required by the Act, exemptions were granted only after notice and opportunity for hearing. No hearings were requested as to any applications which
were granted.

12

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The company's sole operations consisted of receiving the return from
a perpetual lease of its property and the company's only major shareholder had always elected the directors.
In one instance, a requested exemption was denied after a hearing.
The applicant in the case, Orchard Supply Building 00., operates
three retail hardware stores. Its total assets substantially exceed the
minimum figure specified in Section 12(g) and, as of the time of the
hearing, it had more than double the minimum number of shareholders.
The company urged that small shareholders should be disregarded
in applying the 500-shareholder test. It also alleged that there was
limited trading interest in its common stock, that it was basically a
local concern, and that to require compliance with the registration and
other provisions of the Exchange Act would impose a heavy financial
burden on it without commensurate benefit to its shareholders or the
investing public.
In his initial decision the hearing examiner noted the strong public
policy favoring registration, as reflected in the legislative history of
the 1964 amendments, and pointed out that the standards incorporated
in the legislation were the result of very careful administrative and
legislative study and should not be lightly disregarded. He concluded
that the company had not sustained the burden of justifying the requested exemption and that such exemption would not be consistent
with the public interest and the protection of investors. The examiner
rejected the contention that a "de minimis" rule should be applied to
exclude small shareholders from the calculation of the number of
shareholders. He further found that the company's shareholders were
not receiving important financial information which they would receive upon registration; that there had been substantial trading in the
company's stock; and that the extent of its sales indicated that its
operations had a significant impact on interstate commerce. The company did not seek review of the initial decision, and the Commission
did not order review on its own initiative. The initial decision therefore
became the final decision of the Commission,"
Securities of Insurance Companies.-8ecurities
of insurance companies which meet specified conditions are exempted from the provisions of Section 12(g) of the Act. As described in the last annual
report,' these conditions are that (1) the company is required to and
does file an annual statement conforming to that prescribed by the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAJC") with
the insurance regulatory authority of its domiciliary State; (2) the
company is regulated in the solicitation of proxies as prescribed by

the NArC; and (3) the purchase and sale of securities issued by the
company by beneficial owners, directors or officers of the company are
subject to reporting and trading regulations substantially in the manner provided by Section 16 of the Act. Last year's report also discussed
the steps that had been taken by the various States and their insurance
regulatory authorities to meet these conditions.
Securities of Foreign Issuers.-Section
12(g) (3) authorizes the
Commission to grant complete or partial exemptions for foreign securities if it concludes that such exemptions are in the public interest
and consistent with the protection of investors. To determine how best
to apply the Exchange Act to foreign issuers so as to assure that
American investors would have available adequate information about
such issuers, the Commission made an extensive study of the disclosure
and reporting requirements and practices in many of the countries
whose issuers have securities traded in the United States, and of the
requirements of many leading foreign stock exchanges. The Commission also consulted with representatives of American brokers, dealers,
financial analysts, the principal banks issuing American Depositary
Receipts (ADR's) and other persons who are interested in foreign
securities, and received recommendations from interested domestic
and foreign groups. During this study, the Commission exempted
until November 30, 1965, all securities of foreign companies and
certificates of deposit therefor,"
After completing this initial study, the Commission, in November
1965,published for comment proposals including rules and forms to be
applicable to foreign companies subject to Section 12(g).6 The Commission received many comments on these proposals. After careful
consideration of these comments, and after further discussion with
interested persons and groups, the Commission decided not to adopt
the proposals at that time, but rather to extend the temporary exemption until November 30, 1966,1 Because registration of securities under Section 12(g) is not required until 120 days after the end of the
issuer's fiscal year, this extension meant that companies whose fiscal
year ended December 31 would not have to register their securities
until April 30, 1967.
As a basis for further study, the Commission also asked those foreign issuers which it had reason to believe would have been subject
to the Act, had the proposed rules been adopted, to furnish to the
Commission certain information which they made public abroad. Most
of these companies complied with the request. After careful exami• Securities Exchange Act Release No.7 427 (September 15, 1964).

nation of the material furnished, the Commission decided to revise its
original proposals. It determined that the continuing improvement in
the quality of the information being made public by foreign issuers
warranted exempting from Section 12(g) the securities of those foreign companies which have not sought a public market for their securities in the United States through a public offering or through
stock exchange listing, and which furnish the Commission with certain information published pursuant to foreign law or stock exchange
requirement or sent to their security holders.
On April 28, 1967, the Commission adopted Rules 3b-4, 12g3-2, 13a16 and 15d-16 and amended Rules 13a-ll and 1ild-ll.s In connection
with the adoption of these new rules, the registration and annual report forms for use by foreign issuers were also revised and a new Form
6-K for periodic reports was adopted," Under the new rules, securities
of a foreign company are exempt from registration under Section
12 (g) if the class of securities has fewer than 300 holders resident in
the United States. Foreign companies which have not previously been
subject to the reporting requirements of the Act may obtain an exemption from Section 12 (g) by furnishing to the Commission copies of
certain information which they have made public abroad or have sent
to their security holders together with a notification that such information is being furnished in order to obtain the exemption.
Foreign companies which have reporting obligations arising from
the listing of securities on a United States securities exchange or from
a public offering of their securities in the United States are exempted
from Section 12(g) for the duration of such prior obligation. Registration of a class of securities under Section 12(g) would not affect
the reporting requirements of these companies or subject them to any
further provision of the Act, and the exemption thus serves only to
eliminate unnecessary filings. This exemption is not available, however,
to companies 'which are essentially United States companies or to
North American or Cuban companies with securities listed on a United
States securities exchange. Such companies are subject to the provisions of sections 14 and 16 of the Act governing proxy solicitations
and insider reporting and short-term trading with respect to their
registered securities.
The Commission decided not to adopt at the present time special
rules applicable to brokers and dealers who deal in foreign securities.
It did, however, call to the attention of brokers, dealers and investors
the fact that information concerning certain foreign issuers may not
be available in the United States. The Commission intends to issue
• Securities Exchange Act Release No. 8066.
• Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 8067, 8068 and 8069 (April 28, 1967).

lists from time to time showing which foreign issuers have registered
securities under Section 12(g), which have obtained exemptions by
furnishing information in the manner noted, and which have done
neither. One such list was issued on August 10, 1966, showing 80 issuers which had furnished information voluntarily to the Commission
and 32 issuers which had not done SO.'0 The Commission maintains a
continuing review of activity in the markets for foreign securities to
see whether the new rules are achieving their purpose and whether
further rules are necessary.
Regulation of Broker-Dealers Who Are Not Members of Registered Securities
Association

Prior to the 1964 amendments, brokers and dealers registered with
the Commission who were not members of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), or of one of the principal exchanges, were not subject to any comprehensive regulation concerning
their qualifications or business practices. A major objective of the
amendments was "to insure that the Commission has the necessary
authority to provide regulation of nonmember brokers and dealers
comparable to that imposed by (self-regulatory) associations on their
membership, including the requirement that these nonmember brokers
and dealers pay fees which will compensate the Commission for this
additional regulation." 11
Subsections (1;), (9) and (10) of Section 15(b) of the Exchange
Act authorize the Commission to adopt rules and regulations prescribing standards of training and experience and establishing other prerequisites for entry into the securities business by nonmember brokers
and dealers and their associated persons, and rules and regulations for
such brokers and dealers designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent unreasonable profits or unreasonable rates of
commissions or other charges, and in general to protect investors and
the public interest and remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market. The Commission is also authorized to
adopt rules and regulations imposing fees to defray the cost of regulating nonmember broker-dealers.
The last two annual reports of the Commission described the initial
steps taken to implement these statutory provisions." including the
adoption in September 1965 of Rule 15b8-1 which among other things
requires associated persons of nonmember broker-dealers to pass a
qualification examination. During the 1967 fiscal year, 2,368 associated
persons took the Commission's general securities examination, which is

administered by the NASD. As of the end of the fiscal year, there were
462 registered nonmember broker-dealers with a total of about 22,000
associated persons.
During the past fiscal year and within the month following its close,
the Commission took important further steps to implement the statutory provisions. In October 1966, it published a proposal to adopt Rules
15b10-1 through 15b10-6 under Section 15(b) (10).18 On July 17, 1967,
the proposed rules with certain modifications, as well as a Rule 15b10-7,
were adopted, effective October 2, 1967.H The new rules establish
standards of general business conduct, suitability of recommendations
and supervision of associated persons, regulate discretionary accounts,
and impose recordkeeping requirements.
Rule 15b10-1 defines certain terms used in the other rules. Rule
15b10-2 requires nonmember brokers and dealers and their associated
persons to adhere to high standards of commercial honor and just
and equitable principles of trade in the conduct of their business. The
rule is designed to impose a general ethical standard of fair dealing.
Rule 15b10-3, the suitability rule, provides that no recommendation
to purchase, sell, or exchange a security shall be made unless the
broker or dealer or associated person making the recommendation
has reasonable grounds to believe that the recommendation is "not
unsuitable" in view of the customer's investment objectives, financial
situation and needs as disclosed by the customer after reasonable
inquiry or as otherwise known by the broker or dealer or associated
person.
The nature and extent of the inquiry to be made will depend on all
the facts and circumstances. Thus, depending on the length of the
interval between recommendations, it might be sufficient simply to ask
the customer whether there has been any material change in his circumstances since the previous inquiry. The broker-dealer is not precluded from making a recommendation because the customer, after
reasonable inquiry, declines to furnish information concerning his
investment objectives, financial situation and needs.
This rule is not an attempt to second-guess the exercise of the reasonable business judgment of a broker-dealer or to make him an insurer
of favorable investment performance. The recommendation must be
judged in the light of the information available to the broker-dealer
after reasonable inquiry as to the customer's situation at the time of
the recommendation and not by reference to subsequent events.
The discretionary account rule, Rule 15b10-5, provides that discretionary authority to effect transactions in a customer's account must

be given in writing and the customer must indicate his reasons for
granting such authorization.
The supervision and recordkeeping rules are designed to give effect
to the suitability and discretionary account rules. The supervision rule,
Rule 15bl0-4, imposes a general duty on nonmember brokers and
dealers to supervise diligently the securities activities of their associated persons. It requires the maintenance and enforcement of written
procedures setting forth the measures adopted to comply with the
duties imposed by the rule. The written procedures must include the
review and written approval of the opening of new customer accounts;
frequent examination of customer accounts; and the prompt review
and written approval of all securities transactions. The rule also requires that the written procedures include special supervisory treatment for discretionary accounts. Further, a supervisor is required to
review promptly and approve in writing the handling of all customer
complaints which are handled by or pertain to the associated persons
subject to his supervision.
The recordkeeping rule, Rule 15bl0-6, requires that a record with
specified identifying information be kept for each person who becomes
a customer after the effective date of the rule. This record must also
contain the signatures of the customer, the associated person regularly
handling the account and a supervisor designated pursuant to the
supervision rule. Where the broker-dealer, or any associated person,
has made any recommendation to the customer to purchase, sell or
exchange any security, the record must also state the customer's occupation, marital status, investment objectives, and other information
concerning the customer's financial situation and needs which the
broker-dealer or associated person considered in making the recommendation, and the signature of the broker or dealer or associated
person who made the recommendation. If a recommendation is made to
a person who was a customer prior to the effective date of the rule, a
record containing the above information must be made and kept
current.
Where a customer has delegated discretionary authority to the
broker-dealer or any associated person, the broker-dealer's records
must contain the customer's written delegation of discretionary authority, a statement of the customer's reasons for granting such
authority, and the written approval of the supervisor. The rule also
requires maintenance of a separate complaint file, which must include
copies of all material relating to complaints, and a record of action, if
any, taken by the broker-dealer. All records to be maintained under
the recordkeeping rule are required to be preserved for not less than
6 years.

18

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The last of this group of rules, Rule 15bl0---7,exempts from the
other rules members of national securities exchanges who do not carry
customers' accounts and whose annual gross income from the over-thecounter business does not exceed $1,000.
The Commission's staff is presently engaged in drafting additional
rules under Section 15(b) (10) pertaining to advertising and sales literature of nonmember broker-dealers.
In May 1967,the Commission adopted Rule 15b9-1, which establishes
assessment fees for the 1967 fiscal year.!" The rule requires the filing of
an assessment form and payment of a base fee for each nonmember
broker or dealer and payment of additional fees for each associated
person and each officeof the broker-dealer.
Pursuant to the inspection program for nonmember broker-dealers,
a number of inspections were carried out during the year. These were
designed to determine compliance with existing rules and to obtain
information with respect to the type of securities activities engaged in
by nonmember broker-dealers.
Proceedings To Obtain Compliance With Securities Exchange Act Registration
or Reporting Requirements

Section 15(c) (4) which was added to the Securities Exchange Act
by the 1964 amendments assists the Commission in obtaining compliance 'with the registration and reporting provisions of Sections 12,
13 and 15(d) of that Act, in terms both of filing the required documents and of accuracy and completeness of documents filed. Under
the Section if the Commission finds after notice and opportunity for
hearing that any person has failed to comply with these provisions,
the Commission may publish its findings and issue an order requiring
compliance upon such terms and conditions and within such time
as it may specify. The first hearings to be held under Section 15(c) (4)
took place during the 1967 fiscal year. Two of the cases involved
allegedly deficient registration statements under Section 12(g) of
the Act filed by Hadson Ohio Oil Company and Ventura Oil Company, respectively. In the third proceeding, Crescent Corporation
and Pakco Companies, Inc. were charged with the filing of allegedly
deficient periodic reports and failure to file required reports.
The Crescent- Pakco proceeding afforded a striking demonstration
of the use of proceedings under Section 15(c) (4) to obtain adequate
and accurate disclosure of material facts. It was alleged that Crescent,
whose securities are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and
Pakco, an over-the-counter company, had failed to file certain reports
and had filed materially misleading reports in order to conceal certain
material insider transactions. After 2 months of hearings, the com15

panies, pursuant to offers of settlement, filed amended and additional
reports disclosing that the control person of the two companies had
made use of their assets in connection with the purchase of a control
block of Crescent's stock.v
The other two cases were also disposed of pursuant to offers of
settlement. These settlements provided, among other things, for the
filing by Hadson and Ventura of correcting amendments to their
registration statements and the mailing of a copy of the amended
registration statements to their shareholders."
Disciplinary Action Against Broker-Dealers and Their Associated Persons

The provisions enacted in 1964 giving the Commission authority
to proceed directly against and impose sanctions on individuals associated with broker-dealer firms and expanding the range of sanctions
which it may impose on broker-dealers have by now become wellestablished elements in the regulatory scheme. Four proceedings solely
against individuals associated. with broker-dealers were pending at
the beginning of the 1967 fiscal year, and another such proceeding
was instituted during the year. Three of these proceedings resulted
in orders barring the individuals from further association with a
broker-dealer, and two were still pending at the end of the year. In
proceedings in which broker-dealers as well as certain of their associated persons were named as respondents, 102 individuals were barred
from further association with a broker-dealer, and 25 others were
suspended from such association for varying periods of time. In addition' the Commission, in orders entered during the year, suspended
the registrations of two broker-dealers.
Summary Suspension of Over-the-Counter Trading

Section 15(c) (5) of the 1964 amendments authorizes the Commission to suspend over-the-counter trading in any security (except an
exempted security) summarily for 10 days if the Commission believes
the public interest and protection of investors so require. Brokerdealers are prohibited from trading in any such security during the
period of suspension. This provision is a counterpart to Section
19(a) (4) which provides for summary suspension of trading in securities listed on a national securities exchange.
During the 1967 fiscal year, the Commission temporarily suspended
trading in 14 over-the-counter securities, compared to 5 in fiscal 1966
and 2 suspensions in fiscal 1965. In all but one of these cases, the
Commission suspended trading when it learned of information not
generally known to the securities conununity and investors which
indicated that there were substantial questions concerning the finan10

cial condition or business operations of the companies involved. The
suspensions were ordered pending clarification and adequate public
dissemination of information concerning these matters. IS
In some instances, the Commission instituted enforcement action
shortly following the suspension where related violations of law were
uncovered. For example, in a case involving First Standard Corporation of New York City, the Commission suspended over-the-counter
trading in the company's common stock as a result of information
obtained in a staff investigation indicating that incomplete and misleading information and false rumors concerning the business operations of the company and its development of new product lines were
publicly disseminated. Subsequently, the Commission filed a complaint
in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
seeking to enjoin the company and others from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and to compel
the defendants to issue a clarifying statement about the company and
its products. An order enjoining further violations was entered against
the defendants and the issuer thereafter issued a clarifying statement.
The Commission thereupon terminated the trading suspension, cautioning investors to consider carefully the information made available
in connection with the injunctive action before effecting transactions
in the company's stock.
In the remaining case, which involved S & P National Corporation,
the suspension followed a request for such action by the trustee-receiver
of S & P who had been appointed by the court in an injunctive action
by the Commission against the corporation, its subsidiaries and two
individuals. The trustee's request was based on the fact that settlement
negotiations were pending which could result in values to public
holders of S & P stock substantially above the market prices in recent
years. Trading was suspended pending clarification of these matters."
The suspension was later terminated following submission to the court
of a Plan of Settlement and Reorganization under which, among other
things, an offer would be made by S & P to its public stockholders to
purchase their shares at prices above recent market prices, following
which S & P would be liquidated and dissolved." A notice of a hearing
on the Plan which had been mailed to stockholders and published
contained an explanation of the Plan and stated that the Plan was
available for inspection.

m

FULL DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE ISSUERS
OF SECURITIES
One important thrust of the Federal securities laws administered by
the Commission, as well as the rules, regulations, registration and reporting forms adopted by the Commission to implement those laws, is
to provide public disclosure of financial and other information about
publicly-held companies and those companies seeking to raise capital
through the public offering of their securities. The objective of such
disclosure is to enable public investors to evaluate the securities of
these companies on an informed and realistic basis. Thus, the Securities
Act of 1933 requires the filing of registration statements with the Commission by companies proposing the public offering of securities, and
the use of a prospectus containing prescribed financial and other information in the offering and sale of their securities. Certain types of
offerings and securities are exempt from the registration and prospectus requirements of the Securities Act. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the registration of securities and the
filing of annual and other periodic reports containing similar data by
companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange
and by other companies in whose securities, traded over-the-counter,
there is a substantial public interest. The Exchange Act further extends the disclosure principle by requiring disclosure of material information to holders of registered securities whose proxies are solicited
for the election of directors or the approval of other corporate action,
and by requiring "insiders" of companies whose equity securities are
registered to report their holdings of and transactions in all equity
securities of the issuer with whom they are affiliated.
DISCLOSURE

IN CONNECTION

WITH PUBLIC

OFFERINGS

Disclosure under the Securities Act with respect to securities to be
offered for public sale, either by an issuing company or a person in a
control relationship to such company, is obtained through a two-step
process: (1) by requiring the issuer to file with the Commission a
registration statement containing certain required financial and other
information; and (2) by requiring that a prospectus which is a part
of the registration statement and contains the more significant data set
21

22

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

forth in that statement, be furnished to investors so as to enable them
to evaluate the securities and make an informed investment decision.
The registration statement is available for public inspection as soon
as it is filed. Although the securities may be offered for sale upon filing
of the statement under prescribed limitations, actual sales may not
be made until the statement has become effective. The Commission
has no authority to pass on the merits of the securities to be offered or
the fairness of the terms of distribution. In fact, the Act makes it
unlawful to represent to investors that the Commission has approved
or otherwise passed on the merits of registered securities.
Type of Information Included in Registration Statement

Generally speaking, a registration statement relating to securities
issued by a corporation or other private issuer must contain the information specified in Schedule A of the Act, while a statement relating
to securities issued by a foreign government must include the information specified in Schedule B. The Act empowers the Commission to classify issues, issuers and prospectuses, to prescribe appropriate forms, and to increase, or in certain instances vary or
diminish, the particular items of information required to be disclosed
as the Commission deems appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors. To facilitate the registration of securities by
different types of issuing companies, the Commission has prepared
special registration forms which vary in their disclosure requirements
so as to provide maximum disclosure of the essential facts pertinent
in a given type of case while at the same time reducing the burden and
expense of compliance with the law.
In general, the registration statement of an issuer other than a
foreign government must disclose such matters as the names of persons who participate in the management or control of the issuer's
business; the security holdings and remuneration of such persons; the
general character of the business, its capital structure, past history and
earnings; underwriters' commissions; payments to promoters made
within 2 years or intended to be made; the interest of directors, officers
and principal stockholders in material transactions with the issuer;
pending legal proceedings; and the purposes to which the proceeds
of the offering are to be applied, and must include financial statements
certified by an independent accountant. The registration statement of a
foreign government must contain information concerning the purposes for which the proceeds of the offering are to be used, the natural
and industrial resources of the issuer, its revenues, obligations and
expenses, the underwriting and distribution of the securities being
registered, and other material matters, but need not contain certified
financial statements.

REPORT

Proposed Short Form for Registration of Securities of Certain Issuers

The Commission announced during the fiscal year that it had under
consideration a proposed short form (Form S-7) for registration
under the Securities Act of equity securities (including convertible
debt) and subordinated debt securities of certain issuers which are to
be offered to the public for cash.' The form's use would be limited
to domestic and Canadian companies which have a class of equity
securities listed on a national securities exchange and registered under
Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, have filed reports under Section 13 or 15 (d) of that Act for a period of at least
5 years, and meet certain tests as to sales volume, earnings and stability
of management and business.
The proposed form is based on the assumption that issuers meeting
these conditions have disclosed in their periodic reports or proxy or
stockholder information statements adequate information regarding
such matters as the composition and remuneration of management,
transactions of management with the registrant, the issuance of options, and the identity of controlling persons. A prospectus for securities registered on the form would therefore require no disclosure with
respect to these items. Generally speaking, it would require only the
following information: the price and underwriting data; the intended use of the proceeds; a description of the registrant's business;
earning statements; a description of the securities to he registered;
and balance sheets of the registrant and its subsidiaries.
The Commission anticipates that prospectuses and registration statements on the proposed form would be considerably shorter than those
filed on existing forms. They would be substantially easier to prepare
and, if properly prepared, could be processed more rapidly.
The Commission also proposed to amend paragraph (a) of Rule 174
under the Securities Act so that securities registered on the proposed
form would be exempt from the prospectus delivery requirements of
Section 4(3) of the Act. Under this amendment a dealer would not be
required to deliver a prospectus to his customer if he is no longer acting
as an underwriter of the offering or is not engaged in a transaction
involving participation in the offering.
The proposed form would represent a closer integration of the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act
within the present statutory framework. In this connection, the Commission and its staff are engaged in a careful review of the existing
reporting and disclosure requirements under the Securities Exchange
Act to improve the information contained in and the timeliness of the
reports filed under that Act.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

On November 27, 1967, the Commission adopted Form S-7 with
certain revisions resulting from consideration of the public comments
received (Securities Act Release No. 4886).
Simplification of Prospectuses

During the fiscal year the Commission requested the cooperation of
issuers in improving the clarity of prospectuses for securities registered
on Form S-8, a simplified :form for the registration of securities under
various employee stock purchase, savings, stock option and similar
plans," These prospectuses are sometimes unduly complex and technical, particularly the parts describing the plan. Some prospectuses give
the full text of the plan. Others summarize the plan's provisions, but
use its legal phraseology. The result is that it is difficult :for employees
to understand readily the nature o:fthe plan and their rights and duties
under it.
Some issuers, recognizing the need for a clear presentation, include
in the prospectus, or transmit with the prospectus in booklet form, a
description of the plan in plain language. Sometimes these descriptions are in question-and-answer form. The Commission commended
this practice and suggested that it might well be extended to the prospectus proper. For example, a booklet containing a description of the
plan in simple, nontechnical terms may be substituted for that portion
of the prospectus dealing with the plan, or the booklet may be
expanded and serve as the full prospectus.
Staff Examination of Registration Statements

Registration statements are examined by the Commission's staff for
compliance with the standards of adequate and accurate disclosure.
This examination is primarily the responsibility of the Division of
Corporation Finance. Statements filed by investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 are examined by
the Division of Corporate Regulation. If it appears that a statement
does not conform in material respects with the applicable requirements, the issuing company is usually notified by a letter of comment
and is afforded an opportunity to file correcting or clarifying amendments. The Commission also has the power, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to issue a "stop-order" suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement if it finds that material representations are misleading, inaccurate or incomplete. In certain instances,
such as where the deficiencies in a registration statement appear to
stem from careless disregard of applicable requirements or from a
deliberate attempt to conceal or mislead, a letter of comment is not
sent and the Commission either conducts an investigation to determine
• Securities Act Release No. 4844 (August 5,1966).

THIRTY-THIRD

REPORT

25

whether "stop-order" proceedings should be instituted or immediately
institutes such proceedings. A discussion of the exercise of the "stoporder" power during fiscal year 1967 begins on page 30.
Time Required To Complete Registration

The Commission's staff endeavors to complete its examination of
registration statements in as short a time as possible. The Act provides
that a registration statement shall become effective on the 20th day
after it is filed (or on the 20th day after the filing of any amendment
thereto) . Since most registration statements require one or more amendments, they usually do not become effective until some time after the
original 20-day period. The period between filing and effective date is
intended to afford investors an opportunity to become familiar with
the proposed offering through the dissemination of the preliminary
form of prospectus. The Commission can accelerate the effective date
so as to shorten the 20-day waiting period, taking into account the
adequacy of the information respecting the issuer theretofore available to the public, the facility with which the facts about the offering
can be understood, the public interest and the protection of investors.
The note to Rule 460 under the Act lists some of the more common
situations in which the Commission considers that the statute generally
requires it to deny acceleration.
The median number of calendar days which elapsed from the date
of the original filing to the effective date with respect to the 1,460
registration statements that became effective during the 1967 fiscal
year 3 was 36, compared with 38 days for 1,280 registration statements
in :fiscal year 1966 and 36 days for 1,097 registration statements in
fiscal year 1965. The number of registration statements :filed during
fiscal year 1967 was 1,637, as compared with 1,450 and 1,209, respectively, in the two preceding years,'
The following table shows by months during the 1967 fiscal year
the number of registration statements which became effective, and the
number of calendar days elapsed during the registration process for
the median registration statement.
Statistics Regarding Registration Statements Filed

During the 1967 :fiscal year, 1,836 registration statements were filed
for offerings of securities aggregating $36.2 billion, as compared with
1,697 registration statements :filed during the 1966 fiscal year for offera This figure excludes 192 amendments filed by investment companies pursuant to Section 24(e) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which provides
for the registration of additional securities through amendment to an effective
registration statement rather than the filing of a new registration statement.
• These figures exclude 199, 247 and 167 amendments filed by investment companies pursuant to Section 24(e) of the Investment Company Act for fiscal years
1967, 1966 and 1965, respectively.

Of the 1,836 registration statements filed in the 1967 fiscal year, 440,
or 24 percent, were filed by companies that had not previously 6led

Stop Ordcr Proceedings

Section 8(d) of the Securities Act of 1933 gives the Commission the
power, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to issue a stop order
"suspending" the effectiveness of a registration statement which
includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated t.herein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading. The effect of a stop order, which
may be issued even after the sale of securities has begun, is to bar
distribuGon of the securities so long as tho order remains in effect.
Although losses which may have been suffered by investors before
issuance of the order are not restored to them by a stop order, the
Commission's decision and the evidence on which i t is based may serve
to put them on notice of their rights and aid in their own recoveq
suits. As provided by the Act, a stop order is lifted when the registration statement has been amended to corrwt the deficiencies.
As of the beginning of the fiscal year, three stop order proceedings
were pending. During the year, three additional proceedings were
instituted, and three were terminated through the issuance of stop
orders. I n one case; no review of the hearing examiner's initial decision was sought by the registrant, or ordered by khe Commission, and
the initial decision accordingly bemme the h a 1 decision of the Commission. The other two stop orders which were issued during the year
were issued in a consolidated proceeding pursuant to offers of settlement by the t.wo investment companies involved, Delaware Fund, I m .
and Decatar Income Fund, Znc. The Commission's orders ' and subse-

Report. The stop orders as to these two registration statements were
later lifted upon the filing of amended registration statements. As of
the end of the fiscal year, three stop order proceedings were pending.
Examinations

and Investigations

The Commission is authorized by Section 8(e) of the Act to make
an examination in order to determine whether a stop order proceeding
should be instituted under Section 8 (d), and in connection therewith
is empowered to examine witnesses and require the production of
pertinent documents. The Commission is also authorized by Section
20(a) of the Act to make an investigation to determine whether any
provision of the Act or any rule or regulation prescribed thereunder
has been or is about to be violated. In appropriate cases, investigations
are instituted under this Section as an expeditious means of determining whether a registration statement is false or misleading or omits
to state any material fact. The following tabulation shows the number
of such examinations and investigations which were in progress during
the year:

ISSUES

The Commission is authorized under Section 3 (b) of the Securities
Act to exempt, by its rules and regulations and subject to such terms
and conditions as it may prescribe therein, any class of securities from
registration under the Act, if it finds that the enforcement of the
registration provisions of the Act with respect to such securities is not
necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors by
reason of the small amount involved or the limited character of the
public offering. The statute imposes a maximum limita:tion of $300,000
upon the size of the issues which may be exempted by the Commission
in the exercise of this power.
Acting under this authority, the Commission has adopted the following exemptive rules and regulations:

Under Section 3 (c) of the Securities Act, which was added by
Section 307(a) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, the
Commission is authorized to adopt rules and regulations exempting
securities issued by a small business investment company under the
Small Business Investment Act. Acting pursuant to this authority,
the Commission has adopted Regulation E, which is described below.
Exemption from registration under Section 3 (b) or 3 (c) of the Act
does not carry any exemption from the provisions of the Act prohibiting fraudulent conduct in the offer or sale of securities and imposing
civil liability or criminal responsibility for such conduct.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation A

Regulation A permits a company to obtain needed capital not in
excess of $300,000 (including underwriting commissions) in anyone
year from a public offering of its securities without registration, provided specified conditions are met. These include the filing of a notification supplying basic information about the company with the
Regional Office of the Commission in the region in which the company
has its principal place of business, and the filing and use in the offering
of an offering circular. However, an offering circular need not be filed
or used in connection with an offering not in excess of $50,000 by a
company with earnings in one of the last 2 years.
During the 1967 fiscal year, 383 notifications were filed under Regulation A, covering proposed offerings of $74,761,963, compared with 410
notifications covering proposed offerings of $75,218,434 in the 1966
fiscal year.

ANNUAL

REPORT

Reports of SaIes.-Regulation A provides that within 30 days after
the end of each 6-month period following the date of the original offering circular required by Rule 256, or the statement required by Rule
257, the issuer or other person for whose account the securities are
offered must file a report of sales containing specified information.
A final report must be filed upon completion or termination of the
offering.
During the fiscal year 1967, 820 reports of sales were £iled reporting
aggregate sales of $45,288,600.
Suspension of Exemption.-The
Commission may suspend an exemption under Regulation A where, in general, the exemption is sought
for securities for which the regulation provides no exemption or where
the offering is not made in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the regulation or with prescribed disclosure standards. Following
the issuance of a temporary suspension order by the Commission, the
respondents may request a hearing to determine whether the temporary suspension should be vacated or made permanent. If no hearing
is requested within 30 days after the entry of the temporary suspension
order and none is ordered by the Commission on its own motion, the
temporary suspension order becomes permanent.
During the 1967fiscal year, temporary suspension orders were issued
in 13 cases, which, added to the 2 cases pending at the beginning of
the fiscal year, resulted in a total of 15 cases for disposition. Of these,
the temporary suspension order was vacated in 1 case and became
permanent in 10 cases: in 7 by lapse of time, in 2 by withdrawal of
the request for hearing, and in 1 after hearing. Four cases were
pending at the end of the fiscal year.
The case in which the suspension was made permanent following
a hearing was Fibercraft Products Oorporation» Fibercraft had been
organized for the purpose of manufacturing and selling laminated
fiberglass products, primarily boats. In 1964, the company and two
selling stockholders, Thomas C. Bennett, President, and Jacqueline
W. Bennett, Treasurer, filed a notification with the Commission with
respect to a proposed public offering under Regulation A of an
unspecified number of shares of common stock at the market, with a
maximum aggregate offering price of $50,000.
The Commission found that Fibercraft and the selling stockholders
had distributed sales material in the form of a letter to stockholders
which was misleading in that it reported a very substantial increase
in both sales and net worth without disclosing that the figures included
the sales and net worth of another company being acquired by Fibercraft and without disclosing that 125,000 shares of Fibercraft stock
• Securities Act Release No. 4847 (September 16, 1966).

34

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

were to be issued in the undisclosed acquisition which would substantially reduce the proportionate interest of the stockholders.
The Commission also found that the statement filed pursuant to
Rule 257 failed to name Michael A. Light as one of the persons in control and therefore an affiliate of Fibercraft and to disclose required
information regarding Light and his holdings of, and transactions in,
the company's securities. Light was a major stockholder of the company, and while he was vice president and a director had been instrumental in helping it improve its financial condition and also supervised
the accounting procedures and the preparation of periodic reports and
helped supervise the plant. Although Light resigned as an officer and
director in August 1964, he continued to be active in the company's
affairs, attended directors' meetings, participated in merger negotiations, and suggested the filing under Regulation A.
The Commission also found that no exemption was available because
the aggregate offering price, when computed, as required by Rule 254,
to include the price at which Light sold about 40,000 shares of Fibercraft's stock in violation of the registration requirements of the Act
within 1 year prior to the commencement of the proposed offering,
exceeded the $50,000 limitation imposed on offerings under Rule 257.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation B

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1967, 353 offering sheets and
329 amendments thereto were filed pursuant to Regulation B and were
examined by the Oil and Gas Section of the Commission's Division of
Corporation Finance. During the 1966 and 1965 fiscal years, 235 and
173 offering sheets, respectively, were filed. The following table indicates the nature and number of Commission orders issued in connection with such filings during the fiscal years 1965-67. The balance of

Exempt Offerings Under Regulation E

Regulation E provides a conditional exemption from registration
under the Securities Act for securities of small business investment
companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940
which are licensed under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958
or which have received the preliminary approval of the Small Business Administration and have been notified by the Administration
that they may submit an application for such a license.
The regulation, which is substantially similar to the general exemption provided by Regulation A, requires the filing of a notification
with the Commission and, except in the case of offerings not in excess of
$50,000, the filing and use of an offering circular containing certain
specified information.
No notifications were filed under Regulation E during the 1967 fiscal
year.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation F

Regulation F provides an exemption for assessments levied upon
assessable stock and for delinquent assessment sales in amounts not
exceeding $300,000 in anyone year. It requires the filing of a simple
notification giving brief information with respect to the issuer, its
management, principal security holders, recent and proposed assessments and other security issues. The regulation requires a company
to send to its stockholders, or otherwise publish, a statement of the
purposes for which the proceeds of the assessment are proposed to be
used. Copies of any other sales literature used in connection with the
assessment must be filed. Like Regulation A, Regulation F provides
for the suspension of an exemption thereunder where the regulation
provides no exemption or where the offering is not made in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the regulation or in accordance with
prescribed disclosure standards.
During the 1967 fiscal year, 19 notifications were filed under Regulation F, covering assessments of $494,404. These notifications were
filed in three of the nine regional officesof the Commission: Denver,
San Francisco and Seattle. Underwriters were not employed in any

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of the Regulation F assessments. No Regulation F exemptions were
suspended during the fiscal year.
CONTINUING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS
Registration of Securities on Exchanges

Unless a security is registered on a national securities exchange
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or is exempt from registration, it is unlawful for a member of such exchange or any broker
or dealer to effect any transaction in the security on the exchange. In
general, the Act exempts from registration obligations issued or guaranteed by a state or the Federal Government or by certain subdivisions
or agencies thereof and authorizes the Commission to adopt rules and
regulations exempting such other securities as the Commission may
find necessary or appropriate to exempt in the public interest or for
the protection of investors. Under this authority the Commission has
exempted securities of certain banks, certain securities secured by
property or leasehold interests, certain warrants and, on a temporary
basis, certain securities issued in substitution for or in addition to
listed securities.
Pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, an issuer may register
a class of securities on an exchange by filing with the Commission and
the exchange an application which discloses pertinent information
concerning the issuer and its affairs. Information must be furnished
regarding the issuer's business, its capital structure, the terms of its
securities, the persons who manage or control its affairs, the remuneration paid to its officers and directors, and the allotment of options,
bonuses and profit-sharing plans. Financial statements certified by an
independent accountant must be filed as part of the application.
Form 10 is the form used for registration by most commercial and
industrial companies. There are specialized forms for certain types
of securities, such as voting trust certificates, certificates of deposit
and securities of foreign governments.
Statistics regarding securities traded on exchanges may be found
in Part IV of this report, as well as in certain of the appendix tables.
Registration of Over.the-Connter Securities

As previously noted, Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act requires the
registration of securities traded over the counter, when certain standards as to assets of the issuer and number of shareholders are met. The
same forms used for the registration of securities on an exchange are
used for the registration of over-the-counter securities. Part II of
this report includes statistics regarding the number of registration
statements filed during the fiscal year pursuant to Section 12(g) and
related information.

37

TLnRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT

Periodic Reports

Section 13 of the Exchange Act requires issuers of securities regisbred pursuant to Section 12 to file periodic reports keeping current
the information contained in the application for registration or registration statemant. These periodic reports include annual, semi-annual,
and current reports. The principal annual report form is Form 10-K,
which is designed to give current information regarding the matters
covered in the original filing. Semi-annual reports required to be filed
on Form 9-K are devoted chiefly to furnishing mid-year hancial
data. Current reports on Form 8-K are required to be fled for each
month in which any of certain specified events of immediate interest to
investors have occurred. A report on this form deals with matters such
as changes in control of the registrant, important acquisitions or dispositions of wets, the institution or termination of important legal
and important changes in the issuer's securities. Section
15(d) of the Exchange Act, generally speaking, requires issuers which
have registered securities under the Securities Act of 1933 and which
have no securities registered under Section 12 to f l e the reports described above.

Swpe and Nature of Proxy Regulation.-Regulation 14A under
the Exchange Act, implementing Section l4(a) of that Act, T e r n s
the manner in which proxies or other authorizations may be sohcited
from the holders of securities registered under Section 12 of that Act,
whether for the election of directors, approval of other corporate

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

action, or some other purpose,"? It requires that in any such solicitation,
whether by the management or minority groups, disclosure must be
made of all material facts concerning the matters on which such holders
are asked to vote, and they must be afforded an opportunity to vote
"yes" or "no" on each matter. The regulation also provides, among
other things, that where the management is soliciting proxies, any
security holder desiring to communicate with other security holders
for a proper purpose may require the management to furnish him with
a list of all security holders or to mail his communication to security
holders for him. A security holder may also, subject to certain limitations, require the management to include in its proxy material any
appropriate proposal which he wants to submit to a vote of security
holders. Any security holder or group of security holders may at any
time make an independent proxy solicitation upon compliance with
the proxy rules, whether or not the management is making a solicitation. Certain additional provisions of the regulation apply where a
contest for control of the management of an issuer or representation
on the board is involved.
Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed with the Commission in preliminary form prior to the date of the proposed solicitation.
'Where preliminary material fails to meet the prescribed disclosure
standards, the management or other group responsible for its preparation is notified informally and given an opportunity to correct the deficiencies in the preparation of the definitive proxy material to be
furnished to security holders.
Under Section 14(c) of the Act, issuers of securities registered under
Section 12 must, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by
the Commission, transmit information comparable to proxy material to
security holders from whom proxies are not solicited with respect to a
stockholders' meeting. Regulation 14C implements this provision by
setting forth the requirements for "information statements."
Proposed Amendments to Proxy Rules and Information Rules.-

During the fiscal year, the Commission invited public comments on
proposed amendments to its proxy rules under Section 14(a) and its
information statement rules under Section 14(c).ll At the request of
certain persons who desired further time to study the proposed amendments and submit comments thereon, the Commission extended the
period within "which comments could be submitted and most of the
proposed amendments were still pending at the close of the fiscal year.
The Commission did, however, adopt amendments to Rules 14a-3,
14a-6, 14c-3 and 14c-5P
ro This regulation also applies to security holders of registered public-utility
holding companies, their SUbsidiaries, and registered investment companies.

ANNUAL REPORT

Paragraph (b) of Rule 14a-3 formerly provided that if a solicitation is made on behalf of management and relates to an annual meeting
at which directors are to be elected, the proxy statement must be accompanied or preceded by an annual report to security holders containing certified financial statements for the last fiscal year. This paragraph was amended to require an issuer, other than an investment company, to include in such annual report financial statements for the last 2
fiscal years, although only the last year's statement must be certified.
Provision was made, however, for the omission of statements for the
earlier of the 2 years upon a showing of good cause. Because there are
special problems with respect to investment companies and because
most of their reports had already been published by the effective date
of the amendment, it was determined not to make the change applicable
to the reports of such companies at this time.
Paragraph (b) of the rule was further amended by the addition of
a note stating that it is unnecessary to send a copy of the annual report
to each of several security holders of record having the same address
if such security holders consent to the sending of a lesser number of
copies. However, where a security holder of record has an obligation
to obtain or send the annual report to other persons, such as the beneficial owners of the securities held in his name, the new provision does
not relieve him of such obligation.
An amendment to paragraph (0) of Rule 14a-3 increased from four
to seven the number of copies of each annual report sent to security
holders which must be furnished to the Commission for its information. This will enable the Commission to send copies to certain of its
regional offices, including the regional office :for the region in which
the issuer has its principal office.
In order to maintain consistency between the proxy rules and the
rules relating to information statements, Rule 14c-3 was amended to
conform to the amended Rule 14a-3.
Rules 14a-6 and 14c-5 were amended to require the filing with the
Commission of five copies of all preliminary material, rather than
three copies as previously required. The additional copies are needed
to expedite examination of the material and for recording in connection
with the Commission's data processing program.
Statistics Relating to Proxy and Information

Statements.-Dur-

ing the 1967 fiscal year, 4,633 proxy statements in definitive form were
filed, 4,611 by management and 22 by nonmanagement groups or
individual stockholders. In addition, 92 information statements were
filed. The proxy and information statements related to a total of 4,370
companies, some 355 of which had a second solicitation during the
year, generally for a special meeting not involving the election of
directors.

Proxy Contests.-During
the 1967 fiscal year, 37 companies had
proxy contests involving the election of directors. In 18 contests control of the board was at stake while the other 19 involved representation on the board. Pursuant to the requirements of Rule 14a-ll, 556
persons, both management and non management, filed detailed statements as participants.
Management retained control in 12 of the 18 contests for control of
the board of directors, 1 was settled by negotiation, nonmanagement
persons won 4 and 1 was pending as of June 30, 1967. Of the 19 cases
where representation on the board of directors was involved, management retained all places on the board in 9 contests, opposition candidates won places on the board in 5 cases, 2 were settled by negotiation,
and 3 were pending as of the end of the fiscal year.
Insiders' Security Holdings and Transactions

Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act and corresponding provisions in Section 17 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935 and Section 30(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 are
designed to provide other stockholders and investors generally with
information as to insiders' securities transactions and holdings, and to
prevent the unfair use of confidential information by insiders to profit
from short-term trading in a company's securities.
Ownership Reports.-Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires
every person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, more than
10 percent of any class of equity security which is registered under Section 12(b) for exchange listing or under Section 12(g) for over-thecounter trading, or who is a director or an officer of the issuer of any
such security, to file statements with the Commission disclosing the
amount of all equity securities of the issuer of which he is the beneficial owner and changes in such ownership. Copies of such statements
must also be filed with exchanges on which securities are listed. Similar provisions applicable to insiders of registered public-utility holding companies and registered closed-end investment companies are
contained in Section 17(a) of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act and Section 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act.
During the fiscal year, 85,283 ownership reports (13,494 initial
statements of ownership on Form 3 and 71,789 statements of changes
in ownership on Form 4) were filed with the Commission. This is a
decrease of 10,949 reports from the record high of 96,232 reports filed
during the 1966 fiscal year which included a large number of initial
statements by insiders of issuers of over-the-counter securities registered under Section 12(g).

42

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMM:ISSION

All ownership reports are made available for public inspection as
soon as they are filed at the Commission's officein 1Vashington and at
the exchanges where copies are filed. In addition, the information contained in reports filed with the Commission is summarized and published in the monthly "Official Summary of Security Transactions and
Holdings," which is distributed by the Government Printing Officeon
a subscription basis to more than 25,000 persons.
Recovery of Short-Swing Trading Profits.-In
order to prevent
insiders from making unfair use of information which they may have
obtained by reason of their relationship with a company, Section 16(b)
of the Exchange Act, Section 17(b) of the Holding Company Act, and
Section 30(f) of the Investment Company Act provide for the recovery by or on behalf of the issuer of any profit realized by insiders
(in the categories listed above) from certain purchases and sales, or
sales and purchases, of securities of the company within any period
of less than 6 months. The Commission at times participates as amicus
curiae in actions to recover such profits when it deems it important to
present its views regarding the interpretation of the statutory provisions or of the exemptive rules adopted by the Commission thereunder. Two such cases are discussed in Part V of this report.
Investigations

With Respect to Reporting

and Proxy Provisions

Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to
make such investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether
any person has violated or is about to violate any provision of the Act
or any rule or regulation thereunder. The Commission is authorized,
for this purpose, to administer oaths, subpoena witnesses, compel their
attendance, take evidence and require the production of records. The
following investigations were undertaken pursuant to Section 21(a)
in connection with the enforcement of the reporting provisions of
Sections 12, 13, 14 and 15(d) of the Act and the rules thereunder, particularly those provisions relating to the filing of annual and other
periodic reports and proxy material:

ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING MAITERS

The several Acts administered by the Commission reflect a recognition by Congress that dependable financial statements of a company
are indispensable to an informed investment decision regarding its

THIRTY-TEITRD~AL

REPORT

43

securities. The value of such statements is directly dependent on the
soundness of the judgment exercised in applying accounting principles
and practices in their preparation, and on the adequacy and reliability
of the work done by public accountants who certify the statements.
A major objective of the Commission has been to improve accounting
and auditing standards and to assist in the establishment and maintenance of high standards of professional conduct by certifying
accountants. The primary responsibility for this program rests with
the Chief Accountant of the Commission.
Pursuant to the Commission's broad rulemaking power regarding
the preparation and presentation of financial information, it has
adopted a basic accounting regulation (Regulation S-X) which,
together with opinions on accounting principles published as "Accounting Series Releases," governs the form and content of financial
statements filed under the statutes administered by the Commission.
The Commission has also formulated rules with respect to accounting
for and auditing of brokers and dealers, and has prescribed uniform
systems of accounts for companies subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The accounting rules and the opinions of
the Commission and its decisions in particular cases have contributed
to clarification and wider acceptance of the accounting principles and
practices and auditing standards developed by the profession and
generally followed in the preparation of financial statements.
In the large area of financial reporting not covered by its rules, the
Commission's principal means of protecting investors from inadequate
or improper financial reporting is by requiring a certificate of an
independent public accountant, based on an audit performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, which expresses
an opinion as to whether the financial statements are presented fairly
in conformity with accounting principles and practices which are
recognized as sound and which have attained general acceptance. The
requirement of the opinion of an independent accountant is designed
to secure for the benefit of public investors the detached objectivity
of a knowledgeable person not connected with the management.
In order to keep abreast of changes and new developments in financial and economic conditions and in recognition of the need for a
continuous exchange of views and information between the Commission's staff and outside accountants regarding appropriate accounting
and auditing policies, procedures and practices for the protection of
investors, the staff maintains continuing contact with individual
accountants, other government agencies, and various professional organizations. These include the American Accounting Association, the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the American

44

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Petroleum Institute, the Financial Analysts Federation, the Financial
Executives Institute, and the National Association of Railroad and
Utilities Commissioners.
Opinions of Accounting Principles Board

The Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants performs a vital function in the improvement of accounting standards and practices. The work of the Board
is reflected in accounting research studies and opinions for the guidance of the profession. Drafts of these studies and opinions are
referred to the Commission's accounting staff for review and comment
prior to publication. During the fiscal year significant opinions were
issued by the Board which pertained to accounting for the cost of
pension plans and to reporting the results of operations. The Board's
opinion on accounting for pension costs provides that pension costs
within specified minimum and maximum limits shall be accrued on a
consistent basis from year to year. Previously, alternative practices
were permitted that resulted in substantial differences in accounting
among companies and variations within a company in accounting for
costs between years.
The opinion on reporting the results of operations provides improved
standards in two major problem areas. One part of the opinion specifies that net income shall reflect all items of profit and loss recognized
during a period except for prior period adjustments, and that extraordinary items of income and expense shall be segregated from the
results of ordinary operations and be shown separately in the income
statement. These provisions accord closely with SEC requirements as
published in Regulation S-X.
In the second part of the opinion, additional guidelines were promulgated for the computation and reporting of earnings per share of
common stock, which have resolved a number of difficult problems in
this area. One aspect of the opinion which relates to the determination
of the effect of convertible securities on earnings per share is particularly timely, since convertibles have become increasingly popular in
recent years.
An omnibus opinion was also issued which provides guidelines for
the profession in a number of areas of lesser significance. The Board
has indicated that it expects to issue several additional opinions by
early 1968.
Reporting by Foreign Issuers

In connection with the adoption by the Commission during the fiscal
year of rules applicable to foreign issuers and the revision of related
reporting forms, as described at pages 13-15 above, the accounting

THIRTY -THIRD

ANNUAL REPORT

45

requirements applicable to financial data to be provided under such
rules were also revised. Under the revised requirements, foreign issuers that are registered or are required to register and file periodic
reports under the Securities Exchange Act must file the financial statements, schedules and accountants' certificates which would be required
of domestic issuers. Any material variation in accounting principles
or practices from the form and content of financial statements prescribed in Regulation S-X must be disclosed and, if practicable, the
effect of each such variation must be given. As noted previously, foreign issuers which have not sought a public market for their securities
in the United States through a public offering or a stock exhange
listing and who have more than 300 American security holders, may
obtain exemption from the registration and reporting requirements if
they file with the Commission certain specified information which they
publish abroad. Foreign issuers which have fewer than 300 American
security holders are exempt from the requirements.
Reporting by Diversified Companies

The increasing number of business acquisitions and mergers in
recent years, particularly the diversified type, has caused the Commission to explore the need for more detailed reporting on the disparate
operations of registrants who are broadly diversified. During the year
the staff has been considering the problems involved in any extension
of requirements in this area of financial reporting, particularly with
respect to the feasibility of eliciting by rule, from all companies affected, additional information meaningful to investors.
In this connection the staff has consulted with business and professional groups. The Commission has authorized the Chief Accountant
to serve on an advisory board, representing various sectors of the
accounting, financial and industrial communities, in connection with
a comprehensive study and survey of all aspects of the problem being
conducted under the sponsorship of the Financial Executives Institute.
The staff is also considering many comments made by individuals,
corporations and organizations and the growing volume of current
literature being published on the subject.
Staff surveys have indicated that there has been an increase in voluntary disclosures by diversified companies in recent annual reports to
stockholders. More companies have provided breakdowns of sales by
divisions or product lines, and there has been some increase in the
reporting of profits on comparable bases. This trend will be taken into
account in the development of practical reporting standards.
Other Current Developments

The Chief Accountant and his staff cooperated with the Commission's Division of Corporate Regulation in the preparation of a

46

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

proposal to revise its Uniform System of Accounts for Mutual Service
Companies and Subsidiary Service Companies. The purpose of the
proposal was to eliminate a requirement that service companies retain
their records permanently, unless otherwise authorized by the Commission, and to substitute appropriate procedures for the orderly
destruction of records, the retention of which is no longer necessary in
the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.
The revision was adopted by the Commission on August 12, 1966.13
During the year the Chief Accountant's staff cooperated with the
Division of Trading and Markets in the preparation of a release 14
interpreting Rule 15c3-1, the "net capital" rule, under the Securities
Exchange Act. The release is more fully described at page 71 of this
report.
A revision of Form X-17A-5, the form for the annual report of
financial condition required to be filed by brokers and dealers pursuant
to Section 17 of the Securities Exchange Act, was prepared by the
Di vision of Trading and Markets and the Chief Accountant's Office,
after consideration of comments recei ved on a proposed revision 15 of
the form. The revision was adopted by the Commission on October 3,
1967.16
Resignation of Accountant From Practice Before Commission

On the basis of information furnished to the Commission in a
nonpublie investigative proceeding conducted during the fiscal year,
the Commission had reason to believe that a certified public accountant
may have failed to adhere in a number of respects to generally accepted
auditing standards and the Commission's minimum audit requirements,
in connection with the preparation and submission to the Commission
of certain financial statements in accordance with the requirements of
Rule 17a-5 under the Securities Exchange Act for reports by brokers
and dealers.
The accountant, without admitting or denying any such lack of
adherence, tendered his resignation in which he agreed not to appear
or practice before the Commission in the future. The Commission
determined that in view of the resignation no further proceedings
were necessary and entered an order accepting the resignation."

CIVIL LITIGATION INVOLVING DISCLOSURE MATTERS

Summarized below are some of the more significant civil court cases
relating to disclosure matters in which the Commission participated
either as a party or as amicus curiae during the fiscal year. Civil
proceedings related to other phases of the Commission's work are discussed in Parts V-VIII of this report.
S.E.O. v, North American Beaver Associatiorc" involves the construction of the term "investment contract," which is included in the
definitions of "security" in both the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act. The court, in granting the Commission's motion for a preliminary
injunction, held that the combined activities of the seven corporate and
three individual defendants in selling live beaver and contracts for
their care, management, replacement and breeding to members of the
public constituted an investment contract.
One of the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals for the
Tenth Circuit," contending that the activities of each of the defendants should be measured separately because none owns stock of the
other. The Commission contends that the absence of stock holdings
among the defendants is unimportant, since they all acted together
and would have to act together in order to continue their business.
Previously the defendants had carried out all aspects of their business
through one business entity.
InS.E.O. v. Great American Industries, Inc.,20 the corporate defendant had purchased certain mining properties through issuance of its
securities. A substantial portion of the securities went to persons whose
only role in the transactions was claimed to have been as .finders. The
facts regarding the transfer of the shares to these .finders were not
disclosed in reports filed with the Commission and releases issued to the
press which described the purchase transactions. The district court held
that this information was not material, and that in order to obtain
injunctive relief the Commission was required to prove that the facts
were actually known to those preparing the reports and press releases.
The Commission appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit with respect to these and other points.
In Fischer v, Kletz,,21 the district court, agreeing with the Commission that "as a statutory 'independent public accountant' " a .firm of
accountants engaged to audit and certify financial statements to be
included in reports to be .filed with the Commission had assumed
responsibilities not only to its corporate client but to the stockholders

of the corporation and the public as well, held that the accounting firm
was under a duty to disclose material information allegedly received
by it after its certification which indicated that the financial statements
were inaccurate. The court further held that the accountants could be
liable for damages at common law for violation of that duty but did
not reach any decision on the position urged by the Commission that
such violation could also give rise to a private right of action under
Section10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.
In Barnes v, Osofsky,22 the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
held that a civil action to impose liability for untrue or misleading
statements or omissions in a registration statement under Section 11 of
the Securities Act may be maintained only by persons who purchase
securities that are the direct subject of the prospectus and registration
statement. The court adopted the view urged by the Commission,
amicus curiae, that as to open market purchasers liability extends only
to purchasers of the registered shares and not to purchasers of previously outstanding shares. The court observed that it is for this reason
that a private action under Section 10 (b) of the Exchange Act does
not simply duplicate the remedy already afforded by Section 11 of
the Securities Act.
CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING DISCLOSURE VIOLATIONS

During the year convictions were obtained or indictments returned
in several cases referred by the Commission to the Department of J ustice involving the filing of registration statements or periodic reports
which the Commission had considered were so seriously false or misleading as to warrant criminal prosecution.
Robert M. Swa:ffield and Stanley W. Stanick were convicted in
August 1966 of filing a false registration statement and of conspiracy
to violate the anti-fraud and false statement provisions of the Securities Act.23 Through the alteration and manipulation of the financial
records of a subsidiary of Shinn Industries, Inc., the defendants understated the net losses and overstated the assets of Shinn and caused such
figures to appear in a registration statement and in prospectuses circulated to the investing public in connection with the sale of $900,000
worth of common stock of Shinn. The defendants were each fined
$5,000, but their sentences were suspended and they were placed on
probation for 3 years.
In May 1967, Alfred Dallago, a former officer and director of Lancer
Industries, Inc., was convicted of conspiracy to violate the anti-fraud
and false statement provisions of the Securities Act and of violating
11373 F. 2d 269 (1967).

the false statement provision of the Exchange Act in connection with
the filing by Lancer of amendments to a registration statement and of
an annual report.'" Dallago caused fictitious sales and purchases to
be recorded on Lancer's books, creating the impression that sales
volume was increasing and that assets providing a basis for further
growth were being acquired, and caused figures reflecting these fictitious transactions to appear in financial information filed with the
Commission.
Louis Wolfson and Elkin Gerbert, along with three other persons,
were indicted for conspiring to violate, and violations of, the antifraud and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act.25 Among other
things, the defendants are charged with filing with the Commission
and the New York Stock Exchange a false and misleading balance
sheet as a part of the annual report filed by Merritt-Chapman & Scott
Corp. Wolfson and Gerbert are also charged with perjury, allegedly
committed when testifying in a Commission investigation of transactions in Merritt-Chapman stock. In a separate case, Wolfson and Gerbert were indicted for distributing a large block of stock of Continental Enterprises, Inc., a corporation which they allegedly controlled,
without complying with the registration requirements of Section 5
of the Securities Act.26 Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, they
were found guilty on all counts of the indictment in the latter case.
Wolfson was sentenced to 1 year in prison and a $100,000 fine, Gerbert
to 6 months and a $50,000 fine.
In another case, Gerald W. Eskow, former president of Yale Express System, Inc. and Fred H. Mackensen, Yale's former administrative vice president, were indicted in February 1967 for violations
of the Mail Fraud Statute in connection with the mailing of false Yale
financial statements for the purpose of inducing major lending institutions to purchase over $2 million of Yale's notes." Mackensen and
Norman Goldwasser, Yale's former director of accounting, are also
charged with causing Yale to file reports containing false information
regarding Yale's financial condition with the Commission, the New
York Stock Exchange and the Interstate Commerce Commission.
The case is awaiting trial.
Harold Roth, president and chairman of the Board of Continental
Vending Machine Corporation, and three certified public accountants
were indicted in October 1966 for conspiring to file a false annual report for Continental Vending with the Commission and the American
Stock Exchange." In July 1966, Roth and two other persons had been

In a criminal case involving an important application of principles
regarding the availability of the so-called private offering exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, the Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in U.S. v. Oueter Ohannel Wing 007'poration,SO affirmed the conviction of the defendant corporation and
Willard T. Custer, its president, for criminal contempt for selling unregistered securities in violation of an injunction obtained by the
Commission.
The court ruled that the question whether the claimed exemption
was available was controlled by the Supreme Court's decision in S.E.O.
v. Ralston Purina Oompany,Sl where it was held that the exemption is
available only where the persons to whom the securities are offered
have "access to the same kind of information that the Act would make
available in the form of a registration statement." Here that test was
not met, and the court held that the claimed "sophistication" of the
purchasers was not a substitute. The court further held that it is not
necessarily a basis for exemption that the issuer requires purchasers
to agree to hold the securities for investment and causes a legend restricting transfer to be imprinted on the stock certificates. Finally, the
court held that for a criminal contempt conviction it was not necessary
to prove specific intent to violate the injunction; it was enough to
show that the defendants intentionally committed the acts constituting
the violation with full knowledge of the relevant circumstances.
EXEMPTION FOR SECURITIES OF INTERNATIONAL BANKS
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 securities issued, or guaranteed as to
both principal and interest, by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Bank is required to file with the Commission such annual and other reports with respect to such securities as

character of the Bank and its operations, and necessary in the public
interest or for the protection of investors. Pursuant to this authority,
the Commission has adopted rules requiring the Bank to file quarterly
reports and also to file copies of each annual report of the Bank to
its board of governors. The Bank is also required to file reports with
the Commission in advance of any distribution in the United States
of its primary obligations. The Commission, acting in consultation
with the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and
Financial Problems, is authorized to suspend the exemption at any
time as to any or all securities issued or guaranteed by the Bank
during the period of such suspension. The following summary of the
Bank's activities reflects information submitted by the Bank to the
Commission.
The Bank reported a net income of $170 million for the fiscal year
ending June 30,1967. This compared with net earnings of $144 million
in the fiscal year 1966.
The Executive Directors have allocated $160 million from the year's
net income to the Supplemental Reserve against losses on loans and
guarantees, increasing it to $892 million. This raised the Bank's total
reserves, including the Special Reserve, to $1,183 million. The Executive Directors reported that they have decided to recommend to the
Board of Governors that $10 million, the balance of the year's net
income, be transferred to the Bank's affiliate, the International Development Association.
Gross income for the fiscal year 1967 was $331 million, compared
with $292 million in the preceding year. Expenses, which included
$131 million for interest on Bank borrowing, bond issuance and other
financial expenses, totaled $162 million, compared with $148 million
last year.
During the year, the Bank made 47 loans totaling $877 million, including a loan of $100 million to the Bank's affiliate, the International
Finance Corporation, compared with a total of $839 million last year.
The loans were made in Brazil (five loans), Cameroon, Chile, Republic
of China, Colombia (two loans), Congo (Brazzaville), Cyprus, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras (two loans), Iceland, India, Iran, Iraq,
Jamaica (two loans), Japan, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, Malaysia
(two loans), Nicaragua, Pakistan (two loans) , Peru, Philippines (two
loans), Senegal, Singapore (two loans), South Africa, Swaziland,
Thailand (two loans), Trinidad and Tobago (two loans), Tunisia,
Turkey, Venezuela, Yugoslavia and Zambia. This brought the total
number of loans to 508 (including IFC) in 82 countries and territories
and raised the gross total of commitments to $10,671 million. By June
30, as a result of cancellations, exchange adjustments, repayments and

52

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

sales of loans, the portion of loans signed still retained by the Bank
had been reduced to $7,122 million.
During the year the Bank sold or agreed to sell $69 million principal
amounts of loans, compared with sales of $82 million last year. On
June 30, the total of such sales was $2,035 million, of which all except
$69 million had been made without the Bank's guarantee.
On June 30, the outstanding funded debt of the Bank was $3,075.2
million, reflecting a net increase of $269.4 million in the past year.
During the year the funded debt was increased through the public sale
of Can$20 million (US$18.5 million) of Canadian dollar bonds, $425
million of U.S. dollar bonds of which $273.1 million were sold under
delayed delivery arrangements, and SwF60 million (US$14 million)
of Swiss franc bonds, the private placement of bonds and notes of
$232 million, DM:128 million (US$32 million) and SwF33.3 million
(US$7.7 million), and the issuance of $39.1 million of bonds under
delayed delivery arrangements. The debt was decreased through the
retirement of bonds and notes of $144 million, DM80 million (U8$20
million) and SwF33,333,333 (US$7.8 million), and by purchase and
sinking fund transactions amounting to $54.1 million.
During the year Singapore, Guyana and Indonesia became members
of the Bank, and the following eight countries increased their subscription to the Bank's capital: Syrian Arab Republic, Morocco,
Venezuela, Iraq, Canada, Nicaragua, Greece and Liberia. Thus on
June 30, 1967 there were 106 member countries and the subscribed
capital of the Bank amounted to $22,849.8 million.
Inter-American

Development Bank

The Inter-American Development Bank Act, which authorizes the
United States to participate in the Inter-American Development Bank,
provides an exemption for certain securities which may be issued or
guaranteed by the Bank similar to that provided for securities of the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Acting pursuant to this authority, the Commission adopted Regulation lA, which
requires the Bank to file with the Commission substantially the same
information, documents and reports as are required from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Bank is also
required to file a report with the Commission prior to the sale of any
of its primary obligations to the public in the United States. The following summary of the Bank's activities reflects information submitted by the Bank to the Commission.
During the year ended June 30, 1967, the Bank made 15 loans totaling
the equivalent of $158,740,000 from its ordinary capital resources,
bringing the gross total of loan commitments outstanding to 144,
aggregating $831,089,000. During the year, the Bank sold or agreed

to sell $5,158,500 in participations in the aforesaid loans, all of such
participations being without the guarantee of the Bank, The loans
from the Bank's ordinary capital resources were made in Argentina,
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico,
Nicaragua, Peru and Venezuela.
During the year the Bank also made 4'7 loans totaling the equivalent
of $295,905,000 from its Fund for Special Operations, bringing the
gross total of loan commitments outstanding to 144, aggregating
$'756,148,000.The Bank made no loans during the year from the Social
Progress Trust Fund, which it administers under an Agreement with
the United States, leaving the gross total of loan commitments out.
standing from that Fund at 11'7, aggregating $501,226,000.
On June 30, 196'7, the outstanding funded debt of the ordinary capital resources of the Bank was the equivalent of $442,894,000, reflecting
a net increase in the past year of the equivalent of $68,994,000. During
the year the funded debt was increased through a public bond issue in
Switzerland in the amount of SwF 50,000,000 (US $11,434,000), a public offering in the United States of $50,000,000 of bonds, the private
placement in Latin America of an issue of $30,000,000 of short-term
dollar bonds, and the drawing under a loan agreement with the ExportImport Bank of Japan of the equivalent of $2,560,000 in Japanese yen.
The funded debt was decreased through the retirement of $25 million
of short-term dollar bonds.
The subscribed ordinary capital of the Bank on June 30,1967, was
the equivalent of $1,'769,820,000 of which $1,388,240,000 represented
callable capital.
Asian Development Bank

The Asian Development Bank Act, approved March 16, 1966, authorizes United States participation in the Asian Development Bank
and provides an exemption for certain securities which may be issued
or guaranteed by the Bank similar to the exemptions accorded the
International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the
Inter-American Development Bank. The Agreement establishing this
organization became effective August 22, 1966, and the Bank formally
opened for business in Manila, the Philippines, on December 19, 1966.
By the end of the 1967 fiscal year, the Bank had received 20 percent
of its authorized paid-in capital of $550 million. Another $550 million
is callable. No bond issues had been placed, and no loans extended by
June 30, 1967. The Bank has received a $250,000 technical assistance
grant from the United States.
TRUST INDENTURE ACf OF 1939

This Act requires that bonds, debentures, notes, and similar debt
securities offered for public sale, except as specifically exempted, be

54

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

issued under an indenture which meets the requirements of the Act and
has been duly qualified mith the Commission.
The provisions of the Act are closely integrated with the requirements of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant to the Securities
Act of securities to he issued under a trust indenture subject to the
Trust Indenture Act is not permitted to become effective unless the
indenture conforms to the requirements of the latter Act designed to
safeguard the rights and interests of the purchasers. Moreover, specified information about the trustee and the indenture must be included
in the registration statement.
The Act was passed after studies by the Commission had revealed
the frequency with which trust indentures failed to provide minimum
protections for security holders and absolved so-called trustees from
minimum obligations in the discharge of their trusts. I t requires that
the indenture trustee be free of conflicting interests which might interfere with the faithful exercise of its duties in behalf of the purchasers
of the securities. I t requires also that the trustee be a corporation with
minimum combined capital and surplus; imposes high standards of
conduct and responsibility on the trustee; precludes preferential collection of certain claims owing to the trustee by the issuer in the event
of default; provides for the issuer's supplying evidence to the trustee
of compliance with indenture terms and conditions such a s those relatipg to the release of substitution of mortgaged property, issuance
of new securities or satisfaction of the indenture; and provides for
reports and notices by the trustee to security holders. Other projvisions
of the Act prohibit impairment of the security holders' right to sue
individually for principal and interest except under certain circumstances, and require the maintenance of a list of security holders which
may be used by them to communicate mith each other regarding their
rights as security holders.

REGULATION

MARKETS

OF EXCHANGES

Registration and Exemption of Exchanges

As of June 30, 1967, 14 stock exchanges were registered under Section
6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as national securities
exchanges:
American Stock Exchange
Boston Stock Exchange
Chicago Board of Trade
Cincinnati Stock Exchange
Detroit Stock Exchange
Midwest Stock Exchange
National Stock Exchange
New York Stock Exchange

Pacific Coast Stock Exchange
Philadelphia-Baltimore- Washington
Stock Exchange
Pittsburgh Stock Exchange
Salt Lake Stock Exchange
San Francisco Mining Exchange 1
Spokane Stock Exchange

Pursuant to Section 5 of the Exchange Act, the Commission has exempted three exchanges from registration because of the limited volume of transactions effected on them:
Colorado Springs Stock Exchange
Honolulu Stock Exchange

Richmond Stock Exchange

Review of Exchange Rules and Procedures

Rule 17a-8 promulgated under Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act
provides that each national securities exchange must file with the
Commission a report of any proposed amendment to or other change
in its rules and practices not less than 3 weeks (or such shorter period
as the Commission may authorize) before taking any action to effectuate the change. These proposals are submitted for review and comment to the Commission's Division of Trading and Markets. The
Division also reviews, on a continuing basis, the existing rules, regulations, procedures, forms and practices of all national securities
exchanges in order to ascertain the effectiveness of the application and
enforcement by the exchanges of their own rules; to determine the
adequacy of the rules of the exchanges, and of related statutory provisions and rules administered by the Commission, in light of changing market conditions; and to anticipate and define problem areas
1 Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, an order of the Commission terminating the registration of the San Francisco Mining Exchange became eft'ective.

so that members of the Commission staff can meet with representatives
of the exchanges to work out salutary procedures within the framework of cooperative regulation.
NYSE Commission Rate Schedule-Kaplan

v, Lehman Bros.

In Kaplan v, Lehman Bros., et 01.,2 a shareholder suing on behalf
of certain mutual funds alleged that the New York Stock Exchange,
in establishing and enforcing its minimum commission rate schedule,
was guilty of a per se violation of the anti-trust laws. The district
court granted summary judgment for the defendants, holding that
the Exchange's action was within the authority conferred on it by
the Exchange Act and therefore was not illegal per se. The court
added that if the complaint were to be construed as an attack on the
reasonableness of the commission rate structure or level, such matters
were clearly within the jurisdiction of the Commission under the
Exchange Act and should therefore be brought to the Commission
for its initial adjudication.
The Commission participated as amicus curiae in the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, urging affirmance. That court
affirmed, holding that the fixing of minimum commission rates by
the Exchange was not a violation of the anti-trust laws, since such
action by the Exchange was contemplated by the Exchange Act and
is subject to Commission review and oversight under Section 19(b)
of that Act.
On November 13, 1967, a petition for a writ of certiorari was denied
by the Supreme Court.
Inspections

of Exchanges

Pursuant to the regulatory scheme of the Exchange Act the Commission actively oversees the discharge by the national securities
exchanges of their self-regulatory responsibilities . .As part of this
program, the Office of Regulation in the Division of Trading and
Markets conducts regular inspections of various phases of exchange
activity. During the past fiscal year, the Office of Regulation conducted two inspections of the New York Stock Exchange and one of
the American Stock Exchange, covering such areas as registered
trader surveillance and exchange regulation of the floor and off-floor
activities of their members. In addition, the Office carried out extensive general inspections of the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange and
Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington
Stock Exchange. The inspection
program provides a means of ensuring exchange compliance with
regulatory responsibilities and enables the Commission to recommend

improvements and refinements designed to increase the effectiveness
of self-regulation.
In cases where it appeared that revisions in internal policies were
desirable in order to improve an exchange's performance, the Commission staff communicated its views to the particular exchange and
discussed the matters with exchange personnel to arrive at appropriate
solutions.
STATISTICS RELATING TO SECURITIES TRADED ON EXCHANGES
Number of Issuers and Securities

As of June 30,1967,4,573 stock and bond issues, representing 2,748
issuers, were admitted to trading on securities exchanges in the United
States. Of these, 4,370 securities issues (3,008 stock issues and 1,362
bond issues), representing 2,606 issuers, were listed and registered on
national securities exchanges, the balance consisting primarily of securities admitted to unlisted trading privileges and securities listed on
exempted exchanges. The listed and registered issues included 1,686
stock issues and 1,250 bond issues, representing 1,478 issuers, listed and
registered on the N ew York Stock Exchange. Thus, with reference to
listed and registered securities, 56.7 percent of the issuers, 56.1 percent
of the stock issues and 91.8 percent of the bond issues were on the New
York Stock Exchange. Table 4 in the Appendix to this report contains
comprehensive statistics as to the number of securities issues admitted
to exchange trading and the number of issuers involved.
During the 1967 fiscal year, 158 issuers listed and registered securities on a national securities exchange for the first time, while the registration of all securities of 130 issuers was terminated. A total of 395
applications for registration of securities on exchanges was filed.
Markel Value of Securities Available for Trading

As of December 31, 1966, the market value of stocks and bonds admitted to trading on U.S. stock exchanges was approximately $644
billion. The tables below show various components of this figure.
With reference to the tables, .jt should be noted that issues traded
on either the New York or American Stock Exchange are not traded
on the other of those exchanges. Many of these issues are also traded
on the so-called regional exchanges. The figures below for "other exchanges," however, show only the number of issues traded solely on
the regional exchanges. The figures in the tables exclude issues suspended from trading and a few inactively traded issues for which
quotations were not available.

Block Distributions Reported by Exchanges

The usual method of distributing blocks of listed securities considered too large for the auction market on the floor of an exchange is
to resort to "secondary distributions" over the counter after the close
of exchange trading. Secondary distributions declined both in number
and value during the calendar year 1966. The 1966 secondary distributions aggregating $1,523,373,000 were slightly lower than the record
high of $1,603,107,000 reached in 1965. During the first 6 months of
1967, there were 73 secondary distributions with a total value of
$666,066,000.
Special Offering Plans were adopted by many of the exchanges in
1942, and Exchange Distribution Plans in 1953, in an effort to keep as
much trading as possible on their floors. Since 1962 there have been no
special offerings. Exchange distributions continued to decline from the
record of 72 in 1963 to 52 in 1966. However, the value of the 1966 exchange distributions was $118,349,000 compared to $107,498,000 in
1963.

ing on the exchanges in stocks with only unlisted trading privileges
increased to about 23,985,000 shares, or about 0.75 percent of the total
share volume on all exchanges, from about 23,775,000 shares, or about
0.92 percent of share volume, during calendar year 1965.
About 96 percent of the 1966 volume was on the American Stock
Exchange while three other exchanges, Spokane, Honolulu and Salt
Lake, accounted for the remaining 4 percent. The share volume in
these stocks on the American Stock Exchange represented 3.2 percent
of the total share volume on that exchange.
As of June 30, 1967, there were 1,824 unlisted trading privileges on
exchanges in stocks listed and registered on other exchanges. The volume of trading in these stocks for the calendar year 1966 was reported
at about 113,613,000 shares. About 13 percent of this volume was on
the American Stock Exchange in stocks listed on regional exchanges
and 87 percent was on regional exchanges in stocks listed on the New
York or American Stock Exchanges. While the 113,613,000 shares
amounted to only 3.6 percent of the total share volume on all exchanges, they constituted substantial portions of the share volume of
most regional exchanges, as reflected in the following approximate percentages: Boston 86 percent; Cincinnati 82 percent; PhiladelphiaBaltimore-Washington
79 percent; Detroit 74 percent; Pittsburgh
60 percent; Pacific Coast 32 percent; and Midwest 29 percent.'
Applications by exchanges for unlisted trading privileges in stocks
listed on other exchanges, filed pursuant to Rule 12f-1 under Section
12(f) (1) (B) of the Securities Exchange Act, were granted by the
Commission during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1967, as follows:

COMMISSION

During the .fiscal year ended June 30,1967, the Commission granted
applications by exchanges and issuers to delist 56 stock issues, representing '53issuers, and 5 bond issues. 'Since two stocks were each delisted
by two exchanges, the total of stock removals was 58 as follows:

The seven applications by issuers which were granted during the
year removed one security each from the Boston, Detroit, National
and Pacific Coast Stock Exchanges, and three securities from the
Philadelphia- Baltimore-Washington
Stock Exchange.
Delisting applications by exchanges are generally based on one or
more of the following grounds: the number of shares of the issue in
public hands or the number of share holders is insufficient; the market
value of outstanding shares or trading volume on the exchange is too
low; the issuer has failed to meet the exchange's requirements as to
earnings or financial condition; the issuer has failed to file reports with
the exchange as required; or the issuer has ceased operations or is in 'the
process of liquidation.
During the fiscal year, the Commission in two instances granted
exchange delisting applications which were opposed by the issuers involved. In Fifth, Avenue Industries Oorporation.: the company's principal operating properties had been taken by New York City through
condemnation. The New York Stock Exchange, after withholding action for some time at Fifth Avenue's request because of the pendency
of litigation regarding the condemnation award, sought to delist the
company's stock. Ingranting the application, the Commission held that
in view of the drastic reduction of the scope of the company's operating activities and their minor significance compared to the condemnation claim, the Exchange's position that the company had ceased to be
an operating company was not unreasonable. In any event, the Commission noted, it was clear that in terms of the Exchange's delisting
rules the company's operating assets had been substantially reduced
and it had discontinued a substantial portion of its operations. The

REPORT

Commission further held that the Exchange's action was an appropriate exercise of its function of maintaining high standards with
respect to securities admitted to trading, and that there was no basis
for requiring the Exchange to await further developments including
additional steps in the condemnation procceedings and utilization of
the funds to be received.
Fotoohrome.Tnc:" involved a provision of the American Stock Exchange's deli sting policies that securities will be considered for delisting where the issuer has not operated at a net profit in any of its last
3 fiscal years. Fotochrome had sustained losses for its last 4 fiscal years.
It contended, however, that the Exchange had not in the past applied
this provision to companies in sound financial condition such as Fotochrome and that delisting should at least be deferred pending results
of the current year which it expected would show a profit. The Commission rejected these arguments. It held that even if prior delistings
involved issuers in a poorer financial condition, the Exchange, in advancing the objective of limiting the market afforded by it to securities
having suitable characteristics, should not be "straitjacketed by limited prior applications." The Commission further ruled that there was
no basis for requiring the Exchange to await the results of current
operations.
OVER-THE-COUNTER

TRADING

IN STOCKS LISTED

ON EXCHANGES

In order to correct a dearth of information concerning over-thecounter trading in common stocks traded on national securities exchanges (the so-called "third market"), the Commission, in December
1964, adopted Rule 17a-9 under the Exchange Act which, together
with related reporting forms, provides a system for the identification
of broker-dealers making over-the-counter markets in such stocks and
for the reporting of summaries of third market transactions. Originally, the specified reports were required to be filed with respect to
over-the-counter transactions in common stocks traded on all national
securities exchanges whose annual sales volume exceeded $20 million.
During the 1967 fiscal year the Commission amended Rule 17a-9 and
the reporting forms 7 so as to limit the reporting requirements to stocks
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, which account for about 98
percent of third market volume.
Under the reporting requirements, market makers must report their
over-the-counter and exchange trading in the stocks in which they
make a market, as well as certain over-the-counter trading in other
listed common stocks. Broker-dealers who are not market makers are

• Securities Exchange Act Release No. 8047 (March 22, 1967).

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

required to report certain large third market transactions. Coincident
with the amendment referred to above, Rule 17a-9 and the related
forms were further amended to provide for separate reporting of overthe-counter transactions in common stocks listed on the New York
Stock Exchange effected with Exchange members by "nonmember
market makers" pursuant to Rule 394(b) of the New York Stock
Exchange and amended Rule 19b-1 under the Securities Exchange
Act. These rules permit Exchange members to solicit qualified nonmember market makers t~ participate in the execution of orders for
listed securities off the floor of the Exchange under designated cond1tions.BThe various reports are designed to reflect all sales to persons
other than broker-dealers, i.a, to individuals and institutions.
During the calendar year 1966, total over-the-counter sales of common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange amounted to 58.2
million shares valued a t $2,873 million. This latter figure was the
equivalent of 2.9 percent of the value of shares of common and preferred stwks traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Although
third market volume was greater than in the previous year, it did not
keep pace with the increased volume on the Exchange.
I n lhe first half of 1967, third market volume was larger than in
the co+ponding period of 1966 both in aotual amounts and in relation to volume on the New YorkStock Exchange.

have been continued in the Commission's Office of Policy Research. The
statistical series described below are published in the Commission's
monthly Statistical Bulletin. In addition, current figures and analyses
of the data are published quarterly on new securities offerings, individuals' savings, stock trading of financial institutions, financial position of corporations, and plant and equipment expenditures.
Issues Registered Under the Securities Act of 1933

Monthly statistics are compiled on the number and volume of registered securities, classified by industry of issuer, type of security, and
use of proceeds. Summary statistics for the years 1935-67 are given
in Appendix Table 1 and detailed statistics for the fiscal year 1967
appear in Appendix Table 2.
New Securities Offerings

Monthly and quarterly data are compiled covering all new corporate and noncorporate issues offered for cash sale in the United States.
The series includes not only issues publicly offered but also issues privately placed, as well as other issues exempt from registration under
the Securities Act, such as intrastate offerings and offerings of railroad securities. The offerings series includes only securities actually
offered for cash sale, and only issues offered for the account of issuers.
Estimates of the net cash flow through securities transactions are
prepared quarterly and are derived by deducting from the amount of
estimated gross proceeds received by corporations through the sale of
securities the amount of estimated gross payments by corporations to
investors for securities retired. Data on gross issues, retirements and
net change in securities outstanding are presented for all corporations
and for the principal industry groups.
Individuals'

Savings

The Commission compiles quarterly estimates of the volume and
composition of individuals' savings in the United States. The series
represents net increases in individuals' financial assets less net increases in debt. The study shows the aggregate amount of savings and
the form in which they occurred, such as investment in securities, expansion of bank deposits, increases in insurance and pension reserves,
etc. A reconciliation of the Commission's estimates with the personal
saving estimates of the Department of Commerce, derived in connection with its national income series, is published annually by the Department of Commerce as well as in the Securities and Exchange
Commission Statistical Bulletin.
PriYale Pension

Funds

An annual survey is published of private pension plans other than
those administered by insurance companies, showing the flow of money
into these funds, the types of assets in which the funds are invested

and the principal items of income and expenditures. Quarterly

data

Stock Trading of Financial Institutions

A new statistical series containing data on stock trading of four
principal types of financial institutions was begun with the publication of a report in June 1966. Information on purchases and sales of
common stock by private noninsured pension funds and nonlife insurance companies has been collected on a quarterly basis by the Commission since 1964; these data are combined with similar statistics
prepared for mutual funds by the Investment Company Institute and
for life insurance companies by the Institute of Life Insurance. A
quarterly release is being published.
Financial Position of Corporations

The series on the working capital position of all U.S. corporations,
excluding banks, insurance companies and savings and loan associations, shows the principal components of current assets and liabilities,
and also contains an abbreviated analysis of the sources and uses of
corporate funds.
The Commission, jointly with the Federal Trade Commission, compiles a quarterly financial report of all U.S. manufacturing concerns.
This report gives complete balance sheet data and an abbreviated
income account, data being classified by industry and size of company.
Plant and Equipment Expenditures

The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce, conducts quarterly and annual surveys of actual and anticipated plant
and equipment expenditures of all U.S. business, exclusive of agriculture. After the close of each quarter, data are released on actual
capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated expenditures for
the next two quarters. In addition, a survey is made at the beginning
of each year of the plans for business expansion during that year.
Directory of Registered Companies

The Commission annually publishes a list of companies required
to file annual reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In
addition to an alphabetical listing, there is a listing of companies by
industry group classified according to The Standard Industrial Classification Manual.
Stock Market Data

The Commission regularly compiles statistics on the market value
and volume of sales on registered and exempted securities exchanges,
round-lot stock transactions on the New York and American Stock
Exchanges for account of members and non-members, odd-lot stock
transactions on the New York and American Stock Exchanges, odd-lot

Commission has been compiling statistics on volume of over-thecounter trading in common stocks listed on national securities exchanges (the so-called "third market") based on reports filed under
Rule 17a-9 of the Securities Exchange Act.
Data on round-lot and odd-lot trading on the New York and American Stock Exchanges are released weekly. The other stock market data
mentioned above, as well as these weekly series, are published regularly
in the Commission's Statistical Bulletin.

Registration.-Subject
to limited exemptions, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires all brokers and dealers who use the mails
or instrumentalities of interstate commerce in the conduct of an overthe-counter securities business to register with the Commission. Similarly, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which establishes a pattern of regulation comparable to that established by the Exchange
Act with respect to brokers and dealers, requires with certain exceptions the registration of investment advisers.
As of June 30, 1967, 4,175 broker-dealers and 1,732 investment
advisers were registered.

Capital Requirements with Respect to Broker-Dealers.c -Tiule
15c3-1 under the Exchange Act, commonly known as the net capital
rule, imposes minimum net capital requirements on brokers and dealers.
Inaddition, it limits the amount of indebtedness which may be incurred
by a broker-dealer in relation to its capital, by providing that the
"aggregate indebtedness" of a broker-dealer may not exceed 20 times
the amount of its "net capital" as computed under the rule.
During the fiscal year, the Commission issued a two-part staff interpretation of, and guide to computations under, the net capital rule,
to assist brokers and dealers in complying with the rule.' Part I explains the operation of the rule, including the exemptions therefrom,
and discusses questions concerning the application of the rule frequently presented to the Division of Trading and Markets for interpretation. Part II, prepared by the Office of Chief Accountant, consists
of an example of the computation of "net capital" made by a hypothetical broker-dealer, and includes a detailed trial balance work
sheet with explanatory notes.
The Commission also amended Rule 17a-3, its recordkeeping rule,
to require brokers and dealers to prepare a record of the computation
of "aggregate indebtedness" and "net capital" at least once a month."
These computations will help to keep broker-dealers currently informed of their capital positions. At the same time, the Commission
amended Rule 17a-4 to require preservation of these net capital computations and related working papers for a 3-year period.
Financial Reports of Broker-Dealers.-Rule
17a-5 under the
Exchange Act requires registered broker-dealers to file annual reports of financial condition with the Commission. These reports must
be certified by a certified public accountant or public accountant who
is in fact independent, with certain limited exemptions applicable to

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

situations where certification does not appear necessary for customer
protection. During the fiscal year 3,987 reports were filed with the
Commission.
These reports enable the Commission and the public to determine
the financial position of broker-dealers. They provide one means by
which the staff of the Commission can determine whether a brokerdealer is in compliance with the net capital rule. Failure to file required
reports may result in the institution of administrative proceedings to
determine whether the public interest requires remedial action against
the registrant.
Detection of Improper Practices

Public Complaints.-The
Commission has various sources of information concerning possible violations of the Federal securities laws.
A primary source is complaints by members of the general public
concerning the activities of certain persons in securities transactions.
During fiscal 1967 the Commission received some 4,000 complaints
from investors and others relating to broker-dealers and investment
advisers. The Commission's staff gives careful consideration to such
complaints and, if violations are indicated, an investigation may be
commenced. Other outside sources of information include the stock
exchanges, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
brokerage firms, State and Canadian securities authorities, better
business bureaus, and various law enforcement agencies.
Inspections.- The program of surprise inspections of broker-dealers
and investment advisers by the Commission's staff is another important
device for the detection of improper practices. During fiscal 1967,
1,019 broker-dealer inspections and 273 investment adviser inspections
were carried out. These inspections produced indications of various
types of infractions, as shown below:

."Hedge clauses" used in literature distributed by investment advisers generally state,
in substance, that the information furnished is obtained from sources believed to be reliable,
but that no assurance can be given as to its accuracy. A clause of this nature may be
improper where the recipient may be led to believe that he has waived any right of action
against the investment adviser.

Section of Securities Violations.-A
Section of Securities Violations is maintained by the Commission as a part of its enforcement
program to provide a further means of detecting and preventing fraud
in securities transactions. This Section maintains files which contain
information concerning persons who have been charged with, or found
in violation of, various Federal and State securities statutes, as well
as considerable information concerning Canadian violators. These
files play a valuable role in the Commission's enforcement program
and provide a clearinghouse for other enforcement agencies. The information in the files is kept current through the oooperation of
various governmental and nongovernmental agencies.
During the fiscal year, the Section received 3,869 "securities violations" letters either providing or requesting information and dispatched 1,'765 eommunications to cooperating agencies. Among other
matters, information was received from several States and Canada
respecting 104 criminal actions, 25 injunctive actions, 267 actions in
the nature of cease and desist orders and 1'70 other administrative
orders, such as denials, suspensions and revocations of registrations
of issuers, broker-dealers and salesmen. Information with respect to
5,636 persons or firms was added to the files, including information regarding 2,202 persons and firms not previously identified. As of the
end of the 1967 fiscal year, the files contained information concerning
'75,614 persons and firms.
Use of Computer for Name Searches.-The
use of the Commission's
computer for "name searches" in the enforcement program has resulted in a substantial increase in the amount of information available
and the speed with which it can be obtained. The names of suspected
securities law violators are checked against the more than 1 million
entries presently stored in the computer. Upon request, the Commission
also performs "name searches" on prospective securities salesmen and

74

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

others whose names are submitted by the exchanges, the NASD and
the State securities commissions. If the subject checked has been named
in formal filings with the Commission, has been a party to a proceeding, or has been involved in an investigation, such information, together with pertinent dates, relationships and cross references, is
available immediately on a printout. Formerly a time-consuming
manual search of indices and files was required.
Investigations

Each of the Acts administered by the Commission specifically authorizes it to conduct investigations to determine whether violations
of the Federal securities laws have occurred.
The nine regional officesof the Commission, with the assistance of
their respective branch offices,are chiefly responsible for the conduct
of investigations. In addition, the Office of Enforcement of the Division of Trading and Markets at the Commission's headquarters office conducts investigations dealing with matters of particular interest
or urgency, either independently or with the assistance of the regional
offices. The Office of Enforcement also exercises general supervision
over and coordinates the investigative activities of the regional offices
and recommends appropriate action to the Commission.
It is the Commission's general policy to conduct its investigations
on a confidential basis. Such a policy is necessary to effective law enforcement and to protect persons against whom unfounded or unconfirmed charges might be made. The Commission investigates many
complaints where no violation is ultimately found to have occurred.
To conduct such investigations publicly would ordinarily result in
hardship or embarrassment to many interested persons and might
affect the market for the securities involved, resulting in injury to
investors with no countervailing public benefits. Moreover, members
of the public would tend to be reluctant to furnish information concerning violations if they thought their personal affairs would be
made public. Another advantage of confidential investigations is that
persons suspected of violations are not made aware that their activities
are under surveillance, since such awareness might result in frustration or obstruction of the investigation. Accordingly, the Commission
does not generally divulge the results of a nonpublic investigation
unless it is made a matter of public record in proceedings brought
before the Commission or in the courts.
When it appears that a serious violation of the Federal securities
laws has occurred or is occurring, a full investigation is conducted.
Under certain circumstances is becomes necessary for the Commission
to issue a formal order of investigation which designates members of
its staff as officers to issue subpoenas, take testimony under oath and

TEaRTY-TEaRD ANNUAL

REPORT

75

require the production of documents. Usually this procedure is resorted
to only when the subjects of the investigation and others involved are
uncooperative and it becomes necessary to invoke the subpoena power
to complete the investigation. During the fiscal year ended June 30,
1967, the Commission issued 170 such formal orders.
The following table reflects in summarized form the investigative
activities of the Commission during fiscal 1967 :

Imposition of Sanctions

Where enforcement action appears appropriate, the Commission
may proceed in one of several ways, although the use of one procedure
may not necessarily preclude the use of another with respect to the same
conduct. The Commission may: (1) institute administrative proceedings, (2) institute civil proceedings in the appropriate U.S. district
court to enjoin further violations of law, or (3) refer the case to the
Department of Justice or appropriate local enforcement authorities for
criminal prosecution.
Administrative Proceedings.-Under
the Securities Exchange Act,
as amended in 1964, the Commission has available to it a wide range
of administrative sanctions which it may impose against brokers and
dealers and persons associated with them. The Commission may deny
a broker-dealer's application for registration. With respect to a brokerdealer already registered, it may impose sanctions ranging from censure through suspension of registration to revocation of registration.
It may also suspend or terminate a broker-dealer's membership in a
stock exchange or registered securities association. Associated persons
of broker-dealers may be censured, or suspended or barred from association with any broker-dealer. Under the Investment Advisers Act,
the Commission may impose comparable sanctions against investment
advisers, but has no authority to proceed against persons associated
with investment advisers.
The Commission may impose a sanction only if, after notice and
opportunity for hearing, it finds that (1) the respondents committed
willful violations of the securities acts or are subject to certain disqualifications, such as convictions or injunctions relating to specified
types of misconduct, and (2) a particular sanction is in the public

interest.

Formal administrative proceedings under the statutes administered
by the Commission generally culminate in the issuance of an opinion
and order. Where hearings are held, the hearing officer who presides
normally makes an initial decision following the hearings, unless such
decision is waived by the parties. Under an amended procedure which
went into effect in April 1966, the initial decision includes an appropriate order. If Commission review is not sought, and if the case is not
called up for review on the Commission's own initiative, the initial
decision becomes the final decision of the Commission.
In those instances where it prepares its own decision, upon review
or waiver of an initial decision, the Commission, or the individual
Commissioner to whom a case may be assigned for the preparation of
an opinion, is generally assisted by the Office of Opinions and Review.
This Office is directly responsible to the Commission and is completely
independent of the operating divisions of the Commission, consistent
with the principle of separation of functions embodied in the Administrative Procedure Act. Where the parties to a proceeding waive
their right to such separation, the operating division which participated in the proceeding may assist in the drafting of the Commission's
decision.
The Commission's opinions are publicly released and are distributed
to the press and to persons on the Commission's mailing list. In addition, they are printed and published periodically by the Government
Printing Office in bound volumes entitled "Securities and Exchange
Commission Decisions and Reports."

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

A few of the more significant decisions of the Commission in administrative proceedings with respect to broker-dealers and investment
advisers and involving what may be characterized as improper brokerage or investment adviser practices are summarized in the following
paragraphs: 5
The Commission addressed itself in three instances during the year
to the practice of "interpositioning," i.e., interposing, in the execution
of transactions, a second broker-dealer between the customer's brokerdealer and the best available market.
In Delaware Management Oompany, lne.,' the principal issue involved interpositioning in the execution of portfolio transactions for
mutual funds. Delaware Management Co., a registered broker-dealer,
was the investment adviser of and principal underwriter for two
mutual funds and its officers were the officers of the funds. It interposed a second broker-dealer, which did not maintain markets in listed
or unlisted securities, between the funds and the best market in order
to compensate the second firm for selling the funds' shares and to
stimulate further sales. It was established that the funds were in a
position to deal directly with the same broker-dealers used by the
interposed broker on as favorable a basis. As a result, the funds were
caused to incur unnecessary brokerage costs and charges. The Commission concluded that this practice constituted a fraud on the funds and
their shareholders by both broker-dealers and their principals.
The Commission found additional fraudulent conduct by the management company and its officers in that they caused one of the funds
to sell portfolio securities at a price below that offered by another
broker-dealer the same day, through a broker-dealer selected because
it supplied research services to the management company. The Commission further held that the funds' prospectuses were misleading in
stating that the funds would seek the most favorable prices and execution of orders.
The Commission's findings were based on a stipulated record and on
offers of settlement submitted by the respondents under which, solely
for the purpose of the proceedings, they consented to certain findings.
Pursuant to the offers, the Commission temporarily suspended the
broker-dealer registrations of the two firms, suspended their principals
from association with any broker or dealer and issued stop orders as
to the funds' registration statements. In determining to accept the
offers, the Commission gave consideration among other things to the
agreement of the management company to reimburse the funds for

their excess costs and losses, totaling over $300,000, and the fact that
the interpositioning had been discontinued some months before the
proceedings were instituted.
Two other decisions of the Commission which involved interpositioning were rendered on review of disciplinary action by the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) and are discussed in
the section dealing with NASD matters at pages 87-89.
As in the past, a number of Commission decisions issued during the
year dealt with campaigns by broker-dealers to sell highly speculative
securities by means of a concerted high pressure sales effort including
the use of false and misleading representations and predictions. Among
these cases were Seaboard Securities Corporation." A.lfred Miller,.
J. P. Howell & 00., I no:' and James De M ammos" In each instance, the
sales effort was characterized by predictions of specific and substantial
increases in the price of the securities within relatively short periods of
time. The Commission reiterated the principle that such predictions
are inherently fraudulent and cannot be justified. It revoked the registrations of the broker-dealers involved and barred various individuals
who, as principals or salesmen, participated in the fraudulent schemes,
from being associated with a broker or dealer.
In the Miller case, the Commission rejected the argument of two
individuals, one of whom had been president of the broker-dealer and
the other a salesman, that they were naive and were "dupes" of the
controlling person of the broker-dealer. It stated that "the protection
from fraud to which investors are entitled cannot be dissipated by
claims of naivete or gullibility on the part of those who hold themselves out as professionals with specialized knowledge and skill and
undertake to furnish guidance but nevertheless participate in a highpressure campaign to sell speculative securities." In the de M ammos
case, the Commission held that whether or not a broker-dealer operation could be characterized as a "boiler-room," the legal principles
applicable to "boiler-rooms" were applicable to any concerted fraudulent high-pressure sales campaign.
In a decision under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Marketlines, Inc.,D the Commission revoked the registration of an investment
adviser for publishing and distributing materially false and misleading advertisements of its market letters and for failing to make required disclosures in amendments to its registration application. The
respondent published newspaper advertisements soliciting subscripa Securities Exchange

tions to its market letter which stated that "interest in LOW PRICED
is opening profit possibilities that will undoubtedly pave the
way for many family fortunes in the years just ahead;" that the respondent had developed a "completely unique advisory service;" and
that certain items covered by the market letter were "backed by the
research and experience" of its "financial scientists and chartists." The
Commission held that the advertisements, "in presenting a highly optimistic picture of the profits that would accrue to subscribers . . .,
were materially misleading in failing to disclose the risks inherent in
the purchase and sale of securities and were obviously designed to whet
the speculative appetite of unsophisticated investors .... " Among
other things, the Commission also pointed out that the reference to
"financial scientists" was highly misleading in implying that techniques for evaluating securities could be reduced to an exact science.
Among court decisions affirming Commission orders in brokerdealer proceedings were the following:
In Irish v. 8£.0.,10 the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
affirmed an order of the Commission revoking the registration of Russell L. Irish and expelling him from membership in the NASD. The
court held that the record contained substantial evidence to support the
Comission's findings that "Mr. Irish advanced his own interests to
the detriment of his customers by making excessive trades in mutual
funds ('churning'), charging excessive commissions and making sales
to customers at prices just below the minimum break points." The
court held that certain delays in the proceeding were insufficient to
warrant reversal or remand of the proceeding to the Commission and
found that petitioner had "failed completely to show how the Commission caused him prejudice" by waiting from 1959, the time of the last
hearing, until 1965 to revoke his registration. The court stated that
instead of requesting that the proceedings be dismissed, petitioner
should have sought "a speedy decision" by the Commission on the
merits.
In R. A.. Holman. d!J 00., Inc. v. 8.E.0.,11 the Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit affirmed the Commission's order revoking petitioner's registration as a broker-dealer, expelling petitioner from membership in the NASD and making permanent an earlier Commission
order temporarily suspending a Regulation A exemption. The opinion
dealt principally with petitioner's claim that the proceedings before
the Commission had not been fair.

rector, did not by itself, without some additional evidence, disqualify
him from participating in an adjudicatory capacity in preliminary
stages of the proceedings against petitioner. The court distinguished
Amos Treat &: 00., v. 8.E.0.,12 noting that "in this case the SEC has
made extensive disclosures, upon sworn statements, as to the nature
of the investigation and as to Woodside's role in it" and, since petitioner had the burden of proof, it "was obliged either to offer evidence
contradicting the sworn statements of the Commission, or to point out
the inadequacy and inconsistency, if any, in the sworn statements, before [it] was entitled to subpoena the Commission members and staff."
The court refused to consider petitioner's contention that the hearing examiner was disqualified because he had passed mandatory retirement age, holding that the challenge was not timely made.
After proceedings had been instituted against petitioner involving
certain of the violations charged, there were ee parte communications
from the Commission staff to the Commission concerning consolidation
of these proceedings with pending Regulation A proceedings and
amendment of the order to include additional charges. The court held
that the Commission "was not required to divulge the communications
in question which merely concerned the nature of the proposed proceedings" and that these communications were not "the ex parte communications forbidden by Section 5 (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act .... "
In two cases concluded this year, M. G. Davis &: 00., I'M. v, Oohen 18
and Fontaine v. 8.E.0.,I4 the Commission has successfully defended
against attempts by registered broker-dealers to enjoin the continuation of administrative proceedings instituted against them. In both
cases it was held that the district court lacked jurisdiction of an action requesting injunctive relief against the Commission because plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and had not
shown facts sufficient to bring their cases within the narrow exceptions
to the exhaustion doctrine. In Davis, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the decision of the district court 15 granting the
Commission's motion to dismiss the complaint. While the district court
had considered and rejected plaintiffs' contentions on their merits, the
court of appeals held that even if plaintiffs had been correct in their
contentions that the Commission was acting in excess of its authority
they had failed to show an excess "so extreme as to warrant a district

court to upset the orderly course of review procedures." Alternatively,
the court held that "~v.en if appellants could surmount the jurisdictional hurdle, their action must fail, because they do not allege that
they would be irreparably injured if denied relief." It added that "the
usual factors of litigation expense and frustration due to delay .•.
are not such threatened injuries as will satisfy this requirement."
The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in denying a motion for
a stay pending appeal in Fontaine,16 similarly found it "unthinkable
that an administrative agency cannot even institute a proceeding until
it has had, in effect, the permission of the district court and of the court
of appeals whenever the parties to be investigated choose to deny its
jurisdiction," although it recognized that injury, expense and inconvenience might be involved. In that case the district court had applied
the doctrine of primary jurisdiction as well as the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies in denying plaintiff's motion for a
preliminary injunction against the conduct of an administrative proceeding and in granting the Commission's motion for summary judgment. The district court held that questions concerning the scope of the
Commission's jurisdiction, application of Commission rules and regulations, and plaintiff's rights as a broker-dealer registered under the
Securities Exchange Act "will not be ripe for judicial decision until
the SEC has had the opportunity contemplated by the Exchange Act
to pass upon them." It also held that plaintiff's arguments that the
Commission had exceeded its jurisdiction in instituting the proceeding,
and that if required to comply with certain demands made by the Commission the plaintiff might thereby 'be required to violate Swiss law,
"provide no basis for an exception to the exhaustion and primary jurisdiction doctrines."
In a similar case, not yet concluded, Thomson &: McKinnon v.
S.E.O.,17 the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed from the
bench the district court's denial of a motion by a registered brokerdealer for a preliminary injunction against an investigation into its
activities. Plaintiffs had argued that the Commission could not investigate certain of its activities which had come to the Commission's
attention in a related proceeding, previously concluded, to which plaintiffs had not been parties. Although plaintiffs had so contended before
the Commission by a motion to limit the investigation, the district
court held that it "lacks jurisdiction to enjoin, or partially enjoin, the
investigation" because plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative
remedies.

continuing or threatened violations, Such violations may involve a
wide range of illegal practices, including the purchase or sale of
securities by fraud, and the sale of securities without compliance with
the registration requirements of the Securities Act. During the 1967
fiscal year, permanent injunctions were obtained against 34 registered
broker-dealers, 3 of whom were also registered investment advisers."
Criminal Prosecution.- The statutes administered by the Commission provide that the Commission may transmit evidence of violations
of any provisions of these statutes to the Attorney General, who in
turn may institute criminal proceedings. Where an investigation by the
Commission's staff indicates that criminal prosecution is warranted, a
detailed report is prepared. After careful review by the General
Counsel's Office,the report and the General Counsel's recommendations
are considered by the Commission, and if the Commission believes
criminal proceedings are warranted the case is referred to the Attorney
General and to the appropriate U.S. Attorney. Commission employees
familiar with the case generally assist the U.S. Attorney in the presentation of the facts to the grand jury, the preparation of legal
memoranda for use in the trial, the conduct of the trial, and the
preparation of briefs on appeal.
During the past fiscal year 44 cases were referred to the Department
of Justice for prosecution. As a result of these and prior referrals, 53
indictments were returned against 213 defendants, including 24 brokerdealers and principals of broker-dealers and 17 broker-dealer employees. Convictions were obtained against 127 defendants in 42 cases,
including 25 broker-dealers and broker-dealer principals and 20
broker-dealer employees. Convictions were affirmed in 8 cases, and
appeals were still pending in 12 other criminal cases at the close of the
period. In addition, two individuals were convicted of criminal contempt during the fiscal year for violations of court orders previously
entered enjoining further violations of the securities laws.19
As in prior years, several criminal prosecutions during the past fiscal
year involved high pressure sales by broker-dealers of speculative,
unseasoned securities of over-the-counter issuers. For instance, six
principals of over-the-counter brokerage firms were convicted after
a 10-week trial of violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in the offer and sale of stock of Allied Entertainment
Corporation of America." Prior to trial, a market-letter writer for

firms had pleaded guilty. The jury failed to reach a verdict with
respect to Marvin Hayutin, the principal promoter of the scheme
to distribute a large block of unregistered, "insider" Allied. stock by
means of fraudulent representations and a manipulated market in the
quotation sheets for the over-the-counter market. However, Hayutin
was convicted in a 6-week retrial on charges of conspiring to violate the
anti-fraud and registration provisions of the Securities Act, and for
substantive violations of the registration provisions of that Act, and
was sentenced to 2lf2 years imprisonment and fined $14,000. This second
Allied case is now on appeal. A European banker, through whom the
stock transactions were channeled, remains a fugitive in the case.
In affirming the convictions of four of the defendants in the original
Allied case, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit made clear
that the failure of a broker-dealer to disclose secret cash commissions
received from an insider of the issuer in return for recommending
stock to public customers can constitute part of a scheme to defraud
under Section 17 of the Securities Act, even though the broker sells
the stock as principal rather than as agent.21
In a case involving a classic "boiler-room" promotion, Charters &
Co. of Miami, Inc., a Florida broker-dealer, three principals of the
firm, and a securities promoter were convicted of conspiracy to violate
the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act for their participation
with other defendants in selling stock of Bankers Intercontinental
Investment Co., Ltd. and Florida Patsand Corp. by means of a high
pressure telephone sales campaign. Certain other defendants, including Arnold Mahler, president of Broadwall Securities, a New
York broker-dealer, pleaded guilty to the charges against them."
In a related case,23 Mahler's conviction for conspiring to give and
giving false testimony in a Commission investigation regarding
Broadwall's "boiler-room" activities was affirmed. The court held
among other things that the statute relating to the giving of false
testimony covers oral as well as written statements, and that it was
not necessary for the jury to find that the false statements made to
the Commission were material.
Supervision of Activities of National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

serve as a medium for self-regulation by over-the-counter brokers
and dealers. Their rules must be designed to protect investors and the
public interest, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and
to meet other statutory requirements. They are to operate under the
general supervision of the Commission, which is authorized to review
disciplinary actions taken by them, to disapprove changes in their
rules, and to alter or supplement their rules relating to specified
matters. Review of NASD rules is carried out for similar purposes as
the review of exchange rules described at page 55.
In adopting legislation permitting the formation and registration
of national securities associations, Congress provided an incentive to
membership by permitting such associations to adopt rules which preclude a member from dealing with a nonmember broker or dealer
except on the same terms and conditions as the member affords the
general public. The NASD has adopted such rules. As a result, membership is necessary to profitable participation in underwritings since
members may properly grant price concessions, discounts and similar
allowances only to other members.
At the close of the fiscal year the NASD had 3,659 members,
reflecting a net decrease of 48 members during the year. This decrease was the net result of 218 admissions to and 266 terminations
of membership. At the end of the year NASD member firms had
5,283 branch offices,reflecting a net increase of 258 officesduring the
year. This increase was the net result of the opening of 861 new offices
and the closing of 603 offices.During the year the number of registered
representatives and principals, which categories include all partners,
officers, traders, salesmen and other persons employed by or affiliated
with member firms in capacities which involve their doing business
directly with the public, increased by 6,884 to stand at 90,525 as
of June 30, 1967. This increase was the net result of 15,895 initial
registrations, 11,734 re-registrations and 20,745 terminations of registrations during the year.
During this period the NASD administered 39,354 qualification
examinations of which approximately 22,000 were for NASD qualification and the balance for other agencies, including major exchanges,
the Commission 24 and various States.
NASD Disciplinary Actions.- The Commission receives from the
NASD copies of its decisions in all disciplinary actions against members and registered representatives. In general, such actions are based
on allegations that the respondents violated specified provisions of the
NASD's Rules of Fair Practice. Where violations are found the
NASD may impose one or more sanctions upon a member, including
.. See pp.15-16, 8upra.

expulsion, suspension, fine, or censure. If the violator is an individual,
his registration as a representative may be suspended or revoked, he
may be suspended or barred from being associated with any member,
and he may be fined and/or censured. Under Section 15A(b) (4) of the
Exchange Act and the NASD's by-laws, no broker-dealer may be
admitted to or continued in NASD membership without Commission approval if he has been suspended or expelled from membership
in the NASD or a national securities exchange; he is barred or suspended from association with a broker or dealer or with members
of the NASD or an exchange; his registration as a broker-dealer has
been denied, suspended, or revoked; he has been found to be a cause
of certain sanctions imposed upon a broker-dealer by the Commission,
the NASD or an exchange; or he has associated with him any person
subject to one of the above disqualifications.
During the past fiscal year the NASD reported to the Commission
its final disposition of disciplinary complaints against 143 member
firms and 123 individuals associated with them. With respect to 32
members and 33 associated persons, complaints were dismissed because
the alleged violations had not been established." In the remaining
cases, violations were found and penalties were imposed on 111 members and 90 registered representatives or other individuals. The maximum penalty of expulsion from membership was imposed against 13
members, and 7 members were suspended from membership for periods
ranging from 5 days to 3 months. In many of these cases, substantial
fines were also imposed. In another 80 cases, members were fined
amounts ranging from $50 to $3,000. In 11 cases, the only sanction
imposed was censure, although censure was usually a secondary penalty
1'1' here a more severe penalty was also imposed.
Various penalties were also imposed on associated individuals found
in violation of NASD rules. The registrations of 35 registered representatives were revoked, and 10 representatives had their registrations
suspended for periods ranging from 5 days to 3 months. Fines in
various amounts were also imposed against many revoked or suspended representatives. In addition, 43 other representatives were censured and/or fined amounts ranging from $100 to $4,000. Two individuals were barred from association with any NASD member .
.. The majority of the cases where allegations against members were dismissed
involved misuse of customers' and/or firm securities or funds by a representative
under such circumstances that the member could not have known of or prevented
the impropriety. The Securities Acts Amendments of 1964 authorized registered
securities associations to take disciplinary action directly against individuals
associated with members. The NASD has amended its rules to provide for such
nctlon. In the fiscal year there were 19 cases in which the sole respondents were
individuals associated with members.

Commission
Review of NASD Disciplinary
Action.-Section
15A(g) of the Exchange Act provides that disciplinary actions by the
NASD are subject to review by the Commission on its own motion
or on the timely application of any aggrieved person. This Section
also provides that upon application for or institution of review by the
Commission the effectiveness of any penalty imposed by the NASD is
automatically stayed pending Commission review, unless the Commission otherwise orders after notice and opportunity for hearing. Section 15A(h) of the Act defines the scope of the Commission's review.
If the Commission finds that the disciplined party committed the acts
found by the NASD and thereby violated the rules specified in the
determination, and that such conduct was inconsistent with just and
equitable principles of trade, the Commission must sustain the NASD's
action unless it finds that the penalties imposed are excessive or oppressive, in which case it must cancel or reduce them.
At the start of the fiscal year, 15 NASD disciplinary decisions were
pending before the Commission on review. During the year 4 additional cases were brought up for review. Twelve cases were disposed
of by the Commission. In 5 of these cases, the Commission sustained
in full the disciplinary action taken by the NASD. 26 It dismissed the
review proceedings in 1 case as having been abandoned," and permitted the withdrawal of 2 applications for review. With respect to
the 4 remaining cases, in 2 the Commission sustained the action against
some of the applicants, and reduced the penalty or set aside action
against others; 26 in 1 it set aside the association's action; 29 and in the
last case it reduced the penalty." Seven cases were pending as of the
end of the year.
Two of the decisions issued by the Commission during the year upon
review of NASD action dealt with "interpositioning." In the first of
these decisions, the Commission sustained the NASD's action expelling
H. O. Keister & Oompooy from membership in the association and
revoking the registration as a registered representative of H. C.
Keister, the member's principal partner." However, it reduced from
$1,000 to $500 a fine imposed on another partner who was not active
in the member's business .

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

According to the Commission's opinion, the member had been
engaged principally in effecting retail transactions in the over-thecounter market. It then hired a trader for the purpose of developing
an over-the-counter trading department which would serve as a vehicle
for reciprocity for listed business given by the firm to exchange members. The trader entered into an arrangement with the senior order
clerk of a large exchange firm under which over-the-counter orders of
customers of the exchange firm would be directed to the member's
trading department. Substantial payments were made to the order clerk
to influence and reward him. The member effected a large number of
transactions in a wide variety of securities with the exchange firm.
Principal transactions were offset with, and agency transactions
effected for, dealers who were market makers or traditional sources of
those securities.
The Commission rejected applicants' contention that the public was
not harmed because the member, as a wholesale dealer, assertedly
could obtain a better price from market makers than the exchange
firm. Itstated that it was unlikely that the member had access to a more
favorable market with respect to the many securities involved than
the exchange firm, a substantial retailer of considerable standing. The
Commission held that the interpositioning in fact operated to increase
the price paid by the exchange firm's customers for securities purchased by them and to reduce the amount they received for securities
sold as compared with the best prices obtainable. It concluded that the
member's conduct aided and abetted the exchange firm's wrongful
conduct and violated the NASD's rules, even aside from the payments
to the order clerk. The Commission also concluded that Keister must
have been aware of the interpositioning and should have known of the
payments being made to the order clerk and that he was responsible
for the violations.
In a companion disciplinary action, which was not appealed to the
Commission, the exchange member was fined $2,000 and the partner
in charge of its over-the-counter department was suspended for 30
days and fined $2,000. With reference to applicants' contention that
by comparison the penalties as to them were unduly harsh, the Commission noted that it did not have the benefit of arguments on behalf
of the exchange member and its partner. The Commission stated, however, that it would be of considerable assistance to it in reviewing cases
such as this to have a fuller exposition of the reasons entering into the
determination to apply different sanctions to respondents involved in
the activity under scrutiny. It further stated that differences in sanctions for persons with seemingly similar responsibility for violations
raise questions, in the absence of appropriate justification, respecting
the adequacy of existing statutory provisions for review of NASD

disciplinary decisions (which allow the Commission to reduce NASD
sanctions but not to increase them).
In a dissenting opinion, Commissioner Budge emphasized the unexplained disparity in treatment by the NASD of the two firms and their
partners. Even aside from this disparity, he was of the view that the
penalty against Keister was too severe in light of Keister's advanced
age and his long period of employment in the securities business.
Commissioner Wheat concurred in the views of Commissioner Budge
as to the severity of the sanction imposed on Keister.
In a second interpositioning case, the Commission sustained the
NASD's findings that T~O'JYlO,8
Brown Ill, while employed as a
trader for a member firm, interposed both his firm and another
broker-dealer between a customer of the member and the best available market." At a time when the member held a customer's open
limited price order with respect to an over-the-counter security, Brown
purchased shares of the same security from other dealers for the member's trading account at prices below the limit price. Brown then
caused these shares to be sold to another broker-dealer, a nonmarket
maker, at slightly higher prices and, pursuant to a buy-back arrangement, to be repurchased at the limit price for the customer's account.
The Commission found that the purpose of the arrangement was to
reciprocate for business in listed securities obtained from the other
broker-dealer.
While Brown conceded that his conduct violated the NASD's rules
of fair practice, he contended, among other things, that he should not
be penalized because his method of handling the trades was consistent
with what he believed to be the member's normal procedures. The
Commission held that the record did not support this contention, but
that in any event he should have been aware of his obligation to give
the benefit of the best price to the customer. However, in view of the
isolated nature of Brown's misconduct and his otherwise good record,
the Commission reduced the penalty from a 3-month suspension of
Brown's registration as a registered representative to a 30-day
suspension.
Commission Review of NASD Action on Membership.-As
previously noted, Section 15A(b) (4) of the Act and the by-laws of the
NASD provide that, except where the Commission finds it appropriate
in the public interest to approve or direct to the contrary, no broker
or dealer may be admitted to or continued in membership if he, or any
person associated with him, is under any of the several disabilities
specified in the statute or the NASD by-laws. A Commission order

membership, notwithstanding
a disqualification under Section
15A(b) (4) of the Act or under an effective association rule adopted
under that Section or Section 15A(b) (3), is generally entered only
after the matter has been submitted initially to the association by the
member or applicant for membership. The association in its discretion
may then file an application with the Commission on behalf of the
petitioner. If the association refuses to sponsor such an application
the broker or dealer may apply directly to the Commission for an order
directing the association to admit or continue him in membership. At
the beginning of the fiscal year, five applications for approval of
admission to or continuance in membership were pending. During the
year, eight additional applications were filed, six were approved,
one was withdrawn, one was discontinued, and one was denied, leaving
four applications pending at the year's end.
The Commission denied an application by the NASD for approval
of a member's continuance in membership with Michael Shaub in its
employ." Commission approval was required because in March 1966
Shaub had been named a cause of the revocation of the broker-dealer
registration of Crow, Brourman & Chatkin, Inc.S4 on the basis of
his participation, while employed as a salesman by the Crow firm in
1962-63, in a high-pressure fraudulent sales campaign with respect
to highly speculative securities.
The Commission noted that Shaub's proposed employment would
involve retail sales of speculative securities, the same type of activity
in which his previous violations occurred. It further noted that the
required positive showing that Shaub's conduct since the violations
had been on such a high level as to demonstrate that he had changed
his ways had not been made. In addition, the Commission stated that
it had not been shown that the supervisory procedures of the prospective employer would be adequate. The Commission also took into
account the short lapse of time since Shaub had been named a cause.
Commission Inspections of NASD.-Under the regulatory scheme
of the Exchange Act the Commission is also charged with general
oversight of national securities associations in the performance of
their self-regulatory activities. In carrying out this responsibility the
Commission staff conducts periodic inspections of various phases of
NASD activity. These inspections assist the Commission in insuring
that the NASD is complying with its self-regulatory responsibilities
and enable the Commission to recommend improvements designed to
increase the effectiveness of such self-regulation.
During the past .fiscal year, the Commission staff inspected the

tion on the district's activities in certain substantive regulatory areas,
including the enforcement of NASD standards of fair practice governing the reasonableness of prices charged to customers by member firms,
the execution of over-the-counter retail transactions, and the maintenance of procedures for the supervision of salesmen and other employees. Another inspection covered the work of the NASD Committee
on Underwriting Arrangements. That Committee has the responsibility
for reviewing public offerings of securities of unseasoned companies
and determining whether the arrangements for compensating the
underwriter might be unreasonable and therefore in violation of applicable rules and policies. Where it appeared to the staff of the Commission that modifications of NASD procedures or policies were desirable
in order to improve the association's performance, the staff's views
were communicated to the association and conferences were held with
a view toward arriving at appropriate solutions.
Supervision of Exchanges

Exchange Disciplinary Action.-Each national securities exchange
reports to the Commission disciplinary actions taken against its members, member firms, and their associated persons for violation of any
rule of the exchange or of the Securities Exchange Act or any rule
or regulation thereunder. During the fiscal year, 10 exchanges reported
over 100 separate actions, including impositions of fines in 39 cases
ranging from $50 to $5,000, with total fines aggregating $29,775, the
suspension from membership of 13 individuals and 2 member organizations and the censure of 2 member firms. These exchanges also
reported the imposition of various sanctions against 81 registered
representatives and employees of member firms. In addition, several
exchanges reported a large number of informal staff actions of a
cautionary nature.
Termination of Registration of San Francisco Mining Exchange.InSan Francisco Mining Exchange v. S.E.O.3s, the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit affirmed an order of the Commission of April 22,
1966, entered pursuant to Section 19(a) (1) of the Securities Exchange
Act, withdrawing the registration of the San Francisco Mining
Exchange. The Commission had found that the Exchange over a
period of years had repeatedly neglected to enforce compliance by its
members and by issuers of securities listed thereon with the reporting,
insider trading and anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act and
had lent its facilities to securities distributions made in violation of
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The Commission had also found that officials of the Exchange had been personally involved in repeated violations of the securities laws. The

Exchange did not contest these findings; it contended that the remedy
proposed by the hearing examiner, which would have permitted it to
reorganize within 90 days, was supported by the record and that the
Commission's remedy, withdrawal of the Exchange's registration, was
not. The court held that the Commission's decision was reasonable and
was not an abuse of discretion, noting that "the complete reorganization proposed by the hearing examiner . . . would in essence be the
withdrawal of the registration of the present Exchange, and the registration of a completely new exchange."
The court also rejected the Exchange's allegations that it had been
denied due process because of the Commission's refusal to issue subpoenas ad teetifioamduan. and duces teoum. directed to the Commissioners
and the Secretary for the purpose of determining whether there had
been prejudgment and bias in the administrative proceeding. The
court held that the Commission was entitled to refuse such requests
if, as here, the evidence sought was not shown to be generally relevant
and material, stating, "Were that otherwise, an indiscriminate subpoenaing of Commission members would lead to an unreasonable and
unnecessary delay of the administrative process."
MISREPRESENTATIONS IN THE SALE OR PURCHASE OF SECURITIES

Among the improper practices which constantly concern the Commission and its staff and which are the subject of frequent enforcement
action is the use of false or misleading representations in connection
with the sale or purchase of securities." The comments in the preceding
section regarding detection methods, investigations and sanctions are
in general equally applicable to this type of conduct. The Commission also frequently participates as amicus curiae in litigation between
private parties under the so-called anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws, where it considers it important to present its views regarding
the interpretation of those provisions.
During the course of the fiscal year, the Commission participated
either as a party or as amicus curiae in a number of cases involving
important issues under the anti-fraud provisions.
In 8E.0. v. Van Horn,31 an action to enjoin the defendants, among
other things, from violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933 through false and misleading statements in the sale of
securities, one of the principal issues was whether "scienter or fraudulent intent" must be proven as a prerequisite to injunctive relief under
.. Misrepresentations are, of course, an integral part of "boiler-room" or similar
high-pressure fraudulent operations by broker-dealers. To the extent misrepresentations are employed in that context, they are discussed in the section on
improper broker-dealer practices.

Sections 17(a) (2) and (3) of the Act. In affirming the issuance of a
preliminary injunction, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
held that there is no such requirement, stating that:
"In view of the plain language employed by Congress, it would be presumptuous on our part to hold that the applicability of the clauses involved is
dependent on intent to defraud. Not only did Congress fail to include such
a requirement, but legislative history indicates that it did so deliberately."

During the year the Commission participated either as a party or
as amicus curiae in cases in three different judicial circuits posing
the question whether corporate mergers or consolidations constitute
purchases or sales of securities within the meaning of Section 10(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder as well
as the other related anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws. In
an amicus brief over two decades ago in National Supply 00. v.
Leland Stanford Jr. U(J1iversity,38the Commission had taken the
position that a merger was not a sale for purposes of the anti-fraud
provision of the Securities Act of 1933,89 and the Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit had adopted the Commission's "no-sale" position.
For at least the past 15 years, however, the Commission has consistently
taken the position that, whatever the status of a corporate merger or
consolidation for purposes of the registration provisions of the Securities Act, it constitutes a purchase or sale of the securities for purpose
of the anti-fraud provisions. This is the position that the Commission
took in a'111JWus
briefs in Vine v, Beneficial Finance 00.40 and Desha v.
Susquehanna OorpP and as a party in S.E.O. v, National Securities,
Inc.42 Both the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the Vine
case, decided during the fiscal year, and the Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit in the Dasho case, decided soon after the close of the
fiscal year, agreed with the Commission's amious position in those
cases. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stated:
"We note that whatever stance it adopted two decades ago, the Commission
strongly urges in this case that the short form merger resulted in a purchase
and sale of plaintiff's stock within the meaning of Rule 10b-5."

In the Vine case, which involved a short form merger, the court also
held that no proof of reliance is required where "no volitional act is
required and the result of a forced sale is exactly that intended by the
wrongdoer." It therefore found it unnecessary to deal with the Commission's "interesting contention" that damages incurred by a security
holder as a direct result of a violation of Section 10(b) and Rule

lOb-v are recoverable under those provisions even if he was not a purchaser or seller of those securities.
One of the most recurrent issues in litigation under anti-fraud provisions in recent years has been the scope of the Federal securities
laws vis-a-vis State law in the corporate and other areas. With the
almost universal acceptance of private rights of action under Section
lO(b) and Rule lOb-5, persons with possible grievances under State
law have increasingly asserted those grievances in the Federal courts
under the anti-fraud provisions as well, in order to take advantage of
the liberal substantive and procedural provisions of the Federal securities laws. In deciding such cases the courts have been faced with the
question whether the conduct complained of falls in that area in which
State and Federal law exist side by side and complement each other,
or in the area occupied solely by State law. The Commission participated as amicus curiae during the fiscal year in cases posing this
question.
One such case, A. T. Brod & 00. v. Perl(Y/J),43 involved what has been
called the "man bites dog" situation. In that case the plaintiff broker
alleged that the defendant customer placed an order to purchase securities with the intention not to pay for them unless their market value
had increased by the date that payment was due. The defendant argued
that the Federal securities laws were only designed to protect investors,
and that all that had been alleged was a breach of contract in violation
of State law. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed with
the amicus position of the Commission that the securities laws were
not designed only to protect investors, and that the alleged intention of
the defendant customer to pay for the securities only under certain
conditions constituted fraud within the meaning of Section lO(b) and
Rule lOb-5 and not a mere breach of contract. The court also agreed
with the Commission that the anti-fraud provisions are not limited to
fraud as to the investment value of securities. It stated that:
"We believe that ~ lOeb) and rule lOb-5 prohibit alZ fraudulent schemes in
connection with the purchase or sale of securities, whether the arti1lces
employed involve a garden type variety of fraud, or present a unique form
of deception. Novel or atypical methods should not provide immunity from
the securities laws."

The Dasho case, which was discussed earlier in connection with the
no-sale issue," involved a transaction in which the defendant corporation transferred cash and stock in another corporation to a dissident
group of the defendant corporation's shareholders in exchange for the
dissidents' stock in the defendant corporation. The transaction was

allegedly entered into to prevent the dissident shareholders from
bringing a derivative suit against management, and the exchange ratio
was allegedly unfair to the defendant corporation. Although all the
directors of the defendant corporation, who approved the transaction,
were aware of 'these facts, they were either proposed defendants in the
threatened derivative suit or representatives of the dissident group.
The Commission took the position in its brief as amicus curiae that
under these circumstances it was a violation of Rule 10b-5 for the directors to fail to disclose these facts to their stockholders even though
stockholder approval of the transaction was neither required under
State law nor sought. One member of the panel of the court of appeals
wrote a concurring opinion in which another joined which considered
inter alia the decision by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
in Ruckle v. Roto-Asnerioaa OOrp.45 where some of the directors had
not been participants in the transaction and thus could be deceived in
the ordinary sense. Here also, the opinion stated, there had been a violation of the anti-fraud provisions since
"the failure of the defendant directors to perform their duty presumably
injured the corporation, and I do not believe it is sound to differentiate between situations where the directors were unanimous in wrongdoing and
those where less than all were involved."

A similar issue was involved in Pappas v. Moss.46 In that case the
directors of the defendant corporation had issued stock in the corporation to themselves and others at an allegedly inadequate price.
All of the directors, who approved the transaction with themselves,
were fully aware of the facts, and stockholder approval was not required under State law. In this case, however, shareholder approval
was sought so that the stock could be listed on an exchange, and allegedly false statements were made to the shareholders in the process.
The defendant directors owned a majority of the shares of the corporation and voted them in favor of the transaction. The Commission's
position in its brief amicus ouriae was that, when interested directors
of a corporation approve a securities transaction on its behalf at an
unfair price and make misrepresentations of material facts apparently
designed to deceive the shareholders, they violate Section 10 (b) and
Rule 10b-5 regardless of their voting power either as directors or as
shareholders. The case was awaiting decision at the end of the fiscal
year.

shares of a second corporation. The plaintiffs claimed to have purchased stock in the second corporation in reliance on this tender offer,
which did not disclose either the fact that certain assets of the second
corporation were worth substantially more than their book value or
the alleged intention of the defendant corporation to loot the second
corporation after gaining control. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in a decision handed down after the close of the fiscal year,
agreed with the Commission that, since (1) the plaintiffs allegedly
purchased rather than sold stock in the second corporation on the basis
of the tender offer, (2) the information as to the true value of the
corporate assets was publicly available and plaintiffs under their own
allegations benefited from this nondisclosure by being able to purchase their stock at depressed prices, (3) there were no affirmative
misrepresentations alleged and (4) the defendant corporation was not
an insider of the second corporation, this aspect of the complaint stated
no cause of action.
The court stated:
"As the Commission's amicus brief points out, if plaintiffs' proposition were
'accepted, it would convert any instance of corporate mismanagement into
a Rule 10b-5 case."

Also in agreement with the Commission's position, the court went on
to state that with respect to the period after plaintiffs became security
holders they would have a cause of action for any damages resulting
from defendant's alleged downward manipulation of the market price
of the stock, to enable it to purchase shares at depressed prices, although it held that they had not been damaged because they had not
sold their stock. It held, however, that plaintiffs had standing to seek
an injunction against the alleged manipulation without any proof of
loss. In Pacific 17l8. 00. v. Blot 48 the Commission, as amicus, stated
that it was inclined to believe that a noninsider who is planning to
make a tender offer may make open market purchases of the same
stock at lower prices without disclosing the forthcoming tender offer.
The district court did not reach this issue but instead denied a preliminary injunction against the use of the shares acquired in this
manner on the basis of two points urged by the Commission: (1) that
a corporation does not have standing to seek an injunction against a
tender for its shares absent an allegation that the corporation was
itself defrauded or injured by the tender, and (2) that the fact that
one has acquired stock in violation of the anti-fraud provisions is not
sufficient to prevent him from exercising such rights of a shareholder
under State law as the right to obtain a list of shareholders.

in the Securities Exchange Act, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh

Circuit, in Toherepnia v. Knight,49 reversing the decision of the district COurt,60 held, contrary to the views expressed by the Commission as amicus curiae, that withdrawable capital shares issued by
a State-chartered savings and loan association are not securities within
that definition and that the district court, therefore, did not have jurisdiction of a cause of action based upon alleged violation of Rule
100-5 brought by the holders of such shares. Supported by the Commission, plaintiffs petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. The writ was granted and on August 31, 1967, a brief was
filed on behalf of the Commission.
In the criminal area, further progress was made during the fiscal
year in the prosecution of fraudulent securities promotions. Last year's
report had discussed the return of indictments in the American
Bonded Mortgage Company case, charging the defendants with employing a scheme to distribute notes purportedly "guaranteed" by
mortgages, in violation of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities
Act.51 In December 1966 the defendants were convicted The most
severe sentences were imposed on Mark H. Kroll and William Cahn,
who were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and fined $40,000 and
$15,000, respectively.
In another prosecution involving the sale of high-interest bearing
notes and debentures, John B. Sanders, Jr., was convicted of violating
the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act on an indictment charging fraud in the sale of securities of three corporations known as the
"Underwriters" group, as well as certificates of deposit of Lords Bank
and Trust Company, Ltd., a Bahamian bank. 52 This bank was one of
a number of Bahamian banking institutions that had been placed on
the Commission's Foreign Restricted List due to unlawful securities
distributions in the United States. 53 Sanders was sentenced to a total
of 10 years imprisonment.
Eight individuals and three corporations were convicted of violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act in connection with
the sale of stock of Air and Space Underwriters, Inc., primarily to
residents of Indiana." A particularly significant aspect of the case was
the conviction of Van C. Vollmer, former editor of an Indiana financial newspaper, of violating the "anti-touting" provisions of Section 17 (b) of the Securities Act by failing to disclose that he received
compensation for promoting the company's securities in the news and

In sustaining the conviction of Donald R. Elbel of violations of the
anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act and of the Mail Fraud
Statute, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit 115 made it plain
that requisite criminal intent may be inferred from a "reckless disregard" for the underlying truth or falsity of the represenations
made. The court also held that a defendant's allegation that he believed
in the eventual success of the business venture is no defense to criminal
charges of misrepresentations of material facts. Elbel had been convicted of devising a scheme to offer and sell securities of Coffeyville
Loan and Investment Company by fraudulent means.
MANIPULATION

The Exchange Act and Commission rules under the Act prohibit
various kinds of manipulative activities. In order to enable the Commission to meet its responsibilities for the surveillance of the securities
markets, the market surveillance staff has devised a number of procedures to identify possible manipulative activities. A program has
been adopted with respect to surveillance over listed securities, in which
the staff's activities are closely coordinated with the stock watching
operations of the New York and American Stock Exchanges. Within
this framework, the staff reviews the daily and periodic stock watch
reports prepared by these exchanges and on the basis of its analysis of
the information developed by the exchanges and other sources, determines matters of interest, possible violations of applicable law, and
the appropriate action to be taken.
In addition, the market surveillance staff maintains a continuous
ticker tape watch of transactions on the New York and American
Stock Exchanges and the sales and quotations sheets of regional exchanges to observe any unusual or unexplained price variations or
market activity. The financial news ticker, leading newspapers and
various financial publications and statistical services are also closely
followed.
If any of these sources reveals possible violations, the market surveillance staff conducts a preliminary inquiry into the matter. These
inquiries, some of which are conducted with the cooperation of the
exchange concerned, generally begin with the identification of the
brokerage firms which were active in the security. The staff may communicate with partners, officers or registered representatives of the
firms, with customers, or with officials of the company in question to
determine the reasons for the activity or price change in the securities
involved and whether violations may have occurred.
The Commission has also developed an automated over-the-counter
surveillance program to provide more efficient and comprehensive
.. Elbel v. U.S.,364 F. 2d 127 (1966).

surveillance. The automated equipment is programmed to identify,
among other things, unlisted securities whose price movement or dealer interest varies beyond specified limits in a pre-established time
period. When a security is so identified, the automated system prints
out current and historic market information concerning it. This data,
combined with other available information, is collated and analyzed to
select those securities whose activity indicates the need for further
inquiry or referral to the Commission's enforcement staff.
In addition to the Commission's market surveillance activities, the
other detection methods previously discussed are also useful tools in
the detection of manipulation. Prior comments of a general nature
regarding investigations and the nature of sanctions available are
equally pertinent to manipulations.
Among Commission decisions during the year dealing with manipulative activities by broker-dealers, the following are of particular
interest:
In Kamen & Oompany,56 the Commission dealt with a manipulative scheme perpetrated by a group of employees of the Kamen firm,
a New York and American Stock Exchange member. The employees
solicited numerous nonexchange member broker-dealers throughout
the country to place their exchange business in listed securities with
the firm in return for over-the-counter business to be furnished them
by the firm. The only over-the-counter business furnished, however,
was in the form of contrived transactions in the stock of Jerome, Richard & Co., Inc., a registered broker-dealer which certain of these employees had organized.
In the typical situation, a member of the group would telephone an
out-of-town nonexchange member dealer (A) and in a single conversation instruct that dealer to purchase a specified number of Jerome
shares from another designated dealer (B) at a specified price and simultaneously to sell the same shares to a third designated dealer (C) at
a specified price which was usually lh or % of a point higher than
the purchase price. This last dealer (C) was then in a similar manner
instructed by a member of the group to buy the shares at that higher
price from the prior dealer (A) and simultaneously to sell them to
still another designated dealer (D) at an even higher price. In this
manner a large number of circuits of transactions were effected among
approximately 100 nonmember broker-dealers. Finally the group arranged for a large number of shares to end with two "dummy" corporations. The failure of these corporations to pay for the stock resulted
in losses to various broker-dealers totaling more than $475,000.
The Commission found that although there was no evidence to support a finding that the firm's managing partner had actual knowledge
.. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 7965 (September 29,1966).

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of the group's plan or the methods by which it was accomplished, the
firm and the partner failed to discharge their responsibilities to institute and maintain adequate supervisory procedures designed to prevent violations. It suspended the firm from its exchange memberships
and NASD membership for 10 business days and suspended the partner from association with any broker or dealer for 90 days.
In F. 8. Johns & Oompany, Inc.,51 the Commission found that a
number of 'broker-dealers participated in a manipulative scheme with
respect to the stock of Diversified Funding, Inc., masterminded by the
Johns firm and its president, who were also engaged in retailing
Diversified stock through -a "boiler-room" sales campaign. The Commission found that the Johns firm, in order to create the appearance of
a broad and active market 'and to facilitate the retail distribution at
artificially inflated prices of substantial blocks of Diversified stock
which it held or expected to acquire, induced other dealers to place
ostensibly independent, but in reality fictitious, quotations in the quotation sheets for the over-the-counter market at continually increasing
levels, in willful violation of the anti-fraud provisions. The Commission further held that the other dealers, who should have realized
that they were cogs in a manipulative scheme, were culpable participants in the scheme. With respect to one of the respondents, Reuben
Rose & Co., Inc., whose trader had on his own entered into the arrangement with F. S. Johns, the Commission held that the firm failed to
exercise the necessary supervision over the trader. It found that the
firm "exercised no supervision whatever over the day-to-day activities
of its trader . . . . The controls which were assertedly maintained
were directed toward protection of the firm's capital rather than to
protection of investors. Under the circumstances, the firm's failure
of supervision made it a participant in [the trader's] misconduct."
Two criminal cases developed during <thefiscal year involved the
manipulation of stocks listed on the American Stock Exch-ange. In
United States v, Osborne A.ndreas,58 six defendants were indicted for
conspiring to manipulate the price of the stock of Pentron Electronics
Corporation while distributing a block of Pentron stock for Andreas,
the former president of the corporation. Two of the defendants, Mark
Rolland, a partner in a Chicago factoring firm called Investment
Associates, and Spero FurIa, a securities salesman, have pleaded guilty
to the charges. In United States v. Henry Dubbin,59 seven defendants,
including Dubbin, the president of Canaveral International Corporation, were indicted for conspiring to manipulate the price of Canaveral
stock.

IMPROPER USE OF INSIDE INFORMATION

Corporate insiders by virtue of their position may have knowledge
of material facts which are unavailable to the general public and may
be able to use such knowledge to their advantage in transactions in
the company's securities. Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act
was designed to curb the misuse of inside information. As previously
noted, that section requires insiders to report their security holdings
and transactions and provides for the recovery by or on behalf of the
issuer of short-swing trading profits realized by insiders. The Commission is not a party in suits under Section 16, but frequently participate as amicus curiae in those instances where significant interpretive
issues are involved. Aside from Section 16, however, those who make
improper use of inside information in the purchase or sale of securities
may also be liable for damages or subject to injunctive action under
the anti-fraud provisions of the securities acts, either at the instance
of injured private litigants or the Commission itself, or subject to
disciplinary action in administrative proceedings instituted by the
Commission.
In Penmahma &: OomPO/ll/Y, Inc.,oo the Commission held, among
other things, that where a director and controlling person of a company sold its securities without making disclosure of the adverse financial condition of the company which condition was inconsistent
with the favorable public image of the company known to and even
fostered by him, his sales violated the anti-fraud provisions.
The last annual report 61 discused at some length the decision of the
trial court in S.E.O. v, Teeas Gulf Sulphur 00./2 rendered early in
the 1967 fiscal year. This is an action by the Commission for injunctive
and other relief against various insiders of Texas Gulf as well as
against the company itself raising important issues under the antifraud provisions of Rule 10b-5 with respect to insiders' securities
transactions based on undisclosed inside information. Both the Commission and the two individuals who were found by the trial court to
have violated the law appealed from the decision, and the appeals were
argued in March 1967 before the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit.
In Pettef« v, Butler,63 an action under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,
contrary to the position urged by the Commission in an amicus curiae
brief, held that a conversion of preferred stock into common stock,

constitute a "purchase" of the common within the meaning of that
section.
In Ohemical Fund, Inc. v, Xerow Oorporations" the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that for purposes of determining
beneficial ownership under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act
convertible debentures are not a separate "class" of an equity security.
It further held that the test of liability under Section 16(b) where
convertible debentures are involved is whether the total percentage
of common stock which a holder would own following a hypothetical
conversion of his debentures would exceed 10 percent of the outstanding common stock thus hypothetically augmented. The Commission
had filed a brief, amicus curiae, urging that the debentures constituted
a separate class of an equity security.
ENFORCEMENT PROBLEMS WITH RESPEcr

TO FOREIGN SECURITIES

The unlawful offer and sale of Canadian securities in the
United States remained at a fairly low level in fiscal 1967, continuing
the trend of the past few years. The decline of unlawful Canadian
promotions since the operations of the Toronto and Montreal "boilerrooms" of the late 1950's is due primarily to effective cooperation
and liaison between the Commission and the Alberta, Ontario and
Quebec Securities Commissions and quasi -offlcial bodies such as the
Toronto and Montreal Stock Exchanges and the Broker-Dealers' Association of Ontario. A promising development during the year was
the enactment of new securities laws in Ontario and several other
Canadian provinces. The Commission is following with considerable
interest the steps being taken to create a Federal securities agency in
Canada, and has offered to provide full assistance to it.
The Commission has continued to work closely with the Ontario
Royal Commission on Atlantic Acceptance Corporation Limited in
its investigation into the circumstances surrounding the collapse in
June 1965 of Atlantic Acceptance, a large Canadian finance company.
The Royal Commission, which was appointed in the wake of Atlantic's
financial debacle, has held 124 days of public hearings, at several of
which a member of this Commission's staff testified. The Atlantic
Acceptance collapse had wide ramifications, and resulted in a loss of
almost $100 million to Canadian and American investors. Numerous
criminal charges have been brought, mostly in Ontario, as a result of
the investigation, and the Commission has assisted the Ontario Securities Commission and the Attorney General's Department of Ontario
in connection with many of those cases.
In response to a request from the Internal Revenue Service, the
Commission assisted it in an investigation of substantial evasions of
.. 377 F. 2d 107 (e.A..2, 1967).

TEURTY-TEURD ~AL

REPORT

103

the Interest Equalization Tax on purchases by Americans of foreign
securities from foreign sellers. These evasions have taken place through
the use of false certificates of American ownership of foreign securities. Two indictments have been returned against alleged tax evaders.
In addition, a new system for substantiation of the fact of prior United
States ownership of taxable securities has been established by the
Internal Revenue Service in order to avoid the evasive practices. This
system implements a recent amendment of the Interest Equalization
Tax section of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
Offers and sales to American residents of unregistered securities
in the form of certificates of deposit issued by Bahamian banks have
declined considerably due to the enactment in late 1965 of Bahamian
legislation regulating the bank business in that colony. The name of
one Bahamian savings and loan association was added to the Commission's Foreign Restricted List 65 during the year, however, as a
result of the offer and sale of its securities (in the form of savings
account passbooks) to United States residents. The Commission deleted the names of 13 Bahamian "banks" from the Foreign Restricted
List after being informed by the Bahamas Ministry of Finance that
their corporate charters had been revoked.
The Commission's Foreign Restricted List has reflected the changing character of its foreign enforcement effort. As of June 30, 1967,
only 26 companies remained on the list, the smallest number since
its establishment. The names of 41 Canadian and 14 Bahamian companies were deleted from the list during the fiscal year in accordance
with established procedures, while the names of 1 Canadian, 2 Bahamian, 1 British Honduran and 4 Panamanian companies were added
to the list. The current list and supplements to it are issued to and
published by the press, and copies are mailed to all registered brokerdealers and are made available to the press.
As of September 30, 1967, there were 30 companies on the list, including 18 Canadian, 4 Bahamian, 7 Panamanian and 1 British Honduran companies, as follows:
Bahamian

American International Mining

in the United States in violation of the registration requirements ot the Becurttles
Act of 1933.

PART VI
REGULATION OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES
The Investment Company Act of 1940 provides for the registration
and regulation of companies primarily engaged in the business of
investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities. The
Act, among other things, requires disclosure of the financial condition
and investment policies of such companies; prohibits changes in the
nature of their business or their investment policies without shareholder approval; regulates the means of custody of their assets;
requires management contracts to be submitted to shareholders for
approval; prohibits underwriters, investment bankers, or brokers
from constituting more than a minority of the board of directors;
and prohibits transactions between investment companies and their
officers, directors, or other affiliates except with approval of the Commission. The Act also regulates the issuance of senior securities and
requires face-amount certificate companies to maintain reserves adequate to meet maturity payments. Investment companies must also
file periodic reports and are subject to the Commission's proxy rules,
and certain "insiders" of closed-end companies are subject to the
insider reporting and "short swing" trading rules. The securities of
investment companies which are offered to the public are required
to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933.
The Division of Corporate Regulation performs the principal functions under the Investment Company Aot. In addition, it has responsibility for the administration of disclosure requirements with respect
to registration statements filed by investment companies under the
Securities Act of 1933and the administration of the periodic reporting,
proxy solicitation and other applicable provisions of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to such companies.
Part I of this report summarizes the Commission's Report on the
Public Policy Implications of Investment Company Growth, which
was submitted to Congress in December 1966, and the legislative proposals implementing the recommendations of the Report for amendment of the Investment Company Act, submitted in May 1967.
COMPANIES REGISTERED UNDER THE Acr

As of June 30,1967, there were 842 investment companies registered
under the Act, including 68 small business investment companies. Of
105

106

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION 


this total, 743 were 'Lactive"companies, whose s e t s had an aggregate
market value of approximately $58.2 billion. Compared with the
corrasponding totals a t June 30,1966, these figures represent WI overall
increase of approximately $8.4 billion in the market value of assets
and an increase of 76 in the number of active registered companies.
The asset increase is partly due to appreciation in the assets of previously registered companies and partly to the large increase in the
number of registered companies. The following table shows the various
categories of registered companies as well as the number of companies
and the approximate market d u e of the assets in each oakgory as

CAPITAL LEVERAGED FUNDS

During fiscal year 1967 a new type of investment company known
as a capital leveraged investment company developed and nine such
companies registered under the Investment Company Act.
I n the capital leveraged company, one-half of the capital is contributed by 'LIncomeShareholders" and the other half by "Capital
Shareholders." The Income Shareholders are entitled to the entire
income of the company for a specified number of years, and at the
end of the specified period to a liquidation value. With respect to the
companies which have registered, the specified period ranges from 12
to 18 years. The Capital Shareholders are entitled to the capital
appreciation on the total capital of the company at the expiration of
the specified period less the liquidation value of the income shares.
I n other words, the Income Shareholders give up the capihl appreciation on their investment to the Capital Shareholders in return for
which the latter give up the income on their investment. The stated
purpose of these companies is to enable investors who seek either
income or growth of capital to the exclusion of the other to maximize
their goals. Seven of the capital leveraged companiw have sold their
securities to the public for cash and the two others issued their securities in exchange for securities held by pnblic iilr cstors.

108

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

All but one of the registered capital leveraged companies are closedend investment companies which, so long as their income shares are
outstanding, will neither issue more stock of either class nor redeem
any securities which they have already issued. The one open-end company sold the two classes as a unit and will redeem as a unit. The
holders of units may, if they so desire, sell either class on the open
market. This open-end company also will not issue any additional
shares.
All of the closed-end capital leveraged companies filed applications
for exemption from Section 18(a) (2) (E) of the Act, which requires
dividends on senior securities that are stocks (here the income shares)
to be cumulative. The one open-end company, which provided safeguards with respect to its income shares substantially equivalent to
those that would be operative if the restrictions of Section 18(a) were
applicable, applied for exemption from Section 18(f) (1) which generally prohibits an open-end company from issuing any senior security.
The Commission granted these applications. In order to minimize the
conflict of interest between the two classes and to protect against
undue leverage, the Commission, with the consent of the companies,
imposed certain conditions in the exemptive orders.
THE "FLEXIBLE FUND ANNUITY"-S.E.C. v, UNITED BENEFIT LIFE
INSURANCE CO.

InS.E.O. 'V. United Benefit Life Imeuranoe 00.,1 the Supreme Court,
reversing the decision of the court of appeals," held that the "Flexible
Fund Annuity" contract offered and sold by United Benefit Life
Insurance Company is subject to the registration requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933. Rejecting the view of the court of appeals that
the contract must be characterized in its entirety, the Supreme Court
held that the operation of the contract during the accumulation, or
pay-in, period, when the company "promises to serve as an investment
agency and allow the policyholder to share in its investment experience," must be assessed independently ''to determine whether that
separable portion of the contract falls within the class of those
exempted by Congress from the requirements of the Securities Act,
and, if not, whether the contract constitutes a 'security' within Section
2 of that Act .... " In holding that the exemption from registration
provided by Section 3(a) (8) of the Act for insurance and annuity
contracts is unavailable with respect to the accumulation portion of
the contract, the Court emphasized that arrangements of this type

in the 32nd Annual Report, pp, 112-13; 31st Annual Report, p. 127; 29th Annual
Report, pp. 119-20.

"require special modifications of State la w, and are considered to appeal
to the purchaser not on the usual insurance basis of stability and
security but on the prospect of 'growth' through sound investment
management." The Court added that the contract provision under
which the company guarantees a partial repayment to the purchaser
does not convert the contract into one of insurance; "the basic difference between a contract which to some degree is insured and a contract
of insurance must be recognized." Finally, the Court held that the
accumulation provisions constitute an "investment contract" within
the meaning of Section 2 of the Securities Act. In so holding, the
Court noted that "contracts such as the 'Flexible Fund' offer important competition to mutual funds ... and are pitched to the same
consumer interest in growth through professionally managed investment," and then stated that "it seems eminently fair that a purchaser of
such a plan be afforded the same advantages of disclosure which inure
to a mutual fund purchaser under ...
[the registration provisions]
of the Securities Act." Having thus disposed of the issues raised under
the Securities Act, the Court remanded the case to the court of appeals
for consideration of the question whether the Flexible Fund is an
investment company under the Investment Company Act-an issue
which the lower courts had not reached.
CONTROL OF IMPROPER PRAcrICES
Inspection

and Investigation

Program

Section 31(b) of the Investment Company Act authorizes the Commission to make periodic and special examinations of registered
investment companies. Pursuant to this authority the Commission's
staff conducted 156 inspections during fiscal 1967. Many of these
inspections disclosed violations not only of the Investment Company
Act but also of other statutes administered by the Commission. Most
of the violations uncovered during routine inspections appear to have
resulted from unfamiliarity with the Investment Company Act and
were resolved after they were brought to the attention of management.
Some of the violations uncovered, however, were serious in nature.
These included inadequate arrangements for the safekeeping of investment company assets, failure to disclose true sources of periodic income
and capital gain distributions paid to shareholders, inadequate disclosures concerning the activities of the investment company and
failure to maintain adequate fidelity bond coverage for persons dealing
with investment company assets. The inspections also disclosed several
instances where the procedures for pricing investment company shares
did not conform with statutory requirements and with procedures
set forth in the company's prospectus. Instances were also uncovered

110

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

in which self-dealing transactions had been effected by affiliated persons in violation of Section 17 of the Act.
Largely as an outgrowth of the information obtained during routine
inspections, 12 private investigations were commenced during the fiscal
year to develop the facts concerning what appeared to be serious
violations.
Civil, Administrative and Criminal Proceedings

During the fiscal year, the Commission, on the basis of facts
developed through investigations, instituted three civil and two administrative actions. In two other cases, which had been referred to the
Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, indictments were returned. Other proceedings, previously instituted, were concluded or
progressed toward conclusion.
In one of the civil actions, BE.O. v, Montauk Financial Corporation,s the Commission obtained a permanent injunction prohibiting
the company from operating as an unregistered investment company
and its president from aiding and abetting such conduct, and enjoining
both respondents from violating the anti-fraud provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933 by selling securities of the company without
disclosing material facts regarding its financial condition. The complaint also sought a receiver of Montauk's assets. By agreement among
the court and the parties, however, the defendants filed a plan for the
voluntary liquidation of Montauk which the court approved. The
plan provides, among other things, for the surrender by the president
and certain other stockholders of some of the stock originally issued
to them in exchange for certain securities.
In BE.O. v. Milton,4 the Commission sought an injunction prohibiting David M. Milton, former chairman of the board of directors and
chief executive officer of The Equity Corporation, a registered investment company, from acting as an officer or director of Equity or any
other registered investment company. The Commission also sought an
accounting and restitution from Milton in favor of Equity and a majority-owned subsidiary of Equity, Bell Intercontinental Corporation.
The complaint alleged that Milton was guilty of gross misconduct
and gross abuse of trust in respect of Equity, that he converted to his
own use certain assets of Equity and that he caused Bell to purchase
at an excessive price the assets of a company with which he was affiliated. It further alleged that he made false and misleading statements to
the board of directors of Equity and concealed from the board material
information concerning the business of, and transactions engaged in

by, Equity and its subsidiaries and affiliated persons; that he concealed from the board certain conflicts of interest between his fiduciary
duties to Equity and his personal interests; that by means of these
concealments and false and misleading statements he secured authorization from Equity's board of directors for numerous transactions
which benefited himself and certain of his associates and controlled
companies; and that he prevented Equity's directors from being
furnished with sufficient information to enable them to discharge
their obligations and responsibilities to direct and manage the business
and affairs of Equity.
Following the close of the fiscal year Milton consented in a stipulation of settlement to the entry of a permanent injunction. In view of
the pendency of certain shareholder derivative actions seeking recovery from Milton and others in favor of Equity and Bell on the
basis of the same matters alleged in the Commission's complaint, the
Commission agreed, as part of the settlement, to the dismissal of that
portion of its complaint which sought monetary relief against Milton
in favor of Equity and Bell. Included in the stipulation of settlement,
which was incorporated into the final judgment, were several provisions designed to protect the interests of the shareholders of Equity
and Bell.
In S.E.O. v. Sterling Precision Oorporation,t' the Commission
sought an injunction prohibiting further violations of Section 17 (a)
of the Investment Company Act and an order decreeing that the redemption by Sterling of certain of its preferred stock and debentures
held by a registered investment company affiliated with Sterling violated that section and was void. After the close of the fiscal year, the
district court granted Sterling's motion for summary judgment, holding that although supervision by the Commission of the redemption
might have been desirable in the public interest, it was not required
under the statute. The court held that the omission from Section
17(a) (2) of a specific reference to "redemption" indicated that Congress meant to exclude redemption transactions from the prohibition
in that section of "purchase[s]" from a registered investment company by affiliated persons. The Commission has appealed from the
district court's decision.
The last annual report II discussed earlier stages of the litigation in
SE.O. v, Wong, an action in which the Commission, among other
things, sought an order under Section 36 of the Investment Company
Act enjoining the defendants from serving as officers or directors of
~ S.D. N.Y., 66 Civ. 3052.

a registered investment company, because of their alleged "gross
abuse of trust" while serving in those capacities for Puerto Rico Capital Corporation. As previously noted, the district court denied motions
to dismiss the complaint," It also denied a motion by one of the defendants to permit an interlocutory appeal with respect to the court's
rulings that (1) a former officer or director of a registered investment
company who allegedly committed gross abuse of trust while serving
in that capacity cannot evade the injunctive provisions of Section 36
by resigning before the complaint is filed; and (2) the Commission
may seek ancillary relief of restitution and an accounting in injunctive actions instituted under the Investment Company Act and the
Securities Exchange Act," Subsequently, the court granted an application by the receiver for the investment company to be substituted for
the company, which had been named as a nominal defendant, and to
be realigned as a co-party plaintiff. In connection with this application
the court held that an implied private right of action exists under
Section 36.
The two administrative proceedings principally involved alleged
improprieties by the investment advisers and principal underwriters
of mutual funds in the execution of portfolio transactions for the
funds, as well as related misrepresentations in the sale of the funds'
securities. In one of the proceedings, Delaware Management Oompany, Ino., it was charged that a broker-dealer, which was a substantial
dealer in the shares of the two funds involved, was improperly "interposed" between the funds and the best market, thus causing the funds
to incur excessive costs in their portfolio transactions. This proceeding
culminated during the year in the issuance of an order by the Commission accepting offers of settlement submitted by the respondents,
which provided among other things for reimbursement of the mutual
funds for excess costs incurred," Subsequent to the close of the year the
Commission issued its detailed findings and opinion." This case is
discussed at greater length at pages 78-79, supra. The other administrative proceeding, which was still pending at the close of the fiscal
year, involves allegations, among others, that the adviser and principal
underwriter of a mutual fund caused the fund to purchase for its
portfolio highly speculative securities which were unsuitable for the
fund and inconsistent with its stated investment policies.
In February 1966, the Commission had instituted administrative
broker-dealer proceedings against Investors Overseas Services (lOS)
and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Investors Continental Services, Ltd.,

largely of shares of investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act) and unregistered participations in the lOS

Rule 17d-1 thereunder, relating to transactions between International
Investment Trust, an investment company affiliate of lOS and FOF,
and certain registered investment companies; and (3) Section 17 ofthe
Securities Exchange Act relating to the failure to preserve and produce
certain books and records of lOS and ICS.11
In May 1967, the Commission announced that it had accepted an
offer of settlement submitted by the respondents proposing termination
of the proceedings without any findings as to these allegations and
agreeing for that purpose that: (1) respondents would not engage
in any activities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction; (2) lOS and
its affiliates would cease all sales of securities to U.S. citizens or nationals wherever located (with certain very limited exceptions), and
lOS would return funds which certain U.S. citizens and residents
had invested in FOF; (3) respondents would remove the lOS securities complex from the jurisdiction of the Commission by the sale or
other disposition of Investors Planning Corporation of America, a
registered broker-dealer, and ICS, withdrawal of lOS's registration
as a broker-dealer, and deregistration under the Investment Company
Act of five registered investment companies wholly owned by FOF;
(4) lOS and its affiliates would not acquire directly or indirectly
any controlling interest in any financial entity doing business in the
United States; and (5) lOS would cause FOF and its affiliated investment companies to make only such further purchases of shares of registered investment companies as are within the percentage limitations
now provided in Section 12(d) (1) of the Investment Company Act
and would abide by any future legislation applicable to foreign fund
holding companies such as FOF.12

vestment Company Act as well as violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and violation of the Mail Fraud
Statute. The indictment alleges that the defendant embezzled and converted to his own use funds and assets of the investment company. In
the other action, the former president of an investment company was
charged in a 6-count indictment with misappropriating $69,900 from
the company's shareholders through a series of sham transactions. He
was also charged with conspiring with another to defraud the company
by causing it to purchase shares of companies which are now worthless. The investment company is currently in receivership.
The Commission's enforcement program under the Investment Company Act was responsible for the return of approximately $700,000 to
investors, directly or indirectly, during the fiscal year, including approximately $376,000 as a result of the settlement in the Delaware
Management matter.
FILINGS REVIEWED

As previously noted, investment companies offering their shares for
sale to the public must register them under the Securities Act of
1933. The companies themselves, of course, must register under the
Investment Company Act. The registration statements of investment companies filed pursuant to the Securities Act are reviewed for
compliance with that Act and the Investment Company Act. The
Commission's rules promulgated under the Investment Company Act
generally require that the basic information contained in notifications
of registration and in registration statements of investment companies
filed under the Investment Company Act be kept current through
periodic and other reports. In addition, proxy soliciting material filed
by investment companies is reviewed for compliance with the Commission's proxy rules. The following table sets forth the nature and volume

exempt any person, security, or transaction from any provision of the
Act if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors
and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the
Act. Other sections, such as 6(d), 9(b), 10(£), 17(b), 17(d), and
23(c), contain specific provisions and standards pursuant to which the
Commission may grant exemptions from particular sections of the
Act or may approve certain types of transactions. Also, under certain
provisions of Section 2, 3, and 8, the Commission may determine the
status of persons and companies under the Act. One of the principal
activities of the Commission in its regulation of investment companies
is the consideration of applications for orders under the above sections.
During the fiscal year, 226 applications were filed under these and
other sections of the Act, and 211 applications were disposed of. As
of the end of the year, 115 applications were pending. The following
table presents a break-down, by sections involved, of the number of
applications filed and disposed of during the year and the number
pending at the beginning and close of the year.

Some of the more significant matters in which applications were
considered are summarized below:
The Commission denied an exemption from Section 17(a) of the
Investment Company Act for a proposed purchase by Bowser, Inc. of
222,600 shares of its voting common stock from The Equity Corporation, a registered investment company, Sterling Precision Corporation,
an affiliate of Bowser and Equity, J. Russell Duncan, chairman of
Sterling's board of directors, and J ardun Corporation, a company
wholly owned by Duncan," The Commission determined that the appli11

COMMISSION

cants had failed to establish that the terms of the proposed transaction,
including the consideration to be paid, met the test of Section 17(b)
of the Act that such terms be reasonable and fair and not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned.
The Commission found that in arranging for the proposed purchase,
Bowser's president and his adherents on the Bowser board of directors
were primarily motivated by the desire to maintain control of Bowser.
The proposed purchase would have avoided a threatened proxy contest
or tender offer by Duncan and the interests aligned with him. The
Commission stated that applicants had not shown that the use of the
corporation's funds for such a purpose would be fair to all of Bowser's
stockholders.
The Commission further found that applicants had failed to establish that the proposed purchase price of $13 per share was fair. Applicants relied on the fact that this price was about the same as the
market price quoted for Bowser stock on the American Stock Exchange
at the time the parties entered into the purchase agreement. The Commission stated, however, that such market price could not furnish an
appropriate standard by which to judge the fairness of the purchase
price, since the market price was significantly inflated as a result of
the heavy volume of insider buying by the vying groups.
The Commission subsequently denied a petition for rehearing filed
by Sterling, Duncan and Jardun, and these parties have appealed the
Commission's order to the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit.
In December 1966, Electric Bond and Share Company and American & Foreign Power Company Inc., its 56 percent-owned subsidiary,
both registered investment companies, entered into a merger agreement providing for the exchange of each share of common stock of
Foreign Power not owned by Bond and Share for %oth of a share
of Bond and Share common stock. The companies filed a joint application pursuant to Sections 17(b) and 6(c) of the Act for an order
exempting the proposed merger from Section 17(a) and other sections
of the Act.14
Prior to the date set for hearings, a shareholder of Foreign Power
instituted an action in a State court to enjoin the merger and moved
the Commission to dismiss its proceedings or to stay them pending
determination of the court action. The court thereafter granted a
motion by Foreign Power and Bond and Share to stay its proceedings
pending the Commission's proceedings, and the Commission denied the
motion before it. The shareholder participated in the hearings which
were concluded in May 1967. The parties and participants waived a

decision by the hearing examiner and submitted briefs to the Commission. At the close of the fiscal year the matter was pending.
New Rule Relating to Transactions Between Affiliated Investment Companies

Section 17 (a) of the Act, broadly speaking, prohibits purchase and
sale transactions between investment companies and persons or companies affiliated with such companies. Under Section 17(b), however,
the Commission may exempt proposed transactions from this prohibition when it finds that the terms are fair and that certain other
conditions are met. Rule 17a-7 exempts from Section 17(a) transactions between affiliated registered investment companies involving the
purchase or sale for cash and at the "independent current market
price" of securities traded on a national securities exchange." The
rule is designed to eliminate the need for filing a Section 17 (b) application under circumstances where it ris unlikely that the findings required by that section for an exemption could not be made. In addition,
it appears that the rule will serve the interests of investors by permitting affiliated registered investment companies which previously may
have purchased or sold securities on the open market in order to
avoid the application procedures of Section 17(b) and thereby incurred duplicate brokerage charges, to effect such transactions with
each other and pay no such charges.
NEW RULES RELATING TO "REWADING"

Section 11 (a) of the Act, in substance, prohibits an open-end investment company from imposing a sales load in connection with the
"exchange" of new shares for outstanding shares in the same company.
Certain open-end companies have issued shares which, by their terms,
terminate after a stated period of time. Upon investment of the proceeds of the terminated shares in new shares, a new sales load has been
imposed. Rule lla-1, published for comment during the fiscal year and
adopted shortly after the close of the year, makes it clear that the term
"exchange" includes the issuance of new shares under the above circumstances and thus precludes the imposition of a new sales load."
Section ll(b) (2) exempts from Section ll(a) an offer of exchange
made pursuant to the right of conversion, at the shareholder's option,
from one class or series into another "class or series of securities issued
by the same company." Rule llb-1 was adopted as a companion rule
to Rule lla-1 to make it clear that the exemption is not available to all
investment companies which might seek to escape the provisions
of Rule lla-1P It does so by specifying that the exemption is available

PART VII
REGULATION OF PUBUC-UTILITY

HOLDING COMPANIES

Under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Commission regulates interstate public-utility holding-company systems
engaged in the electric utility business and/or in the retail distribution
of gas. The Commission's jurisdiction also extends to natural gas
pipeline companies and other nonutility companies which are subsidiaries of registered holding companies. There are three principal
regulatory areas under the Act. The first includes those provisions
of the Act which require the physical integration of public-utility
companies and functionally related properties of holding-company
systems and the simplifioation of intercorporate relationships and
financial structures of such systems. The second covers the financing
operations of registered holding companies and their subsidiaries, the
acquisition and disposition of securities and properties, and certain
accounting practices, servicing arrangements, and intercompany transactions. The third area of regulation includes the exemptive provisions
of the Act, and provisions relating to the status under the Act of
persons and companies and regulating the right of persons affiliated
with a public-utility company to become affiliated with a second such
company through the acquisition of securities.
COMPOSmON

OF REGISTERED

HOLDING-COMPANY

SYSTEMS

registered holding-company systems, 4 of the 22 being subholding
utility operating companies in these systems/ The remaining 5 registered holding companies, which are relatively small, are not considered
part of "active" systems," In the 18 active systems, there are 89
1 The four subholding companies are

SECTION 11 MATTERS IN REGISTERED HOLDING-COMPANY SYSTEMS

In New Erngland Electric Sy8tem, as reported earlier," the Court
of Appeals for the First Circuit disagreed with the Commission's
interpretation of the phrase "loss of substantial economies" in Clause
(A) of Section 11 (b) (1) and reversed the order of the Commission
directing New England Electric System to divest itself of its gas
properties. The Supreme Court of the United States, however, sustained the Commission's position and remanded the case to the
court of appeals for further consideration.' On remand, the court
of appeals, after the filing of further briefs, again set aside the Commission's order," Proceeding on the premise that the Commission is to
be held to a "most stringent" standard in applying the "loss of substantial economies" test, the court concluded that the Commission's
analysis was not adequate to sustain its divestment order. The Supreme Court has granted the Commission's petition for a writ of
certiorari,"
As reported previously,' during fiscal year 1966 Penmeoil Oompany,
a registered holding company, and United Gas Corporation: its gas
utility subsidiary, jointly filed a two-part plan with the Commission
pursuant to Section 11 (e) of the Act. Part I proposed the sale of
United's gas distribution system, and Part II the consolidation of
Pennzoil and United. Part I of the plan was abandoned after completion of hearings thereon; an amended plan provides solely for
the consolidation of Pennzoil and United. The proceedings on the
amended plan were consolidated with proceedings instituted by the
Commission under Sections 11(b) (1) and 11 (b) (2). Hearings have
been concluded, and, at the close of the fiscal year, the case was pending before the Commission for decision.

pursuant to Section 11 (e) of the Act. Pursuant to Part I, approved by
the Commission," American sold its gas utility properties and paid
certain of its indebtedness. After a public hearing on Part II of the
plan, the Commission approved an initial 20 percent cash distribution
to the debenture holders." By separate Findings, Opinion and Order,
the Commission, over the objection of a debenture holder, authorized
American to acquire for $400,000 in cash additional shares of its sole
subsidiary company's common stock to provide the latter with necessary funds to complete construction of additional facilities." The

year. American Electric Power Company, Inc., a registered holding
company, had filed an application-declaration with the Commission
regarding the proposed acquisititon by American of outstanding shares
of common stock of Michigan Gas and Electric Company ("MGE"),
a nonassociate gas and electric utility company. A hearing was held,
and, after the close of the fiscal year, the Commission, in a three to
one decision, authorized the proposed acquisition by American." The
MGE shares are to be acquired from public stockholders pursuant to a
tender offer, from Michigan Gas Utilities Company ("MGU"), a
nonassociate gas utility company, and in the open market. The Commission also authorized the disposition to MGU of MGE's gas properties. MGE is to be liquidated and the electric interests retained by
the American holding-company system.
Northeast Utilities, a registered holding company, filed an application-declaration relating to a proposed offer by Northeast to exchange,
through an invitation for tenders, common stock to be issued by it for
the outstanding shares of capital stock of Holyoke 'Vater Power Company, a nonassociate company. The City of Holyoke, Massachusetts,
and its Gas and Electric Department urged the imposition of certain
conditions if the proposed acquisition were approved. Following the
close of the fiscal year, the Commission issued a decision authorizing
Northeast to proceed with the offer." The Commission ruled that it
was not appropriate to impose the conditions requested.
As reported previously," Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates, an exempt holding company which owns all the outstanding stock of Boston
Gas Company, has filed an application for permission to acquire common stock of Brockton Taunton Gas Company, a nonassociate gas
utility company, pursuant to a tender offer and by the exercise of an
option. The management of Brockton Taunton opposed the application, and extensive hearings were held. After the end of fiscal year,
the Commission granted the application subject to certain conditions

The table does not include securities issued and sold by subsidiaries
to their parent holding companies, debt securities maturing in less
than 10 years which were issued as temporary financing, portfolio
sales by system companies, or securities issued for assets or securities
of other companies. Transactions of this nature also require authorization by the Commission except, pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Act,
the issuance of notes having a maturity of less than 9 months where
the aggregate amount does not exceed 5 percent of the principal
amount and par value of the other securities then outstanding.
Competitive Bidding

Rule 50 under the Act requires that all proposed issuances or sales
of any securities of, or owned by, any system company be at
competitive bidding unless an exception from such requirement is
available under the terms of paragraphs (a) (1) to (a) (5), inclusive,
of the rule. Of the 31 issues of securities shown in the preceding table,
28 issues, aggregating $594 million, were offered for competitive
bidding pursuant to the requirements of Rule 50. The remaining three
issues, aggregating $65 million, were sold to the public or to existing
shareholders at prices and terms determined by the issuers or set by
negotiation with underwriters. These three issues consisted of: (1) a
nonunderwritten rights offering of $28 million of common stock by
General Public Utilities Corporation, a registered holding company,
to its shareholders; (2) a negotiated underwritten public offering of
$25 million of debentures, maturing March 1, 1982,by Duval Corporation, a nonutility subsidiary of United Gas Corporation, which is a
public-utility subsidiary of Pennzoil Company; and (3) a nonunderwritten rights offering of $12 million of common stock by Delmarva
Power & Light Company, a registered holding operating company, to
its shareholders and employees of its subsidiaries. With respect to the
General Public Utilities Corporation and Duval Corporation issues,
the Commission, pursuant to paragraph (a) (5) of Rule 50, granted
exceptions from the competitive bidding requirements." The Delmarva Power & Light Company issue was automatically exempt from
those requirements pursuant to paragraph (a) (1) of Rule 50.
During the period from May 7, 1941, the effective date of Rule 50,
to Jillle 30, 1967, a total of 969 issues of securities with an aggregate
value of $14,930 million have been sold at competitive bidding under
"'Paragraph
(a) (5) of Rule 50 provides for exceptions from the competitive
bidding requirements of the rule where the Commission finds such bidding is
not necessary or appropriate under the particular circumstances of the individual case. In GeneraZ Public Utilities Gorp., the exception was granted " .•. to
the extent such rule may be applicable to the proposed sale." Holding Company

the rule. These totals compare with 238 issues of securities with an
aggregate value of $2,636 million which have been sold pursuant to
orders granting exceptions under paragraph
(a) (5). Of the total
amount of securities sold pursuant to such orders, 133 issues with a
total value of $2,153 million were sold by the issuers and the balance
of 105 issues aggregating $483 million were portfolio sales. Of the 133
issues sold by the issuers, 71 were in amounts of from $1 to $5 million,
3 debt issues were in excess of $100 million each,22 and 2 stock issues
totaling $36 million were issued in fiscal 1966 to holders of convertible
debentures and employee stock options.
POLICY AS TO REFUNDABILITY OF DEBT ISSUES

In accordance with its long-standing policy under the Act, the
Commission has continued to require that all debt securities and preferred stocks sold by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries be fully refundable at the option of the issuer upon reasonable
notice and that any redemption premium be reasonable in amount.
Exceptions from this policy have been permitted only where clearly
warranted by the circumstances of a particular case.
The 32nd Annual Report, pages 82-84, contains a summary of the
results of an examination by the Commission's staff of all electric and
gas utility bond issues (including debentures) sold at competitive
bidding between May 14, 1957, and June 30,1966, by companies subject
to the Act as well as those not so subject. This study was extended to
include the fiscal year 1967.
During the period from May 14, 1957 to June 30, 1967, a total of
666 electric and gas utility debt issues, aggregating $16,005.4 million
principal amount, was offered at competitive bidding. These included
471 refundable issues totaling $9,497.5 million, and 195 nonrefundable
issues totaling $6,507.9 million. The latter issues were all nonrefundable for 5 years except one, which was nonrefundable for" years. The
refundable issues thus represented 70.7 percent of the total number of
issues and 59.3 percent of principal amount.
During fiscal year 1967, 75 debt issues were offered, aggregating
$2,234.5 million principal amount. They consisted of 37 refundable
issues totaling $915 million and 38 nonrefundable issues totaling
$1,319.5 million. The number of refundable issues thus represented 49.3
percent of the number of issues and 40.9 percent of principal amount.
The weighted average number of bids for fiscal 1967 was 4.41 on the
refundable issues and 4.16 on the nonrefundable issues, while the median number of bids was 4 both on the refundables and the nonrefund.. Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, a $860 million bond issue; United Gas
Corporation, a $116 million bond issue; and Pennzoil Company, a $135 million
note issue maturing in 18 months sold to underwriters.

ables." With respect to the success of the marketing of the debt issues,
an issue was considered to have been successfully marketed if at least 95
percent of the issue was sold at the syndicate price prior to termination
of the syndicate. On this basis, during fiscal 1967, 51 percent of the
refundable issues were successful, as against 47.4 percent of the nonrefundable issues.t! In terms of principal amount for fiscal 1967, 60.2
percent of the refundable issues were successful, as compared to 36.3
percent of the nonrefundable issues," Extension of the comparison to
include the aggregate principal amount of all issues which were sold
at the applicable syndicate prices up to the termination of the respective
syndicates, regardless of whether a particular issue met the definition
of a successful marketing, indicates that during fiscal year 1967, 81
percent of the combined principal amount of all the refundable issues
was sold, as compared with 76 percent of the nonrefundable issues. 26
.. The weighted average number of bids received during the period from May
14, 1957 to June 30, 1967, was 4.77 on the refundable issues and 4.27 on the nonrefundable issues. The median number of bids was 5 on the refundables and 4
on the nonrefundables .
.. For the period from May 14, 1957 to June 30, 1967, 62.8 percent of the
refundable issues and 58.5 percent of the nonrefundable issues were successful.
25 For
the period from May 14, 1957 to June 30, 1967, 59.4 percent of the
refundable issues were successful, as against 54.7 percent of the nonrefundable
ones.
.. For the period from May 14, 1957 to June 30, 1967, the applicable percentages
were 81 percent of the refundables and 79 percent of the nonrefundables.

vm

PARTICIPATION IN CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS
The Commission's role under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act,
which provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations in the U.S.
district courts, differs from that under the various other statutes which
it administers. The Commission does not initiate Chapter X proceedings or hold its own hearings, and it has no authority to determine any
of the issues in such proceedings. The Commission participates in proceedings under Chapter X in order to provide independent, expert assistance to the courts, the participants, and investors in a highly complex area of corporate law and finance. It pays special attention to the
interests of public security holders who may not otherwise be represented effectively.
Where the scheduled indebtedness of a debtor corporation exceeds
$3 million, Section 172 of Chapter X requires the judge, before approving any plan of reorganization, to submit it to the Commission for its
examination and report. If the indebtedness does not exceed $3 million,
the judge may, if he deems it advisable to do so, submit the plan to the
Commission before deciding whether to approve it. When the Commission files a report, copies or a summary must be sent to all security
holders and creditors when they are asked to vote on the plan. Th£J
Commission has no authority to veto or to require the adoption of a
plan of reorganization.
The Commission has not considered it necessary or appropriate to
participate in every Chapter X case. Apart from the excessive administrative burden, many of the cases involve only trade or bank creditors
and few public investors. The Commission seeks to participate principally in those proceedings in which a substantial public investor interest is involved. However, the Commission may also participate
because an unfair plan has been or is about to be proposed, public security holders are not represented adequately, the reorganization proceedings are being conducted in violation of important provisions of
the Act, the facts indicate that the Commission can perform a useful
service, or the judge requests the Commission's participation.
For purposes of carrying out its functions under Chapter X, the
Commission has divided the country into five geographic areas. The
New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle regional offices of the
Commission each have responsibility for one of these areas. Each of
128

THIRTY-THIRD

ANNUAL

REPORT

129

these offices has lawyers, accountants, and financial analysts who are
engaged actively in Chapter X cases in which the Commission has filed
its appearance. Supervision and review of the regional offices' Chapter
X work is the responsibility of the Division of Corporate Regulation
of the Commission, which, through its Branch of Reorganization, also
serves as a field officefor the fifth area.
SUMMARY OF ACI'IVITIES

In the :fiscalyear 1967, the Commission continued to maintain a high
level of activity under Chapter X. It entered its appearance in 16 new
proceedings involving companies with aggregate stated assets of approximately $200 million and aggregate indebtedness of approximately $131 million. These proceedings involved the rehabilitation of
corporations engaged in various businesses, including, among others,
plastics manufacturing, pre-fabricated homes, well logging services,
manufacture of geophysical instruments and aerospace equipment, real
estate and mortgage investments, operation of hospitals, bowling alleys, and an amusement park.
Including the new proceedings, the Commission was a party in a
total of 103 reorganization proceedings during the year. The stated
assets of the companies involved in these proceedings totaled approximately $777 million and their indebtedness approximately $661 million. The proceedings were scattered among district courts in 33 States
and the District of Columbia, as follows: 13 in New York, 9 in California, 7 in Florida, 6 in New Jersey, 5 each in Arizona and Texas, 4
each in Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania
and Washington, 2 each in Colorado, the District of Columbia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma,
South Dakota and West Virginia; and 1 each in Alabama, Arkansas,
Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Ohio,
Tennessee, Utah and Virginia.
During the year, 17 proceedings were closed. As of the end of the
year the Commission was a party in 86 reorganization proceedings.
JURISDICTIONAL, PROCEDURAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE MATI'ERS

In Chapter X proceedings in which it participates, the Commission
seeks to advise the courts with respect to application of the procedural
and substantive safeguards to which all parties are entitled. The Commission also attempts to secure judicial uniformity in the construction
of Chapter X and the procedures thereunder.
In Parknoood; 11W.,I answers to the Chapter X petitions were filed by
several secured creditors alleging that the petitions had not been filed in
] D. D.C., No. 39-66.

130

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

good faith, primarily because it was unreasonable to expect that a
plan of reorganization could be effected. The Commission supported
the good faith of the Chapter X petitions, taking the position that for
purposes of determining whether it is unreasonable to expect that a
plan of reorganization can be effected, the appraisal values of the
debtor's property should be based on assumed normal market conditions and should not be adjusted downward because of alleged "tight
money" conditions. The special master concluded that the petitions
were filed in good faith. After the close of the fiscal year, a hearing was
held before the judge on objections to the special master's report and
the matter is pending.
In Tower Oredit Oorp.,2 as previously reported," a second involuntary Chapter X petition, filed by three creditors, and supported by
the Commission, was approved by the court as having been filed in
good faith. There are pending appeals by the State court receiver and
by the debtor, and certain of its officersand creditors.' The State court
receiver contends on appeal, as he did in the district court, that the
Chapter X petition had not been filed in good faith, and should have
been dismissed, chiefly on the ground that the pending State court receivership proceeding would better subserve the interests of the debtor's creditors and stockholders.
In Bankers T1'U8t,5 the Commission moved to disqualify, as not disinterested under Section 158 of Chapter X, the law firms serving as
attorneys for the trustee because, prior to Chapter X, the firms had
served as attorneys for the debtor trusts and certain members of the
firms had served as trustees of the debtors, positions similar to those
of corporate directors. Although the court indicated that the Commission's motion was well founded, it denied the motion because it was
reluctant to disqualify persons who were already familiar with the
debtors' properties and problems, especially where no specific allegations of impropriety had been made. The Commission does not agree
with this interpretation of Section 158.
In Minneapolis Scientific Oontrols Oorp.,6 the Commission filed a
motion to restrain an attorney representing the management group
from soliciting public stockholders to sign powers of attorney granting
him authorization to appear on behalf of the stockholders in the proceedings and to vote on all plans of reorganization. The attorney
agreed to limit his representation to the management and, after the
other stockholders were notified that he had withdrawn his represen• M.D. Fla., No. 66-171-Bk-T.

tation of the solicited stockholders, the Commission withdrew its
motion.
In Westec Oorporation.' the Commission opposed the trustee's petition for authority to employ an investment firm both as financial
adviser and as exclusive agent for the trustee in the sale of any of the
debtor's assets because, under the agreement, the firm was to receive a
fixed fee as financial adviser and compensation as sales agent based on
a percentage of the proceeds received in any sale. The Commission took
the position that this arrangement might involve a conflict of interest,
since the firm's advice might be influenced by the fact that a sale would
bring it compensation as sales agent. After several hearings the court
authorized the employment of the firm only as financial adviser on the
basis of a monthly interim fee, with final compensation to 'be determined by the court, upon application, at the termination of the firm's
services.
In Webb &: Knapp, bw.,8 the Chemical Bank New York Trust Company, a creditor secured by a pledge of a large block of stock owned by
the debtor, petitioned the court for a modification of its earlier injunctive orders so as to permit the bank to foreclose on the stock. The
Commission took the position, with which the court agreed, that foreclosure should not be permitted, at least until the court had the benefit
of the trustee's recommendations as to the possibility of utilizing this
stock in connection with a plan of reorganization. The petition was
denied without prejudice.
In Indiana Business and Investment Trust,9 the court restrained a
mortgagee of real property of the debtor from exercising its rights to
the income from the mortgaged property under an assignment clause
in the mortgage. The court held that the trustee may utilize income
from the mortgaged property for operating and maintenance expenses
attributable to such property. It also held that the trustee, upon petition, could use the income for "general overhead expenses directly related to the servicing of all properties of the estate."
In Oanandaigua Enterprises Oorp.,lOthe Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit 11 granted the Commission's motion to dismiss an appeal by the first mortagagee from an order of the district court fixing
a date for the filing of plans of reorganization, after which date plans
may be filed only by leave of court. The Commission's motion pointed
out that the appellant had had abundant opportunity to submit a
plan, and that if stockholders and creditors were given an unlimited

right to file amendments and substitute plans at any time, they would

In Imperial '¥JO' Nationcil, bW.,12 the district court directed that
co-owners of a motel, in which the debtor held a 75 percent partnership
interest, account for the financial operations of the motel to the reorganization trustee. The co-owners contended that the reorganization
court lacked summary jurisdiction and that the trustee was required
to sue in a plenary action. The Commission contended that the district
court had summary jurisdiction over the entire complex of motels
which made up the debtor's business and, accordingly, over funds
derived from operation of the motels. The district court stated that the
accounting was a preliminary inquiry to determine whether the coowners held assets of the debtor and that whether the court would order
any turnover of such assets would be considered upon completion of the
accounting. The co-owners appealed but the court of appeals 18 granted
the Commission's motion to dismiss the appeal because the district
court's order was entered for the purpose of assisting it in determining its jurisdiction and not for the purpose of deciding the merits of
the accounting.
In Minneapolis Scientific Oontrols Oorp.,14 and in General United
Corporation; Inc.,15 the Commission took the position that stockholders of these companies, who had been defrauded in violation of
Section 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934:and Rule 10b-5
thereunder, had claims arising therefrom on the basis of which they
were entitled to participate as creditors in any plan of reorganization.
After the close of the fiscal year the referee in bankruptcy in
General United concluded that the Commission lacked standing to
present this issue, and the Commission is seeking review by the district
judge.
In Swan-Finch Oil Oorp.,xe the confirmed plan of reorganization
provided for full payment of creditor claims, but was silent as to interest accrued during the proceeding. The Commission took the position that creditors are entitled to such interest (1) if the estate is
solvent, or (2) where the claim is secured and the value of the security
exceeds the principal balance due on the claim. The court, agreeing
with the Commission, awarded interest to the secured creditor and
reserved decision on whether interest is to be paid to all other creditors
until it is determined whether the debtor is solvent.

the trustees with the reorganization court to restrain the New York
Stock Exchange and the Commission from delisting the debtor's common stock and to order the restoration of trading of the stock on the
Exchange. The Exchange had suspended trading in the debtor's stock
in 1958, and in 1959 the Exchange filed an application with the Commission, which is still pending, pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to strike the debtor's common stock
from listing and registration. It is the Commission's position that
a Chapter X court has no jurisdiction to enjoin an administrative proceeding for delisting and that the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over such matters, subject to statutory review by the court of
appeals.
In another matter involved in the same proceeding," the court, over
the objections of the Commission, approved the appointment of the
two Chapter X trustees as members of the board of directors of the
reorganized company and their election by the board as chairman and
vice-chairman, respectively. The Commission took the position that,
the trustees and their attorney, who must be disinterested, should not
be permitted to assume management or executive positions with the
reorganized company.
In Yale Empress System, Inc.,19 the district court denied a motion
of a secured creditor to reclaim a substantial number of truck trailers
and truck bodies. In reversing the district court,"? the court of appeals
held that the right of reclamation depends upon equitable considerations and not upon whether a security agreement is labeled a "conditional sales contract" or a "chattel mortgage." 21 The court of appeals
remanded the case to the district court to determine, in light of these
principles, whether the secured creditor was entitled to reclamation or,
in the alternative, to rental payments for the use of the trucks and
trailers during the reorganization."
TRUSTEE'S INVESTIGATION

A complete accounting for the stewardship of corporate affairs by
the prior management is a requisite under Chapter X. One of the
primary duties of the trustee is to make a thorough study of the debtor
to assure the discovery and collection of all assets of the estate, including claims against officers, directors, or controlling persons who may
have mismanaged the debtor's affairs. The staff of the Commission
often aids the trustee in his investigation.

As previously reported," the trustee in Oontinental Vending
Machine 00rp.24 filed a civil suit against the former management and
directors of the debtor, its accountants and others, seeking $41 million
in damages. He began taking depositions of the accountants and before
completion of the depositions a criminal indictment was returned
against three members of the accounting firm and others, charging
mail fraud and securities law violations based upon false statements
in the debtor's annual report and in reports filed with the Commission. The district court in which the indictments are pending 25
enjoined the trustee from taking civil depositions of those persons
who were already under indictment because the subject matter of the
civil examination was expected to cover matters related to the indictment. The court of appeals 26 reversed (2-1) the order of the district
court and the Supreme Court 27 has granted certiorari.
In Webb db Knapp, Inc.,28 the trustee was authorized to bring three
major lawsuits, one of them an action against the indenture trustee,
based on the latter's alleged breach of trust, to recover on behalf of
debenture holders the entire principal amount of debentures outstanding ($4,298,000). The Commission supported the trustee's petition
even though the proceeds of recovery would be paid to the debenture
holders rather than to the estate. 29
In Edward N. Siegler & 00.,30 the trustees, together with a Chicago,
TIlinois investment firm, brought a plenary suit against First National
Bank of Lincolnwood (Ill.) and 25 individuals, seeking a total of
$3,150,000 in compensatory and exemplary damages for losses from
allegedly fraudulent stock transactions. The reorganization court had
approved an agreement, as reported previously;" under which the
customers of the debtor received, in effect, full satisfaction of their
claims with funds contributed by the Midwest Stock Exchange and
Hartzmark & Co., a Cleveland, Ohio, broker-dealer firm which took
over the debtor's customer accounts. Any proceeds from the suit would
go to unsecured creditors, payment to whom was deferred in order to
permit full satisfaction of customer accounts.

REPORTS ON PLANS OF REORGANIZATION

Generally, the Commission files a formal advisory report only in a
case involving a substantial public investor interest and presenting
significant problems. When no such formal report is filed, the Commission may state its view briefly by letter, or authorize its counsel to
make an oral or written presentation to amplify the Commission's
views. During this fiscal year the Commission did not publish any
formal advisory reports; its views on seven plans involved in four
proceedings were presented orally at the hearings on approval of the
plans."
In TMT Trailer Fe7'1"J!,lno.,33 the Supreme Court granted the
petition for a writ of certiorari 34 filed by the stockholders protective
committee to review decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit which had affirmed orders of the district court confirming a
plan of reorganization from which the debtor's 7,000 stockholders were
excluded." In response to an order of the Supreme Court inviting the
United States to express its views, a memorandum was submitted on
behalf of the Commission supporting the petition. The principal
contentions of the Commission and the committee are: (1) that the
plan is objectionable in that it contemplates employment of the trustee
as president of the reorganized company; (2) that stockholders should
have been afforded a hearing on their contention that they have claims
against the debtor arising out of the sale of the debtor's stock to them
in violation of the Federal securities laws and are entitled to participate in any plan as creditors; and (3) that the plan is not fair in excluding stockholders because the district court's finding of insolvency
had been based on an inadequate record as to valuation, and the court,
without hearings, had allowed substantial, seriously contested, claims
almost in full.
InHydrocarbon Ohemicals, lno.,36 the plan of reorganization, which
the court confirmed, provided that the plan proponents together with
unsecured creditors who elected to receive new common stock of the
reorganized debtor in payment of their claims would receive 85 percent of the new common stock to be outstanding, and that the debtor's
public stockholders would receive 15 percent of the new stock. The
Commission did not object to the plan but proposed amendments to

include preemptive rights and representation on the initial board of
directors for present stockholders who would have a minority stock
equity in the reorganized company. The court adopted these
recommendations.
In Oceanside Properties, Inc.,37 the plan of reorganization was based
primarily upon the construction and sale of five condominium apartment buildings in the Hawaii area within a 30-month period. The
Commission supported the plan but urged that it should not be confirmed unless firm commitments were obtained for the interim and
long-term financing contemplated by the plan.
InAtlas Sewing Oeniers, Inc.,3B although an order had been entered
by the district court in July 1965 declaring the plan of reorganization
to have been substantially consummated pursuant to Section 229, the
new securities and cash required to be issued to creditors and stockholders under the plan were never issued. In April 1967, the district
court, after lengthy hearings, held that the plan proponent had not
fulfilled his contractual obligations to provide certain additional funds
under the plan and that a group of banks had gained a position of
dominion and control over the debtor's affairs, causing it to close down
its business except for the collection of several million dollars of
pledged accounts receivable. The district court appointed a receiver
for the debtor's assets and suggested that proceedings be instituted to
surcharge the banks and others. On appeal by the plan proponent and
the banks, the court of appeals," among other things, agreed with the
Commission that the jurisdiction of a Chapter X court continues over
a debtor corporation's affairs until the plan of reorganization has been
substantially consummated in fact and that, at least until such time,
persons entrusted with the handling of any debtor's assets act at their
peril without the approval of the district court."
ACTIVITffiS WITH REGARD TO ALLOWANCES

Every reorganization case ultimately presents the difficult problem
of determining the allowance of compensation to be paid to the various
parties for services rendered and for expenses incurred in the proceeding. The Commission, which under Section 242 of the Bankruptcy

Act may not receive any allowance for the services it renders, has
sought to assist the courts in assuring economy of administration and
in allocating compensation equitably on the basis of the claimants'
contributions to the administration of estates and the formulation
of plans. During the fiscal year, 197 applications for compensation
totaling about $6.9 million were reviewed.
In Hydrocarbon Ohemioaie, Inc.,41 17 applicants requested final
allowances aggregating $1,053,855. The Commission recommended
allowances of $343,648, and the court awarded $465,000. The court, in
accordance with the Commission's recommendation, denied a fee to
the debtor's attorney who had made a short sale of the debtor's stock
just prior to the inception of the Chapter XI proceeding and had
purchased shares of the debtor's stock to cover the short sale, just
after the Chapter XI petition was filed. The Commission urged denial
of an allowance both on equitable principles and on the ground that
Section 249 of Chapter X was applicable to securities transactions
during the superseded Chapter XI proceeding, since Section 328 of
Chapter XI, pursuant to which the Chapter X petition was filed,"
provides that the amended Chapter X petition shall "for all purposes
of Chapter X ... be deemed to have been originally filed under such
chapter." The court also adopted the Commission's recommendation
that two attorneys who had been retained by the debtor's attorney
during the Chapter XI proceeding should be denied a fee because their
retention had not been authorized as provided under General Order
44 of the Bankruptcy Act.43 In Oosmo Oapital, Inc.,44 the court granted
the Commission's objections and refused to award any fees or reimbursement of expenses to members of a stockholders' protective committee who had purchased shares of the debtor's stock, in violation of
Section 249, after they had solicited powers of attorney from stockholders.
In Imperial 'lIJO' National, Inc.,45 the debtor had paid a total of
$67,595 in fees to two law firms 6 days prior to filing a Chapter XI
petition. After an amended Chapter X petition was filed under Section
328, as reported previously," the Chapter X trustee moved, pursuant
to Section 60d, for examination by the court of the fees paid and a
recovery by the estate of the portion of the fees in excess of a reasonable
amount. The Commission, supporting the Chapter X trustee, recommended that amounts in excess of $4,000 should be returned to the

estate. The court, after the close of the fiscal year, ordered that the
firms refund to the estate all sums paid to them in connection with the
proceedings, except a nominal filing fee, and that the award of reasonable fees be determined and made at the conclusion of the Chapter X
proceeding.
In Bamkers Tru.st,47 the court, in its order awarding interim allowances to the trustee and trustee's counsel, stressed the need for accurate
daily time records so that in the future it could determine, among
other things, whether there had been an unnecessary duplication of
effort by the applicants." In Republic Aluminum 00.,49 the trustee
applied for a final allowance. The Commission advised the court that,
because of contradictory and apparently unreconcilable estimates of
the time spent by the trustee on services rendered in this and another
Chapter X proceeding in which he had concurrently served as trustee,
it was impossible to make an informed judgment as to the value of his
services in the pending case. The Commission recommended that the
trustee should be afforded an opportunity to clarify his time estimates
on the record before it recommended any allowance to him.
In Yuba Oonsolidated Industries, I'lW.,50 12 applicants requested
allowances totaling about $1,949,000 and the Commission recommended
a total of about $1,110,000. The awards made by the court aggregated
approximately $1,567,000. The court, among other things, disagreed
with the Commission's view that time spent by attorneys for committees in reading and reviewing pleadings and merely attending court
hearings was largely unproductive time, for which little, if any, compensation should be paid."
In Coast Investors, I'lW.,52the Commission recommended an allowance of $18,000 to counsel for a committee and the district court,
allowing $10,000, stated that a different standard for allowances in
Chapter X applies when, as in this case, the plan provides for an
orderly liquidation over a period of years, rather than a reorganization as a going concern. In its brief in support of counsel's petition
for leave to appeal, the Commission urged that the governing standard
for allowances is the same since Chapter X contemplates that a reorganization may take the form of a liquidation. The court of appeals
granted the petition and the case is pending."

In Anglo-American Properties, Inc.,54 the Commission, though not
participating in the Chapter X proceeding, filed a brief amicus curiae
in the court of appeals 55 in opposition to the motion of the appellant,
a secured creditor, to stay the hearings in the district court on applications for interim allowances on behalf of the trustee and his attorney,
pending a determination of its appeal in which it urged that the
trustee and his attorney were not disinterested. In a separate appeal
the same appellant contended that the Chapter X petition, which the
district court had approved, was not filed in good faith. In its brief,
the Commission argued that the trustee and his attorney were entitled
to an allowance for their services in the Chapter X proceeding even
if it were determined on appeal that they were not disinterested, provided that full disclosure of all the facts was made at the time of their
appointment, or if the appellant should succeed in his other appeal and
the Chapter X petition be dismissed for lack of good faith. The court
of appeals denied a stay and subsequently both appeals were settled.
The allowance of interim fees during the course of the proceeding
has continued to receive the 'attention of the courts. While Chapter X
does not expressly provide for interim or partial allowances, courts
have awarded interim fees to the trustee and his counsel in order to
alleviate any economic hardship to them which may result from postponing all payments of fees until the conclusion of the Chapter X
proceeding." The amounts awarded, however, have been generally
well below the possible amounts of any final allowances. They are considered to be partial payments on account and do not reflect or measure
the value of the services rendered to the date of the interim allowance.
Section 24'7 requires that the judge consider applications for allowances at a hearing, notice of which is to be given to creditors, stockholders, the Commission and other interested parties. At the suggestion
of the Commission, the courts 'have adopted a procedure in respect of
interim allowances which differs somewhat from that described in an
earlier annual report. 57 Under the present practice, notice is given of a
hearing at which the court is to establish a schedule for hearing applications for future interim allowances. At the conclusion of this hearing
a second notice is given to creditors and stockholders of hearings
scheduled on specified dates in the future at which the court will
consider applications for interim allowances and the maximum
amounts which may be a warded at such future hearings. In this manner
the requirements of the statute are met without an undue burden upon

INTERVENTION

IN CHAPTER

XI PROCEEDINGS

Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act provides a procedure by which
debtors can effect arrangements with respect to their unsecured debts
under court supervision. From time to time it appears that the proper
protection of public investors and the needs of the company for
rehabilitation require a more thoroughgoing reorganization than is
possible under the summary procedures of Chapter XI. The Commission or any other party in interest is authorized, under Section 328 of
Chapter XI, to make application to the court to dismiss the Chapter
XI proceeding unless the debtor's petition is amended to comply with
requirements of Chapter X, or a creditors' petition under Chapter X
is filed.
In Arlington Discount OO.,fi8 the debtor was engaged in the business
of purchasing, at a discount, second mortgages and installment land
contract receivables. It proposed an arrangement under Chapter XI
whereby the 400 holders of $1,194,000 of subordinated certificates of
indebtedness would receive 5 percent of their claims in cash at confirmation, 60 percent in noninterest-bearing notes and the balance in
preferred stock. The Commission's motion under Section 328 was
based on the need for an impartial investigation of management
activities and for a comprehensive reorganization under Chapter X,
including an adjustment of secured debt, rather than a simple composition of unsecured debts. The court granted the Commission's
motion and the debtor filed an amended Chapter X petition, which
the court approved.
In Embarcadero Ranchos, I'JUJ.,fi9 the Commission had filed a motion
under Section 328 in July 1962. Prior to the hearing on the motion the
Chapter XI receiver had negotiated a sale of the land owned by the
debtor and requested that the Commission withdraw its motion because
it appeared that the public investors, who held mortgages on the land,
might be paid in full from the proceeds of the sale. The Commission
agreed not to press its motion, pending consummation of the sale. The
sale was closed in October 1966, and the public investors were paid in
full including interest to date of payment. The Commission thereupon
withdrew its motion .

PART IX
SUPPORTING

ACTIVITIES

PUBLIC INFORMATION SERVICES
Dissemination of Infonnation

As the discussion in prior sections of this Report indicates, most
large corporations (except banks and insurance companies) in which
there is a substantial public investor interest have filed registration
statements or registration applications under the Securities Act or
the Securities Exchange Act with the Commission and are required to
file annual and other periodic reports. Widespread public dissemination of the financial and other data included in these documents is
essential if public investors generally are to benefit by the disclosure
requirements of the securities laws. This is accomplished in part by
distribution of the prospectus or offering circular in connection with
new offerings. Much of the data is also reprinted and receives general
circulation through the medium of securities manuals and other financial publications, thus becoming available to broker-dealer and investment adviser firms, trust departments and other financial institutions
and, through them, to public investors generally.
Various activities of the Commission also facilitate public dissemination of information filed as well as other information. Among these
is the issuance of a daily "News Digest" which contains (1) a resume of
each proposal for the public offering of securities for which a Securities Act registration statement is filed; (2) a list of issuers of securities traded over-the-counter which have filed registration statements
under the Securities Exchange Act; (3) a list of companies which have
filed interim reports disclosing significant corporate developments;
(4) a summary of all notices of filings of applications and declarations, and of all orders, decisions, rules and rule proposals issued by
the Commission; (5) announcements of the Commission's participation in corporate reorganization proceedings under Chapter X of the
Bankruptcy Act and of the filing of advisory reports of the Commission on the fairness and feasibility of reorganization plans; (6) a brief
report regarding actions of courts in litigation resulting from the
Commission's law enforcement program; and (7) a brief reference to
each statistical report issued by the Commission. During the year, the
News Digest included summary reports on the 1,637 registration statements filed with the Commission, 900 notices of filings, orders, decisions, rules and rule proposals issued by the Commission, 227 develop141

142

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

ments in litigation under its enforcement program., 13 releases on
corporate reorganization proceedings, and 78 statistical releases.
The News Digest is made immediately available to the press, and
it is also reprinted and distributed by the Government Printing
Office, on a subscription basis, to some 2,368 investors, securities
firms, practicing lawyers and others. In addition, the Commission
maintains mailing lists for the distribution of the full text of its
orders, decisions, ru1es and rule proposals.
er,
These informational activities are supplemented by public discussions from time to time of legal, accounting and other problems arising in the administration of the Federal securities laws. During the
year, members of the Commission and numerous staff officers made
speeches before various professional, business and other groups interested in the Federal securities laws and their administration
and
participated in panel discussions of like nature. Participation in these
discussions not only serves to keep attorneys, accountants, corporate
executives and others abreast of developments in the administration of
those laws, but it also is of considerable value to the Commission in
learning first-hand about the problems experienced by those who seek
to comply with those laws. In order to facilitate such compliance the
Commission also issues from time to time general interpretive releases
and policy statements explaining the operation of particular provisions
of the Federal securities laws and outlining policies and practices of
the Commission. An example of such a general interpretive statement
is the Commission's net capital release discussed at page 71.
Publications.-'In
addition to the daily News Digest, and releases
concerning Commission action under the Acts administered by it and
litigation involving securities violations, the Commission issues a number of other publications, including the following:
Weekly:
Weekly Trading Data on New York Exchanges: Round-lot and odd-lot
transactions effected on the New York and American Stock Exchanges
(information is also included in the Statistical Bulletin).
Monthly:

for Public Inspection

The many thousands of registration statements, applications, declarations and annual and other periodic reports filed with the Commission each year are available for public inspection at the Commission's
principal officein Washington, D.C. In addition, at each regional office
of the Commission there are available for inspection copies of prospectuses used in recent offerings of securities registered under the Securities Act; registration statements, recent annual reports and definitive proxy statements filed pursuant to the Exchange Act by companies
having their principal office in the particular region; broker-dealer
and investment adviser applications, amendments thereto, and brokerdealer financial reports originating in the region; and letters of notification under Regulation A filed in the region. Additional material is
available in the New York, Chicago and San Francisco regional offices.
Members of the public may purchase copies of material in the Commission's public files. Under the existing contract with a printing
company for the reproduction of such material, the cost is 9 cents per
page for pages not exceeding 8113" x 14" in size. The detailed price
schedule may be obtained from the Publications Unit of the Commission. (Release No. 34-8109.) A charge of $2 is imposed for each certification of a document by the Commission. Visitors to the Public Reference Room in Washington may make immediate reproductions of
material on coin-operated copiers. Similar machines are located in the
New York and Ohicago regional offices.
Each year many thousands of requests for copies of and information
from the public files of the Commission are received by the Public
Reference Section in Washington, D.C. During the 1967 fiscal year,
6,932 persons examined material on file in Washington and several

thousand others examined files in the New York and Chicago regional
offices. More than 15,593 searches were made for individuals requesting information and approximately 2,478 letters were written with
respect to information requested.
Implementation
of Public Information Act.-To
implement the
provisions of the Public Information Amendment to Section 3 of the
Administrative Procedure Act,l which became effective on July 4,1967,
the Commission amended its rule pertaining to records and information, 17 CFR 200.80.2 The rule specifies the categories of documentary
materials available to the public upon request at the Commission's
principal office, and the materials which are also available at regional
offices. It establishes a procedure to be followed in requesting records
or copies thereof, provides a method of administrative appeal from
the denial of access to any record, and provides for the imposition of
fees when more than one-half man-hour of work is performed by members of the Commission's staff to locate and make available records
requested.
All materials previously available for public inspection and copying
continue to be available under the new provisions. In addition, some
documents contained in Commission files previously considered nonpublic, certain materials developed for use by the Commission's staff,
including indexes of Commission decisions, and a current index as
specified in the statute and covering Commission adjudicatory opinions and orders issued after July 1, 1967, will now be available to
the public.
PERSONNEL
Organizational

AND FINANCIAL

MANAGEMENT

Changes

During fiscal year 1967, certain organizational changes were effected
in accordance with the Commission's policy of continuing review of
all its operations to assure maximum utilization of manpower and
the most efficient and economical operations possible.
In July 1966, a number of changes were effected in the Division
of Trading and Markets. The Office of Criminal Reference and the
Office of Proceedings, which performed similar functions, were consolidated; the Branch of Distribution and Stabilization was abolished;
and the three Branches of Enforcement were consolidated into two
Branches.
In December 1966, the Commission discontinued its Branch Office
in St. Paul, Minnesota. The investigative work previously done by
that office in the St. Paul-Minneapolis area was taken over by the
Chicago Regional Office. It is expected that this change will increase

the effectiveness of the Commission's work in that area. The elimination of three positions and related expenses will also result in an annual
savings of about $40,000, which will be applied to higher priority
activities.
In March 1967, a realignment of certain functions and staff in the
New York Regional Office, designed to strengthen its enforcement and
regulatory programs and activities, was effected. An additional Assistant Regional Administrator for enforcement was appointed to share
with the existing Assistant Regional Administrator for enforcement
primary responsibility for directing the enforcement activities of the
New York Office. At the same time, the Assistant Regional Administrator for regulation was given the additional responsibility of directing the work of the Branches of Small Issues and Interpretations.
Recruitment and Training Programs

In fiscal 1967, the Commission continued its efforts to recruit "quality" graduates to fill its entrance level positions. The Chairman sent
a personal letter to the deans of undergraduate and graduate schools
of business and of law schools explaining the Commission's staffing
needs and seeking their assistance in identifying outstanding students
interested in Federal employment. Campus visitations were arranged
and Commission recruiters from the Headquarters Office and the
various regional offices interviewed numerous students. The G8-9
entrance salary of $7,696 for recent graduates of law schools was found
to be competitive with salaries paid by most law firms. Competition
for graduates of business schools was much more severe and the Commission found that it could not meet the average salary of $10,000 offered by private industry to the superior applicant possessing a Master
of Business Administration degree.
The Commission continued during the year to supplement its on-thejob training of professional employees with more formalized training
sessions. The Division of Corporate Regulation conducted a 2-week
seminar on the Investment Company Act for personnel of the Division
as well as those regional office employees who are concerned with investment company matters. The lectures given during the seminar
covered matters involved in the performance of current staff duties
as well as various new and unusual types of investment companies
now coming to the fore, such as variable annuity life insurance companies, insurance "packages," swap funds, speculative funds, and dual
policy funds. The Division of Trading and Markets conducted an enforcement seminar designed to strengthen skills and increase knowledge in the enforcement aspects of the Commission's work, and the
Division of Corporation Finance sponsored a series of lectures by outside authorities on corporate mergers and acquisitions. These training

sessions were attended by employees of the sponsoring divisions, other
home office employees, and personnel from the regional offices.
An unusual experiment in legal education in the Federal service
conducted during the fiscal year was the SEC Staff Seminar on current problems in securities regulation. Selected staff attorneys participated in the seminar. As distinguished from the more narrow focus
of normal staff training, this seminar focused on some of the broad
policy problems facing the Commission.
In the summer of 1967 an unusual feature was introduced into the
Commission's training program for summer finance and law students.
Members of the Commission met with the interns in a session entitled
"At the Commission Table." The interns were given background material on certain major matters which had been considered by the
Commission and were afforded the opportunity to discuss these matters with the Commissioners. Following the session with the Commissioners, knowledgeable staff members discussed at greater length
the problems which were raised with the Commission.
In fiscal 1967, the Commission tripled the amount of funds allocated
for training conducted outside the agency. A total of 133 employees
were able to attend courses given by the Civil Service Commission,
and by various schools, universities and professional associations.
The Commission participated in the educational program developed
jointly by the Bureau of the Budget and the Civil Service Commission
to provide intensive training in modern analytic methods required to
implement a planning-programing-budgeting
system within the Commission. One employee attended Carnegie Institute of Technology for
a year and another attended a 3-week residence seminar at the University of Virginia.
In anticipation of greater utilization of the Commission's IBM 360
computer, selected employees have been sent to the IBM Education
Center to acquire basic knowledge in computer capabilities. Also, in
cooperation with IBM, field investigators have been exposed to the
use of computers in brokerage operations in anticipation that most
of the large brokerage houses will become fully automated as to their
"back office" procedures in the foreseeable future. In addition, a
planned training program geared to the specific needs of individual
employees directly engaged in computer work is now in operation. It
takes into account the development of new and more advanced hardware or more sophisticated systems which offer more opportunities
for computerization of Commission processes.
Merit Awards to Employees

As part of its Twelfth Annual Service and Merit Awards Ceremony
held in October 1966, the Commission gave "Distinguished Service

148

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Awards" to Messrs. Philip A. Loomis, Jr., General Counsel; Thomas
B. Hart, Administrator of the Chicago Regional Office; and William
E. Becker, Chief Management Analyst. Nineteen employees were given
30-year pins for SEC service. Within-grade salary increases in recognition of high quality performance were granted to 81 employees.
These awards are authorized by the Salary Reform Act of 1962. I n
addition, cash awards totaling $9,920 were presented to 65 employees
for superior performance and 5 employees were awarded a total of
$245 for adopted suggestions.
On the occasion of his 25th anniversary with the Commission, Chairman Manuel I?. Cohen received a special length of service award
which displayed official medallions of the five Presidents-Rooser,elt,
Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson-under whom he has
served.
Employee Benefit Programs

I n May 1966, coincident with the Commission's move into the new
building, the SEC Recreation and Welfare Association commenced
the operation in the tmo sub-basements of a parking garage for 90
automobiles under a 10-year lease negotiated with the owners of the
building. The Commission actively encouraged the Association to
entkr into this venture in order to assure that members of the staff
would have parking facilities at reasonable rates. As another employee
service, a t no cost to the Commission, the Association also sponsors
accident, income protection, and dependent life insurance programs
a t low-cost group rates.
