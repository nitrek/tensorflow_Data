In the Matter of
the Registration Statement of

ORDER REGARDING THE
SCHEDULED HEARING

SAND INTERNATIONAL, INC.
13 Stusa Street, Lvov Region
Zvirka, Ukraine, 8000

On July 27, 2016, in an order instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 8(d) of
the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities and Exchange Commission ordered a hearing on
August 16, 2016, at the Commission’s Headquarters, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C.
20549. The OIP alleges that Sand International, Inc., is a revoked Nevada corporation that
claims to be headquartered in Zvirka, Ukraine. OIP at 1. The hearing is to determine whether
Respondent failed to respond to a subpoena issued by Commission staff and if so, whether
Respondent’s failure to respond to the subpoena constitutes a failure to cooperate with, refusal
to permit, and obstruction of the staff’s examination, so as to warrant issuance of a stop order
suspending the effectiveness of Respondent’s registration statement.
Respondent is ordered to answer the allegations within ten days of service of the OIP.
OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). On August 2, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed
notice that Respondent had been personally served with the OIP on August 1, 2016. Service
was on Respondent’s registered agent for service of process listed on the Nevada Secretary of
State’s website: Incorp Services, Inc., 3773 Howard Hughes Parkway, Suite 500S, Las
Vegas, Nevada 89169-6014 (last searched August 8, 2016). See 15 U.S.C. § 77h(d), (e), (f);
Nev. Rev. Stat. §§ 78.090(1), .750; Canarelli v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, 265 P.3d 673,
675 n.2 (Nev. 2011).
The Division, located in Denver, Colorado, has told my office that based on its
experience in dealing with the Respondent, it does not expect Sand International to participate
in the hearing.

Ruling
In these circumstances, I ORDER that the hearing begin at 11:30 a.m. EDT, on August
16, 2016. Respondent and the Division may participate in person in Washington, D.C., or by
videoconference from the Division’s office at 1961 Stout Street, Suite 1700, Denver,
Colorado 80294. If Respondent plans to participate in the hearing at either location or is
unable to participate from either location, it should contact my office by emailing alj@sec.gov
or calling (202) 551-6030 by no later than August 12.
At the hearing the Division should be prepared to prove the allegations in the OIP. At
the close of the hearing, I will issue a briefing schedule and direct the filing of exhibits with
the Office of the Secretary.
