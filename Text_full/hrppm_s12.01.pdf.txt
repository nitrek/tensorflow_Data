PURPOSE
1:01

The purpose of the Corporate Human Resource Strategy is to encourage
and support the development of an innovative and inclusive workforce
which enables the organization to realize the goals and priorities of
Government. The strategy will guide departments in the civil service of
Prince Edward Island to attract and retain people with talent and
commitment to providing quality programs and services to the citizens of
Prince Edward Island.

1:02

The goals and strategies will promote the renewal and rejuvenation of
human resources in the civil service and the sustainability of quality
services and programs within the context of changing needs and
conditions.

Agency
•
Prince Edward Island Liquor Control Commission
•
Prince Edward Island Museum and Heritage
Foundation

While this strategy does not specifically apply to other crown corporations
listed in Schedule “B” and reporting entities listed schedules “C” and “D”,
the spirit and intent of the strategy should serve as a guideline for those
corporations in developing their own internal strategies.

PRINCIPLES
3:01

The corporate approach to human resource planning consists of six
commitments endorsed by Deputy Ministers and approved by the Minister
responsible for the Public Service Commission of PEI. The Government
of Prince Edward Island is committed to:
a)

effectively retaining and recruiting qualified individuals based on

Sub-Section 2.01

5.

b)

becoming a learning organization and creating continuous learning
opportunities for its employees;

c)

providing a positive working environment where employees can
exercise their freedom to act in support of government’s goals;

d)

ensuring employees are well informed about government goals and
receive regular feedback on how their work contributes to the
achievement of government’s goals;

e)

recognizing and rewarding employees based on their contributions
to government’s goals;

f)

ensuring that human resource planning is a strategic component of
the organization’s business planning;

DEFINITIONS
4:01

Renewal means ensuring that employees have the skills to respond to the
changing role of government and the way work is done.

4:02

Rejuvenation means planning ahead to ensure that there will always be a
future generation of skilled employees in the civil service of PEI.

VALUES
5:01

The Civil Service is comprised of 10 government departments responsible
for providing leadership in public policy and governance for the
government of the day. Leading our human resources is an integral
component to realizing Government goals. In doing so, this government
values the following:
a)

Integrity - Openness and honesty in all interactions

b)

Innovation - Support failures with learning and successes with
recognition

Sub-Section 2.01

c)

Respect - Keep others informed, value diversity and listen with
empathy

d)

Trust - Confidentiality, accept feedback, offer assistance

e)

Accountability - Take ownership of organizational decisions and
accept responsibility.

POLICY
6.01

The Senior Management Team identified corporate goals to be the
cornerstone of an effective human resource plan for the civil service. The
goals revolve around the need for quality public service; the leadership
preferred; the value placed on learning as an organization; the
motivation and flexibility of the workplace; the value placed on
employees’ contributions to government’s goals; and accountability at all
levels of government for planning its human resources.
(a)

To improve recruitment and retention strategies for the civil
service of Prince Edward Island - To ensure the organization has
the knowledge, skills and abilities to accomplish current and future
business plan goals and sustain quality services and programs.
This will become a priority for all leaders in government.

(b)

To improve leadership and learning opportunities to adapt and
transform the organization to meet the changing needs - To
become an attractive employer, the civil service of Prince Edward
Island is striving to be more flexible, knowledge intensive and
learning based. Reaching these goals requires nothing short of a
new way of organizing, managing and supporting people. To face
the rapid organizational and technological change and steady upskilling, this requires anticipating the learning needs not only of
knowledge workers, but of all employees in the organization.

(c)

To improve workplace wellbeing - Recognizing that the delivery of
sustainable quality services is largely dependent on a healthy
skilled workforce, employee wellbeing will be a major priority. The
civil service will promote a culture of wellness that values personal
responsibility, positive personal health practices, safe and positive
workplaces, ongoing education and respect for the contributions
employees make to the services provided to Islanders.

Sub-Section 2.01
Corporate Human Resource
Planning

Date

Page
011 December 2002

4 of 6

(d)

To improve alignment of employees’ goals to department and
government goals - There is a renewed commitment to
performance management and development in government
departments in order to deliver on desired business outcomes.
Recognizing the contribution that employees make toward realizing
these goals is imperative and considered a major priority.

(e)

To improve employee commitment to the organization - Improving
public confidence must involve improving the confidence of
employees. The employees of the civil service are dedicated
individuals and they need to know that their work is valued by the
people they serve. Being recognized and rewarded for
contributions is a key strategy to ensuring retention of the brightest
and the best in the civil service.

(f)

To improve alignment of HR planning to business planning Several factors are placing increasing pressures on the system to
maintain access, quality and client satisfaction. These factors
include increased demand for new and existing services; rising
costs; a declining supply of knowledge workers and specialized
workers and an on-going recruitment and retention challenge.
To ensure the organization is committed to planning for its human
resources of the future, sustainability of quality services will be
addressed through proactive human resource planning linked to
business planning in the civil service.

This policy applies to departments and agencies under the jurisdiction of
the Civil Service Act.

POLICY
3.01

While the Senior Management Team will assist the P.E.I. Public Service
Commission in developing a Corporate Human Resource Strategy for
government, each Department and Agency is expected to develop and
implement a Departmental Human Resource Plan, outlining what human
resource strategies and activities are required to meet its vision, goals and
objectives.

3.02

Ideally, each Department would start with a strategic plan and from that,
identify the operational human resource impacts that result from the
strategic plan.

3.03

The development of an effective Human Resource Plan requires the
active participation of a number of key players. The senior departmental
management, middle management, human resource manager, line staff ,
and P.E.I. Public Service Commission all have a role to play in the
development and implementation of an effective plan.

Introduction
Human Resource Planning is critical to the success of any organization. While it is often
acknowledged that people are the most critical resource of any organization, there
needs to be a systematic approach to Human Resource Planning to ensure that we

This template is a guide to assist departments in developing and implementing an
annual Human Resource Planning Process to ensure that they can meet their current
and future human resource needs.

I.

II.

Workforce Profile
In order to plan for the future, an organization needs to have a thorough
understanding of its current complement of staff. On a regular basis, an
organization should complete a demographic analysis, focussing on such issues
as: age of employees by job code descriptor, years of service by job code
descriptor, actual and anticipated attrition rates, education and training of
employees, gender of staff within job codes, employment equity representation,
and health status of employees.

Demographic data to assist in Human Resource Planning is available from
sources such as the Peoplesoft Human Resource Management Information
System, the Payroll System, and the Pension System.
1.

Demographic Reports
The following reports, available through the Peoplesoft Human Resource
Information System and the Pension Payroll and Ariel System, may be used to

provide data on an annual basis, and also to identify the development of trends,
through year to year comparisons. Graphing of the following information will
assist in forecasting future activity. For comparison purposes, it is recommended
that the reports be run for consistent time frames.
The identification of trends can lead to the development of appropriate strategies
to respond to the trends. If no trends are identified, then no action would be
required. The first full fiscal year that Peoplesoft reports are available is 20002001.
a)

Position Status Report / Vacant Position Report - Develop Workforce Manage Positions - Reports - AI Position Status
AI Vacant Position Report
This report should be run for a current date prior to beginning your HR Planning
activities. It is important to remember that this report is for a point in time only
and should be reviewed on a periodic basis.
The Position Status / Vacant position reports are useful to give an overview of
the organization . Reviewing this information will give an indication of positions
vacant and needing to be staffed. It will identify individuals who may be affected
by any HR plans that may require reorganization. Based on the
recommendations of the HR plan this report identifies available positions and
what activities if any need to be requested ( i.e., position creations, FTE
changes, classification reviews)

Sub-Section 2.02

may be identified through analysis of the Employee Turnover Analysis Report. If
the numbers of terminations are high and therefore decreasing your end
employee count, this may identify that the department may be facing possible
staff shortages, particularly if over a period the hires are very low. Another issue
may be if both hires and termination rates are high the department may be facing
retention issues. When reviewing this report it is important to also identify any
policies which may have had an effect on the numbers ( e.g., hiring freeze /
workforce adjustment) Note: the end count is simply a headcount as of the end
date of the report, it is not a sum of all columns.
Identify the job code descriptor where it seems apparent that there are turnover
issues.

Service Commission to obtain data related to pension eligibility.
Limited historical data may be obtained on the average age, pensionable and
average retirement age of Plan Members. This information is available only on
the total Civil Service Superannuation Fund and is not available on a employer or
departmental basis. The average age and pension eligibility of employees when
they retire can be helpful to give an overall sense as to when employees retire. If
a department has numbers of employees approaching the average age and
pension eligibility, they should be considering a plan to ensure that they will be
able to replace the employees when they do retire. Caution must be used that

Report
This report needs to be reviewed only if the department has health and safety
issues. If there are no issues and you have not had WCB claims this step can
be skipped.
The OHS summary report gives an overview of all incidents and accidents
reported for a period of time. This report should be run for the same period for
each planning year. This will allow for comparisons in coming years.
It is recommended that the first page of the report be used to determine the
extend of OHS issues by reviewing the number of accidents/ incidents and
number of days work lost. The remainder of the report gives a summary of the
types of jobs affected by the accidents, what type of accident, type of injury, etc.
A review of this information may help identify if there are safety concerns and if it
is believed that training is necessary, what type of training.

h)

Employee Leave Summary Report - ( from Payroll System )
This report provides data on all employees on the salary payroll (including
classified, long term casual, and contract). This report should be reviewed to
identify if there are any issues related to sick or special leave usage by
Departmental staff. This report provides average leave usage per full time
equivalent (FTE) for the overall Department, by Division and Section, as well as
providing the government average usage for comparative purposes. The report
for the full fiscal year is often the best for comparative analysis. The report for

Sub-Section 2.02

Date

the fiscal year is usually available by May.
If leave usage for the Department, Division and Section are lower than the
government averages, you may not require further analysis. If the averages are
higher than the government average, a further analysis should be completed to
see what the issues are leading to the higher usage. Higher average usage may
not necessarily mean there is a problem, as some individuals may require more
leave due to long term health or other issues and this will increase the overall
average.
If issues are identified, the following information should be provided:

Diversity
To provide quality services to a diverse Island population, we require a workforce
representative of the population that we serve. Within the public service, there
has traditionally been under-representation of the following four groups: persons
with disabilities, aboriginals, visible minorities, and women in management and
leadership and women and men in non-traditional occupations.
To understand the diversity that exists within your departmental workforce,
departments are expected to complete workforce surveys. Details on these
surveys will be available after the approval of a provincial diversity policy.
Based upon the results of the survey, departments are to develop diversity
objectives and action plans in accordance with the nature of your department’s
work and strategic direction, under the following headings:

Performance Development Planning is a critical component of Human Resource
Planning. It ties individual employee work plans and learning plans into the
vision and direction of the department. It is important that departments utilize
Performance Development Planning to ensure that employees receive feedback
on their work performance, identify career development interests, plan training
and development opportunities, and identify organizational improvements.

Salary and benefit costs for additional positions
Advertising costs for job postings
Relocation expenses, when required
Training of new employees
Costs of computers, software, connections, telephone, etc.

To ensure that HR Planning efforts run smoothly, costs associated with any of
the above need to be factored into departmental budgets. It is recommended
that Departments relate their Human Resource Planning process to their budget
process to ensure the required funds are allocated.
Please refer to Andrea Soberg H R Planning material in the reference manual
developed for HR Managers by the Commission.

V.

Department Human Resource Plan Summary
With the identification of issues, strategies will need to be developed to address
the issues. Departments should check the Corporate HR Strategy to ensure
that any relevant corporate strategies are factored into their Departmental Plan.
In the development of their Departmental HR Plan, Departments may identify
issues requiring a corporate strategy. The need for corporate strategies is to be
discussed with the Public Service Commission.

In the development of HR Plans, Departments are required to ensure that any
gaps and/or surpluses between their inventory and forecast of required human
resources are identified.
Strategies will also be grouped into short, medium, and long term strategies in an
effort to sequence them to ensure the needs are addressed in a timely basis.
HR Plans should be developed on an annual basis. Once developed, the plan
needs to be monitored and evaluated to ensure the desired progress is being
made.
The following format may be used to summarize the issues and strategies
required within your Departmental Human Resource Plan:

Evaluation
Strategies and action plans need to be stated in measurable terms and have
specific time frames so that progress may be monitored and measured. On an
annual basis, Departmental HR Plans need to be evaluated based upon
progress made.

VII.

Communication Strategy
Any significant changes affecting the employees of an organization need to be
communicated to the employees, and there is a need to involve the employees
in the planning of the changes.
Depending upon the nature of the changes, there may be a need for legislative
change, involvement of the Public Service Commission, Union of Public Sector
Employees, Excluded Group, Treasury Board, Executive Council, and / or other
groups.
From the beginning, it is important to consider a communication strategy so that
the affected employees and the various stakeholders are informed and involved,
so that the initiative has the best opportunity for success. The Communications
Division should be consulted on any significant issues.

Pre-Interview (screening)
(a)

(b)

A selection board is established normally consisting of a staffing
officer from the Commission (usually the Chair of the Board), the
supervisor of the position being filled, and another individual who
has good knowledge of the responsibilities of the position being
filled. The selection board should reflect diversity amongst its
members as much as possible.
(i)

It is the responsibility of the department to ensure that they
have appropriate membership on the selection board.

(ii)

Selection board members are to have training and
experience in the staffing process within government.

(iii)

Board members should be individuals who are respected in
their field, are objective, recognize the importance of the
staffing process and are committed to following a fair
process.

(iv)

Generally position incumbents would not be involved on
selection boards to fill the position they are leaving. The
reason for this is that the individual might not be objective in
selecting a successor for the position.

(v)

Selection Board members are required to comply with the
terms of the Selection Board Declaration (Attachment 7:01).
As members of a selection board, individuals are bound by
the relevant legislation, Collective Agreement, and policies
related to staffing.

The Selection Board performs the following duties during the
screening session.
(i)

Reviews, signs, and dates Selection Board Declaration
forms.

(ii)

Conducts a position analysis on the position.
C

A position analysis involves a discussion on the
responsibilities of the position and enables each of

Sub-Section 3:01
Recruitment, Selection and
Appointment

Date

Page
01 October 2002

4 of 26

the board members to have a common
understanding of the position. A form (Attachment
7:02) is available for the Board to use.
C

(iii)

Establishes rating criteria
C

(iv)

(vi)

The rating criteria must reflect the skills, abilities and
knowledge required to perform the job responsibilities
of the position to a satisfactory level. Information
from the position analysis will be helpful in
developing the rating criteria.

Develops questions/tests to be used as part of the
interview/selection process.
C

(v)

If a position analysis has been completed recently on
an identical position, it may suffice to review the
document to ensure that it is still relevant, and that
the board is familiar with the position.

It is critical that any questions used as a written
exercise or during an interview relate to the position
and be used to evaluate the applicant’s
qualifications, relative ability, knowledge and skills to
perform the job.

Screens applications for eligibility and qualifications.
C

In order for an applicant to be eligible for an inservice competition they must meet the requirements
as outlined in Section 17 (2) of the Civil Service Act.

C

In order for an applicant to be qualified, they must
possess the education and experience requirement
as outlined in the advertisement. Only those
applicants will be interviewed and/or tested.

Sets up interview/testing times
C

Once the applications are screened to determine
who is qualified and eligible for the competition,
those who are to be interviewed and/or tested are

Sub-Section 3:01
Recruitment, Selection and
Appointment

Date

Page
01 October 2002

5 of 26

contacted to arrange a time for the interview and/or
test. Applicants should be given as much lead time
as possible so that they may adequately prepare for
the process.
C

6:04

Those applicants who are not qualified are also to be
advised of the outcome of the screening process.
While normally applicants are advised in writing,
sometimes it is advisable for the supervisor to
discuss the outcome of the screening with the
applicants particularly if they are from the department
where the position exists.

Selection
(a)

The selection board conducts interviews and/or testing with the
qualified applicants.

(b)

The selection board scores and ranks the applicants.

(c)

References are completed usually by the staffing officer.

.
(i)

Information obtained in a reference is to relate only to the
ability and suitability of the applicant to perform in the
position applied for.

(ii)

Reference checks are to conform to the applicable Human
Rights legislation.

(iii)

For in-service competitions, a minimum of one reference is
to be completed on, at least, the top applicant (and more if
the top applicants are relatively equal.) This reference is
normally with their current supervisor.

(iv)

For open competitions, a minimum of two references will be
completed on, at least, the top three applicants (and more
if applicants are relatively equal.)

(v)

References are usually with people who have direct
knowledge of an applicant’s previous employment

Sub-Section 3:01
Recruitment, Selection and
Appointment

performance.
(vi)

Standardized reference forms can be used to facilitate
consistency in referencing (forms may be obtained at the
PEI Public Service Commission).

(vii)

If concerns are expressed in a reference, generally
additional references are conducted to determine if there is
a pattern to the concerns, and to rule out the possibility of a
biased reference.
C

6:05

The concerns are to be reviewed with the selection
board to determine how serious the issues are, and
the impact they would have on the applicant’s ability
and suitability to perform in the position. The board
may determine that the identified concern(s) do not
warrant changing the ranking of applicants, if the
issue has little impact on the applicant’s ability and
suitability to perform in the position. On the other
hand, if the concern(s) are serious, they could impact
on the ranking of applicants. If the concern is
sufficiently serious, the applicant could be deemed to
have failed the reference and not be considered
further for the position.

(viii)

If a reference was recently completed for a similar position,
that reference could be used, rather than completing
another reference.

(ix)

Certain positions within the organization require criminal
record checks to be conducted. These are conducted on the
successful applicant only. The need for a criminal record
check is identified in the job ad and this is reconfirmed in the
job interview.

Post Interview (Appointment)
(a)

Once the evaluation and referencing of applicants is complete, an
employment list is created, listing the applicants who have passed
the competition in order of merit.

Sub-Section 3:01
Recruitment, Selection and
Appointment

6:06

Date

Page
01 October 2002

7 of 26

(b)

For an in-service competition, the top candidate, based on merit,
is appointed to the position.

(c)

In relation to open competitions, one of the top three candidates
based on merit, will be appointed to the position after consultation
with the employer.

(d)

An offer letter is drafted to the successful applicant. This letter is
to contain the classification and pay rate being offered, who to
report to, and if there is a time limit on when the applicant must
confirm their acceptance of the position.

(e)

Unsuccessful applicants are notified of the results of the
competition.

(f)

Post-board interviews are available to applicants. A post-board
interview provides an applicant with feedback on the selection
board’s assessment of the applicant in relation to the said position.
This information can be used for professional development so that
the applicant can improve for further competitions.

Unsolicited Applications (Paper Copy)
(a)

The Public Service Commission maintains a manual file system
containing unsolicited employment applications. These applications
maybe accessed when employers have open competitions or need
casuals or temporaries and there are no internal applicants.

(b)

These unsolicited applications are kept in a general file, unless the
applicant is qualified in a specific classification which has a high
demand.

(c)

The following is the list of specific classifications maintained in the
file system:
(i)
(ii)

Date

This policy applies to all employees of the classified division who are
appointed to temporary positions within or outside of their home
departments.

PRINCIPLES
3.01

Employers should make every effort to allow employees to experience
temporary assignment opportunities. However, there maybe some
circumstances where this cannot occur due to operational requirements.
Not only are temporary assignments a learning experience for
employees, but they also enrich the home work environment when
employees return with new skills gained while away.

Among other terms, these agreements ensure a continuation of benefits
for employees, and a guarantee of employment upon completion of the
assignment.

DEFINITIONS
4.01

Temporary Assignment Agreement is used when the employer remains
the same (e.g. from one government department to another government
department).

Secondment Assignment Agreement is used when there are two
employers involved (e.g. government department and a health region).

4.03

Home Department/Region means where the employee’s permanent
position exists.

temporary position, the length of the temporary assignment, the benefits
related to the assignment, and employment guarantee for the employee at
the end of the temporary assignment.

5.03

The normal % pay increase to higher positions is 7%. If an employee is
seconded to a participating employer of the CSSF, pension will be based
on actual salary. If the employee is seconded to an employer outside the
CSSF, pension will be based on substantive salary. Questions should be
referred to the Employee Benefits Section of th PSC.

5.04

If the two employers involved in the agreement do not share the same
benefit plan, the home employer generally keeps the employee on their
payroll, billing the host employer for salary and benefits on a quarterly
basis.

5.05

Employees will use vacation and other paid leaves where they are earned
unless otherwise agreed upon. Benefit billing may be at a different rate
where this does not occur.

PURPOSE
1.01

2.

Date

This policy applies to all temporary assignments which are advertised
internally (within Departments) or in-service (across all government).

PRINCIPLES
3.01

There is to be consistency in the staffing process used by Departments
and the PEI Public Service Commission.

3.02

There needs to be accountability for all staffing activity to ensure that
decisions are based upon merit and that fairness guides the process.

3.03

Staff involved in the staffing process must be provided with training and
knowledge about the staffing process so that they may conduct their work
in a professional manner.

3.04

Confidentiality is to be ensured in all staffing activities; applicants have a
right to confidentiality within competitions.

POLICY
4.01

Temporary Assignments may be staffed by Departments, however, the
process needs to be one that is approved by the P.E.I. Public Service
Commission. As indicated in this policy, there are situations where the
P.E.I. Public Service Commission shall be involved.

4.02

Excluded Positions
(a)
In staffing Temporary Assignments of excluded positions, the
Department may choose to advertise within the Department, inservice, or open to the public. Generally, positions would be
advertised internally so that existing employees have the first
chance at new opportunities. Under Section 10 (3) of the Civil
Service Act, departments may hire for a maximum of six months.

Sub-Section 3.06
Departmental Responsibility in
Staffing Temporary Assignments

Date

Page
05 December 2002

2 of 7

The P.E.I. Public Service Commission may appoint for longer
periods of time.

4.03

(b)

The eligibility for temporary in-service excluded competitions is as
outlined in Section 17 of the Civil Service Act.

(c)

For temporary assignments advertised in-service or open, a staffing
officer from the P.E.I. Public Service Commission shall be involved
in setting up the competition to ensure that the screening of
applicants and the selection process are done according to P.E.I.
Public Service Commission standards.

(d)

Departmental staff who are involved in the selection process are to
have received training in the staffing process. If training and
staffing experience are lacking, an experienced departmental HR
Manager or staffing officer must be involved in the selection
process.

Unionized Positions
The process for the staffing of unionized Temporary Assignments is
outlined in Article 39 of the UPSE Collective Agreement.
(a)

“The Employing Authority shall post the temporary assignment
within the Department, Agency or in-service for a period of seven
calendar days. The posting shall indicate that applications are
restricted to classified employees and relief and temporary
employees with a minimum of one year of continuous service
following an appointment through competition by the Commission.”

(b)

In filling the temporary assignment, the applications shall be
processed in the following order:

(c)

(i)

Applications from employees within the Department or
Agency shall be fully processed;

(ii)

If the temporary assignment is not filled by the process
outlined in section (a), the Employing Authority may then
consider applications from employees in other Departments
or Agencies.

If it is believed that there may not be qualified eligible applicants

Sub-Section 3.06
Departmental Responsibility in
Staffing Temporary Assignments

Date

Page
05 December 2002

3 of 7

within the department, then the position may be advertised inservice. If there are no qualified applicants from the internal
competition, the position may be filled from an existing employment
list that was created by the P.E.I. Public Service Commission from
an open competition, or the position may be advertised externally.
With in-service or open competitions, the Commission shall be
involved in the screening of the competition. All appointments for
in-service or open competitions shall be made by the P.E.I. Public
Service Commission.
4.04

Departments have full authority to staff temporary assignments that are
advertised only within their Department. For these competitions, the
departmental HR Manager or the supervisor of the position being
advertised is to chair the selection board and is responsible to ensure that
the staffing process is carried out according to this policy. If there are any
concerns, a staffing officer from the P.E.I. Public Service Commission is
available for consultation. Attached is a checklist that, in point form,
identifies the steps of the process for competitions for temporary
positions. (Attachment 5.01)

4.05

(a)

After positions have been advertised and the competition has
closed, all applications will be screened to ensure that they meet
the qualifications as stipulated in the job ad and that the applicant
is eligible for the competition. For unionized positions, to be
eligible the applicant must be “a classified employee or a relief or
temporary employee with a minimum of one year of continuous
service following an appointment through competition by the P.E.I.
Public Service Commission.

(b)

Employees are expected to complete the full length of a temporary
assignment unless applying for a permanent position.

(a)

The selection board must confirm the eligibility of all applicants to
ensure that they meet the eligibility requirements, as outlined in
section 4.03 (a) above. The departmental HR office will need to be
contacted to obtain information on applicants to confirm eligibility
for competitions.

(b)

For government wide competitions where an applicant is from
another department, the staffing officer will establish the eligibility

4.06

Sub-Section 3.06
Departmental Responsibility in
Staffing Temporary Assignments

Date

Page
05 December 2002

4 of 7

of the applicant. Also, if the applicant is working in a temporary
assignment, the selection board is responsible to establish the
duration of the temporary assignment (employees working in a
temporary assignment are not to be considered for another
temporary assignment until they have completed the first one.)
(c)

It is crucial that this step is followed to avoid the possibility of
appointing an applicant who is not eligible. Grievances may be
filed in all competitions for temporary and permanent positions.

4.07

The selection process normally consists of an interview, testing (if
required), and reference checking. Once the applications are screened to
determine who is qualified and eligible for the competition, those who are
to be interviewed and/or tested, are contacted to arrange a time for the
interview and/or test. Applicants should be given as much lead time as
possible so that they may adequately prepare for the process. Those
applicants who are not qualified or eligible for the competition are also to
be advised of the outcome of the screening process. With internal
applicants, tact and sensitivity is to be used as these applicants continue
to be employees of the department. While normally applicants are
advised in writing, sometimes it is advisable for the supervisor to discuss
the outcome of the screening with the applicants.

4.08

When using interviews or tests to evaluate applicants, it is critical that the
questions relate to the position and be used to evaluate the applicants
qualifications, relative ability, knowledge and skills to perform in the
temporary assignment. These factors are more commonly referred to as
the merit principle.

4.09

Once interviewing and testing (if used) are completed, the top applicants
are to be referenced. With internal applicants, only one reference is
required. However, more should be completed if there are any concerns
with the work performance of the applicant being referenced. Reference
forms from the P.E.I. Public Service Commission are recommended so
that the questions asked conform with Human Rights legislation and relate
to the duties of the position. The selection process, including referencing,
is subject to the grievance process.

4.10

When the evaluation of applicants is complete, the Deputy of the
department is provided with the results of the competition. For any
internal competitions, the name of the top candidate, based upon the
merit principle, is provided to the Deputy for authorization to hire. The

Sub-Section 3.06

Deputy (or Minister, as per Departmental practice) signs their
authorization to hire the recommended candidate.
4.11

4.12

(a)

If departments take responsibility for the competition, they are
responsible to ensure that applicants are advised of the outcome of
the competition. The successful candidate in the competition is to
be advised in writing of the offer of employment. It is
recommended, for consistent purposes, that departments use the
offer letter format used by the P.E.I. Public Service Commission.

(b)

Generally, it is advisable to confirm that the successful candidate
has accepted the position before advising the unsuccessful
applicants.

(a)

Departments are responsible to ensure that they establish a filing
system for all competitions of temporary assignments for which
they take responsibility. Competitions that have been advertised
in-service or open are to be returned to the P.E.I. Public Service
Commission for retention. If the P.E.I. Public Service Commission
is involved in the full process of filling a temporary assignment, they
will maintain a file, so the Department would not be required to do
so.

(b)

All documents associated with competitions are to be retained in
the competition file. The entire file is to be retained for a minimum
of eighteen months, and employment lists (lists of all applicants in a
competition and the results of their evaluation), the signed
notification of results form, and a copy of the job ad are to be kept
an additional six years.

4.13

Periodic audits may be conducted by the P.E.I.Public Service Commission
to ensure compliance with the required staffing process.

4.14

For consistency purposes, it is recommended that the staffing forms
developed by the P.E.I. Public Service Commission be used by
Departments. Forms may be accessed from the P.E.I. Public Service
Commission at any time.

4.15

(a)

There is a requirement that statistics be maintained on staffing
activity. Departments are required to maintain the following
statistics on any staffing activity for which they take responsibility:

Sub-Section 3.06

the number of competitions, number of applicants, number of
interviews, and number of appointments.
(b)

5.

An annual report shall be submitted by each Department to the
P.E.I. Public Service Commission, by April 30 each year. This
report shall provide the above information on Departmental staffing
activity for the previous fiscal year.

PURPOSE
1.01

2.

Date

The recall provision is intended to provide government with a stable
seasonal workforce, while providing some security of tenure to seasonal
employees. Vacant, seasonal positions, that are not filled by the recall
process, should be filled through a fair hiring process. The purpose of this
policy is to provide information on the recall / seasonal hiring process.

APPLICATION
2.01

The recall process applies to seasonal employees who have met the
following criteria;
a) They have worked a minimum of ten (10) weeks in a recall job in the
previous season and have completed their full term of employment.
b) They have received a satisfactory performance evaluation for that job.
c) That same job must be available.
d) They must have been referred through the Seasonal Hiring Centre for
the original seasonal appointment, unless the incumbent has worked in
that position prior to the inception of the SHC - April 6, 1999.

3.

POLICY (Recall Process)
3.01

A department or agency must contact eligible employees three to four
weeks in advance of the job’s starting date. Vacancies will occur when
previous seasonal employees are no longer interested, previous work
performance was not acceptable, or where new seasonal positions arise.

3.02

If the employee worked greater than ten (>10) weeks in each of two recall
jobs, they must choose the job for which they wish to be recalled.

3.03

If an employee quits their job, or is terminated for just cause, they are
ineligible for recall but can reapply to the SHC in the following season.

3.04

Supervisors must complete a performance evaluation on each employee
and submit it to the departmental human resource section.

POLICY(Seasonal Hiring Process)

3.05

3.06

4.

The SHC is a registration service for persons seeking seasonal
employment with the Province of Prince Edward Island. The SHC is
operated by the PEI Public Service Commission. Temporary seasonal
positions are generally those filled by departments needing extra staff to
address certain peak workloads, usually connected to a season of the
year. Typically, these positions do not require professional or technical
skills to perform the duties.
The SHC publishes an advertisement calling for applications on an annual
basis. Application forms are submitted to the SHC where they are
maintained in a database for one year. Applications are assessed to
identify potential areas of employment and a new application form must
be submitted each year.

PROCEDURES (Seasonal Hiring)
4.01

The department/agency identifies a vacancy and determines whether
someone may be eligible for that job based on recall. If no one is eligible
then a requisition is forwarded to the SHC. The requisition should be
submitted to the SHC two weeks in advance of the job’s start date.

4.02

Staff at the centre search the database to identify three suitable
candidates based upon ability, geographic location and economic need.

4.03

Need is determined based on information provided by the applicant.
Further referencing may be necessary in order to confirm the information.

4.04

The candidates are then referred to the departmental/agency’s human
resource manager.

4.05

The department/agency makes their selection and notifies the candidate
and the SHC.

4.06

If the department/agency conducted the interviews, then they are also
responsible for notifying the unsuccessful candidates.

4.07

If an employee is fired (‘let go”) from their job, the department must
complete an evaluation form and notify the SHC.

INTRODUCTION
1.01

The Civil Service Superannuation Act (CSSA) provides post-retirement
pension benefits to employees of the Province of PEI and other
participating employers.

1.02

The Provincial Treasurer is the minister responsible for the CSSA. The
Minister has delegated the responsibility of the day to day administration
of the CSSA to the Employee Benefits Section of the Public Service
Commission.

1.03

The CSSA provides for the establishment of the Civil Service
Superannuation Fund (CSSF) into which all contributions are to be made
and out of which all pension benefits are to be paid.

APPLICATION

Contract employees (if participation is provided for in the contract)

PRINCIPLES
3.01

The CSSA provides for a pension benefit equal to 2% of a member’s
salary ( average of the three years of highest salary ) for each year of
pensionable service. The 2% benefit is comprised of :
- Life-time Benefit
- Temporary Bridge Benefit

3.02

1.3 % (*)
0.7 %
2.0 %

* The life-time benefit is the full 2% for that portion of pensionable
earnings in excess of the YMPE. (Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings)
as set out by the Canada Pension Plan.
It is important to note that the benefits paid from the CSSF are integrated

Sub- Section 4.03
Pension

Date

Page

with those paid by the Canada Pension Plan. Initially, the two plans were
integrated so that the total normal pension benefits provided by both
Plans would be equivalent to the total pension benefit provided prior to the
introduction of the CPP.

4.

3.03

The CSSF provides a temporary Bridge Benefit which is paid from date of
retirement until age 65, the date at which a person is eligible for an
unreduced CPP pension. The Life-time Benefit plus the Bridge Benefit will
be roughly equal to the Life-Time Benefit plus the unreduced CPP Benefit
that you can draw at age 65.

3.04

All members are required to make contributions to the CSSF and member
contributions are matched by the employer. The required contribution rate
is set out in section 7 of the CSSA.

This applies to those employees outlined in Article 2.02 of the Collective
Agreement but also has some application to all employees within the Civil
Service.

POLICY
3.01

General ( Article 23 of the Collective Agreement)
(a)

3.02

Entitlement
(a)

3.03

Sick leave is provided to enable employees to be absent during
periods of illness as well as for medical and health examinations or
treatments without suffering financial loss of their regular salary.
Any employee found to be abusing sick leave may be subject to
disciplinary action (See 3.11 for guidance regarding Absenteeism).

Full-time employees earn sick leave at the rate of 9.375 hours for
each 162.5 hours of work or paid leave. The maximum number of
hours an employee can accumulate is 1575. Employees with a
maximum accumulation shall continue to earn credits which may
be used for any illness occurring within the current fiscal year
without affecting their maximum accumulation.

Granting of Leave
(a)

An employee who is absent due to illness must notify their
supervisor as soon as possible. The employee must complete a
leave form outlining the nature of his/her illness and certifying their
inability to perform their duties. If an employee does not wish to
disclose the nature of his/her illness on the sick leave application
the Employing Authority may accept a separate written statement
as to the nature of the illness. The Employing Authority has the
right to be kept informed of the employee’s condition and a

Section 4.04
Sick Leave

prognosis regarding their anticipated return to work date.

3.04

(b)

A Physician’s statement is required for an illness exceeding five (5)
consecutive days/shifts or when the employee has been granted
ten (10) days/shifts on their own certification. Notwithstanding this,
the employer may request certification regardless of the length of
leave if circumstances warrant.

(c)

An employee must submit a leave form no later than ten (10)
calender days from the beginning of the absence. If he/she does
not provide a leave form they will not be paid for the leave of
absence unless there were extenuating circumstances which will
be considered by the Employing Authority

When Benefits are not Paid
(a)

Sick leave credits will not be provided when an employee is:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

3.05

receiving statutory holiday pay;
on suspension without pay; and
on leave without pay (with the exception of Injury on Duty
Article 19.08).

Sick Leave Advances
(a)

Classified employees may be provided advancement of sick leave
credits to a maximum of 15 days.

(b)

In order to qualify for a sick leave advance, the employee must:
(i)
(ii)

(c)

be under a medical doctor’s care; and
show that sick leave credits have not been previously
misused.

The Employing Authority should review the following when
considering a request for advancement of sick leave;
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

employee’s leave history;
is the employee having difficulty repaying previous
advances; and
is the illness likely to become a long term disability?

Section 4.04

3.06

(d)

The denial of advancement of sick leave credits to an employee is
not subject to the grievance process.

(e)

An employee who is terminated for reasons other than layoff,
permanent disability, or death must repay the Employer for all
outstanding advanced sick leave credits.

Bridging of Sick Leave
An employee who is terminated and is rehired within twelve months shall
be credited the sick leave credits they had at the time of termination.

3.07

Medical Examinations
(a)

3.08

This provision can be helpful where the employer is unable to get
sufficient medical information on which to base its decision
regarding the employee or in a case where the employee may be
denying the existence of a medical problem and therefore is not
obtaining appropriate advice or treatment.

Disabled Employee Options
(a)

If, as a result of a medical examination the employee is found to be
physically or mentally disabled from performing the functions of the
position he/she occupies, the employee may request an
accommodation pursuant to Article 40.
C

if a reasonable accommodation of the disability is not
available, the employee will be placed on sick leave until
sick leave credits are exhausted or the employee is able to
return to work, whichever occurs first, or

C

if the employee is unable to return to work or be
accommodated by the date sick leave credits are exhausted,
the employee can request to be placed on a leave of
absence without pay in accordance with Article 24.09(b) or

C

if the employee is unable to return to work or be
accommodated at the end of the leave of absence, the
employee will be subject to the layoff provisions of Article 36.

Addiction Treatment (See Section 8.06 - Employee Assistance Program)
Pursuant to Article 23.16 where an employee’s job performance is
unsatisfactory and is considered by the Employing Authority to be due to
the use of alcohol or other drugs and where the employee concerned
voluntarily elects or is directed to undertake an approved rehabilitation
program, the employee may be granted sick leave with pay in accordance
with the Collective Agreement and the Civil Service Act & Regulations
respecting Drug Abuse.

3.10

Duty to Accommodate (Article 40)
The area of disability and accommodation is an extremely complex and
dynamic one. In any case of employee disability the departmental HR
Manager should be consulted at a very early stage. Depending on the
circumstances, there may be a need to confer with the PEI Public Service
Commission and others in order to ensure that the employer’s duty to
accommodate a disabled employee is discharged.

3.11

Absenteeism
(a)

The management of innocent absenteeism is really a matter of
performance management. While the issues relating to
absenteeism are unique, the employer response in cases of
significant absenteeism is non-disciplinary and is provided in the
context of the desire for improved performance.

(b)

As an element of performance, it is clearly appropriate to speak
with employees regarding their absenteeism in the context of
performance development.

(c)

The absences requiring close monitoring include sick leave, injury
on duty leave, and special leave related to family illness. For cases
where the employee does not appear to have an on-going
disability, the employer should determine whether anything at work
is causing or contributing to the absences. The employee should
be asked about this and given an opportunity to indicate whether
anything at work or elsewhere in their life is causing them
difficulties. A sudden increase in sick and special leave usage may
be an indicator of the onset of a disability such as substance abuse

Section 4.04
Sick Leave

Date

or of problems in the employee’s personal life.
(d)

Employees are not obligated to divulge information relating to their
personal lives but they do have an obligation to actively deal with
any barriers to satisfactory work performance.

S

(e)

3.12

If it appears appropriate, or you sense an underlying
problem that the employee will not speak with you about,
discuss E.A.P. with the employee. (See Section 8.06)

General principles for Leave Management:
C

monitor section, department and civil service leave usage;

C

raise matter with employee as soon as issue appears;

C

ensure clarity and verification of all leave requests and
supporting information;

C

make periodic contact with employee during lengthy
absence; and

C

E.A.P. referral where appropriate.

(f)

To be successful at leave management, the employer must
approach the issue from the dual concerns of the employee’s wellbeing and the work unit’s productivity and efficiency. While these
concerns may seem to be to some degree in conflict, the employer
needs to understand that neither of these is an absolute and that
the task is to strike an appropriate balance between the two.

(g)

The most critical question in attempting to strike this balance is
whether the employee suffers from a disability which in turn gives
rise to the employer’s duty to accommodate.

Medical Information
(a)

Generally, the employer will seek medical information or opinion in
respect of an employee when:
C

the employee is requesting a benefit; or

Section 4.04
Sick Leave

Date

C

(b)

3.13

Page
2 October 2002

6 of 7

fitness to return to work following a lengthy absence is in
question.

When the medical certification is sought for purposes of
adjudicating an entitlement to a benefit, what is really being
requested is proof of illness. The employer is entitled to enough
information to adjudicate the request. This may include, in
appropriate cases, the date the physician saw the employee,
nature of illness, types of treatment recommended, dates of
absence due to illness and prognosis for improved attendance in
future.

The Stress “Diagnosis”
In recent years, more and more sick leave certificates have been
submitted stating the nature of illness to be stress. The employer is not
obliged, without more information, to accept this as the basis for granting
leave. Stress is not a medical diagnosis. Additional information is
required to verify that the employee is experiencing physical or
psychological symptoms which are severe enough to warrant the
employee being on leave from work.

3.14

Fitness for Work and Duty to Accommodate
(a)

In cases where an employee has been out of the workplace for an
extensive period due to illness or injury, the employer has a duty to
ensure that the employee is fit to resume their duties prior to
allowing the employee to return to work.

(b)

Where the employer is trying to verify the employee’s fitness to
return to work or where a continuing disability gives rise to the
employer’s duty to accommodate the employee, perhaps with
alternate work, the employee is responsible for communicating
their needs and for providing relevant information including medical
opinion to assist in the search for accommodation.

(c)

The employer is entitled to medical information respecting the
following:
C

explanation of any limitations the employee has which are
pertinent to the duties of the employee’s position, an
alternate position under consideration, or work in general

Section 4.04
Sick Leave

Date

Page

7 of 7

(e.g., can only work part days);

(d)

C

any types of work that are not recommended for the
employee;

C

any treatment the employee may be having either in terms
of its possible effect on the employee’s ability to do the work
or the need for absence from work to take treatment.

C

any adaptations to the workplace which may be required to
accommodate the employee; and

C

the prognosis for the employee’s future attendance and level
of recovery.

There is no formula for determining when the threshold has been
crossed into excessive absenteeism. Each case must be
examined on its particular circumstances and actively managed
with a view to returning the employee to regular attendance as
soon as reasonably possible.

The casual division consists of employees of the following descriptions
holding positions which are not permanent:
(a)

“contract employee” being an employee engaged by means of a
contract authorized by a department head or deputy head, for
temporary employment for a fixed term. Contract employees shall
not perform the jobs of employees covered by the Collective

to carry out the provisions of legislation respecting conciliation or
who provides advice with respect thereto to the department head;
a solicitor;
a contract employee;
a student employee;
an employee who exercises managerial functions or who is
employed in a confidential capacity in relation to labour relations.

3.12

The employees listed in 3.11, a - g, are called “excluded” employees.
Excluded employees do not have access to collective bargaining as a
mechanism for the determination of their terms and conditions of
employment.

3.13

The terms and conditions of employment for excluded employees are
determined through a consultation process where representatives from
the excluded group meet with/consult with representatives appointed by
the employer.

3.14

Employees who fall under subsection (g) of 3.11 are excluded because of
the conflict which exists between their employment duties and their
interests as members of the bargaining unit. The interests of neither the
employer nor the bargaining unit can be served when such employees are
members of the bargaining unit.

3.15

To be excluded pursuant to subsection (g), this conflict must be
demonstrable. Evidence of such a conflict exists where:
(a)

The employee makes effective recommendations regarding
policies or programs which directly impact upon the utilization or
deployment of employees. (Effective recommendations are ones
which can be shown to be regularly acted upon.)

(b)

The employee has direct supervisory responsibility for a unit of
subordinate employees. The supervisory elements which are
relevant include, for example, scheduling, performance
assessment, allocation of work and overtime, and imposition of
discipline. To be excluded, the employee must have independent
power to exercise these supervisory functions without reference to
a superior.

(c)

The employee is primarily engaged in personnel administration. To
be excluded, an employee must be regularly involved in the
administration of the collective agreement, the Civil Service Act and
regulations, personnel policies and/or employee entitlements.

(d)

The employee is required to participate in labour relations on behalf
of the employer. Labour relations in this sense includes collective
bargaining, grievance handling (informal grievance process) and
dispute resolution. An employee who is regularly required to
handle confidential or sensitive information relating to labour
relations of the employer may also be excluded.

3.16

To be excluded from the bargaining unit, the employee must have more
than incidental involvement in one or more of the itemized areas of
conflict.

3.17

To assist in determining whether an employee should be excluded under
subsection 3.10 (g), a Checklist (Attachment 4.01) has been prepared
which focuses on the employee’s actual duties. A completed Checklist
will provide a good picture of the work being done which, in turn, will help
determine whether or not an employee should be excluded from the
bargaining unit.

Hours of Work

Date

3 of 7

(a)

Employees are expected to be regular and punctual in attendance.
Employees unable to arrive at work on time must report the reason
for such lateness to their supervisor. If an employee has difficulty
arriving for work on time supervisors may wish to discuss their
hours of work to assist them in rectifying the problem. Performance
issues such as this should be dealt with during the Performance
Development process.

(b)

It is the responsibility of the employee to be punctual and, when
absent, to provide adequate and proper notice of absence to the
supervisor or manager with a reasonable or justifiable explanation
for the absence. Failure to provide notice justifies the imposition of
discipline even where it is established the absence is justified.
When the absence is not reasonable or justifiable, the discipline
imposed will be more severe. Time lost due to lateness must be
made up by the employee.

(c)

If an employee is persistently late, the supervisor may also elect to
deduct the employee’s pay. Deductions may occur in the following
manner:
•
•
•

3.06

and
for every additional half-hour of lateness or fraction thereof,
one additional half-hour’s pay.

Absence Without Leave
Employees absent without approved leave for ten consecutive working
days shall be deemed to have resigned their position. The resignation will
be effective the first day of the absence. Employees who satisfy the Chief

FLEXIBLE HOURS GUIDELINES
UPSE Collective Agreement:
According to Article 9.06(a) of the Collective Agreement, non-shift employees may
request a flexible daily work schedule and where operational requirements permit,
the Employing Authority shall endeavor to approve the request and it shall not be
unreasonably denied.
Article 9.06(b), states upon concurrence, the employee may complete the average
weekly hours of work in a period other than 5 full days, providing that over a period
of 14 calendar days, the employee works an average of 37.5 hours per week as per
the hours of work code.
Article 9.06(c) states that variations in the employee’s daily hours of work may
occur as a result of staggered starting and finishing times, or alteration of the time
taken as a lunch break. The lunch break for an employee will not be less than ½
hour and not more than 1 and ½ hours.
Article 9.06(d) states that an employee wanting to establish a flexible hour schedule
must submit the request to the Employing Authority, and receive approval. Any such
approval shall be for an initial trial period of 3 months. After that, the arrangement
can be extended indefinitely provided the Employing Authority and employee are in
mutual agreement. Extensions can be denied or terminated dependent upon
operational requirements.
Article 9.06(e) says that all requests and responses shall be in writing.

Flexible Hour Options
Flexible Hours within 7.5 Hour Day
The hours of operation for government offices is 8:30 - 5:00 (winter hours). Deviation
from this schedule is permitted as described above in Article 9.06 (a). In September
of each year,Human Resources will send out a reminder asking employees who wish
to work flexible hours to submit their request to their supervisor in writing. Once the
request is approved, the supervisor will send it to HR for the personnel file.

Compressed Work Week
As stated above in Article 9.06(b), employees can work a flexible weekly or biweekly
schedule.
•

Any approved work schedule must provide for at least 75 hours of work or paid
leave within each biweekly time frame

•

A schedule must be submitted for the three month period. It will outline the
schedule that the employee will be working within a biweekly time frame.

•

When there is a statutory holiday, the employee will indicate how he/she will
accommodate this in the schedule. For example, a biweekly period with one
statutory holiday must include 67.5 hours of work or vacation leave. If there
are two statutory holidays, it must include 60 hours of work or vacation leave.
Human Resources will need the schedule in advance for leave purposes.

•

Employees who work a compressed work week will take sick leave according to
the set schedule. That is, if an illness occurs on a scheduled 8 hour day, the
employee requests eight hours of sick leave. Conversely, if it occurs on
his/her day off, no sick leave is required.

•

Vacation leave will be determined in the same fashion as sick leave.

Civil servants earn the public's trust by consistent delivery of high quality
service. To do this, employees must dispatch their duties with integrity. The
performance of the employee's official duties must not be compromised by
private or personal interests. The overriding interest to be served is always
the public interest.

1.04

These guidelines are concerned with conflict of interest issues. Employees
must act in accordance with this code as well as other laws (e.g. Criminal
Code of Canada; Civil Service Act and Regulations, the Human Rights Act),

in the civil service;

2.03

Is advanced or enhanced because of the employee's position
with the government.

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

Q.

1.

Why are these guidelines coming out now?

A.

For several years, the Auditor General has noted in the annual report the
absence of a government wide policy to address ethical matters, particularly
conflict of interest issues. Most other provincial governments have had a policy
in place for some time.
Government recognizes that the rules governing conflict of interest must be
written down, circulated and explained to all those concerned if ethical
standards are to be applied in a consistent manner.

Q. 2.

Why don't these guidelines apply to all employees of the Civil Service?

A.

The only exception “to all employees of the Civil Service” is relief and temporary
employees with less than six months continuous service. The exception was
made as it is administratively difficult to include such casual division employees.

Q. 3.

What happens if I am in a conflict of interest?

A.

If you are aware that you are, or potentially are, in a conflict of interest, it is your
duty to disclose the situation to your Deputy Head. The Deputy Head can direct
you to avoid or withdraw from the activity which is creating the conflict of
interest. Alternatively, in an appropriate case, the Deputy Head can direct you
to divest yourself of an asset in order to eliminate the conflict of interest.

Q. 4.

What should I do if I'm not sure whether I'm in a conflict of interest?

A.

If you think you could be in a conflict of interest you must seek clarification from
your Deputy Head.

Q. 5.

If I wish to become involved with a political party, is this a conflict of
interest?

Sub-Section 5.03
Conflict of Interest

Date

Page
01 October 2002

9 of 10

A.

In certain cases, involvement in party politics can be a conflict of interest.
However, this issue is not covered in the guidelines because it is already
addressed in detail in the Civil Service Act and Regulations.

Q. 6.

What do I do if I'm presented with a small gift in appreciation for giving a
presentation?

A.

Normally, this would not be a conflict of interest and you may accept the gift.
However, if the gift is of more than nominal value or if it appears to be designed
to influence your judgement , you should immediately advise your Deputy Head.
A decision will be made whether it is proper to accept the gift.

Q. 7.

What if a non-profit organization asks me to assist them in their funding
request to government?

A.

Under the guidelines, you may or may not be in a conflict of interest depending
on the role you take on with the organization. The more prominent a role you
play, the more likely it is that the situation would constitute a conflict of interest.
Before taking on any role in this regard, you should discuss the matter with your
Deputy Head or the Deputy's delegate.

Q. 8.

Although I am a full-time government employee, I've started doing some
contract work in my spare time. Am I obliged to let my department know
this?

A.

The guidelines detail a number of factors to be considered when deciding
whether other employment constitutes a conflict of interest with your
government employment. If you think you might be in a conflict, you would be
advised to seek clarification from your Deputy Head.

Q. 9.

If I work for government on a part-time basis, is it a conflict of interest for
me to do similar work part-time for another employer?

A.

The guidelines regarding outside employment apply to both full-time and parttime employees. Accordingly, the same factors that are referred to in #8 above
must be reviewed before a determination can be made that a conflict of interest
does or does not exist.

Q. 10. What should I do if another employee is in a conflict of interest and that
employee doesn't tell anyone about it?

Sub-Section 5.03
Conflict of Interest

A.

Date

Page
01 October 2002

10 of 10

Since even one employee being in a conflict of interest can call into question the
honesty and integrity of the entire civil service, you would be expected to report
another employee's conflict. This should be done confidentially to a person in
authority in your department.

Q. 11. Where do I go if I have other questions about how these guidelines apply
to me?
A.

The responsibility for administration of the guidelines in your Department rests
with the Deputy Head. A Deputy Head who is unable to answer your questions
can seek assistance from the CEO of the Public Service Commission.

General Administration

Leave of Absence3
•

If you are on an approved leave of absence with pay, all benefits may be continued for a
maximum of 24 months following the month in which leave commences. The cost
sharing premium remains the same as when an active employee.

•

If you are on an approved leave of absence without pay, all benefits with the exception of
Long Term Disability Insurance, may be continued for a maximum of 24 months and
Long Term Disability Insurance for a maximum of 3 months following the month in
which the leave commences. The cost sharing of premium remains the same as when an
active employee except the cost sharing provisions shall not apply to employees who,
while on leave, are employed with another employer or self-employed.

•

In the case of a period of approved educational leave, benefits are based upon actual
salary. During a period of Deferred Salary Leave, your benefits are based upon your
actual salary earned during both the year of the leave and the years prior to the leave.

C

Maternity Leave - If you are on maternity leave, all benefits may continue for six months
following the month in which you leave commences. The cost sharing of premium
remains the same as when an active employee.

C

If an employee is terminated and files a Grievance and the employer wishes to have
coverage continued, Life AD&D, Health, Dental and Travel coverage’s can continue.
Long Term Disability cannot continue through the grievance period, however, if the
matter is settled in favor of the employee, the LTD would be reinstated retroactively. If
an employee suffers as disability during the grievance period, coverage will be provided
by the underwriter as if no interruption of coverage had taken place.

Taken from Johnson’s handbook.

As of April 1, 2003
Administration Issues:
•
•
•

•

•

An employee can only receive five years maximum of deemed service for pensionable
years under all deferred salary, LOA plans..
Part-time and full-time employees can participate in this plan.
Participants in this deferral plan will not receive credit for the year that the Leave of
Absence was taken in that the employee will not receive any step increases during that
year nor accrue hours for purposes of sick/vacation leave or severance/retirement pay.
An employee participating in the Plan shall be eligible upon return to duty for any
increase in salary and benefits that would have been received had the one (1) year leave
of absence not been taken.
The Participant must sign an Application and Agreement for the Deferred Salary Plan,
which will be kept with the Employee Benefits section of the PEI Public Service
Commission.

The following stipulations are taken from Schedule B of the Collective Agreement for the PEI
Union of Public Sector Employees:
•

•
•
•

An employee must make a written application to his/her Deputy Head on or before
January 31, requesting permission to participate in the Plan; however, the deadline of

forwarded to the employees by April 1 in the fiscal year the original request is made.
Approval of individual requests to participate in the Plan shall rest solely with the
Employing Authority.
With the approval of the Employing Authority, an employee may select some alternative
method of deferring other than that specified in Schedule B of the Collective Agreement.

For an employee on leave: when there is a mass salary increase the deferred salary override
amount is wiped out and the new salary is re-established. These need to be checked so that the
override is reinstated.

Pension Issues:
•
•

Superannuation deductions are to be continued at the rates prescribed by the Civil
Service Superannuation Act.
Deductions will be based on the salary paid to the employee during the period of the
Deferred Salary Plan under Section 1 (of the Schedule B of the Collective Agreement for
the PEI Union of Public Sector Employees). CSSF members who are full-time
employees may opt to pay on 100% salary.

Temporary Reduction in Hours

Definition:

A plan where a permanent employee may voluntarily reduce his/her work hours

reduced work year (i.e. work 10 months and take 2 months off without pay).
To allow permanent employees to voluntarily reduce their hours of work to
accommodate lifestyle demands and interests.

i. Plan Rules and Administration
•

The application will be subject to the approval of the employing authority.

•

The Temporary Reduction in Hours Policy will allow permanent employees to
voluntarily reduce their hours of work to a minimum of 50% of the regular full time
hours for their position, with agreement of their Employer. The incumbent will retain
permanent status and will have access to rights normally available to permanent
employees and all benefits on a pro rata basis.

•

Participants will only be given credit for hours that are worked, for the purpose of
severance pay, retirement pay, etc.

•

AD&D, Life Insurance and LTD coverage as well as CPP and EI premiums will be based
on the reduced salary level.

•

If a full-time employee will be on leave of absence without pay and he/she chooses to
pay pension on 100% salary, upon return to work payment of pension contributions
relating to the leave of absence shall be made by lump sum payment or by payroll
deductions over the same period as the leave.

•

Vacation Leave will be earned and expended on a pro rata basis. (e.g. Employees entitled
to 3 weeks vacation working 50% of work hours for 12 months would receive 7.5 days
paid vacation leave.)

•

Sick Leave will earned and may be expended on a pro rata basis. (Employees working
50% of work hours for 12 months would earn 7.5 days’s sick leave.)

•

For the purposes of calculating retiring/severance pay, only the actual hours worked will

As of April 1, 2003
be used.
•

Designated Holidays will be paid for on a pro rata basis. When establishing the monthly
hours to be worked, exclude designated holidays for that month the apply the appropriate
percentage.

•

Overtime is not payable where management, in emergency situations or unforseen
circumstances, requires employees to work beyond the reduced work hours agreed upon,
but no more than the normal daily hours of the position as determined by its regular full
time hours of work designation.

•

Overtime is payable to employees when authorized by management to work in excess of
daily hours of work as provided by the regular full time hours of work designation of
their positions (i.e. 8 hour/day). Overtime is paid at the rate of time and one-half for all
the overtime that exceeds seven and one half (7 ½) or eight (8) hours of continuous
overtime, depending on the hours of work code.

usually Saturday and/or Sunday where applicable, and designated holidays.

•

The maximum period of any agreement is one year.

•

All forms and contracts must be signed. A copy is to be forwarded to Employee
Benefits.

•

Effective April 1, 2003 full-time employees wishing to work less than 100% will be
allowed to do so for a maximum of 3 consecutive one year periods. Once the employee
has returned to 100% for at least two years the employer may approve a maximum of
three additional years at less than 100%.
During the transition all employees whose three year maximum expires between
January 1, 2003 and March 31, 2003 will be given the option of one additional
year.

extend beyond the 3 year maximum and April 1, 2003 will be allowed to
complete the term of the current agreement.
Benefits will be based on the actual hours worked with the exception of pension

V.

Job Sharing4

The guidelines for job sharing are as follows:
1.

Job sharing will only be permitted when jointly requested by existing classified
employees.

2.

Except as otherwise provided herein, employees participating in job sharing
4

Based on Schedule E of the UPSE Collective Agreement

As of April 1, 2003
arrangements will be entitled to all rights and benefits provided for in the UPSE
Collective Agreement or the Terms and Conditions of Employment for Excluded
Supervisory and Confidential Employees, as applicable.
3.

Job sharing arrangements will only be authorized where operational requirements and the
provision of services is not adversely affected.

4.

Job sharing options are as follows:
(a) Two full-time classified employees may request to job share one of their positions on
a 50/50 basis; or
(b) A full-time classified employee may request to job share a portion of his/her position
with a classified part-time employee who agrees to increase his/her minimum
employment guarantee. For example, the full-time employee could propose to work 80%
if the part-time employee could work 60% instead of 40%.

5.

Both employees must share the same position title and be suitably qualified and capable
of carrying out the duties and responsibilities of the positions to be job shared.

6.

An employee wishing to job share his/her position has the responsibility of finding an
eligible employee willing to enter into the job sharing arrangement. The two employees
requesting approval to implement a job sharing arrangement will submit a written request
to their supervisor or manager.

7.

A position will be job shared for a one year period. Any extension beyond the one year
period must be mutually acceptable to both employees and the Employer (and the Union
where the employees are covered by the UPSE collective agreement). At the end of the
job sharing period, the employees will resume the positions they held prior to entering
into the job sharing arrangement.

8.

Each of the two employees in a job sharing arrangement will be required to fulfill the
work schedule requirements averaged over a maximum of two bi-weekly pay periods,
except where a request for a greater averaging period has the prior approval of the
Employer (and the Union where the employees are covered by the UPSE collective
agreement).

9.

During the period of a job sharing arrangement, the full-time classified employees will
retain their status; however, for the following purposes, their benefits will be calculated
on the basis outlined for part-time permanent employees:
(a) salary increments
(b) statutory holidays, maternity, sick, vacation or other leaves
(c) service for purpose of retire/severance pay calculations
(d) travel allowances

10.

Premiums and benefits under the Group Life, Accidental Death and Dismemberment and

As of April 1, 2003
Long Term Disability Insurance Plans shall be based on the salary level of the job
sharing arrangements (eg. 50% of full-time salary level) and in accordance with policy
documents.
11.

Classified full-time and part-time employees participating in a job sharing arrangement
shall continue to be covered under the provisions of the Civil Service Superannuation
Act. For full-time employees, the portion of their position which is not worked may be
considered as deemed service as provided for in the Civil Service Superannuation Act. If
the full-time employee elects to purchase the eligible deemed service, the purchase
arrangement must be made at the commencement of the job sharing arrangement.

12.

In the event one of the participants vacates the job shared position (eg. through
termination of employment, appointment to another position or being placed on injury on
duty/disability leave), the job sharing arrange will terminate and the remaining
participant will revert to his/her status in the position occupied prior to the job sharing
arrangement, except where mutually acceptable alternative arrangements are approved by
the Employer (and the Union where the employee is covered by the UPSE collective
agreement).

13.

If either participant or the Employer wishes to terminate or extend the job sharing
arrangement prior to its expiry, a minimum of sixty calendar days’ written notice shall be
required.

ii. Processing Procedures:
The following are the procedures to be followed when applying for a Job Sharing Agreement:
•

Employees applies to the employing authority for a Job Sharing Arrangement.

•

Application has to proceed to Director level for final approval.

•

If approved, the employing authority ensures the original agreement is sent to appropriate

also sent to the Union.

•

The divisional payroll staff member responsible for the employee will make the
necessary changes in PeopleSoft as per the section on “Entering a Voluntary Reduction
in Work Hours” in the PeopleSoft manual.

•

The divisional payroll staff member will also make the necessary changes in the Payroll
systems to ensure
<
for the primary applicant, if the Pension contributions are to be on normal salary
(ie. 100% for a full time person), in the EMPL4 screen say YES to the question
“Pension Contrib. on 100% Salary”,

As of April 1, 2003

<
<
<

for the secondary applicant, if the secondary employee was also a full-time
employee and he/she elects to pay pension on the normal salary, in the EMPL4
screen say YES to the question “Pension Contrib. on 100% Salary”
on the TRANS screen, the standard hours for each employee are changed to
reflect their new standard hours under the job sharing arrangement.

Sub-Section 5:05
Telework Guidelines

1.

Date:

1 of 6

PURPOSE
The purpose of these guidelines is to provide information on how telework
arrangements may be structured in situations where the employing authority and
an employee agree to a telework arrangement.

2.

APPLICATION
These guidelines apply to departments and agencies that are under the authority
of the Civil Service Act.

3.

DEFINITION
Telework is the scheduled performance of work during regular working hours by
an employee from a teleworksite that the employer and employee mutually agree
upon (usually is the employee’s home).

4.

POLICY

4.01

General

4.02

a)

Telework arrangements must be voluntary. They are not a term of
employment or a right of employees.

b)

Normally, employees would have to have completed their probationary
status before they would be eligible to work in a telework arrangement.
Employees must have demonstrated a solid work ethic with demonstrated
results in their work. It is also important that the supervisor of the
employee is comfortable with the telework arrangement.

c)

Most telework situations work best if the maximum number of days
worked from the teleworksite is no more than three days per week. There
is an issue of isolation if the arrangement is full-time, and there may be
concerns from co-workers that there is not an equal distribution of work.

d)

Approval of senior management is required for all cases and the
agreement should be put in writing outlining the details of the arrangement
and the frequency of review.

Factors for Consideration Prior to Approval

Sub-Section 5:05
Telework Guidelines

4.03

4.04

4.05

Date:

07 November 2001

2 of 6

a)

It must be operationally feasible for the work to be done from a
teleworksite.

b)

The cost of the arrangement should not be higher than a traditional
worksite, with costs spread over a period of time.

c)

The quality and quantity of work must be maintained or improved as a
result of the telework arrangement.

Health and Safety Considerations
a)

The employee must be able to provide a teleworksite that meets health
and safety standards, so that health and safety are not jeopardized. The
seating arrangement should be reviewed to ensure that it is ergonomically
sound. A visit by a Health and Safety Officer would be advised to ensure
that standards are met.

b)

Ensuring that Workers Compensation coverage is maintained is a crucial
consideration. If health and safety standards are maintained and the
arrangement is approved by the employer, there will be coverage by
Workers Compensation.

Liability Considerations
a)

Meetings with clients are not to occur at the teleworksite for liability
reasons.

b)

The employee is to ensure that there is $1,000,000 minimum liability
insurance. The insurance company that the employee purchases
insurance from should be advised of the telework arrangement and
confirm that the coverage is adequate. The cost of the
insurance would be the responsibility of the employee.

Telework Supplies, Equipment, and Furniture
a)

The employer would normally be responsible for providing a computer,
required software, remote LAN node, desk or table and chair. Other
furniture and equipment could be considered, if required. A laptop is
worthy of consideration since it is portable and can be used in the
teleworksite or the regular worksite.

b)

The employer would be responsible for the cost of telephone for business

Sub-Section 5:05
Telework Guidelines

Date:

purposes only. Normally, a second line would need to be installed for
computer access; the employer would be responsible to cover this cost.

4.06

4.07

c)

While the telework arrangement is normally for no more than three days
per week, the employee will require space at the regular worksite. This
can usually be shared with others. The cost of maintaining two sites must
be a factor in looking at the feasibility of the specific arrangement.

d)

The employee is responsible to provide a teleworksite at his/her cost.
Associated costs such as heat, electricity, taxes, etc. are the responsibility
of the employee. Employees are encouraged to contact Canada Customs
and Revenue Agency to determine if they may deduct certain employment
related expenses from their income. Employees may not claim any
expenses that are paid by the employer. Revenue Canada has a guide
“Employment Expenses” that may also be of assistance.

Travel
a)

Teleworking can reduce the amount of travel required by an employee,
however, planning is required so that meetings in the regular worksite are
scheduled for days that the employee is at that site. It is most economical
if the employee works full days at the teleworksite.

b)

The employee is eligible for travel expenses as outlined in the Treasury
Board Policy Manual. The employee is responsible for travel costs
associated with getting to the regular workplace, including trips there on
any regularly scheduled “home” work days.

Security and Confidentiality
a)

The employee is responsible to provide an acceptable work space which
allows the work to be performed in an environment that does not breach
confidentiality.

b)

The employee must ensure that minimum IT security standards are
followed and is responsible to sign an “Acceptable Use Policy for
Computer Systems” form.

c)

If the employee is taking a government computer outside the government
workplace then a “Portable Computer Agreement” must be signed.

Telework Guidelines

4.08

d)

When a personal computer is provided by the employee for telework,
approved anti-virus software must be used. In some cases the
Government may require that the hard drive be reformatted at the
beginning and end of the agreement.

e)

A dedicated connection must be used.

f)

Meetings with clients are not to take place at the teleworksite.

Dependent Care Arrangements
Dependant care arrangements must be made by the employee so that the
employee is not responsible to provide such care during working hours.

4.09

Responsibilities of the Employer
a)

To ensure that the above factors have been addressed prior to approving
telework arrangements.

b)

To ensure that the teleworksite meets health and safety standards so that
Workers Compensation coverage for the employee is maintained.

c)

To ensure that telework arrangements do not generate ongoing net
additional costs.

d)

To maintain an inventory of all equipment, software, and furniture owned
by the employer that is located in the teleworksite and to ensure that it is
returned upon the completion of the arrangement.

e)

To ensure that a “Security Checklist for New Employees” has been
completed when the employee is first hired.

f)

To ensure that an “Acceptable Use Policy for Computer Systems”form is
completed before gaining access to the network.

g)

To ensure that a “Portable Computer Agreement” is signed before taking
a portable computer away from the regular office setting.

Maintaining Trust and Confidence
Islanders entrust the Government of Prince Edward Island with their sensitive and
private information and rely on us as employees to adequately safe-guard this
information from unauthorized use. As employees, we must accept that security is
an important responsibility as we conduct the day-to-day business of government. The
measures contained in this handbook specify what protections should be taken to fulfil
this trust.
This handbook summarizes the main provisions of the government’s information
security policies and practices. It contains the highlights only and should not be
referenced as a substitute for detailed information contained in the formal policies,
standards and applicable legislation. These reference documents are available on the
government Intranet site at http://iis.peigov/. (Where the policy does not cover a specific
situation, common sense should prevail).
Minimum IT security standards have been formulated by the IT Security
Coordinators Council with input and feedback from Senior Management and
approval of Treasury Board.
You should keep this document readily available during your employment with
government. It has been developed for your convenience and you are encouraged to
refer to it often. Responsible protection of private and confidential information is
essential to maintaining the trust and confidence of Islanders we serve.

Bill Drost, Chief Information Officer
Government of Prince Edward Island

Introduction
The security requirements in this handbook apply to all employees, anyone under
contract to the government or anyone having access to the government-wide
computer network(s). Although this handbook deals primarily with electronic
records, similar safeguards should be in place for recorded information in other
formats, including printouts of electronic information.
Some of the information applies specifically to managers and supervisors and is
highlighted accordingly. If you have any questions regarding security
procedures, endorsed procedures or you need clarification or interpretation of
the contents of this handbook, please contact your manager/supervisor or your
departmental Information Technology Security Coordinator.
Note to Managers/Supervisors______________
As a manager/supervisor, you need to be aware of the contents of
this handbook in order to ensure your staff are aware of and are
following these procedures. You are responsible for the security
within your assigned area.

Information You Need to Safeguard
All government information and assets require good, basic care. There are,
however, certain types of information and assets which are more sensitive or
valuable and these require enhanced safeguarding. We must categorize
information and services that have a confidentiality, integrity or an availability
requirement and protect them accordingly.
Confidentiality
Confidentiality is the expectation of privacy of information. There are three
levels of confidentiality: none, normal and high. The no (none)
confidentiality requirement is for information that is considered public
knowledge, and as such, would not cause any embarrassment to government
or any individual should the information be released.
The normal confidentiality requirement is for information that could cause
embarrassment to government or any individual should the information be
released.
The high confidentiality requirement is for information that could likely
cause significant financial or social hardship or embarrassment to
government or to an individual should the information be released.
Integrity
Integrity is the correctness of the information once it is entered into the
computer system; that is to say, the data or information has not been altered,
except by an authorized individual. Integrity also has three levels: none,
normal and high. No integrity requirement would mean that there would be
no impact if the data were incorrect.
Normal integrity requirement would mean that the information should be
correct and accurate, but the impact of it being incorrect would have minor
consequences.
High integrity requirement would mean that the information must be correct
and accurate, or there could be significant financial or other serious
implications.

Availability
Availability is the maximum acceptable downtime for computer systems that

the organization or government can accept while still maintaining its
objectives and deliverables. More than seven days availability means that
the computerized information or services could be unavailable for at least a
week, with no serious impact to the organizational or governmental
deliverables.
Between one and seven days availability means that the computerized
information or services must be available within this time frame.
Less than one day availability means that the computer information or
service is critical to the programs being delivered by the organization and
government.
Information Classifications
All sensitive government information and systems
must be protected or guarded from unauthorized
access, disclosure, removal, modification and/or
interruption. After information has been
categorized, it must be classified depending on its
sensitivity.
Three classifications determine the level of
sensitivity of information and assets within the
government.
Open or Public Information and Assets
With open or public information and assets, the disclosure or loss would
not be an invasion of privacy, or cause hardship or monetary loss to our
citizens or ourselves, e.g. general policies and procedures and legislation.
Protected Information
With protected information or assets, the disclosure or loss would be
expected to be an invasion of privacy, or cause hardship or monetary loss, or
could be detrimental to relations between governments, i.e. information that
needs to be accurate and correct, such as payroll or accounting data;
information or systems that are essential to the government such as health
information or computer systems. In general, information about individuals
which is not widely available should be protected whether or not such
information would be embarrassing to that person.

Particularly Sensitive Information

With particularly sensitive information, the disclosure would be expected
to be a major invasion of privacy; cause serious harm to either citizens,
corporations or employees; or could be detrimental to relations between
governments, e.g. highly sensitive data such as client health records,
investigative reports of law violations, and pre-release budget information.
This information requires special handling and security procedures to
adequately protect it.
In the absence of legislation, it is difficult to define information which falls
within the protected or particularly sensitive categories. However, the
following classes of information should be adequately protected:
< information which, if disclosed, could be harmful to business
interests; an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy; harmful to
law enforcement; harmful to economic and other interests of a public
body; or harmful to intergovernmental relations; and
< pre-decisional advice and recommendations involving staff and
members of Executive Council or confidences of a public body.
Note to Managers/Supervisors__________________
As a manager/supervisor, you are responsible for ensuring that
information authored in your area of operations is properly
categorized; that all employees are aware of the correct
classification in your area; and that all employees are aware of
the correct classification of information used in your area but
authored elsewhere.

Access to Information
You are entitled to have access to all information and assets needed to perform
your assigned work. Access to information and assets is not permitted to satisfy
your personal interests. You must always be alert and not reveal information to
your co-workers or others unless they specifically require it for their own
assigned tasks. Beware of any attempt by non-authorized personnel to gain
access to sensitive information, and report to your manager/supervisor all such
attempts.

Mailing of Information and Assets
Open or public information and assets can be sent internally and externally in
any manner appropriate, i.e. no special security procedures are necessary.
Protected information and assets (except cash and negotiables) may be mailed
within government by using a reusable (economy) envelope, or externally by
using a properly addressed, single gum-sealed envelope.
Particularly sensitive information is not normally mailed outside of
government. However, it may be mailed within the government by using a single
gum-sealed envelope properly addressed and labelled To be opened by
addressee only. A return address is required. Externally, particularly sensitive
information may only be sent by courier or registered mail with proof-of-mailing.
A record of delivery is required.

Electronic Mail
The government approved e-mail system transmits all its internal messages and
attachments in an encrypted form, i.e. if you are sending a message or document to
someone else within the government, the message or document will be protected within
the system. Therefore, it is permissible to send any category of information via the email system within government.
Messages going to someone outside of the provincial government will be
decrypted and sent without protection when it leaves the control of the
government approved e-mail system. Therefore, messages and documents being
sent to outsiders should not contain sensitive information unless alternate forms
of encryption can be applied.
Here are some general rules to follow regarding the use of e-mail:
< The Internet should not be used for any level of sensitive information,
unless it is encrypted as noted above. Exercise caution.
< Keep attachment size to less than the current government standard. Use
FTP to exchange files greater than the government standard size.
(Contact your system administrator for information on FTP.)
< Don’t carbon copy mail unnecessarily.

< External e-mail accounts provided free by Internet search sites and
engines, e.g. Hotmail, Infoseek mail, Yahoo mail, Hotbot mail, must not
be used to exchange government information.
< E-mail is to be used in direct support of authorized projects and
activities.
< Never abuse the e-mail system by changing the sender’s name.
< Never abuse the system by sending offensive e-mail.
< Never abuse the e-mail system by sending mail to everyone in the Post
Office unless authorized to do so by your deputy.

Storing Information and Assets
Open or public information and assets are to be stored in an appropriate
manner.
Protected information must be secured in a locked cabinet or storage container
when not being accessed or used or when you will be away from your desk for an
extended period of time. Information and assets must be protected from individuals
who do not share your need to access in order to perform their assigned tasks.
Particularly sensitive information, when not being used, is to be stored in a
locked filing cabinet.

Disposing of Information and Assets
All information created by or supplied to government must be regarded as
government records. As such, you are bound by the provisions of the Archives
Act regarding disposal of information. No recorded information should be
disposed of except in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Archives
Act.
Information, including open or public information and assets, must be destroyed
in the manner outlined in the Recorded Information Management Policy which
can be located at the provincial government Intranet site at http:/iis.peigov/. For
information you should contact your department’s Records Management Liaison
Officer.
Due to the potential embarrassment it might create if it were improperly disposed
of, protected and particularly sensitive information is to be destroyed.
Computer storage media, e.g. floppy disks, CDs, and video and audio tapes are
to be disposed of as outlined in the “ Procedures for the Disposal of Government
Information on Computer Media”.
Note to Managers/Supervisors______________________
As a manager/supervisor, you must ensure that your staff know
about the proper procedures for disposal of recorded information
and assets.

Computer Use and Access
Information technology systems include all types of computer systems, such as
the mainframe, servers, workstations, personal computers, laptop/notebook
systems, handhelds and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants).
The use of these systems and the software and information they contain is
granted on a need-to-know basis only. All systems with access to sensitive
information and assets will require you to identify yourself by a user ID, and to
confirm your identity with a password. You are responsible and accountable for
all activities performed under your user ID and accesses made to computer
systems may be recorded and monitored.
Therefore, you should follow these security guidelines:

Passwords
All users are to be uniquely identified by user ID and verified by password
before being granted access to any sensitive information stored or processed
on departmental computer systems.
Passwords are to be selected by the user, must contain at least one special
character, and should be difficult to guess. Family names, dates, telephone numbers, or
words found in dictionaries should not be used as passwords.
Passwords must be a minimum of five characters in length.
Passwords should be memorized (not written down) and not shared.
Network accounts are to be locked after five login attempts and may only be
re-activated by an authorized person.
Passwords are to be changed at least every 90 days. Passwords should be changes
immediately if compromise is suspected.
Computer Use
When leaving your computer you should log out, lock your workstation or
use a password protected screen saver to prevent others from accessing
information under your user ID. Screen savers with passwords are required
to deactivate the display of a session after five minutes of inactivity unless
exceptions are approved in writing by the Information Technology Security
Coordinator for that department or area. It is good practice to sign off if you
plan to be away from your workstation for more than two hours.
You should position your computer screen in such a way as to minimize the
possibility of others reading the information shown there.
Data Files
Removable media such as tapes, disks and CDS containing software and
government information are to be stored in a locked cabinet or drawer when
not being used.
Do not store sensitive information on your hard drive or removable media
unless it is encrypted by approved software.

Remote access to or from computer systems storing or processing sensitive
government information will only be permitted if it is in accordance with
endorsed guidelines.
If you must store information on your workstation, you are responsible for
making backup copies at regular intervals, and storing them in a secure
place, off-site if necessary. You should be using LAN systems to store
essential information, as they are backed up daily.
Note to Managers/Supervisors___________________
As a manager/supervisor, you should ensure that your staff know
the proper procedures for creating and using passwords, storing
sensitive information and remotely accessing systems. You must
ensure that staff know how to virus scan, store essential
information on LAN systems and backup information on their
workstation.
Software
Removal of or alterations to computer hardware or components and
changing computer system configurations is not permitted unless approved
by the IT Security Coordinator or designate.
Software used on government computer systems must comply with all
copyrights and vendor agreements on use and distribution. Computer
software installed on computer systems must be approved by the IT Security
Coordinator or designate as non-approved software cannot be supported if
problems occur, and can have a negative effect on the performance and
security of all computer systems.
Virus Protection
Computer viruses can infect and destroy valuable information. Your daily
work may be lost or corrupted if your workstation is infected, and
everyone’s daily work may be affected if the LAN system becomes infected.
Therefore, you should scan all data, programs and disks from any outside
sources, as well as new or rented equipment, before use. Endorsed computer
virus protection software must be active on all computer systems.

Note to Managers/Supervisors____________________
As a manager/supervisor, you must ensure that computer
hardware alterations and configurations are handled by IT staff;
that sufficient copies of required software licences are available at
the work site; that copyright agreements are respected; that
unauthorized software is not installed on departmental systems
and that staff know how to virus scan.
Modems
Modems must not be connected to your computer system unless approved
by your IT Security Coordinator. Exceptions may be granted for dial-out
access only under the following conditions:
< the dial-out access is required to conduct government business;
< the service required cannot be provided in any other way;
< the modem must have auto-answer disabled;
< external modems must be powered off when not in use; and
< internal modems must be disconnected from the phone line when not in
use.
Refer to Endorsed Procedures for Remote Access.
Note to Managers/Supervisors____________________
As a manager/supervisor, you must ensure that no modems are
connected to networked computers unless approved by IT Security
Coordinator or designate.

Facsimile Machines
Facsimile machines should not be used to transmit particularly sensitive or protected
information. For open or public information, care must be exercised that the number
dialled is the correct number as the transmission will proceed, even if it is not the
intended destination.

Protecting Information and
Assets Outside the Office
Open or public information requires no special handling procedures or authorizations
when taken outside the office.
Protected information and assets may be taken outside the office provided you have
proper authorization. You must take care to ensure that such information or assets are
not exposed to viewing by unauthorized individuals and that sensitive conversations are
not overheard by others. Such information and assets should be contained in an
appropriate briefcase or container with an identification tag indicating the return address
or telephone number. If you use an automobile, the briefcase or container should be
placed in the trunk or at least out of sight if you leave the locked automobile
unattended.
If protected information is in electronic format, e.g. on a laptop computer, it
must be encrypted and all users must adhere to Portable Computer Endorsed
Procedures. Protected information and assets may be left in rental
accommodation or kept at an employee’s residence provided they are returned to
the locked briefcase or container and placed out of sight.
Particularly sensitive information should not normally be taken outside
government offices. If such information must be removed from the office,
approval must be obtained from a manager or supervisor. The information must
be locked in a cabinet or significant sized container when not being worked
upon.
If a computer (laptop, notebook or desktop) is moved offsite, then Portable
Computer Endorsed Procedures must be followed.
Note to Managers/Supervisors___________________
As a manager/supervisor, you should ensure your employees are
aware of security precautions when taking sensitive information or
assets outside the workplace.

Security Incidents
A security incident is any occurrence which did or could compromise the
security of government information, systems or employees. It includes the
unauthorized access or attempts to access sensitive government information or
assets, theft of assets, or contraventions of the security policies and rules. All
such incidents should be reported to your supervisor/manager, and to the IT
Security Coordinator or designate for your area if it involves computer systems.
Good business practices dictate that the department apply sanctions when a
security violation occurs as a result of negligence or misconduct by an employee.
Such circumstances could therefore lead to administrative, disciplinary or
statutory actions. For more information, contact your supervisor/manager.
Note to Managers/Supervisors_____________________
As a Manager/Supervisor, you should investigate every reported
security incident, and implement corrective action as needed. You
are also responsible to report incidents to your IT Security
Coordinator or designate if they involve computer systems.

Business Resumption Planning
Business Resumption Planning is a program designed to prepare managers to
resume the provision of essential services, programs and operations after they
have been disrupted for any reason. A contingency plan to restore computer
services should be included in the business resumption plan.
Note to Managers/Supervisors______________________
As a manager/supervisor, you should ensure that business
resumption plans for areas under your authority which are involved
in essential services, programs and activities, are developed,
implemented and kept up-to-date for use in the event of a disruption.

Date

The classification process applies to all temporary, relief, and classified
civil service positions.

POLICY
3.01

Creation and Classification of New Positions
When a department wishes to have a new position created, a position
questionnaire (Attachment 4.01) is normally completed by the supervisor.
The form is reviewed by the human resources manager and signed by the
Deputy Head. It is then forwarded with a covering letter to the
Commission outlining the reasons for requesting the position.
The Classification Division of the Commission reviews the position
questionnaire following the review process and assigns a classification
level to the position.
Once a classification level has been established, the Commission
forwards the request to Treasury Board on behalf of the department with a
recommendation on the establishment of the position. The final decision
on the establishment of the position rests with Treasury Board.

3.02

Classification Review Process
A classification review of a position can be requested by an employer, a
permanent employee, or other eligible employee as designated by the
Commission. It is important to note that it is the work of the position that is
classified and not the incumbent.
The employee completes the position questionnaire. The questionnaire is
reviewed by the supervisor, human resources manager, and Deputy
Minister prior to it being sent to the Commission. In certifying the
questionnaire, the supervisor, human resources manager, and Deputy
Minister are concurring that the information is accurate and complete.

Sub-Section 6:01
Classification

Date

Attached is a guide (Attachment 4.02) to be used when completing the
position questionnaire.

Upon receipt of the position questionnaire, the Commission will forward an
acknowledgement letter to the employee. The date the position
questionnaire is received by the Commission is the effective date of the
review. The classification consultant assigned to the classification review
will review the documentation on file, will review comparable positions,
and may communicate with the employee and the department to get a
true sense of the position and its place in the organization. The focus of
the review will be to identify changes that have occurred in the position
that may affect the classification ratings. The facts gathered will allow the
consultant to evaluate the position using the Willis Job Evaluation System.
In the case of a classified position, once the review has been completed,
a preliminary decision is forwarded to the department. If the Employer
concurs with the recommendation, he or she is agreeing with the
classification decision. Upon receipt of this departmental concurrence, the
Public Service Commission notifies the employee of the decision by mail.
The letter to the employee includes the classification decision, step, salary
range, and effective date. It also provides information on the appeal
process.
If the position is reclassified to a higher level and the employee in the
position is qualified and satisfactorily performs the duties of the position,
the employee may be promoted effective the date the review was sent to
the Commission. If the department feels that the employee has been
performing the duties prior to the effective date, the employer may request
an earlier effective date. It shall not be more than 60 working days
retroactive to the date the request was submitted to the Commission as
outlined in the Civil Service Act Regulations.
It should be noted that a position may be reviewed and the position
classification may be lowered as a result of changes in the duties and
responsibilities. Procedures for red circling are outlined in the Civil
Service Act Regulations, Part V.

A similar review process is used for the classification review of a
temporary position; however, a memorandum is forwarded to the

Sub-Section 6:01

department with the decision of the classification review rather than a
preliminary decision form.
3.03

Classification Appeal Process
The Classification Appeal Committee hears appeals on behalf of employees or employers
when they do not agree with the decision of the Commission.
Under the Civil Service Act Regulations section 17 the process for the appeal is as
follows:
17(1) An employer, a permanent employee or such other eligible employee as may be
determined by the Commission may appeal the decision of the Commission with respect
to classification of a position to the Classification Appeal Committee within fifteen
working days of receipt of the decision.
Before filing an appeal, the employee must review the classification decision with the
classification consultant from the Public Service Commission who was assigned the
review.
If a decision is made to file an appeal, it must be made in writing to the Chairperson of the
Appeal Committee specifying the reasons for the appeal and a copy is to be forwarded to
the Public Service Commission (keeping in mind the time frame of fifteen working days
after receipt of the decision).
The Committee shall review the appeal and may hold a hearing. The
Committee shall communicate its decision in writing, giving reasons to the
parties within thirty working days of reviewing the appeal.
The Committee may
(a)
allow the appeal by revoking the decision of the Commission and
direct that the Commission re-evaluate the position and correct any
errors or omissions or take other appropriate action; or
(b)

dismiss the appeal.

The Committee shall not deal with an appeal on any position which has
been considered by it within the previous twelve months unless the
appellant can demonstrate in writing that there has been a substantial
change in the duties and responsibilities of the position since the position

13. DUTIES:
Describe the duties or activities that you do. List them in order of importance. If there are procedures or steps used in performing each
activity, describe the steps. In the description of your activities be sure to include the end results expected (why the actions are taken).
Estimate the percent of your total time spent on each duty.

This section is the most critical in any job questionnaire. This is where the actual work is described.
The following steps may help in ensuring that the work is described accurately and completely.
The Big Picture:
Spend a little time thinking about the job. Among other things, ask: What is the purpose of the
job? What is supposed to be accomplished? What are its main thrusts? Where does the job fit
in the organization’s work? What outputs or results must be accomplished?
The Task List:
Write, in no particular order, all the tasks performed on a daily, weekly, and yearly basis. These
are the task statements. They should be complete and specific. Include the work that is done not how to do it or how well it is done. Unless the answer is evident, the task statement should
answer such questions as: What work is done? To what is the work done? By when is the work
done (deadlines)? How often is the work done? For whom is the work done? Where is the work
done? What materials, procedures or equipment are used? What is produced?
The Verbs:
Check each task statement to ensure it has been said in a clear and precise manner. If not,
change the words to state the true meaning. For example, change “prepares reports” to “writes
reports” and change “assists in budget preparation” to “forecasts salary costs for inclusion in
the budget”.

Continued...

The Duties:
Group the task statements into responsibility areas. For example, group together all the
supervisory duties, all the planning duties, all the reporting duties. Typically, a job will have
between five and eight groups, but there may be as few as three. Each responsibility area can be
described by answering three questions:
What

Describe what is done in clear and precise language. For example: “purchases office
supplies”.

Why

Unless the “Why” is obvious, state what outcome is expected. For example: “purchases
office supplies to meet the needs of the XYZ Unit within established budgetary
constraints”.

How

Include enough of the Task Statements (from the Task List) to illustrate the complexity of
the work. For example: “Purchases office supplies to meet the needs of the XYZ Unit
within established budgetary constraints. This involves setting up an inventory of
supplies and monitoring usage using a LOTUS123 spreadsheet; calling suppliers for
quotes on specific items; obtaining Supervisor’s approval for purchases over $500; ........”

Each responsibility statement (duty) should now describe one functional element of the job.
Together, they illustrate the type, purpose, and scope of work assigned to the position.
To finalize the Duties Section, combine miscellaneous duties in a final “catch-all” duty. For example:
“Performs other duties such as: occasionally acting as Receptionist for the office; taking,
transcribing, and circulating minutes of office meetings, .....”. Then list the Duties in order of
importance and indicate the percentage of time spent on each.
The Final Edit:
The completed questionnaire should be reviewed to ensure that:
A.

unusual terminology, technical terms, or jargon are adequately explained;

B.

the description is as concise and factual as possible;

C.

qualifying adjectives such as “difficult” or “major” are supported by specific examples;

D.

the job is described clearly and completely enough to be understood by a person
unfamiliar with the work.

14. SUPERVISION:
If you are required to supervise, please list the employees and their position titles below. Note that Supervision includes responsibility
for training employees, for scheduling and assigning their work, and for evaluating employee performance.

This section, along with #15 Guidance, shows the impact of this job on the work of
other people. List all the employees for whom supervisory responsibility is assigned.
Casual and part-time employees should also be listed.

15. GUIDANCE:
If you are required to provide functional guidance to other people, please describe the circumstances below. Guidance includes
coordinating the work of such people as volunteers, contractors, and members of project teams or committees. This is not intended to
include such duties as responding to information requests from the public or providing instruction or assistance to clients or patients.

Whether or not full supervision is a requirement of the job, the employee may be
required to exercise leadership skills. Identify here any requirement to assign and
monitor the work of others (including volunteers and co-workers).

16. BASIC REQUIREMENTS:
Identify the required skills and knowledge applied in your job, including any requirement to provide services in both official languages,
and list any licenses or registrations required.

Identify here how the knowledge to do the job is NORMALLY obtained. The
combination of education, training, and experience described here should be reflected
in the duties. For example, if a Basic Requirement is listed as “ability to type at
40wpm”, then one of the duties must show why that ability is necessary.
17. EQUIPMENT/INSTRUMENTS USED:
Identify the specialized equipment or instruments used in your job and the frequency with which they are used.

In the same way that abilities must be reflected in the duty statements, any requirement to operate
equipment or instruments should relate to the duties. For example, if the use of LOTUS and WordPerfect
software is listed here, one or more of the duties should show how the software is used in the job.
18. RESOURCE CONTROL:
List, with dollar values where applicable, the resources controlled and/or affected. This could include staff, budgets, equipment,
facilities, supplies, etc.

This section is used to gather information about the accountability for program
resources. Besides listing responsibility for staff or budgets, include the value of
equipment, instruments, or supplies for which responsibility is assigned.
19. MENTAL CHALLENGES:
What are the most mentally challenging parts of your job? What is it about your work that really makes you think? (Be specific and
give one or more examples.)

This is an opportunity to elaborate on areas of the job that require “thinking”.
Situations that require ceative or innovative responses; actions based on accumulated
experience and intuition; and procedures with a number of inter-related steps would be
appropriate here. For example in a Receptionist position: “Callers have to be
questioned about the nature of their business to determine how best to direct them”.
20. DECISIONS:
Give specific examples of the most important decisions or recommendations you make.

This section should describe the responsibility and freedom to make material recommendations or
decisions. It is important to show, using examples, the kind of decisions (or recommendations) and the
impact that these choices have on the work of the organization. For example: “I decide whether to repair
or replace equipment, taking into consideration its age, book value, and repair costs”.
21. PRINCIPAL CONTACTS:
Excluding your supervisor and any employees you supervise, give typical examples of your key personal contacts and the purpose of
each.

List here, with the person or office contacted, the results expected of that contact. For example, is the
contact for the purpose giving and receiving messages, answering questions where detailed
explanations are required, motivating someone other than employees, making public presentations, etc.,
etc.?

Time Limit on Suggestion:
A suggestion is considered "active" for a period of two years from the date
of receipt by the Program Coordinator. One 12-month extension may be
permitted under special circumstances if the suggester submits a written
request to the Employee Innovation Awards Advisory Council before the
end of the initial two- year period. In the event that the suggester should
leave the employment of the provincial government, the council, in
consultation with the suggester and the Deputy Head of the affected
department, will determine whether or not to proceed with the suggestion.
If a denied suggestion is implemented by government within the active
period, the suggestion will be considered to have been implemented and
the innovation subject to award as per Section 9 of this document.
If a suggester fails to provide council members with documentation or
information regarding the suggestion, the council may exercise the right to
terminate the suggestion within the two-year period.
If a department, who is responsible for either implementing or denying a
suggestion, does not notify the council of its decision within 1 year from
the date of submission of the suggestion, the council may assign a time
frame to the department within which they must inform the council of its
decision. If the suggestion will be implemented, the department must
provide the council with a date and plan for implementation. If the
suggestion will be denied, the department must provide the council with a
letter outlining valid reasons for denial.

b)

If the suggestion meets program criteria, the suggestion is assigned to a
council member. Suggestions cannot be assigned to a council member
representing the same department as the suggester if it may result in a
potential conflict of interest.

c)

Acceptable suggestions are categorized by the council in one of the
following five categories:
Category 1 - suggestion has impact on local office/branch or similar
regional sites. These suggestions are forwarded to the Deputy Head of
the suggester’s department for implementation and celebration.
Category 2- suggestion has impact on local office/branch and
Department.
Category 3 - suggestion involves a time saving and/or service
improvement and impact is realized within the department.
Category 4 - suggestion has impact on local office/branch,
department and all of the public service with possible impact on the
general public.
Category 5 - suggestion involves a cost savings which is difficult to
monitor and determine.
Category 6 - suggestion involves a cost savings which is identifiable and
monitored for one year.

9.3

For categories 2-6, the assigned council member will contact the Deputy Head of
the department which has been deemed as being responsible for the evaluation
and possible implementation of the suggestion. Within four weeks of receipt of
the suggestion, the Deputy Head will have assigned a departmental
representative who will have contacted the council member who has been
assigned to work on the suggestion. The departmental representative will work
with the suggester and/or the council member to determine:
a)
b)
c)
d)

the feasibility of implementing the suggestion;
the anticipated benefits or net benefits of implementation, if any;
how the net benefits could be measured;
how the suggestion could be implemented;

whether further action to implement the suggestion is appropriate; and
how the department would like to address any savings.

If the suggestion is not to be implemented, a letter will be forwarded from the
Council to the suggester outlining the reasons provided by the Department.

10.

9.4

The council member is to coordinate meeting with the suggester and the
departmental representative.

9.5

The council representative notifies suggester of the results of the department's
decision regarding his/her suggestion.

9.6

If the decision is to proceed, the department will implement the idea and monitor
resulting benefits. It is recommended that this be done through a team formed
within the department. Should the department request, the council will attempt to
provide a facilitator for the implementation team.

9.7

Progress towards implementation will be monitored by the Employee Innovation
Awards Advisory Council. Periodic updates on progress will be forwarded to the
suggester via a council member or departmental representative.

9.8

For those suggestions monitored for cost savings, at the end of the first year in
which the innovation was implemented, benefits will be measured by the
appropriate department and reported to the Employee Innovation Awards
Advisory Council. This report will form a part of the council’s recommendation to
Treasury Board of an award for the suggester.

Awards
Individuals who make suggestions (“suggesters”) which are successfully implemented
are entitled to recognition certificates, cash or gift awards.
10.1

Cash Awards
Cash awards presented to suggesters are a percentage of net savings (i.e.,

Sub Section 6.05
Discipline

1.

1 of 8

1.01

An employee who fails to maintain proper standards of conduct or
commits a disciplinary offense, shall be subject to disciplinary action. No
employee shall be disciplined except for just cause.

1.02

The administration of discipline is the responsibility of the Deputy Head.
The Deputy Head may delegate responsibility for disciplinary action to
departmental directors, managers and supervisors.

1.03

Discipline in the work place is somewhat similar to discipline in society in
that it serves three functions:

(c)

as a punishment for unacceptable behaviour;
as a corrective measure to ensure unacceptable behaviour is not
repeated;
to act as a deterrent to others.

INTRODUCTION

(a)
(b)

2.

Date

This applies to all employees within the Civil Service.

POLICY
3.01

The discipline philosophy of the Civil Service is based on correction rather
than punishment; as such the emphasis should be identification and
isolation of the problem situations before formal corrective action is
required. The corrective approach dictates that the employee be aware of
the reasons for and the hoped for results of the discipline and understand
that discipline flows from the employee’s own action.

3.02

Discipline is normally a progressive process except for certain kinds of
misconduct, which because of their seriousness, justify moving
immediately to a more serious penalty. The framework under which
discipline occurs is found in the Civil Service Act (S. 32), its regulations (S.
29-35) and the UPSE collective agreement (Article 27).

Sub Section 6.05
Discipline

3.03 DISCIPLINE PROCESS
Although management has the right to discipline any employee, this
discretion is qualified by the right of the employee to have protection
against unfair treatment. Therefore, the Employer must be able to
demonstrate “just cause” for any disciplinary action imposed. For just
cause to exist, these three requirements must be met:
1.

The employee breached the rule or committed the offence
charged against him/her.

In arbitration the onus or burden of proof is on the Employer to produce
evidence and establish the facts which provide sufficient cause to
discipline the employee. This evidence must demonstrate that the
discipline was for just and proper cause.
It follows then that the standard of proof on the charge of misconduct or
breach varies with the gravity of the misconduct forming the basis of the
charge. The more serious the offence, the more convincing must be
evidence relied on to prove its commission. During the investigation
period, it is important to note facts in writing so that any discipline which
may follow can later be substantiated if necessary.
2.

The misconduct or offence warranted discipline.

To address this issue, four questions must be addressed:
i)

Did the employee neglect his/her job duties or
responsibilities?

ii)

Did the employee violate any rules or practices that
endangered themself, his/her clients or co-workers?

iii)

How would a reasonable person act in a similar
circumstance?

iv)

How has the Employer responded to similar situations in the
past?

Sub Section 6.05
Discipline

3.

Date

Page
02 October 2002

3 of 8

Is the penalty just and appropriate to the act or offence as
corrective discipline?

An Arbitration Board has the authority to substitute its judgement for
management in assessing the appropriateness of the penalty. The
following factors will be taken into consideration:
i)

What is the seriousness of the offence or rule violated in
terms of policy and obligations?
Usually this is determined by the degree that either job
duties were neglected or that the safety of clients, other
employees or the offender were in danger.

ii)

What were the circumstances under which the misconduct
occurred?
How would a normal, prudent person act under similar
circumstances?

iii)

What is the continuous service of the offender? It is
accepted practice that greater consideration should be given
to long service employees.

iv)

Has the employee been satisfactory or above average up to
now? If so, some recognition and consideration of this would
be made in assessing a penalty.

v)

The past discipline record of an employee may be used to
determine the degree or penalty for an offence. It cannot be
used to determine his/her guilt on the new offence.
Whereas the first offence may warrant a minimal reprimand,
a second or third similar offence may warrant more severe
discipline. This is a compelling reason why all discipline
must be documented.

A general rule to follow goes as follows:

Sub Section 6.05
Discipline

Date

Page
02 October 2002

4 of 8

“If the offending act was not documented, the act did not
occur”. Another factor that must be considered is the period
of time that has elapsed since the previous infraction. Since
the real objective of discipline is correction, a long period of
good conduct is a mitigating factor as far as previous
infractions are concerned.
vi)

Equality of Treatment:
Discipline must be consistent, uniform and objective. An
employee has a just complaint, in the absence of a poor
record, if he/she is punished more severely than others for
the same offence. Previous failure to punish may indicate
that no discipline will follow for a particular infraction. In such
situations, a tightening of discipline should be preceded by a
notice that such conduct will no longer be tolerated. The
manager who punishes an employee for some particular
behavior yet allows other employees to go unpunished will
be found to be discriminatory and the disciplinary penalty will
be overturned.
It is equally important that discipline also be administered
consistently. For this reason the departmental HR Manager
and the Public Service Commission act as central resources
in guiding managers through the disciplinary process.

3.04

Once a potential discipline situation comes to the employer’s attention, the
first point of contact should be your departmental HR Manager. In turn,
the HR Manager will likely contact the Public Service Commission, Labour
Relations Section. While the HR Manager will be aware of the
department’s level of response in other discipline situations, the Public
Service Commission has a strong, corporate knowledge of discipline
cases across all departments.

3.05

Determining the appropriate disciplinary penalty can be very difficult.
There are often many mitigating and aggravating factors to consider. It
is also essential to be familiar with the Employer’s history in dealing with
similar disciplinary situations. In cases of serious discipline, a meeting
with the supervisory personnel, HR Manager and labour relations
specialists should be convened.

3.06

The Public Service Commission, under the Civil Service Act, must also
provide its approval in any case where suspension, demotion or dismissal
is under consideration.

When a possible misconduct or a breach of a rule or policy occurs, it is
essential to fully investigate the matter before coming to a decision about
what to do. Ensure the following areas are covered before meeting with
an employee:
(a)

Interview all other participants or witnesses to gather as many
objective, concrete facts as possible;

(b)

Check the employee’s personnel file for the history of work
performance or any prior discipline;

(c)

Arrange to interview the employee as soon as possible after the
offence and, if possible, near the end of the employee’s workday;

(d)

Check legislative and collective agreement requirements;

(e)

REMEMBER, the employee MUST be given an opportunity to tell
their side of the story before any discipline can be imposed.

Review the evidence:
(a)

Did the employee do it?

(b)

If yes, does the misconduct or breach of rule warrant discipline?

(c)

If yes, what is the appropriate penalty?

Sub-Section 6.06
Grievance Procedure

1.

Date

Page
October 25, 2002

1 of 6

PURPOSE
1.01 The grievance process provides a framework for conflicts to be explored
and ultimately resolved while allowing work to continue and the parties to
maintain a viable working relationship.

2.

APPLICATION
2.01 The grievance process for unionized employees is contained in Article 26
of the Collective Agreement. These procedures apply to all employees
covered as defined in Articles 2.02 and 2.03 except that a probationary
employee will not be permitted to file a grievance to adjudication against
rejection during the initial probationary period which is served when
entering the classified division.
2.02 This section also applies to permanent excluded employees (Refer to PART X & XI of the Civil Service Act Regulations).

3.

POLICY
3.01 A grievance is simply a dispute usually over contract interpretation. It can
be a disagreement as to whether the employer had just cause to
discipline, an interpretation of the Collective Agreement, or whether an
employee was entitled to a particular benefit which was denied them.
3.02 Types of grievances:
(a)

Policy grievances (Union grievances)
Employer action affecting all employees, such as adoption of a new
policy, can be the subject of policy grievance.
A policy grievance cannot be used to reopen individual grievances
that have been abandoned or settled.

(b)

Individual Grievances
The union brings forward grievances on behalf of an individual or a
group of individuals who are adversely affected by a particular

Sub-Section 6.06
Grievance Procedure

Date

Page
October 25, 2002

2 of 6

interpretation or application of a Collective Agreement provision.
Although the grievance relates to a particular member of the
bargaining unit, it is the Union which carries the grievance.
Individuals cannot bring a grievance without the union. The
Collective Agreement is between the Employer and the Bargaining
Agent (Union), not between the Employer and the employees.
(c)

Employer grievances
An employer can grieve an alleged violation of the Collective
Agreement by an individual or a union.

(d)

Rights v. Interest Disputes
(i)

Rights disputes arise from grievances under a Collective
Agreement.

(ii)

Interest disputes arise from the collective bargaining
process.

3.03 Time limits for grievances:
(a)

Mandatory
The time limits for filing a grievance are mandatory time limits: 7
calendar days for an individual grievance; 14 calendar days for a
policy (Union or Employer) grievance. This is because the
Collective Agreement clearly indicates that if the time limits are not
followed, the grievance is deemed abandoned.

(b)

Withdrawal or Abandonment of Grievance
If an employee does not submit a grievance to the next higher level
within the time limits stipulated in the preceding sections, then the
grievance shall be deemed to be abandoned and all rights of
recourse to the grievance procedure for that particular grievance
shall be at an end. This provision shall not apply in cases where
circumstances beyond the control of the griever prevented
compliance with the time limits.

Sub-Section 6.06
Grievance Procedure

Date

Page
October 25, 2002

3 of 6

Therefore, if the grievance is not filed or advanced through the
steps of the process within the allowed time, that’s the end of the
matter. An exception to this is when either the Union or the
Employer obtains the consent of the other party to extend the time
limits.
(c)

Extending of Time Limits
The time limits fixed in these procedures may be extended by
mutual written consent.
Normally, extensions are sought only in those cases where
essential information on which to found, or respond to, a grievance
is unavailable during the allowable time. An extension must be
obtained prior to the expiry of the time limits.

3.04 Grievance and Adjudication Procedures
This article sets out the rules for discussing and possibly resolving the
dispute. It gives the parties an opportunity to exchange information and
state their positions.
The Collective Agreement sets out the procedure. Most grievances go
through several levels requiring discussions and responses to the dispute
at higher and higher levels of management.

3.05 Variance from Normal Grievance Procedure
An exception to this process is found in Article 26.13 where grievances
against suspension, demotion or dismissal are to be submitted to the final
level (usually Level 3) of the grievance process within 10 days of notice of
the disciplinary action.

Another exception to the normal grievance process is the process around
policy grievances. The parties are obligated to meet and discuss the
dispute before a grievance is filed. If unsatisfied with the outcome of the
meeting, either party may submit the matter directly to adjudication within
thirty (30) days of the date of the meeting. This time limit is also a

Sub-Section 6.06
Grievance Procedure

Date

Page
October 25, 2002

4 of 6

mandatory one.
3.06 Privilege/Without Prejudice:
The substance of the parties’ discussions during the grievance procedure
is considered privileged and inadmissible at adjudication. The philosophy
behind this practice is that the parties can have open and frank
discussions with a view to resolving the dispute without prejudicing their
case at a hearing. To have the subject and content of these discussions
revealed at adjudication would have a “chilling effect” upon settlement
attempts in future grievances.
3.07 The Grievance:
(a)

Form
A grievance must be put in writing and must be signed by the
griever or their representative. Also, a grievance must have the
signed approval of the Union before the Employer need respond to
it.

(b)

Content
To be adjudicable, the grievance must claim a breach of the
Collective Agreement, the Civil Service Act or Regulations, or even
the Human Rights Act.

3.08 Work Now, Grieve Later:
There is a longstanding principle of labour relations which holds that an
employee who believes he/she has a grievance cannot stop work until
their grievance is resolved. This is called the “work now, grieve later”
principle. To allow a work stoppage is considered too disruptive of the
workplace. Grieving employees are expected to continue doing their jobs
well and efficiently pending the outcome of the grievance and adjudication
process.
The only exception to this principle is found within the provisions of the

Sub-Section 6.06
Grievance Procedure

Date

Page
October 25, 2002

5 of 6

Occupational Health and Safety legislation which allows an employee to
refuse to work where the refusal is based on reasonable grounds that the
work is likely to endanger the health or safety of the employee or other
employees.
3.09 Grievance Meetings:
The Employer and the Union may meet for a number of reasons:
•
•
•
•
•

to verify agreed facts (can reduce length of a hearing)
to identify facts in dispute
to review all pertinent documents and agree, if possible, on
documents that could be entered by consent at hearing
to discuss in detail any underlying or peripheral issues related to
the grievance
to discuss, without prejudice, any alternatives to a hearing or
settlement options

3.10 Past Practice:
When there is a dispute over Collective Agreement interpretation, it is
essential to understand not just the Collective Agreement language but
also the manner in which the parties have behaved in the past.
Where the Collective Agreement is found to be clear on its face and a
party consistently, and over time, behaves in a manner at odds with the
agreement, a past practice is built up. If this practice was known and
relied upon by the other party, usually the Union, a unilateral change by
the Employer to revert to the Collective Agreement can be grieved by the
Union and the Employer may be prevented from changing its practice until
the next round of collective bargaining.
Where the language of the agreement can be said to be ambiguous,
evidence of a well-established past practice can be used as a tool in the
proper interpretation of the particular article in dispute.
If the Employer’s policy or practice relates to a matter not covered by the
Collective Agreement, the Employer must communicate its intent to
change the policy and ensure that the Union and all employees are aware
of the change and its implications prior to implementation.
3.11 Outcome of Grievance Procedure:
(a)

Abandonment

Sub-Section 6.06
Grievance Procedure

Date

Page
October 25, 2002

6 of 6

There has been no action in processing the grievance, and no
intention of putting the matter forward.
Because the Union has the carriage of the grievance, if a Union
representative does not appear on the date of the hearing, the
Union is deemed to have abandoned the grievance, even if the
griever shows up for the hearing.
Or, if no action has occurred for a long time and then the Union
tries to proceed, the Employer can argue the Union should be
found to have abandoned the grievance.
(b)

Settlement
The parties agree to a resolution of the matter. It does not require
ratification of the full membership. The parties may mutually agree
that the settlement will not form a precedent for future disputes,
and denote the settlement as “without prejudice”.
While only the Union has the authority to enter into a settlement
with the Employer, it will usually do so only if the griever is
agreeable to the settlement.

(c)

Grievance Adjudication
The Collective Agreement allows for grievances to be heard by
either a single adjudicator or a board of three. The single
adjudicator, or the Chair of a board of three, is most often a lawyer
with considerable experience in labour relations. The remaining
two members of a board of three are nominees, one appointed by
each of the Employer and the Union.

This applies to the Civil Service.

POLICY
3.01

3.02

(a)

In a unionized work environment, the collective agreement and its
contractual nature and the role of management and the union in
the day to day administration of the workplace and the agreement
must be understood.

(b)

To be effective, it’s essential for the Employer to know when and
how to communicate with union representatives and how to ensure
that the communication is productive, even in the face of conflict.

Union vs. Non-union Workplaces
(a)

In a unionized work environment, a written agreement (ie. the
collective agreement) outlines the terms and conditions of
employment for all employees in the bargaining unit. However, the
employer can still make policies or rules on issues which may be a
term or condition of employment, provided the policy or rule does
not conflict with anything in the collective agreement.

(b)

In the civil service, some terms and conditions of employment are
found in the Civil Service Act and the Regulations to the Act. Some
examples of conditions of employment found in the Regulations
include classification appeal (Part V) and disciplinary measures
(Part IX).

(c)

Another obvious difference between union and non-union
workplaces is the presence of the union. The union has
representatives at worksites called stewards. It also has elected
officials and full time paid staff.

d)

In unionized workplaces, regardless of who the actual individuals

Sub-Section 6.07

are occupying positions as management, union or employees, the
relationship created by virtue of the collective agreement continues.

3.03

The Collective Agreement and Related Legislation
(a)

A collective agreement is an employment contract. The parties are
the Employer and the Union. The Union is the “bargaining agent”
for the employees who are collectively the “bargaining unit”. By
legislation, a union who can demonstrate it represents a majority of
employees of an employer is entitled to negotiate the terms and
conditions of employment (the collective agreement) of the
employees in the bargaining unit.

(b)

Some legislative and collective agreement provisions you should
be aware of include the following:

Civil Service Act
Section 1
•

“Employer” in relation to consultation and negotiation, means the
Treasury Board or such other body as the Lieutenant Governor in
Council may designate.

•

“Union” means the Prince Edward Island Union of Public Sector

Key Union Contacts
(a)

Shop Steward/Local Representative
The Steward or Local Rep is an employee who is also an elected
union official who represents the union at the workplace level. The
job of the Steward is to investigate concerns, represent member
interests and protect member rights . There are many union
Stewards, although not necessarily one in every work site.
The Steward is the key union contact at the worksite for most all
labour relations matters.

(b)

Business Representatives/Union Staff
The union has full time paid staff to assist union members and
Stewards with issues that arise in the day to day administration of
the collective agreement in the workplace. These individuals also
assist employees with grievances and conduct negotiations on
behalf of the union. Whenever a grievance or issue which is not
readily resolved at the worksite arises, union staff become involved.

(c)

Elected Officers of the Union

Sub-Section 6.07
Labour/Management Relations

Date

Page
25 October 2002

6 of 8

The union has its own constitution and by-laws which require it to
hold elections every two years for various executive positions. Of
these, only the president is a full time position.
Generally, elected union officials are not involved in the day to day
administration of the collective agreement and do not participate
directly in grievances, adjudications or negotiations.
An employee who is also a union representative may seek leaves
of absence from time to time in order to fulfill the duties of the office
they hold (Article 24). These individuals must seek the leave and
management retains discretion to grant or withhold such leaves in
certain circumstances.
3.05

Key Management Resources
(a)

HR Managers
Each department’s HR Manager is aware of all issues in the
department involving employees and to be effective must be kept
informed by supervisors and managers of what’s going on. As well,
the HR Managers across government meet regularly as a group.
This presents the opportunity to consult within that peer group on
issues which may be of concern across departmental lines.
The departmental HR Manager is also in a position to keep senior
departmental management updated on labour relations issues
within the department.

(b)

Senior Management
There are some matters, such as misconduct warranting significant
discipline, on which it is necessary to consult with senior
management in the department.

(d)

Public Service Commission
Beyond the departmental level, there is expertise available from the
Labour Relations Section of the Commission. Staff of that Section
hold the employer’s corporate memory in labour relations matters
and are experienced in dealing directly with the union on a variety

Sub-Section 6.07
Labour/Management Relations

Date

Page
25 October 2002

7 of 8

of issues.
If you and your HR Manager are uncertain about how to proceed,
consult with one of the staff of the Section before taking action.
3.06

Communication With The Union
(a)

Duty to Consult
In certain circumstances, there is a requirement to consult with the
union. For example, if the employer is seeking to change the hours
of work for one or more employees, there must be consultation with
both the union and the affected employees prior to implementing
any change.

(b)

Joint Consultation - (Article 30)
The Employer agrees to continue consulting with the Union on all
matters which affect or may affect the terms and conditions of
employment of employees.
The employer and the union have over time developed an
understanding that this provision applies only in the case of a major
change which would have a significant impact on a number of
employees.
When considering doing something which might bring Article 30
into play, contact your HR Manager who will contact the Labour
Relations Section of the Public Service Commission for guidance
on how to proceed.

(c)

Wise to Consult
Even though there may not be an obligation to consult with the
union on a certain matter, it may still be wise to do so. Putting the
union in the picture gives them the opportunity to become informed
on an issue, ask questions and let you know what kinds of
problems may be anticipated.
Consultation with the union acts as a check on management to
ensure that employees will be kept informed of upcoming changes.
Effective consultation with the union on matters which are of
concern to them and their members is also a way to build trust,
show respect and generally keep lines of communication open. It is

Sub-Section 6.07

not about seeking permission.

PEI Public Service Commission
Government Departments / Agencies

Policy for the Prevention and Resolution
of Harassment in the Workplace

1.

The Government of Prince Edward Island, as the Employer, and the Union of Public
Sector Employees have jointly developed a policy for the Prevention and Resolution
of Harassment in the Workplace to:
•
•
•

This policy applies to any employee who performs work in any Civil Service
workplace. Where applicable, the policy also applies to volunteers, contractors, fee
for service individuals and clients.

POLICY STATEMENT
3.01

4.

Promote, establish and maintain a harassment free workplace.
Provide procedures for investigating and resolving complaints of harassment,
and remedying situations where instances of harassment occur.
To meet the Government of Prince Edward Island’s ethical and legal
obligations to provide a harassment free work environment.

APPLICATION
2.01

Page 2

PURPOSE
1.01

2.

Amended: July 11, 2006

The Government of Prince Edward Island is committed to providing a workplace in
which all persons can expect to be treated with dignity and respect. Harassment
undermines an individual’s self-respect and adversely affects work performance and
well-being. It also reduces the productivity and effectiveness of the public service
enterprise. All employees have the right to work in an atmosphere free of
harassment.

DEFINITIONS
Complaint is an allegation of harassment which is based on actions defined as harassment
in this policy.
Complainant is an employee who believes that they have been a victim of harassment and
who has filed a complaint under this policy.
Days means working days.
Harassment in the workplace includes personal harassment, sexual harassment, and abuse
of authority.
a)

Personal Harassment means any unwarranted, offensive behaviour that is known or
ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome. It includes any comment, conduct,
gesture or display that demeans, intimidates or causes embarrassment to another
person. Personal harassment includes, but is not limited to, harassment on the basis
of race, religion, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, ethnic or

Policy for the Prevention and Resolution
of Harassment in the Workplace

Amended: July 11, 2006

Page 3

national origin, age, physical or mental disability or political belief.
b)

Sexual Harassment means any conduct, comment, gesture or contact of a sexual
nature that is likely to cause offense, embarrassment or humiliation to the recipient;
or that might, on reasonable grounds, be perceived by the recipient as placing a
condition of a sexual nature on employment or on any opportunity for training or
promotion, or on receipt of a service or benefit provided by the Employer. It is not
flirtation, chit chat or good natured jesting that is sometimes part of office life when
both parties find the conduct acceptable.

c)

Abuse of Authority means an individual’s use of power and authority inherent in the
position held in a manner which serves no legitimate work purpose and which ought
reasonably to be known to be inappropriate. It includes misuses of power which are
intimidating, coercive or demeaning.
The legitimate and proper exercise of the employer’s right to supervise or manage
(for example, performance reviews, work evaluation and disciplinary measures taken
for any valid reason) does not constitute harassment under this policy.

Mediation is a voluntary process used to resolve conflict by having a neutral person help the
disputing parties arrive at a mutually acceptable solution.
Respondent is an employee of the Government of Prince Edward Island who has been
accused of Harassment.
Workplace includes but is not limited to the actual work site, lunchrooms, or cafeterias, a
client’s home or work site, training sessions, conferences, business travel, work-related
social gatherings, or other location where an employee is engaged in activity associated with
employment, such as on-line communication, i.e., emails, etc.
Workplace Conflict is any ongoing inappropriate and disrespectful behavior at the workplace
and/or a dispute or a communication breakdown between two or more individuals that
impact their ability to work productively and cooperatively in the workplace, and potentially
result in a hostile work environment.
5.0

RESPONSIBILITIES
While it is recognized that all employees share responsibility for creating a harassment-free
workplace, it is important to emphasize that managers/supervisors, by virtue of their
authority, carry a greater responsibility for maintaining this type of work environment.

9.0

a supervisor, manager or director in the department or agency providing the
service;
the deputy head or chief executive officer of the department or agency.

PROCEDURE
9.01

Early & Informal Resolution Process
The objective of early resolution is to resolve any situation or conflict as soon as
possible in a fair and respectful manner without having to resort to the formal
complaint process. Every effort should be made to resolve problems early, with open
communication and in a cooperative manner. The use of problem resolution
mechanisms such as coaching, counselling, and mediation can, in many instances,
resolve issues and prevent situations from escalating to the point where filing a
formal complaint is necessary.
It is important that the Complainant make the issue known to the Respondent as soon
as possible in an attempt to resolve the problem.
a)

If the Complainant feels comfortable, he or she should do so directly, either
in person or in writing.

b)

If the complainant feels uncomfortable, he or she should do so with help from

Policy for the Prevention and Resolution
of Harassment in the Workplace

Amended: July 11, 2006

Page 7

a Supervisor or Human Resources staff person.
If the problem is not resolved, the Complainant may meet with his or her supervisor,
or with another person in authority whom he or she trusts, or seek advice from his
or her union or from Human Resources.
9.02

Formal Resolution Process
If early and informal resolution is not successful or is not desired or considered
appropriate by either party, the complainant has the right to file a formal complaint.
Step 1 - Filing a complaint
The complainant will submit a complaint in writing to the appropriate deputy head
or chief executive officer, with a copy to the Director of Classification and Employee
Relations, P.E.I. Public Services Commission.
If a complainant is not comfortable filing a complaint with the deputy head or the
chief executive officer, the complaint may be filed directly with the Director of
Classification and Employee Relations, P.E.I. Public Service Commission.
The complaint should include the nature of the allegation; the name of the
respondent; the relationship of the respondent to the complainant (for example,
supervisor, colleague); the date and a description of the incident(s); and, if
applicable, the names of witnesses. The information provided should be precise and
describe any attempts to resolve the situation.
Complaints should be submitted in as timely a manner as is comfortable for the
complainant, keeping in mind that the more time that elapses, the more difficult it is
to substantiate the complaint. It is the complainant's responsibility to check the time
lines in any other forums they wish to pursue, for example, PEI Human Rights.
The Deputy Minister will acknowledge receipt of the complaint, and after
consultation with Human Resources and/or the Public Services Commission, may
enact interim measures which may be requested by either the Complainant or the
Respondent and may be recommended by Departmental Human Resources and/or
the Public Services Commission.
Step 2 - Investigation
All investigations will be led by a team of two people. The composition of the team
will be decided by departmental management and the Public Services Commission.
Factors such as gender, perception of bias and experience & training in
investigations will be considered when determining the composition of the team.

Policy for the Prevention and Resolution
of Harassment in the Workplace

Amended: July 11, 2006

Page 8

Once the team has been appointed, contact will be initiated with the Complainant and
the Respondent within 30 days. During the interview process the team will obtain
written statements from the Complainant, the Respondent, and any named witnesses.
At the end of the investigation the Team will submit a final report stating whether,
on a balance of probabilities, the harassment complaint is substantiated. This report
may include recommendations, and will be submitted to the Deputy Head, copied to
the C.E.O. of the Public Service Commission.
Note: Records of a formal complaint and any supporting documentation will be kept
in the employee relations files and can only be accessed by the Departmental
Director of Human Resources, and those that need the file for investigative purposes.
Only in the event of discipline will any record of the complaint be kept on the
applicable personnel file.
Step 3 - Resolution & Corrective Action
a)

Remedies

Each case will require individual and impartial consideration. Remedies may include
a range of actions. The complainant shall be given an opportunity to provide a
written explanation of how this experience has affected him/her. This will be
considered by the investigative team before a recommendation is made to the
employer. The employer will make every reasonable effort to remedy the effects of
the harassment and to ensure a positive work environment free from harassment.
After reviewing the report submitted by the Investigative Team, the Deputy Head or
Chief Executive Officer will consult with the Public Service Commission and
Departmental Management, and will determine, the corrective measures to be taken.
Other remedial or disciplinary measures will follow when necessary.
b)

Mediation

When appropriate or requested, the Investigative Team will initiate a mediation
procedure through Employee Assistance Program, which is the recommended avenue
of resolution. Consensual mediation will require the agreement of the complainant
and the respondent.
•

The mediation process and resolution will be kept strictly confidential by all
participants;

•

Where a resolution is reached, the complainant and the respondent must
agree in writing to the resolution, and the matter will then be considered
concluded.

Policy for the Prevention and Resolution
of Harassment in the Workplace

Amended: July 11, 2006

Page 9

The referral should, where possible, include a written statement from the
complainant and the respondent, which succinctly outlines the issue(s) in dispute.
c)

Discipline

Any disciplinary action taken will be based on the circumstances surrounding the
situation and the severity of the behavior. Penalties can be very serious. In
appropriate cases, suspension or dismissal can occur. In all cases where an employee
is disciplined, documentation will be placed in the employees personnel file.
Circumstances which could result in disciplinary action include, but are not limited
to:
•
•
•

•

a finding that harassment has occurred;
inaction of an employee with supervisory or managerial responsibilities who
is aware of a situation of harassment;
a threat or retaliation against a person who lodges an informal or formal
complaint of harassment, or who assists in any way with the administration
of this policy;
a false allegation of harassment that is made in bad faith or is retaliatory in
intent.

Step 4 - Written Decision
The investigative team shall forward a written report to the Deputy Minister and
Human Resources Manager and to the Director of Employee Relations of the Public
Service Commission. The employer will notify the complainant and the respondent
of the results of the investigation and will consult with the Public Service
Commission on the implementation of recommendations. The union will be notified
of the results of the investigation when a corresponding grievance has been filed.
9.03

Appeals
Appeals can be made through the grievance procedure of the applicable Collective
Agreement, to the Departmental Deputy Minister, or to the Director of Classification
and Employee Relations of the Public Service Commission, if the employee is an
excluded staff member. In the event of a conflict with the Deputy another
Department head will be appointed to hear the grievance.

If harassment is based on one of the grounds of discrimination prohibited under the
Provincial Human Rights Act, employees have the right to file a complaint with the Prince
Edward Island Human Rights Commission.

The objectives of this policy are:
a)
to raise awareness and understanding of the value of diversity;
b).

to identify and change policies, procedures and practices that have
an adverse effect on designated group members;

c)

to increase opportunities for qualified members of the designated
groups to obtain meaningful employment within the public service;
and

d)

to fully utilize the diverse range of skills, knowledge and perspectives.

APPLICATION
2.01

While this policy does not specifically apply to other crown corporations listed
in Schedule “B” and reporting entities listed Schedules “C” and “D”, the spirit
and intent of the policy should serve as a guideline for those corporations in
developing their own internal policies.

PRINCIPLES
3.01

4.

Date

The Province of Prince Edward Island is committed to:
a)

valuing and welcoming diversity in its staff and clients and building a
workforce that is free from all forms of harassment and discrimination;

b)

equitable opportunities to employment and promotions based upon
qualifications;

c)

creating and providing quality services that are inclusive, innovative
and flexible in meeting public needs; and

d)

monitoring, reporting results and ensuring accountability of all
departments for the implementation of the diversity policy.

DEFINITIONS
4.01

Adverse Effect means the effect of an employment practice or process
which excludes any designated group from employment opportunities or
creates inequality in the workplace.

4.02

Departmental Diversity Plan refers to a component of the departmental
human resource plan which is focused on goals and activities to achieve
diversity within its workforce.

4.03

Designated Groups are the groups who have experienced employment
disadvantage in the past and are currently under represented in the
workplace. These groups include, but are not limited to:
a)

Aboriginal peoples:
An Aboriginal person is a North American Indian or a member of a
First Nation, Métis, and Inuit. North American Indians or members of
a First Nation include status, treaty or registered Indians, as well as
non-status and non-registered Indians.

Status Indians are persons of Aboriginal ancestry who are registered
as Indians according to The Indian Act.
Non-status Indians are Indian people or those who are descendants
of Indian people, who have lost the right to be registered as Indians
defined by The Indian Act, but who identify with the Indian community
culturally and/or linguistically.
Métis are people who have Aboriginal ancestry, those who selfidentify as Métis, and those who are recognized by the Métis Nations.
Inuit are the Aboriginal inhabitants of Northern Canada.

4.04

b)

Persons with Disabilities:
A person who has a long term or recurring condition or health
problem which limits the kind or amount of activity that he/she can do
in the workplace; or
believes that he/she is perceived by others as limited in the kind or
amount of work which he/she can do because of a physical, mental,
sensory, psychiatric or learning impairment.

c)

Members of Visible Minorities
Members of visible minority groups are persons other than Aboriginal
peoples, who are non-white in color/race regardless of place of birth.
They are a diverse group. Examples of these groups include those
whose ancestry is: African, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino,
Korean, West Asian, Pacific Islanders, East Asian, South/Southeast
Asian and Latin American.

d)

Women in Leadership and Management and Women and Men in
Non-Traditional Occupations
The distribution of women and men in the public service generally
reveals a pattern of women working in support and service roles and
men in leadership and decision making roles.
Participation in occupations reveals similar clustered patterns of men
and women in technical and professional careers. Both these
conditions are the result of stereotypes about the kinds of work
thought to be appropriate for women and men.

Diversity refers to the recognition and acknowledgment of individual

Sub-Section 7.02
Diversity and Equity Policy

Date

differences. An organization participating in diversity management seeks to
provide equitable treatment for all employees. The organization does this by
moving past equal treatment where differences are ignored, to equitable
treatment where differences are recognized, acknowledged and valued.

5.

4.05

Employment Equity means positive measures focused on preventing
and/or correcting discriminatory employment practices that affect the
workforce representation rates of Aboriginal peoples, persons with
disabilities, visible minority communities and women in management and
non-traditional occupations.

4.06

Systemic Discrimination is discrimination resulting from policies, practices
and procedures that have disproportionate effects on different groups of

PURPOSE
1.01

2.

Date

This policy applies to all new classified employees of the PEI Government.

PRINCIPLES
3.01

A formal orientation program provides an employer with an opportunity to
make new employees feel welcome, familiarizes new hires with important
information about the organization and hopefully starts off the employment
relationship on a positive note.

3.02

It is believed that time spent orientating a new employee will result in
having an employee who is able to function effectively and efficiently in a
minimum period of time.

POLICY
4.01

A planned orientation program will be provided to help all new employees
become familiar with Government, their Department and their job.

4.02

An Employee Reference Guide (attachment 5.01) is available to new
employees, however this does not replace the necessity of having an
employee participate in a formal orientation program.

4.03

Orientation to Department
a)

Whether the Department develops its own orientation package or
uses the “Orientation Checklist for New Employees- Public Service
Commission” (attachment 5.02), it is the responsibility of the
immediate supervisor to ensure that new employees receive proper
orientation to their new Department. (The Public Service
Commission sends out Attachment 5.02 along with a copy of the
offer letter to the immediate supervisor when a new employee is
hired through the Public Service Commission.)

b)

The orientation checklist provides a general outline which can be

Sub Section 8.01

WELCOME TO THE PEI PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT
Welcome to the Provincial Government! You are now a member of the dynamic Public
Service Team. The goal of our team is to provide PEI with exceptional public service
achieved through a committed workforce.
The Employee Reference Guide is a quick information guide for the PEI Provincial
Government.
Newcomers and experienced employees will find the Reference Guide helpful. It
provides an overview of government guidelines, including policies, programs and
services. The Reference Guide will also acquaint you with your rights and
responsibilities as an employee of the public service.
The book is a general guide, but will also tell you where to find additional information on
many services and employee programs. As well, your Departmental Human Resource
Office can answer any additional questions you may have.
The Reference Guide is intended to be utilized during an employee's orientation and
throughout his/her employment with the public service.

THE ROLE OF THE PUBLIC SERVANT
Every day Islanders are reminded of Public Service employees' high standards,
commitment to service and dedication to the well-being of our province. Together we
have ensured that residents of PEI can count on a first class Public Service. As Public
Servants we are drawn together through the values we share and our commitment to
the social and economic prosperity of our province.
Each individual in the Public Sector of our province plays an essential role in the
delivery of quality service to the public. The provincial government values strong
leadership, teamwork and respect for clients and employees. We are working to
become a leader in all aspects, not just for ourselves, but so that we can better serve
Prince Edward Island.

components of skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions. The evaluation is
conducted by staff of the Public Service Commission. The salary is determined through
negotiations with the Union.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST GUIDELINES
Public trust in government depends to a large degree on the honesty, integrity, fairness
and good faith of civil service employees. This trust is compromised when an
employee's interest and the public interest conflict.
Guidelines have been developed with an aim to strike a balance between protection of
the public interest and protection of the employee's interest. The performance of an
employee's official duties must not be compromised by private or personal interests.
The overriding interest to be served is always the public interest.
Conflict of interest exists in any situation in which an employee either for himself/herself
or some other person(s), attempts to promote a private or personal interest which
actually or apparently:
a)

interferes with the objective exercise of the employee's duties in
the civil service

b)

is advanced or enhanced because of the employee's position with
the government

Each employee is responsible for taking the necessary actions to prevent conflicts of
interest from arising and resolving those that do arise.
All employees are required to complete a declaration which identifies areas of potential
conflict. These statements are reviewed by the Deputy Head. The responsibility for
determining whether or not an employee is in conflict of interest rests with the Deputy
Head.
If you have any questions on the Conflict of Interest Guidelines, contact your Deputy's
office or your departmental Human Resources office.

employees, public service clients and anyone whose care or security is entrusted to the
Government to be free from harassment in the workplace. It confirms the commitment of
Government to provide a workplace in which all persons can expect to be treated with
dignity and respect. The Workplace Harassment Policy defines three types of
harassment: Personal Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Abuse of Authority.
Questions related to this policy should be directed to your Departmental Human

Occupational Health and Safety Program
The purpose of the Occupational Health and Safety Program is to stimulate among
employees a commitment to safety which is reflected in every activity they undertake.
When this is accomplished, favourable safety performance inevitably follows, with a
corresponding reduction in human misery, lost productivity and expenditures.
It is the responsibility of each employee to take reasonable care to protect his or her
safety and that of other workers present at the workplace and cooperate with the
employer in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Act and the
Occupational Health and Safety Program guidelines.
It is also the employee's responsibility to report workplace hazards to the supervisor and
Occupational Health and Safety Committee and report all accidents promptly and
accurately to the supervisor.
The Occupational Health and Safety Program is administered by the Public Service
Commission. The program coordinator can be contacted at 368-4189 and the Safety
Officer at 368-5820.
Employment Opportunities
The authority for staffing positions within the civil service comes from the Civil Service
Act. The collective agreement between the Province and the Union of Public Sector
Employees outlines the staffing process to be used in staffing classified positions and
temporary assignments.
As specified in the Civil Service Act and the collective agreement, positions may be
advertised in-department, in-service, or open to the public. Job postings are displayed
on bulletin boards within the relevant department for an in-department posting and on
bulletin boards throughout government for in-service and open competitions. Open
competitions are also advertised in local papers and posted on the internet.
The Act and collective agreement outline the eligibility for the various types of
competitions.

Date

This policy applies to departments and agencies covered by the Civil
Service Act.

POLICY
3.01

Performance Development Plans are to be completed at least every 12
months with all employees, but may be completed more frequently, if
required. The Performance Development Process is a participatory
process for all employees, linking an individual’s work plans and
performance to the overall vision of the organization. The focus is on
fostering open communication, being proactive, responding to difficulties
in a timely manner through a problem solving approach, and recognizing
success. Individual and organizational goals are mutually compatible
within a work environment dedicated to helping people who are already
good at their jobs and striving to perform even better.

3.02

The Performance Development Process is not an event, or a series of
events; it is an ongoing cycle that needs to be used year round.

3.03

The Performance Development cycle consists of three parts:

PROCEDURES

Vision
a)

The first phase of Performance Development involves Performance
Planning where the supervisor and employee engage in a
discussion on the vision of the organization, who the clients are,
and the primary responsibilities of the position. It is important that
there is a common understanding so that efforts can be focused
towards the fulfilment of the organizational vision.

b)

This section of the Performance Plan is meant to reinforce the
understanding of the work unit’s vision by asking how this position
contributes to its achievement.

Clients
a)

Clients are people who benefit from the services of Government
and may be internal or external.

b)

This is an important step because, by identifying who is on the
receiving end of services, it is more likely that the unique needs of
the customers will be anticipated and focused on.

Primary Work Responsibilities:
a)

b)

Ideally, four to six primary responsibilities for the position should
be identified. Primary responsibilities must focus employees’
activities to provide clients with the highest quality service.
Agreement must be reached between the supervisor and the
employee on these primary responsibilities before proceeding to
the work plan.

The following guidelines will assist in the identification of primary
responsibilities:

perform the work of the position at a satisfactory level. The
supervisor and employee should discuss what these skills or
competencies are so that there is a common understanding.
These competencies will be expected in the performance of the
employee and will be reviewed at the end of the Performance
Development cycle.

Professional and Career Development
a)

With the many changes that exist in the work world today, it is vital
that employees stay current so that they can provide the best
possible service to the citizens of the province. Enhancing the
professional and career development of employees requires a joint
commitment from the employee and the management of the
organization.

b)

Employees are expected to identify any career aspirations they
have. This may involve further development in their current
position, or employees may be interested in developing their
career so they may move to another level, or another field of
employment within the public sector. Individual employees and
organizations can both benefit from a focus on career
development.

c)

Employees are asked to identify specific learning opportunities.
This could include courses, as well as projects or temporary
assignments.

Work Plan: Goal Setting

Sub-Section 8.02
Performance Development
Planning

a)

Date

A significant activity in the planning phase is the development of a
work plan for the upcoming review period. The work plan is
developed jointly without supervisor and many relate to:

primary work responsibilities
areas requiring improvement
career or professional development goals
organizational goals

b)

It is important to remember that the achievement of goals is a
cooperative effort between employees and their supervisor. Both
of these parties have a role to play.

c)

Goals are best stated in measurable terms and should be reviewed
periodically during the Performance Development Cycle. Additional
goals may be identified during the cycle and should be added to
the Performance Development Plan.
Remember that goals should meet the following criteria:

Organizational Improvements

-

This section gives employees an opportunity to make suggestions
for improvements or changes to the way the work is done or the
way the unit operates.

Performance Coaching
a)

This is an important phase of the Performance Development
Process. Employees need regular ongoing feedback on their
performance. Coaching to improve performance should occur
informally throughout the cycle and formally during interim reviews.

b)

Coaching can happen at any time as employees should expect
feedback on their accomplishments or when they need to identify

Sub-Section 8.02

and overcome obstacles.
c)

4.09

When on-going coaching occurs, good performance is recognized
and issues surrounding our expected performance can be
addressed as necessary. Positive reinforcement is the most
effective means of obtaining desired results.

Performance Review
This is the final phase in the performance development process. It is
meant to be a summation of interim reviews. There should be no
surprises at performance review time. This formal review should be
completed at least annually but may be completed more frequently, if
required.

4.10

Interim Reviews
Supervisors may conduct interim reviews during the performance cycle to
review and document any changes to the work plan. This may also
provide an opportunity for formal feedback.

4.11

Annual Review Meeting
The date for the review meeting should allow both the supervisor and
employee time to prepare. Prior to the review meeting, the supervisor and
employee should individually review the work plan and make notes on the
results achieved.
The review meeting is an opportunity for us to discuss our performance
during the year and to discuss the results of the work plan.

Successful review meetings should include:

Written Review
Once the results of the work plan have been determined, the supervisor

Sub-Section 8.02

should summarize these results in the results achieved section of the
work plan from the previous work plan.
The review should also identify factors which may have affected the
results of the work plan.
(i)

Supervisor’s Comments
Supervisors will provide a summary of the overall performance.
Supervisors will comment on how the work plan unfolded and
summarize achievements.

(ii)

Employee’s Comments
Employees are given an opportunity to comment on the
performance review in the employee’s comments section.

(iii)

Deputy Head, C.E.O., or Designate’s Comments
The completed Performance Development Plan document is sent
through the appropriate channels to the deputy head, C.E.O., or
designate for signature. Any comments made by the deputy or
designate must be shared with employees.

(iv)

Distribution of the Completed PD Plan
A copy of the completed signed Performance Development Plan is
to be provided to the employee and a copy is placed in the
employee’s personnel file.

8.03 FRENCH LANGUAGE TRAINING

AUTHORITY:

CIVIL SERVICE ACT/REGULATIONS

ADMINISTRATION:

PEI PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION

Sub Section 8:03
French Language Training

1 of 4

The purpose of this policy is to provide information on the French Language
Training programs provided through the Language Training Centre of the
PEI Public Service Commission.

APPLICATION
2.01

3.

Page
01 October 2002

PURPOSE
1.01

2.

Revised Date

This policy applies to employees of the classified and casual divisions of the
P.E.I. Government.

POLICY
3.01

The French Language Training Program (FLTP) offers learning opportunities
in a variety of formats for bilingual and non bilingual employees. The goal of
the centre is to maintain and improve the quality of French offered through
provincial government services to the public and to provide development
opportunities in learning French for all government employees. The
curriculum is based on the Language Training Canada Program and uses a
communicative approach effective for use of French on the job as well as in
social contexts.

3.02

Employees may apply at any time for the part-time basic conversation
program which takes place over two semesters; September to December and
January to April. The training is free. There may be a small fee for materials.
Each semester provides a total of 56 hours for Basic and 23 hours for
Maintenance.

3.03

Daytime beginner courses are advertised on a regular basis throughout the
year to assist government employees with the Active Offer of Services as
part of the French Language Services Implementation.

3.04

Advanced programs are also provided to maintain and extend the oral and
written skills of bilingual employees.

3.05

To apply for most courses, the employee must submit an application
(attachment 4.01) to the French Language Training Centre.

3.06

Supervisor approval is not required for courses offered on employee time, but
is required for employees wishing to take the Basic Program on a shared
time basis, 50/50 split of employee/employer time.

Sub Section 8:03

Revised Date

Page
01 October 2002

3.07

Supervisors and Managers may use the Government Priority Levels listed on
the application form as a guide in deciding to grant attendance on
government time. The total commitment over one semester of the Basic
Program is 56 hours with the employer committing 28 hours of work time
over 14 weeks on the split format. Granting this time for motivated employees
can be considered an investment by government as it strives to bring up the
level of French services being offered across the province.

3.08

Managers may consult the French Language Training Centre for assistance
in meeting specialized training needs of bilingual employees. Managers
should give priority to provide this training on government time and
understand that there may be associated costs to their Department. It should
also be noted that FLTP is not the only source of training. The Centre can
assist managers in identifying available options.

3.09

Finally, where there exists a group of employees within a specific work unit,
the Centre can tailor a course to the group using vocabulary and work
situations from that field. Health and tourism are good examples where this
has worked well.

PURPOSE
1.01

2.

Date

This policy applies to all employees who are in designated bilingual positions
or entering into designated bilingual positions.

POLICY (Bilingual Positions)
3.01

Employees in designated bilingual positions are required to maintain an
advanced level of speaking proficiency or higher based on the language
proficiency scale adopted from the Province of New Brunswick. The
Language Training Centre is responsible for maintaining current information
on the proficiency levels of all evaluated employees. The information is
available to human resource managers on the Provincial Human Resource
Management System (HRMS).

3.02

Employees coming into designated bilingual positions through competition
will be referred by the staffing process to language testing to ensure they
have the required levels prior to being offered a bilingual position.

3.03

Employees achieving Advanced Plus level are granted an exemption
excluding them from the future testing. Advanced level employees will be
called for re testing every two years. On rare occasions where an employee
is operating in a bilingual position with an Intermediate plus level, testing will
be annual with the expectation that this employee achieve an Advanced
level within two years.

POLICY ( Bilingual Employees)
3.04

To be considered able to provide backup function to a bilingual position and
listed as a bilingual resource for the province, an employee must maintain an
Intermediate plus level in spoken French. To maintain this standing, the
Language Training Centre will invite employees to an interview every two
years as close as possible to the anniversary date of their last interview.

3.05

Bilingual employees are rated by the same system as for designated

Sub-Section 8:04
French Proficiency Evaluations

Date

Page
01 October 2002

2 of 3

positions. Interviews range in duration from 20 to 30 minutes. The process
is voluntary.

4.

3.06

Bilingual employees wanting to be tested should contact the French Services
or Human Resource person for their department who will in turn make
arrangements with the Language Training Centre. The employee will be
called with a time and a place for the interview. The department and the
employee will receive a written report noting the date of the interview, the
level, comments and recommendations. Ratings will be entered on HRMS.

3.07

An audio recording is made of each interview and kept at the Centre for one
month. In the event of disagreement with the rating, the tape will be
reviewed by another qualified interviewer for an independent decision. On
rare occasions where the interviewers do not agree the candidate may be
requested to do another interview.

3.08

Assessment of speaking proficiency is also available to provincial
government employees enrolled in French courses for purposes of career
and personal development. Annually, the Centre will invite these employees
for voluntary evaluation of their spoken French. No approval is required.

3.09

If an employee has taken concrete steps to improve his or her French,
he/she may ask for a re-evaluation within 6 months of their last evaluation.

1 of 9

PURPOSE
1.01

This policy is based on a Joint Union/Management Agreement and is
designed to give employers and employees a basic understanding of how
the program works.

1.02

The mission of EAP is to contribute toward the total health of employees in
order to have a productive and satisfied workforce. This is accomplished
in a two-fold manner: 1) through confidential counselling offered to
employees whose job performance is (or has the potential to be)
adversely affected by personal or work-related stress; and 2) through
timely group sessions focusing on wellness programming delivered in the
worksite.

APPLICATION/ELIGIBILITY
2.01

3.

Date

The program is available to all probationary and permanent employees,
contract employees, interns, as well as all other employees with six
months continuous service, within all provincial government departments,
agencies and commissions and the regional education and health boards
and immediate family members.

PRINCIPLES
3.01

Management and Union working together can help employees deal with
personal or work-related stressors which can lead to deteriorating work
performance.

3.02

The Employee Assistance Program applies equally to all employees as
defined in Section V of the handbook.
(http://iis.peigov/gov’t/psc/eaphandbook.pdf)

3.03

The Employee Assistance Program respects confidentiality and privacy of
information.

3.04

EAP encourages employees to voluntarily seek help for personal problems
which may affect job performance.

3.05

EAP offers assistance for a wide range of problems which may include
physical, emotional, marital or family distress; legal or financial problems,
various addictions; issues of harassment, job-related stress or job conflict.

Section 8.05
Employee Assistance Program

4.

Date

Page
01 October 2002

3.06

The supervisor or manager is responsible for identifying with the employee
when job performance is below standard, not for diagnosing a personal
problem. EAP works with management and unions to offer early
intervention in wellness programming in the workplace.

3.07

The Employee Assistance Program recognizes the need for granting of
leave for the purpose of counselling and/or treatment.

POLICY
4.01

Program Operation
(a)

The program acts as an assessment, short-term service and
referral system, if necessary. Early recognition of a problem is the
goal to enable an employee to receive help before a crisis
develops.

(b)

The program is not a method of avoiding discipline, nor is it to be
used by management as a disciplinary measure. The intent is to
allow employees the chance to voluntarily seek help with personal
problems which may affect work performance.

(c)

Any employee can consult with EAP concerning access to the
program, how to raise a concern regarding a co-worker or
supervisor experiencing problems, or to ask general information,
(i.e., resources available in the community).
Any worksite can request a group session on wellness
programming.

(d)

4.02

There shall be an Advisory Committee composed of
representatives from: The Government of Prince Edward Island; the
Regional Health Authorities; The Department of Education; the
Union of Public Sector Employees; the PEI Teachers’ Federation;
the Canadian Union of Public Employees; the PEI Nurses Union;
the International Union of Operating Engineers, as well as EAP
Coordinator/staff as advisors.

should consult with the EAP office concerning the
appropriateness of the offer.

(iii)

The following steps shall govern an employer-initiated offer
of assistance:

(c)

S

Informal - the supervisor shall ensure that the
employee receives an informal offer of assistance
prior to initiating a formal offer of assistance. Such
offers shall be documented. Certain behaviour could
result in an employer-initiated offer(s) without there
being previous informal offers.

S

Formal - the formal employer-initiated offer of
assistance is to be in writing on the prescribed form
(Appendix I reference http://iis.peigov/psc/index.htm),
including an appointment time with the EAP
counsellor. A formal offer of assistance is to be hand
delivered to the employee, with a copy to the EAP
Counsellor and a copy retained in a confidential
departmental/health/ school unit EAP formal offer of
assistance file in the H.R. Manager’s office.

Assessment/Short-term Counselling
(i)

An employee who contacts the EAP office will be
given an appointment at the earliest possible time.
During this initial interview, the counsellor will explain
EAP, including the confidentiality of the program and
the employee’s rights and responsibilities, according
to the Employee Agreement as outlined in Appendix

Section 8.05
Employee Assistance Program

Date

III of the EAP Handbook.
(ii)

(d)

During the assessment, the counsellor and employee
will take a detailed look at the nature and severity of
the problem. (This could involve meeting with family
members if warranted.) Upon completion of the
assessment, the counsellor and the employee will
discuss the options which appear to be most realistic
for the employee in resolving the problem. The
employee will choose the treatment service; and a
referral, if necessary, will be arranged.

Referral and Treatment
The EAP counsellor will be involved in assessment and
short-term counselling, and will be knowledgeable about the
appropriate services available in the community. The
counsellor will have the responsibility for making the referral
arrangements with the employee.

(e)

Co-ordination and Follow-up
(i)

The counsellor will work with the employee to ensure
appropriate services are received in a timely manner.

(ii)

The EAP counsellor will maintain an informal but
planned follow-up procedure.

(iii)

If the referral is self-initiated, follow-up will only be
with the employee. Contact with any treatment
agency or employer would only be at the request of
the employee.

(iv)

If the referral is employer-initiated, the counsellor will
maintain contact with employee, and maintain contact
with treatment agency to obtain information on type of
treatment (in/out patient), approximate length of time
away from work, when sessions finished, if the
treatment plan is not working, if the employee drops
out of treatment and follow-up supports are needed.

(v)

If the employee is participating in the EAP as a result
of a formal employer-initiated offer of assistance, then

Section 8.05
Employee Assistance Program

Date

Page
01 October 2002

8 of 9

the employer will be informed of the employee’s
participation level and the duration of the program as
per the agreement in Appendix II of the EAP
Handbook.

6.

(vi)

If an employee has been absent from work due to
treatment, then the EAP counsellor may facilitate and
plan the return to the worksite, where necessary, in
order to help the employee return successfully to the
workplace.

(vii)

The counsellor will maintain regular contact with
community agencies to provide feedback on how
services are being received and obtain feedback on
how EAP is being delivered.

CONFIDENTIALITY
6.01

A primary principle of EAP is to maintain confidentiality throughout every
level of the program. Legally, “confidentiality” refers to the obligation to
refrain from willingly disclosing information that has been received in
confidence and not to situations in which a court or statute compels a
person to disclose information. Consistent with the principle of
confidentiality, every reasonable effort will be made to maintain the EAP
office away from major worksites.

6.02

EAP files will contain the minimum amount of information required. Files
will be available for review by the employee at any reasonable time.

6.03

When an employee is referred to a community agency, only relevant
information to enable that agency to help the employee shall be shared.
In an employer-initiated offer of assistance, the employer will be advised
only of the employee’s participation level in the program, through a
prescribed form (Appendix II of the EAP Handbook.)

6.04

All persons employed within the EAP and the Advisory Committee are
bound by the conditions of confidentiality of the EAP.

6.05

EAP files shall be closed after two years of inactivity and deleted after
seven years.

CONCLUSION
7.01

The employers and unions are committed to the maintenance of EAP as a
service for employees requiring help. In order to maintain this
commitment, EAP must have support from managers and union
representatives as well as the willingness of employees to participate in
the program.

7.02

EAP can benefit everyone. The employees obtain help with problems that
can/are affecting work, family and their well-being. The employer benefits
by retaining employees with valuable skills and knowledge. Early use of
the program can contribute to the prevention of serious problems for the
individual employee, family and employer.

1.01

The aims of the Alcoholism, Gambling and Drug Addiction Rehabilitation
Policy and Program are:
a)
to increase the effective operation of the work unit by restoring the
employee’s job performance to an acceptable level, and
b)
to return the employee to a healthy, productive state.

1.02

This program will normally be used when an employee has not responded
to a supervisor’s request(s) to correct unsatisfactory job performance, and
where one or more of the following conditions exist:
a)
the employee admits that deteriorating job performance is caused by
the use of alcohol, gambling or drugs; or
b)
the employee is drinking and/or is under the influence on the job; or
c)
the supervisor suspects that unsatisfactory job performance is due to
alcohol, gambling and/or drug problems.

1.03

It is the employee’s responsibility to return to an acceptable level of
productivity; however, the supervisor can assist by directing the employee to
the appropriate helping agency.

1.04

In some situations an employee will self identify the need for treatment, prior
to the supervisor identifying any job performance concerns. In such
situations the employee is eligible for leave as outlined in 4.06.

PURPOSE / BACKGROUND
1.01

AIDS and HIV infection are major health and social issues. This policy exists
as part of the Employer’s commitment to maintain a healthy work
environment and to provide quality service to the public. Its specific goals
are:
(a)

To protect the rights of individual employees while maintaining a safe
work environment when dealing with HIV infected employees;

(b)

To provide current information about AIDS and HIV infection; and

(c)

To inform managers and employees about the role of the employer
and the rights of the employee when dealing with employees who are
HIV infected.

1.02

AIDS stands for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. AIDS is caused by
a virus called HIV (Human Immundeficiency Virus) which attacks and
seriously disrupts the body’s immune system. Without the protection of their
immune systems, people with AIDS can develop life-threatening infections
and cancers.

1.03

HIV infected individuals may be free from symptoms, signs or illnesses
related to the infection, or they may have developed AIDS, the most severe
stage of the illness. Most people with HIV infection are perfectly able to carry
on with normal activities, including work. HIV infection refers to all stages of
the illness including AIDS.

1.04

HIV is a fragile virus. It survives only a short time outside the human body.
It has been transmitted in very specific ways:
(a)

through unprotected sexual intercourse with a person who is infected;

(b)

by sharing needles or syringes with an infected person;

(c)

from an infected woman to her infant in the womb or during the
birthing process;

(d)

through transfusions or injections of infected blood or blood products.
Since November, 1985, all blood and blood products are screened for
HIV.

Sub-Section 9.04
Aids in the Workplace

1.05

2.

25 October 2002

2 of 4

HIV cannot be transmitted in the course of the usual interpersonal contact
occurring in the workplace. Nor can it be transmitted by casual contact with
an infected person, through insect bites, by swimming in the same pool as
an infected person, by donating blood, by embracing an infected person, etc.

APPLICATION
2.01

3.

Date

This applies to all employees of the Civil Service.

POLICY
3.01

The Employer recognizes that HIV infection is a life threatening illness, like
cancer or heart disease. Employees with HIV infection will be treated like
those with other life-threatening illnesses.

3.02

Employees with HIV infection have the right to:

3.03

3.04

(a)

continue working as long as their condition permits;

(b)

receive the same benefits coverage as is accorded to other
employees; (however, any optional life insurance that would normally
be subject to satisfactory medical evidence may be denied by the
insurance carrier.)

Non-infected employees have the right to:
(a)

a safe and healthy working environment;

(b)

information on the subject of HIV infection.

Employees infected with HIV infection may continue to work in their present
positions as long as they are able to meet the normal performance standards
of the job.
Consideration will be given to reassignment of the employee to other
responsibilities when:
(a)

The work assigned may not be performed by an employee testing HIV
positive;

(b)

The employee can no longer perform the duties of the originally
assigned position; or

The employee requests reassignment.

The Employer shall:
(a)

Avoid discriminating against any employee or client known to have
HIV infection;

(b)

Refuse to tolerate discrimination or harassment of employees known
to have HIV infection;

(c)

Provide employees with HIV infection with information on where they
can access counselling and support; (Employees Assistance
Programs, etc.)

(d)

Develop and implement an educational program on HIV infection for
employees.

Confidentiality
(a)

There is no legal requirement for a person infected with HIV, or the
attending doctor, to report their condition to the employer. Should the
employee choose to advise the employer, the employee has the right
to have this information held in strict confidence.

(b)

The Employer undertakes to ensure the information about HIV status
is disclosed only where there is informed consent on the part of the
employee concerned. For consent to be informed, it is necessary to
share with the employee why it is felt there is a need to disclose the
information, to whom it will be disclosed, and what the likely
consequences are of the employee agreeing or not agreeing to
disclosure.

(c)

If the employee’s illness reaches the point where work schedules are
disrupted or adjustments have to be made, a medical certificate may
be required, but the certificate should refer only to the employee’s
capability to continue working and need not mention HIV infection or
AIDS specifically.

Education
(a)

Information available to employees will be updated regularly to reflect

Sub-Section 9.04
Aids in the Workplace

Date

Page

new developments and resources available to employees and their
families.
(b)

3.08

The Universal Precautions System developed by the Centre of
Disease Control, Atlanta, and endorsed by the Laboratory Centre for
Disease Control, Ottawa, is to be used by employees working in areas
where they are at potential risk for contracting or exposing others to
the HIV virus. These employees must be trained in the use of
Universal Precautions.

1.

Purpose
1.01

2.

Application
2.01

3.

This policy applies to all employees who are working alone.

Definitions
3.01

4.

To provide for measures to protect the health and safety of, and minimize risk to,
any worker working at a workplace who is the only worker of the employer at that
workplace, in circumstances where assistance is not readily available to the
worker in the event of an injury, ill health or emergency. Strict adherence to this
policy will help to meet health and safety legal requirements and demonstrate due
diligence in work alone situations.

Working Alone means a worker working at a workplace who is the only worker
of the employer at that workplace, in circumstances where assistance is not
readily available to the worker in the event of injury, ill health or emergency.

Policy
4.01

Deputy Heads are responsible for ensuring a procedure for assessing working
alone situations and site specific working alone plans are developed,
implemented, communicated and enforced.

4.02

Employing Authorities shall review each worksite under their control to identify
employees who work alone.

4.03

Employing Authorities shall consult with the workplace occupational health and
safety committee or representative and with the employee who will be working
alone to assess the conditions under which the employee is working, determine
potential hazards and ways to minimize them, establish a means and schedule for
communication with a contact person and provide for assistance in an emergency
situation. The activities the employee will be doing need to be assessed for their
level of risk; higher risk activities require shorter times between communication
with the contact person. The result will be a written plan for working alone in a
specific site.

4.04

The working alone plan shall be signed and dated by both the Employing
Authority and the employee who is required to work alone.

4.05

The Employing Authority shall give a copy of the plan to each employee who is

required to work alone, and that employee’s supervisor.

Attachment 5.01

Working Alone Procedure Template
Working alone in certain circumstances, situations, or environments can increase the risk to the
health and safety of the worker. Special arrangements must be made to minimize this risk,
especially after normal working hours, as these circumstances pose an additional risk to life and
property.
Where a worker is working alone, the employer shall develop and implement written procedures
to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety of the worker from risks
arising out of, or in connection with, the work assigned.
1.

Written procedures developed shall include the following information:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)

the name, address, location and telephone number of the employer;
the nature of the business conducted at the workplace;
identification of the possible risks to each worker working alone that arise from or
in connection with the work assigned;
the steps to be followed to minimize the risks identified in (d);
details of the means by which a worker who is working alone can secure, and the
employer can provide, assistance in the event of injury or other circumstances that
may endanger the health or safety of the worker.

2.

The steps referred to in 1(e) shall
•
specify the time intervals for checking on the worker. Higher risk activities
require shorter time intervals between communications with the contact person;
•
specify the person responsible for contacting the worker and recording the results
of the contact;
•
outline the process to be followed if the worker cannot be contacted, including
provisions for an emergency rescue; and
•
provide for checking with the worker at the end of the worker’s shift.
•
It is strongly recommended that handling of hazardous substances or
performing hazardous activities be prohibited when the worker is working
alone.
•
Work involving entry into confined spaces must never be conducted alone.

3.

Communicate the site-specific Working Alone Policy to all workers under their
jurisdiction and ensure understanding and compliance with the policy.

4.

Maintain documentation of the site specific Working Alone Plans and requirements
within each department.

10.01 LAYOFF AND RECALL

AUTHORITY:

ADMINISTRATION:

Civil Service Act and the Collective Agreement

Public Service Commission
Government Departments/Agencies

1.

2.

INTRODUCTION
1.01

Layoff and recall provisions are contained in Section 35 of the Civil Service
Act and Article 36 of the current collective agreement for unionized
employees, and Section 9 of the excluded terms and conditions of
employment for excluded employees.

1.02

The Deputy Head may issue a notice of layoff pursuant to Articles 36.01 36.06 of the collective agreement for classified employees and 36.07 - 36.10
for casual division employees.

1.03

The layoff of a classified employee may be necessitated by: a shortage of
work or funds; or the abolition of a position; or a material change in duties,
or organization; or where an employee’s medical condition is such that they
are unable to fulfill the functions of their position.

1.04

Where a Deputy Head intends to layoff an employee in the classified division,
they shall notify the employee, the Union and the Commission in writing (a
sample letter is attached).

APPLICATION
2.01

3.

This applies to all employees within the Civil Service with the exception of
executive division, contract and student employees.

POLICY
3.01

Once notified of an intended layoff, an employee may meet with a
representative of their department and the Commission to review vacant
positions, for which they have preference over if they are qualified and
eligible, as well as positions which may be available if displacement rights are
exercised.

3.02

Pursuant to 36.02(c), if an employee has notified the Deputy Head of their
intent to displace another employee within the same department or agency,
the following principles apply: employees shall be retained on the basis of
qualifications, knowledge, skills and abilities to perform the duties of the
positions available; and where it is determined that the employees are
relatively equal, the employee with the greatest continuous service in the
affected classification series will be retained, e.g., Professional Officer or
Administrative Support Worker.

3.03

Pursuant to Article 36.02(d), an employee of the classified division may
displace an employee of the casual division if he/she has the qualifications
and ability to perform the duties of the casual employee. An employee who
displaces a casual employee continues to be an employee of the classified
division. When the terms of employment for the displaced casual employee
expires, the classified employee can displace another casual employee.

3.04

Where the Deputy Head is satisfied that the layoff is necessary pursuant to
Article 36.01 and is in accordance with Article 36.02, the Deputy Head shall
cause a written notice of layoff to be given to the employee and the Union
(120) one hundred and twenty calendar days in advance of the layoff date
excepting cases of employees laid off under Article 36.01 (a)(iv) (medical
condition), who shall receive notice of at least (60) sixty calendar days in
advance of the layoff date.

3.05

During the notice period, an employee who chooses the transfer option shall
continue to be given preference over new employees or employees who have
not been affected by layoff, for appointment to vacant positions for which
he/she is qualified at the same or lower classification level.

3.06

Pursuant to Article 36.04, an employee subject to layoff who accepts a
position with a lower maximum rate of pay than the maximum rate of pay for
the employee’s current position shall retain the current rate of pay until such
time as the rate for the lower paid position equals or exceeds the current
rate, i.e, red-circling. The ability to be red-circled applies to positions received
before the effective layoff date.

3.07

After the effective layoff date, an affected employee has the right to recall
under Article 36.06(a)&(b). Additionally, a medical layoff has further rights
under Article 36.06(c): an employee laid off under the provisions of Article
36.01 (a)(iv) shall be placed on the appropriate recall list for a period of (18)
eighteen months from the date the employee indicates that he/she is
available for work providing that such indication is received by the
Commission within two (2) years from the date of layoff.

3.08

Article 36.06(d) states that employees on a recall list shall be given
preference over new employees or employees who have not been affected
by layoff for appointment to vacant classified positions. Appointments from
the recall list shall be made on the basis of qualifications, relative ability,
knowledge and skills. Where two (2) or more employees are considered
relatively equal, the employee with the greatest length of continuous service
shall receive the first offer of appointment. No new employees shall be hired
unless employees on the recall list have had the opportunity to be recalled.

3.09

Pursuant to Article 36.06(j)(i) recall employees who accept a position in the
classified or casual division shall be paid at the rate of pay for the position occupied.
Recall shall not result in promotion.
3.10

Article 36.06(e) states that employees on a recall list be given the first option
of filling jobs normally filled by casual division employees providing they have
the qualifications and ability to perform the available work. If an employee
accepts such casual work,
(i)

the employee shall remain on the recall list;

(ii)

the period of casual employment shall be counted towards continuous
service; and

(iii)

the employee will not be provided with a further notice of layoff on the
completion of the period of casual employment.

3.11

Article 36.06(f) states that an employee recalled shall be credited with the
period of continuous service immediately prior to being placed on a recall list
plus any additional work in the casual division pursuant to Article 36.06 (e)(ii).

3.12

Article 36.06(g) states that an employee recalled shall be credited with sick
leave accumulation and vacation leave entitlement as of the date of being
placed on the recall list.

3.13

Article 36.06(h) notes that employees are eligible for severance pay (Article
18 of the collective agreement and Section 4.09 of this manual) following the
(18) eighteen month recall period, or at any time during the recall period
providing the employee waives their recall rights.

3.14

Article 36.06(i) states that where continued coverage is provided under group
insurance plans employees shall have the option to continue group insurance
coverage while on the recall list. If employees continue coverage the
Employer agrees to continue cost-sharing arrangements.

3.15

The Deputy Head may layoff a casual division employee in accordance with
the schedule outlined in Articles 36.07 - 36.10.

10.02 TERMINATION FOR JUST CAUSE

AUTHORITY:

Civil Service Act Regulations and the Collective Agreement

1.

2.

INTRODUCTION
1.01

An employee who fails to maintain proper standards of conduct or commits
a disciplinary offense, shall be subject to disciplinary action. No employee
shall be disciplined except for just cause.

1.02

The administration of discipline is the responsibility of the deputy head.
Termination for just cause is a very serious action and must be dispensed in
accordance with the principles and steps outlined within Section 6.05 of this
manual.

1.03

Although management has the right to discipline any employee, this
discretion is qualified by the right of the employee to have protection against
unfair treatment. Therefore, the employer must be able to demonstrate “just
cause” for any disciplinary action imposed. For just cause to exist, the
requirements laid out in Subsection 3.03 of Section 6.05 must be met.

APPLICATION
2.01

3.

This applies to all employees within the Civil Service.

POLICY
3.01

Discipline is normally a progressive process except for certain kinds of
misconduct, which because of their seriousness, justify moving immediately
to a more serious penalty up to and including termination for just cause. The
framework under which termination for just cause occurs is found in the Civil
Service Act, its regulations and the UPSE collective agreement:
CIVIL SERVICE ACT
S.32(4) A department head or a deputy head may, for cause, demote or
dismiss an employee in his department or agency.
S.32 (5) An employee who is suspended, demoted or dismissed shall be
notified in writing of the reason for the action and a copy of the notification
shall be forwarded to the Public Service Commission.

REGULATIONS TO THE CIVIL SERVICE ACT
PART IX:

CONDUCT OF EMPLOYEES

33.(1)(d) dismissal or demotion is taken for repeated violations of
Government or departmental policy or for a single, serious disciplinary
offence.
(2) In this Part “dismissal” means the ending of the employment relationship
by an act of the employer for just cause, and for purposes other than a layoff.
34.(1) The deputy head may, subject to subsection (2),
(a) reprimand an employee; or
(b) suspend, demote or dismiss an employee.
(2) Where an employee of the classified division is disciplined under
clause (1)(b), the discipline awarded is subject to the approval of the
Commission.
(3) The Commission may confirm, vary or quash a disciplinary action
taken by a deputy head or delegate.
(4) Where an employee is disciplined by suspension, demotion, or
dismissal, the employer shall, within ten days from the date of such
disciplinary action, provide the employee with written reasons for such
disciplinary action. A copy of such notice shall be sent to the
Commission, and, to the Union when the employee is a member of
the Union.

UPSE COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT
Article 27 - Disciplinary or Non-Disciplinary Action
Disciplinary Action
27.01 No employee shall be disciplined except for just cause.
27.02 When an employee is disciplined by suspension, demotion or
dismissal, the Employing Authority shall provide the employee within three
(3) working days of the date of discipline with written reasons for such
disciplinary action and a copy of such notice shall be sent to the Union and
the Commission.

27.03 If an employee is to be disciplined by suspension, demotion or
dismissal and a meeting is held with the employee to administer such
discipline, the employee shall be entitled to have a Steward or Union staff
representative present.
27.04 No notice of disciplinary action or any other document concerning
disciplinary action shall be placed on an employee’s personnel file without the
employee being given an opportunity to read its contents and upon request
the employee shall be provided with an exact copy for his/her own records.
27.05 Upon the employee’s request, any notice of disciplinary action or any
other document concerning disciplinary action, other than evaluation reports
and payroll transactions, which may have been place on his/her personnel
file shall be removed after two (2) years have elapsed since the disciplinary
action was taken, provided no further disciplinary action has been recorded
during this period.
27.06 Upon the request of the employee, the Employing Authority shall
provide him/her with the opportunity to read any documents on his/her
personnel file, other than recruitment documents.
27.07 Where it is determined that an employee has been unjustly disciplined,
the employee shall be reinstated without loss of pay or any other benefit
which would have accrued if he/she had not been disciplined. Nothing in this
Article prevents the Commission or the Adjudication Board form increasing,
decreasing, or otherwise revising a disciplinary award made by an Employing
Authority.
3.02

Once a situation which has the potential for discipline comes to your
attention, your first point of contact should be your departmental HR
Manager. In turn, the HR Manager will contact the Public Service
Commission, Employee Relations Division, as the Commission provides
expertise and consistency to the handling of discipline for the employer.

3.03

A grievance of termination for just cause varies from the normal grievance
procedure and shall be submitted at the final level of the grievance
procedure as outlined within Article 26.13(b)(i)&(ii) of the current collective
agreement.

3.04

An employee terminated for just cause is not entitled to severance pay as
outlined within Article 18 of the collective agreement.

2.

Date

This policy applies to Departments and Agencies under the jurisdiction of
the Civil Service Act.

POLICY
3.01

All classified or temporary employees, with a minimum of one year
continuous service, exiting the department will be given the questionnaire
to complete and will then be interviewed. It is intended that the questions
will be answered with respect to the most recent position held by the
employee. The interview will be conducted by the Departmental HR
Manager or delegate.

3.02

The following guidelines should be followed:
C

The interviewer should possess strong interpersonal skills and
have credibility within the department.

C

The interview is to be conducted in a respectful and confidential
manner.

C

The information must be handled and shared in a sensitive manner
(ie. context; not detailed content will be shared). If there is a lack of
trust, management may mistakenly attribute causes of turnover
and other organizational problems to over-reported but comfortably
discussed explanations, or even mistake lack of discussion for an
absence of problems.

C

The questionnaire is not placed in the employee’s personnel file.

C

The process is transparent and all information (both strengths and
opportunities for improvement) is reviewed by the employee prior to
sharing with the department.

and procedures across the Civil Service.

PROCEDURES
4.01

A month prior to exit, the Human Resources Manager or suitable
designate schedules a time, during the employee’s last week, to conduct
the interview. The following steps should be followed:
C

One week prior to the interview, the employee is asked to complete
the questionnaire on his or her own.

C

Set aside at least one hour to move through the Exit Interview
Questionnaire (see attachments 5.01 & 5.02 - Exit Interview
Questionnaire and Guidelines).

C

At the interview, review the purpose of the exercise and the
process for sharing the information.

C

Review the employee’s responses and seek clarification where
necessary. Document all modifications to the employee’s
responses.

C

Review your notes with the employee to ensure he or she is
comfortable with the content. This will help to maintain trust and
establishes an accurate record.

4.02

Share relevant information within the department. If the employee is not
comfortable with the information being shared directly, only present their
feedback in summary form in conjunction with other employee’s exit
information. The summary should only contain the context of the
responses and not the actual content nor any identifying information.

4.03

Celebrate and share successes with the supervisor and within the
department.

4.04

Develop an action plan to address the opportunities for improvement.

4.05

If there are serious HR issues (eg. possible workplace harassment), the

General Policy Statement on Use of Employment Contracts
As a general working principle, staff employed by Provincial Government departments are
hired under the Civil Service Act.
In situations where an appointment under the Civil Service Act would not meet the needs
of the department, an employee may be engaged under a contractual arrangement.
All employment contracts must be in writing, and signed by both the employee and the
Minister Responsible. A copy of Government's Standard Employment Contract is
appended as Attachment 12.02-I..
This policy does not apply to professional services contracts and consultant contracts.
Individuals engaged under either of those contracts are not employees. While government
may be found liable for its employees’ negligence if such is committed in the course of
employment, those who provide services under a professional or consulting services
agreement are, generally liable for their own negligence.

(c)

Approval/Authority
Employment contracts for a term not exceeding one year, may be approved by the
May, 2001

2

SECTION 12: PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT
12.02 Employment Contracts

Minister Responsible. The Minister may also approve a maximum of two renewals for
each employment contract. Employment contracts which exceed a term of one year,
employment contract renewals where the total period of employment without a break in
service exceeds three years, employment contracts which provide a salary level in excess
of the Public Service Commission’s recommended level, and employment contracts that
provide benefits in excess of the Public Service Commission’s recommended level, require
the prior approval of Treasury Board.
(d)

Application of the Policy
This policy applies to all Provincial Government departments, as well as Crown
corporations and agencies to which the Civil Service Act applies.
This policy does not apply to professional services contracts and consultant contracts.
Individuals engaged under either of those types of contracts are not employees. While
Government may be found liable for its employees' negligence if such is committed in the
course of employment, those who provide services under a professional or consulting
services agreement are, generally liable for their own negligence.
This policy also does not apply to those appointments to the executive division enumerated
in subsection 8(1) of the Civil Service Act.

(e)

Policy Approval/Amendment
This policy and procedure direction was established by Treasury Board via Minute #422
(October, 1988) and has been amended by Management Board Minute #182/93 (August
4, 1993), Executive Council Decision #453/93 (August 11, 1993), Management Board
Minute #021/94 (May 11, 1995),Treasury Board Minute #24/01 (April 25, 2001) and
Treasury Board Minute #61/01(May 24, 2001).
In cases where an interpretation is required, such should be referred to the Policy and
Evaluation Division of the Provincial Treasury who will make the interpretation or refer the
matter to the Secretary to Treasury Board or to Treasury Board if a Board decision is
deemed necessary.

(2)

CHECKLIST - IS AN EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT APPROPRIATE?
Where circumstances indicate that an employer-employee relationship will exist with the person
to be engaged under contract, an employment contract (and not a professional services or
consultant contract) must be used.
May, 2001

SECTION 12: PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT

3

12.02 Employment Contracts

An employer-employee relationship exists where the employer can specify when, where, how and
under what conditions the work will be performed. Also, such a relationship normally dictates that,
rather than perform a specific task or amount of work, the employee puts his or her personal
services at government's disposal for a specified period of time.
The presence of one or more of the following criteria will also indicate the likely existence of an
employer-employee relationship:
(i)
the department or agency actively supervises the work;
(ii)
the department or agency provides the necessary tools, equipment and/or facilities to do
the work;
(iii)
the individual has no opportunity to profit and is not exposed to any risk of loss;
(iv)
the individual is economically dependent on Government;
(v)
the individual is precluded from subcontracting or hiring others to do part or all of the
work;
(vi)
the individual and his/her work are an integral part of the organization and its work.
(3)

PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES
Following is a checklist/guidelines of departmental responsibilities and information that should be
obtained as preparatory work prior to submitting the employment contract request to the Minister
for signature:
(a)

Job Description - develop a job description detailing:
(i)
duties and responsibilities of the position;
(ii)
qualifications and abilities required;
(iii)
terms and conditions of employment.

(b)

Job Analysis
The department "must" forward the job description and information on the prospective
employee to the Public Service Commission for analysis of the job and recommendation
of salary level. The results of this analysis will assist the department in matching the job
against existing classifications and determining an appropriate salary range and step. Where
the Minister supports a salary in excess of the Public Service Commission
recommendation, Treasury Board approval is required.

(c)

Benefit Analysis
Where the benefits offered to the prospective contract employee deviates from those laid
out in the Standard Employment Contract, the department “must” forward all relevant
information to Employee Benefits for review. The results of this analysis will assist the
department in determining proper benefit coverages. Where the Minister supports benefits
May, 2001

4

SECTION 12: PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT
12.02 Employment Contracts

that deviate from these recommendations, Treasury Board approval is required.
(d)

Background/Factors
Reason for requesting a contract rather than a term appointment, classified
position, etc.
-

If the contract replaces an existing classified position, the position number, name
of previous incumbent and last date employed.

-

Employment application containing the personnel information relating to the
proposed contract employee including name, education, experience, etc.

-

Although employment contracts normally are not approved for a term of more than
one year, long-range plans regarding this position should be noted.
If request is for a renewal, information re past contracts, term, salary, etc.

-

Ensure that any deviations from the "standard" employment contract or compared
salary for the job description proposed are noted with appropriate explanation.

-

Reference any Executive Council or Treasury Board decisions directly related to
the proposed contract.

(d)

Financial
Financial information identifying the source of funding for the contract including appropriate
account code, etc., and if the employment contract is to continue beyond the current fiscal
year, the source of continued funding.

(e)

Preliminary Discussions with Prospective Contract Employee
Arrange a meeting with any particular candidate(s) being considered for the job. The
following matters should be reviewed:
(i)
clarify that no commitment to the individual can be made before departmental
approval is obtained;
(ii)
salary range being considered by Government;
(iii)
benefit package;
(iv)
terms and conditions of employment;
(v)
answer any questions the individual has regarding the job.

THE EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT
(a)

General
Attachment 12.02-I sets out the Standard Employment Contract which has been
developed to assist users to ensure that all relevant issues are understood by both parties
at the outset of the employment. The contract form has been developed with legal
assistance to ensure that appropriate limitations on liability for the employer are in place
in the event of a dispute. This is the form to be used unless peculiar circumstances render
it inappropriate.
Only in special circumstances should an employment contract for a period greater than one
year be approved.
All employment contracts must be signed on behalf of Government by the Minister
responsible for the department, Crown corporation or agency concerned. All employment
contracts shall be dated the day on which both signatures (or the last of the two signatures)
are obtained.

(b)

Specific Matters to Note
In paragraph 2 of the standard contract, the second sentence should be deleted if the
position is not matched against a classification in the pay plan. In other words, if the
position is not matched against a classification in the pay plan, the employee will not be
eligible for any scheduled economic adjustments during the term of the contract unless the
contract specifically so states.
In paragraph 4, the term of the contract commences on the date the employee actually
starts work.
In paragraph 6, the list of benefits is the standard list offered to contract employees. Any
additions or deletions should be carefully considered. The only additional benefits which
may be permitted where circumstances warrant, are:
protective clothing and equipment;
overtime;
standby pay;
call-back pay.
In paragraph 7, indicate whether or not the employee is to participate in the Civil Service

eligible to participate in the Civil Service Superannuation Fund.
In paragraph 8, the number of months' notice of termination the employer is required to
give the employee must be determined. The appropriate period of notice depends to a
large degree on the duration of continuity of employment the employee has enjoyed. Once
an employee has two or three years of service, one month's salary may not be considered
by the Courts to be sufficient. The fact that this service may have occurred under two or
more contracts is not relevant if the contracts cover consecutive terms without a break in
service.
Paragraph 8 also provides that the "notice" may be given in equivalent pay rather than as
actual notice. This alternative may be helpful where it is not possible or appropriate for the
employee to continue working during the notice period.
While not reflected in the standard contract itself, departments should be aware that
employees who have accumulated many years service through successive contracts should
not simply be terminated at the end of the current contract without some period of
appropriate notice. As the appropriate notice period will vary from one set of
circumstances to the next, legal advice on the length of notice (or amount of pay in lieu
thereof) should be sought.
In Schedule "A", a detailed list of duties and responsibilities should be provided and should
incorporate any unusual terms or conditions of employment, e.g. night or weekend work;
work at a number of locations.
In Schedule "B", ensure that each item listed is actually reviewed with and initialled by the
employee. This should be noted to protect the department in the event of a subsequent
misunderstanding.

ADMINISTERING EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS
Departments are responsible to ensure that appropriate controls are put in place to monitor
employment contracts. One individual, usually the departmental administrator, should be assigned
the task of:
(a)

making any necessary adjustments to salary and benefits;

(b)

developing a bring-forward system so that sufficient time is available prior to expiry to
determine whether a contract employee's services will continue to be required.

ELIGIBILITY FOR PENSION
Normal Retirement: (eligible for a pension with no penalty)
C
C

Must be 60 years of age and must be vested in CSSF (5 years), or
Members with minimum of 30 pensionable years and minimum age of 55

Early Retirement: (eligible to retire but with penalty)
C
C

Must be at least 55 years of age
Must be vested in the CSSF (5 years)

PENSION BENEFIT COMPONENTS
The 2% annual accrual shown above is comprised of :
- Life-time Benefit
- Temporary Bridge Benefit

1.3 % (*)
0.7 %
-------2.0 %

It is important to note that the benefits paid from the CSSF are integrated with those paid by the
Canada Pension Plan. Initially, the two plans were integrated so that the total normal pension benefits
provided by both Plans would be equivalent to the total pension benefit provided prior introduction of
the CPP.
The CSSF provides a temporary Bridge Benefit which is paid from date of retirement until age 65, the
date at which a person is eligible for an unreduced CPP pension.
The Life-time Benefit plus the Bridge Benefit will be roughly equal to the Life-Time Benefit plus the
unreduced CPP Benefit that you can draw at age 65.

*

The life-time benefit is the full 2% for that portion of pensionable earnings in excess of the
YMPE,

Bridge Benefit Reduction:
The pension reduction at age 65 arising from the termination of the bridge benefit is calculated as follows:

x

Avg. of the 3 highest
years of CPP’s YMPE

Therefore, for an employee with an average YMPE of $30,000, the reduction and life-time benefit is:
Total Pension at age 60 Bridge Benefit Reduction at age 65 -

.02 x 27 yrs x $30,000 =
.007 x 27 yrs x $30,000 =

Life-time Pension

=

$ 16,200
$ (5,670)
-----------$ 10,530

Note: Where a surviving spouse is receiving a spousal benefit, the Bridge Benefit ceases when the
contributing member would have turned 65, not when the surviving spouse turns 65.

Calculation for Reduced Pension upon Early Retirement:
C

To begin, the unreduced pension that the employee would be eligible to draw at age 60 is
calculated. This amount is then reduced by the lessor of:
a) 3% for each year prior to age 60, or
b) 3% for each year prior to attaining 30 pensionable years.

Note: The earliest that an employee may retire is age 55, therefore, the maximum penalty is 15% (5
years x 3%).

4

E.G.

A person with 28 years of pensionable service wishes to retire at age 57. This example assumes
the person’s unreduced annual pension is $20,000. This person would incur an early retirement
penalty equal to of the lessor of :
a) 3 years (60-57) times 3% equals 9%, .09 x $20,000 = $1,800
or
b) 2 years (30-28) times 3% equals 6%,
.06 x $20,000 =
$1,200
In this case the annual pension until age 65 is $18,800 ($20,000 - $1,200).
It should be note that the penalty incurred for retiring early reduces both the temporary bridge
benefit and the life-time benefit.

DEFERRED PENSION
C

When a vested member terminates from the CSSF, he may opt to leave his contributions in the
Fund and may access his pension at retirement age (minimum age 55).

•

The deferred pension is indexed annually (see section on indexation).

REFUND OF EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS
An employee who terminates employment may or may not have to take a refund of pension
contributions. The options available depend on the member’s years of participation in the Plan.

Optional (*)

(*) Vested Members may opt to defer the pension until retirement age.
Notes:
1)
2)

Interest at the rate of 5% compounded annually is paid on refunded contributions.
An Employee who takes a refund of contributions and who is subsequently re-employed by a
participating employer of the CSSF, may restore pensionable service. To do so, the Employee
must repay to the CSSF the sum of the refund amount taken, plus interest at the CSSF’s rate of
earnings since the refund was taken.

DEATH BENEFITS
The manner in which the death benefit is paid depends on the Member’s family structure at time of death
and the Member’s status in the Plan. The following, unless noted, applies to Vested or Retired
Members.

Member’s Spouse, and if no Spouse, then to the Member’s Estate.

2)

A dependant is defined as: 1) a child under the age of eighteen; 2) a child in full-time attendance
at an institution of post secondary education, and under the age of twenty-one; or 3) a parent,
grandparent, brother, sister, child, or grandchild who is dependant on the individual by reason of
mental or physical infirmity.

INDEXATION OF PENSION BENEFIT
Indexation is applied each April 1st at the rate of increase in the Canada All-items Consumer Price
Index (CPI) to a maximum of 6%.
The pension payment received upon retirement and the value of a deferred pension benefit are both
indexed under the CSSF.

CONTRIBUTIONS FOR SERVICE PRIOR TO PERMANENT APPOINTMENT
There are circumstances where an Employee is permitted to pay into the Fund a specified amount to
establish pensionable service for “qualified service” accumulated prior to joining the CSSF. Please
contact the Employee Benefits Office for information about this option.
