OUR MARKETS
We organize 10,000 securities into three markets to better inform investors
The Best Market
The OTCQX® Best Market offers transparent and efficient trading of established, investorfocused U.S. and global companies. To qualify for the OTCQX market, companies must
meet high financial standards, follow best practice corporate governance, demonstrate
compliance with U.S. securities laws, be current in their disclosure, and be sponsored by a
professional third-party advisor. Penny stocks, shells and companies in bankruptcy cannot
qualify for OTCQX.

The Venture Market
The OTCQB® Venture Market is for early-stage and developing U.S. and international
companies. To be eligible, companies must be current in their reporting and undergo an
annual verification and management certification process. Companies must meet $0.01 bid
test and may not be in bankruptcy.

The Pink Market
The Pink® Open Market is for broker-dealers to electronically trade all types of companies.
With no minimum financial standards, this market includes foreign companies that limit
distribution of their disclosure to their home market, penny stocks and shells, as well as
distressed, delinquent and dark companies not able or willing to provide adequate
information to investors. Pink requires the least in terms of company disclosure and the
most in terms of investor research and caution.

INCREASED ACCESS TO REG. A+
OTC Markets Group Petition For Rulemaking
•

Expand Reg. A+ to include SEC Reporting Companies
•

Current in SEC reporting requirements

•

S-1 and S-3 offerings impose significant cost
•
•

•

S-3 $75 MM public float requirement
No state law preemption

Allow “at the market” offerings

Public Support for the Petition
Steven Dresner, Founder, Dealflow.com
"Given the existing framework for the "new" Regulation A, including provisions
regarding financial and other
qualitative disclosure, it would seem logical (and easy from a legislative and regulatory perspective) to broaden the
utility of Regulation A by allowing smaller publicly reporting companies to use this capital-raising option."

Douglas S. Ellenoff, Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP, New York, New York
"We believe that implementation of these requested amendments would be beneficial to smaller reporting issuers
without compromising any investor protections since, as the Petition highlights, these issuers are already required to
provide compliant and substantive disclosures."

VENTURE MARKET
OTC Markets Group is the Nasdaq of the 90’s, with today’s technology
•

•

•

Dealer markets can work better for smaller company trading
•

Registered exchanges are centralized auction markets, cannot operate dealer markets

•

Dealers create liquidity in smaller companies
•

Market makers compete on cost, execution quality and liquidity provision

•

80% individual ownership of companies with less than $100 million in market cap1

Aggarwal & Angel study2 – characteristics of historically successful smaller company secondary markets:
•

Grew out of pre-existing Over-the-Counter markets

•

Operated as dealer markets

•

Separate from existing exchanges

SEC and legislative proposals counterintuitively prescribe an exchange-only, monopoly model
•

Exchange Act Section 11A: “Congress finds that . . . it is in the public interest and appropriate for the
protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets to assure . . . fair competition . . .
among exchange markets, and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets.”

•

Smaller companies will benefit from competition among exchanges, ATS and other trading venues
