In the Matter of

ORDER ON RESPONDENT’S
MOTIONS

PAUL LEON WHITE, II

Respondent Paul Leon White, II, moves (1) to be represented by a non-attorney; (2) to
proceed in forma pauperis; and (3) for a more definite statement. His motions are denied.1
The Commission’s Rules of Practice permit a respondent to retain any counsel the
respondent chooses, so long as counsel is admitted to practice before the Supreme Court or the
highest court of any State or United States territory. 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(b); see 15 U.S.C.
§ 78c(a)(16). The rules do not contemplate representation of an individual by a non-attorney.
Contrary to White’s assertion, the Sixth Amendment does not require that he be permitted
to retain a non-attorney to represent him. The Sixth Amendment applies—by its terms—to
criminal proceedings; it does not apply in administrative proceedings.2 And even in criminal
proceedings, the Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to “the Assistance of Counsel,” not to the

White also expresses outrage, “[a]s an American citizen,” that the Division of
Enforcement has served him via UPS rather the postal service. He “would appreciate [it] if [I]
would recommend to the” Commission that the Division serve him via the postal service.
White’s request is denied. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.150(c)(3) (permitting service of papers by parties
“through a commercial courier service or express delivery service”).

Kevin Hall, CPA, Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Release No. 61162, 2009 WL
4809215, at *21 n.90 (Dec. 14, 2009); see Berrios v. New York City Hous. Auth., 564 F.3d 130,
134 (2d Cir. 2009) (“A party in a civil case has no constitutionally guaranteed right to the
assistance of counsel.”); United States v. Campos-Asencio, 822 F.2d 506, 509 (5th Cir. 1987)
(holding that parties in civil administrative proceedings “have no sixth amendment right to
counsel”).

assistance of a non-attorney.3 White’s request to be represented by a non-attorney is therefore
denied.
With respect to White’s request that he be permitted to litigate in forma pauperis, 28
U.S.C. § 1915 permits a party who shows an inability to pay to litigate in federal courts without
paying applicable fees. That provision, however, does not apply to administrative proceedings.4
Moreover, there are no filing fees associated with this proceeding.
In making his request, White asserts that he has limited access to funds and cannot pay
the costs associated with copying the investigative file maintained by the Division of
Enforcement. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.230(f) (generally making respondents responsible for the
copying costs of documents made available by the Division). The Division responds that its
investigative file is maintained in electronic format and that producing the complete file in paper
format would—depending on the contents of files White produced to the Division—take
between four and eight weeks and cost between $500,000 and $3.8 million. Opp. at 5 n.5. The
Division has thus offered to provide White with an electronic version of its file at no cost. Id. at
4-6. It explains that it is currently awaiting a response to its request that White tell it how he
wishes to receive the electronic copy. Id. at 5. Because there is no authority or reason to grant
White’s request and the Division has complied with its obligation to produce its investigative
file, see 17 C.F.R. § 201.230(a), White’s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is denied.
As to White’s motion for a more definite statement, the order instituting proceedings
(OIP) complies with Rule of Practice 200(b), in that it explains the “nature of [the] hearing” and
“the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held,” sets forth “the
matters of fact and law to be considered and determined,” and “state[s] the nature of any relief or
action sought.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.200(b). The OIP thus explains that this matter was instituted
under Exchange Act section 15(b) and Investment Advisers Act of 1940 section 203(f), is based
on White’s conviction in New York state court, and will determine whether the public interest
favors taking any remedial action against White. OIP at 1-2. White has thus received the notice
to which he is entitled.
White nonetheless asks for (1) the authority that required him and his company to register
as investment advisers; (2) the statutes he is accused of violating; (3) the reason the Commission
thinks it is in the public interest to bar him from the securities industry; and (4) the authority the
Commission relies on for instituting this proceeding. But the OIP explains the authority on
which the Commission relied to institute this proceeding and the Division in its opposition has
explained that Exchange Act section 15(b) and Advisers Act section 203(f) set forth the
requirements that the Division must meet before White can be barred from the securities
industry. Opp. at 8-9. And the Division will necessarily explain in its dispositive motion why it
believes the public interest favors barring White. It will also explain why it believes the

U.S. Const. amend. VI (emphasis added); United States v. Benson, 592 F.2d 257, 258
(5th Cir. 1979) (“there is no sixth amendment right to be represented by a non-attorney”).

Cf. Froudi v. United States, 23 Cl. Ct. 328, 330 (1991) (explaining that the authority in
section 1915 applies to courts “created by Congress under Article III of the Constitution”).

evidence shows that White acted in a relevant capacity and suffered a relevant conviction. See
15 U.S.C. §§ 78o(b)(4)(B), (6)(A)(ii), 80b-3(e)(2), (3), (f). White will then have the opportunity
to respond. White’s motion for a more definite statement is denied.5
