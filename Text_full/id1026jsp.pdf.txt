INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
June 20, 2016

APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Jason S. Patil, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registrations of Respondents’ registered securities due to
their failures to timely file required periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
INTRODUCTION
On May 4, 2016, the Commission initiated this proceeding with an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The OIP
alleges that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange
Act Section 12(g) and have repeatedly failed to file timely periodic reports with the Commission,
in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and/or 13a-13 thereunder.
Respondents were served with the OIP by May 12, 2016, and answers were due May 25, 2016.
Giant Res., Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3867, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1846 (ALJ May 25,
2016). When Respondents failed to file answers, I ordered them to show cause no later than
June 13 why the registrations of their securities should not be revoked by default due to their
failures to file answers or otherwise defend the proceeding. Giant Res., Inc., Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3892, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1954 (ALJ June 2, 2016). To date, Respondents
have not filed answers, responded to the show cause order, or otherwise defended this
proceeding.

FINDINGS OF FACT
Respondents are in default for failing to file answers or otherwise defend the proceeding.
See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, I find the following allegations
in the OIP to be true. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a).
Giant Resources, Inc., Central Index Key (CIK) No. 1327926, is an Alberta corporation
located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, with a class of securities registered with the Commission
pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with
the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 20-F for the period
ended December 31, 2012, which reported a net loss of $310,247 for the prior twelve months.
As of March 4, 2016, the company’s stock (symbol “GIREF”) was quoted on OTC Link
(previously, “Pink Sheets”) operated by OTC Market Group, Inc. (OTC Link), had four market
makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
Rush Exploration, Inc., CIK No. 1301574, is an Alberta corporation located in
Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant
to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 20-F for the period ended
December 31, 2012, which reported a net loss of $76,223 (Canadian) for the prior twelve
months. As of March 4, 2016, the company’s stock (symbol “REXEF”) was quoted on OTC
Link, had four market makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act
Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
In addition to their repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, Respondents failed to
heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance
requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations, or, through their failures to maintain
valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not receive
such letters.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require issuers of
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the Commission current
and accurate information in periodic reports. Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file
annual reports. See 17 C.F.R. § 240.13a-1. “Compliance with those requirements is mandatory
and may not be subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons.
denied, Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is
not required to establish violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1. See SEC v.
McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C.
1978). Respondents failed to file timely periodic reports and as a result violated Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1.

SANCTION
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
the registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an
opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of
the Exchange Act or rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will adequately protect
investors, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s
violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved,
the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and
the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
Respondents’ failures to file required periodic reports are serious because the failures
constitute violations of a central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic
reporting is “to supply investors with current and accurate financial information about an issuer
so that they may make sound [investment] decisions.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., 2006 SEC
LEXIS 1288, at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that Congress fashioned
for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the
sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977). Respondents’
violations are also recurrent in that they repeatedly failed to file periodic reports. See Nature’s
Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21,
2009); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26
(May 23, 2008). Respondents are also culpable because they failed to heed delinquency letters
sent to them by the Division of Corporation Finance, or, through their failures to maintain valid
addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not receive the
letters, and were therefore on notice, even before the OIP issued, of their obligations to file
periodic reports. See China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS
3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that revocation may be warranted even without
proof that a respondent was aware of its reporting obligations). Finally, Respondents have not
answered the OIP, responded to the show cause order, or otherwise participated in the
proceeding to address whether they have made any efforts to remedy their past violations. They
have also made no assurances against further violations.
For these reasons, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to revoke
the registrations of each class of Respondents’ registered securities.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registrations of each class of registered securities of Respondents Giant Resources, Inc., and
Rush Exploration, Inc., are REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Commission Rule of Practice 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that rule, a
party may file a petition for review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of
3

the initial decision. A party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten
days of the initial decision, pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct
a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a
petition for review from the date of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a
manifest error of fact.
This initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion
to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become
final as to that party.
A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at
any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall
be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
