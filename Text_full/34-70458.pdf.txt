ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-ANDDESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASEAND-DESIST ORDER

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that
cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against JPMorgan Chase & Co.
(“JPMorgan”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, JPMorgan has submitted an
Offer of Settlement (“Offer”) that the Commission has determined to accept. JPMorgan admits
the facts contained in Annex A attached hereto, the Commission’s jurisdiction over it, and the
subject matter of these proceedings; and consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Ceaseand-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order, the Offer, and the facts contained in Annex A attached hereto,
the Commission finds1 that:
1.
Public companies are responsible for devising and maintaining a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to, among other things, provide reasonable assurances that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of reliable financial statements. In
addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) established important
requirements for public companies and their management with respect to corporate governance
and disclosure. For example, public companies are obligated to maintain disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that important information flows to the appropriate
persons so that timely decisions can be made regarding disclosure in public filings. Commission
regulations implementing Sarbanes-Oxley therefore require management to evaluate on a
quarterly basis the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and the
company to disclose management’s conclusion regarding their effectiveness in its quarterly
filings.
2.
On an investor call conducted in connection with the filing of its quarterly report
on May 10, 2012, JPMorgan publicly disclosed a trading loss of approximately $2 billion since
the start of the second quarter in a large portfolio of credit derivatives known as the Synthetic
Credit Portfolio (“SCP”) held by the firm’s Chief Investment Office (“CIO”). In the quarterly
report, JPMorgan stated that, based upon management’s evaluation at the time, its disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the quarter.
3.
Over the next few months, as JPMorgan sought to bring down risk in the SCP, the
losses in the SCP grew to nearly $6 billion. Nevertheless, the full extent of the trading losses
that had occurred during the first quarter was not detected and reported, in part, because of the
ineffectiveness of an internal control function within CIO, known as the Valuation Control
Group (“CIO-VCG”). Within JPMorgan and other financial institutions and investment firms,
valuation control units frequently serve as an essential internal control by helping to ensure that
traders and other market professionals record accurate valuations for trading positions.
Valuation control units must be sufficiently independent from the trading desks, and clear and
effective written policies are necessary in order to guard against the risk that a company’s
investment assets will be improperly valued—and its public filings misstated.
4.
In the case of CIO, its VCG unit was unequipped to cope with the increase in the
size and complexity of the SCP in early 2012, and did not function as an effective internal
control in the first quarter of the year. The unit was understaffed, insufficiently supervised, and
did not adequately document its actual price-testing policies. Moreover, the actual price-testing
methodology employed by CIO-VCG in the first quarter of 2012 was subjective and
insufficiently independent from the SCP traders, which enabled the traders to improperly

1

The findings herein are made pursuant to JPMorgan’s Offer and are not binding on any other
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

2

influence the VCG process. In addition, during the first quarter of 2012, CIO-VCG failed to
escalate to CIO and JPMorgan management significant information that management required in
order to make informed decisions about disclosure of the firm’s financial results for the first
quarter of 2012. As a result, JPMorgan did not timely detect or effectively challenge
questionable valuations by the SCP traders as the portfolio’s losses accumulated in the first
quarter of 2012 and publicly misstated its financial results for that period.
5.
JPMorgan’s response to the CIO trading losses also was affected by inadequate
communication between JPMorgan’s Senior Management and the Audit Committee of
JPMorgan’s Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”). In April 2012, after learning of large
counterparty valuation disputes relating to SCP positions, JPMorgan Senior Management
initiated several reviews of the SCP marks and of CIO-VCG. By early May 2012, the various
reviews had alerted JPMorgan Senior Management to serious issues about CIO-VCG’s
effectiveness in price-testing the values SCP traders had assigned to positions in the SCP during
the first quarter of 2012. These issues, among others, prompted JPMorgan Senior Management
to take several actions, including recommending delaying the filing of the firm’s quarterly report
with the Commission, and substantially revising CIO-VCG policies in early May 2012 to
eliminate what Senior Management believed was an undue amount of subjectivity in a control
function.
6.
Consistent with Sarbanes-Oxley’s emphasis on the role that the audit committee
of a public company’s board of directors should play in corporate governance, JPMorgan’s
internal controls include a requirement that its management keep the Audit Committee informed
of, among other things, the identification of any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses
in the firm’s internal control over financial reporting. Such updates are necessary for the Audit
Committee to fulfill its oversight role and help to assure the integrity and accuracy of
information JPMorgan discloses in its public filings.
7.
Before JPMorgan filed its quarterly report on May 10, 2012, however, JPMorgan
Senior Management did not adequately update the Audit Committee concerning the facts learned
during the reviews of CIO-VCG. Nor did it adequately update the Audit Committee on
important observations made by the management-commissioned reviews of control breakdowns
at CIO-VCG that amounted to, at a minimum, a significant deficiency. Three primary issues
relating to the sharing and synthesis of relevant information contributed to the inadequate
communications with the Audit Committee. First, several employees involved in conducting the
reviews of CIO-VCG failed to timely escalate important facts regarding control deficiencies at
CIO-VCG. Second, JPMorgan Senior Management was concerned about the market sensitivity
of the SCP positions and the confidential nature of the review, and required that the review teams
keep their work strictly confidential, which had the effect of impeding the exchange of
information among the review teams and their ability to analyze collectively the information
generated by these reviews. Third, despite learning of important information concerning control
deficiencies at CIO-VCG, JPMorgan Senior Management did not make a considered assessment
of the significance of that information to determine if it revealed a significant deficiency or
material weakness at CIO-VCG that had to be disclosed to the Audit Committee.
8.
On July 13, 2012, JPMorgan announced that it would restate its results for the
first quarter of 2012 because it was no longer confident that the SCP marks used to prepare the

3

first quarter results, which CIO-VCG was responsible for price testing, “reflect good faith
estimates of fair value at quarter end.” Also on this date, JPMorgan disclosed to investors that a
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting had existed at CIO as of March 31,
2012 based on deficiencies in the CIO-VCG process.
9.
On August 9, 2012, JPMorgan filed an amended Form 10-Q with restated results
for the first quarter of 2012. The restatement had the effect of moving certain SCP losses from
the second quarter to the first quarter. These misstated first quarter results were disclosed not
only in the quarterly report filed on Form 10-Q on May 10, 2012, but also in JPMorgan’s
earnings release for the first quarter, which was filed on Form 8-K with the Commission on April
13, 2012. Also on August 9, 2012, JPMorgan disclosed that its disclosure controls and
procedures as of March 31, 2012 were not effective and that management’s prior conclusion in
the firm’s May 10, 2012 quarterly report that they were effective was incorrect.
10.
As a result of its failure to maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of March 31, 2012, and disclosure controls and procedures, and as a result of its
filing of inaccurate reports with the Commission (specifically, the Form 8-K filed on April 13,
2012, and the Form 10-Q filed on May 10, 2012), JPMorgan violated Sections 13(a),
13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-11, 13a-13, and 13a-15
thereunder.
11.
In response to the Commission’s investigation, JPMorgan provided substantial
cooperation to Commission staff. JPMorgan has also voluntarily undertaken a comprehensive
program of remediation to address, among other things, the internal control deficiencies that are
the subject of this proceeding. Most notably, JPMorgan has substantially strengthened the
valuation control function within CIO to ensure that price verification procedures are conducted
with the appropriate degree of independence and supervision.

THE MISMARKING OF JPMORGAN’S
SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO
JPMorgan, CIO, and the Synthetic Credit Portfolio
15.
In 2007, CIO created an investment portfolio, the SCP, which was designed to
provide a hedge against adverse credit events. It invested in derivatives that could be expected to
generate profit during adverse credit events, such as widespread corporate defaults. The
positions in the SCP consisted of credit derivative indices and portions (or “tranches”) of those
indices, both of which were constructed to track a collection of credit default swaps (“CDS”)
referencing the debt of corporate issuers.
16.
The SCP was invested in two primary index groups: CDX, a group of North
American and Emerging Markets indices, and iTraxx, a group of European and Asian indices.
Some indices referenced companies considered to be investment grade and others referenced
companies considered to be high-yield (which generally means that their credit risk is viewed as
higher). Investors in CDX and iTraxx indices, including CIO, can be “long” risk, which is
equivalent to being a seller of CDS protection, or “short” risk, which is equivalent to being a
buyer of CDS protection.
17.
Beginning in 2008, the SCP’s investment strategy generally consisted of holding a
net short risk position in high-yield indices and tranches, which meant that the SCP was
positioned to realize gains if high-yield companies were to default on their corporate debt. The
composition of the book changed from time to time in response to CIO’s assessment of market
conditions.
18.
In December 2011, in preparation for complying with the capital adequacy
standards of the Third Basel Accord, the SCP traders were instructed to reduce the SCP’s use of
regulatory capital. To achieve this—and, in light of improving economic conditions, to reduce
the SCP’s credit protection profile—CIO management and the traders in charge of the SCP
considered reducing the size of the SCP’s short risk position in high-yield investments. There
were substantial costs associated with this strategy. To avoid these costs, CIO management and
traders therefore decided to add investments to the SCP’s existing long risk investment-grade
positions to offset the short risk high-yield position. However, as CIO built its long risk
investment-grade positions, which included a large investment in an index known as the CDX
North American Investment Grade Index Series 9 10-year, it also added substantially to its
existing high-yield short position. JPMorgan did not have risk limits restricting the notional size
of the SCP, and CIO’s trading strategy led to a large increase in the notional size of the SCP.
During the first quarter of 2012, CIO tripled the net notional amount of the SCP. As of March
31, 2012, the SCP contained 132 trading positions with a net notional amount of approximately
$157 billion.
Traders Mismark the SCP as Losses Mount
19.
Like many other public companies, JPMorgan reported its results, which
incorporated the mark-to-market profit and loss of the SCP, at the end of each quarter in
accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). Under JPMorgan

5

policy, the SCP traders were required to assign valuations (or “marks”) to the positions in the
SCP at fair value. Both GAAP and JPMorgan’s accounting policy required that the SCP traders
do so by making a good-faith estimate of the fair value of each SCP position based on
information available in the marketplace. Under GAAP, the positions in the SCP had to be
marked “within the bid-ask spread” at the point that is “most representative of fair value in the
circumstances,” with a particular emphasis on the price where the traders could reasonably
expect to transact. GAAP also allows for the use of mid-market pricing “as a practical expedient
for fair value measurements within a bid-ask spread.”
20.
At the end of each business day, the SCP traders had to mark the positions in the
SCP and report to CIO management a summary of the portfolio’s mark-to-market profits and
losses for the day. Additionally, the traders had to provide their valuations for the SCP to the
middle office at CIO so that the information could be incorporated into the books and records of
JPMorgan.
21.
The SCP generated sizeable profits for JPMorgan over the period from 2007 to
2011. In the first quarter of 2012, however, it began experiencing substantial mark-to-market
losses. By early March 2012, the most senior SCP trader, who was a managing director within
CIO, instructed the other SCP traders to stop reporting losses to CIO management unless there
was a market-moving event that could easily explain the losses. In response, a junior SCP trader
changed his daily marking methodology for the SCP. Previously, he had derived for each SCP
position a bid-offer spread from dealer quotes he had received and then assigned a mark that was
generally equivalent to the mid-point in that spread. In response to the most senior trader’s
instruction, the junior trader began to assign marks that often were at the most aggressive point
in the bid-offer spread received that day (i.e., the point that resulted in higher valuations of the
SCP positions). For some SCP positions, the junior trader assigned marks in March that were
altogether outside every dealer’s bid and offer received that day. As a result of these marking
practices, the SCP traders intentionally understated mark-to-market losses in the SCP.
22.
In March 2012, the junior trader began to maintain a spreadsheet which showed
that, by March 15, 2012, the difference between the daily prices he had assigned to the SCP and
the average mid-market point between the best bids and offers he had received from dealers had
grown to $292 million. Within a few days, the difference had grown further to $432 million.
The traders, however, revealed significantly smaller losses in daily reports to CIO management
about the portfolio’s performance than were indicated by mid-market pricing.
23.
On March 30, 2012, the last trading day in the first quarter of 2012, the SCP
traders informed the most senior trader in the morning that losses for that day alone could reach
$250 million. In response, the most senior trader directed the junior trader not to mark the SCP
at the close of business in London, as JPMorgan policy required, but instead to wait for the
markets in New York to close because trading information from New York might support higher
valuations for the SCP positions.
24.
The most senior trader also instructed the junior trader to use the “best” prices
(i.e., the most advantageous prices within the bid-offer spread) in marking the SCP. On March
30, the junior trader marked the SCP positions in accordance with these instructions, and
reported to CIO management an estimated loss of $138 million. Over the next several weeks, the

6

traders continued to understate mark-to-market losses in the SCP until their authority over the
portfolio was taken away from them on or around April 29, 2012, when JPMorgan Senior
Management asked a senior Investment Bank (“IB”) trader and senior risk officer to take
responsibility for the portfolio.
JPMorgan Issues Its First Quarter
Results and Subsequently Issues a Restatement
25.
On April 13, 2012, JPMorgan issued its earnings release for the quarter ending
March 31, 2012, which was filed on Form 8-K with the Commission. Also on April 13,
JPMorgan Senior Management conducted an earnings call with analysts and investors. The
earnings release disclosed that JPMorgan’s consolidated quarterly income before income tax
expense was $7.641 billion. These results included the understated losses for the SCP, which
was based on the SCP traders’ marks as of March 30, 2012.
26.
One month later, on May 10, 2012, JPMorgan filed on Form 10-Q its report for
the first quarter, which ended on March 31, 2012, disclosing that CIO had experienced
significant mark-to-market losses in the SCP during the second quarter to date. Also on May 10,
2012, JPMorgan Senior Management conducted a call with analysts, during which the firm
disclosed that CIO had suffered losses of approximately $2 billion during the second quarter to
date and that there could be additional losses, that the trading strategy that resulted in the losses
was “flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed, and poorly monitored,” that “we’ve
had teams from audit, legal, risk, and various control functions . . . involved in extensive review
of what happened,” and that “[w]e have more work to do but it’s obvious at this point that there
are many errors, sloppiness, and bad judgment.” The $2 billion calculation was based on marks
for positions in the SCP that were derived from independent pricing sources and not from the
SCP traders; therefore, the full year-to-date loss figure was not affected by its subsequent
conclusions concerning the integrity of the SCP traders’ marks.
27.
Two months later, on July 13, 2012, JPMorgan announced that it would restate its
results for the first quarter of 2012 because it had discovered “information that raises questions
about the integrity of the [SCP] marks” and was no longer confident that the marks used to
prepare the first quarter results “reflect good faith estimates of fair value at quarter end.” On
August 9, 2012, JPMorgan filed an amended Form 10-Q with restated results for the first quarter.
The restatement had the effect of moving certain SCP losses from the second quarter to the first
quarter. Specifically, the restatement reduced the revenues of JPMorgan’s Corporate/Private
Equity reporting segment in the first quarter by $660 million, from $1.689 billion to $1.029
billion, and the firm’s consolidated quarterly income before income tax expense from the
previously-reported $7.641 billion to $6.981 billion.
JPMORGAN’S INEFFECTIVE INTERNAL ACCOUNTING CONTROLS
AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
28.
JPMorgan’s May 10, 2012 quarterly report on Form 10-Q contained its financial
statements for the first quarter of the year, management’s discussion of the firm’s various
businesses, and other information. In addition, the report stated that JPMorgan’s management

7

evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they
were effective.
29.
As discussed below, between late April and May 10, 2012, JPMorgan engaged in
an extensive process involving work performed by the Controller’s office, the Internal Audit
department (“Internal Audit”), valuation experts from the Investment Banking Division (“IB”),
and in-house and outside counsel in an effort to evaluate the SCP’s quarter-end marks and to
understand the CIO valuation control process and the differences between that process and the
valuation control process of the IB. As a result, by May 10, various executives and employees of
the firm had learned of deficiencies as of March 31, 2012 in CIO’s internal controls. Due to
failures to timely escalate information and instructions that had the effect of hindering the
sharing of information, not all of these deficiencies had been escalated to JPMorgan Senior
Management prior to May 10, 2012. And, as to the information that was escalated, JPMorgan
Senior Management did not make a considered assessment as to whether critical facts existed—
including any significant deficiency or material weakness in internal controls—that had to be
disclosed to the Audit Committee. Consequently, JPMorgan Senior Management did not
disclose the existence of any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses to the Audit
Committee before JPMorgan filed its quarterly report on May 10, 2012.
30.
On July 13, 2012, at the same time JPMorgan disclosed to investors that it would
restate its results for the first quarter of 2012, the firm announced that a material weakness in
internal control over financial reporting had existed at CIO as of March 31, 2012. As a result of
the material weakness, JPMorgan also announced that its management had concluded that
JPMorgan’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2012.
CIO Internal Controls in the First Quarter of 2012
31.
As part of fulfilling the requirements to devise and maintain systems of internal
accounting controls, financial institutions such as JPMorgan need to have internal controls that
adequately monitor and test the accuracy and integrity of, among other things, the valuations of
the firm’s trading portfolios such as the SCP. CIO-VCG served as a significant control for
ensuring that certain assets and liabilities of CIO, including the positions in the SCP, were
measured at fair value in accordance with GAAP in JPMorgan’s books and records and in the
quarterly and annual reports the firm filed with the Commission.
32.
For the SCP, CIO-VCG carried out its responsibility by price-testing the marks
that the SCP traders assigned to the portfolio’s positions on the last business day of every month.
Under firm policy applicable during the first quarter of 2012, CIO-VCG performed this pricetesting function by undertaking the following steps:
a. First, CIO-VCG had to calculate, as a benchmark, an independent price for
each of the SCP positions. A CIO-VCG policy and procedure document
indicates that, for index positions, these independent prices were to be
obtained from Markit Limited Group (“Markit”), a service that provides
consensus-based prices for indices. For tranches, CIO-VCG obtained
independent prices from dealer quotes, which it checked against Totem,

8

another consensus pricing service offered by Markit, for any significant
discrepancies.
b. After calculating an independent price for each SCP position, CIO-VCG
had to establish and apply a threshold (or tolerance) around each price that
represented the average bid-offer spread for the security based on quotes
received from dealers. While it had authority to make an adjustment to
trader marks that fell within these thresholds, CIO-VCG considered such
marks to be presumptively marked at fair value and would not make any
adjustment to those marks.
c. If the SCP traders’ mark for a given position fell outside of the threshold,
CIO-VCG would record the excess as a loss (or profit) and make a
corresponding adjustment to the mark-to-market profit and loss for the
SCP.
d. Finally, if CIO-VCG determined that the market for a particular position
had become illiquid, CIO-VCG applied a pre-established formula to
calculate and record a liquidity reserve to account for the risk that certain
SCP positions could not be sold at fair value due to reduced liquidity in
the marketplace.
33.
The CIO-VCG staff actively involved in price-testing the SCP’s 132 positions at
the end of the first quarter of 2012 consisted of one person, who worked at CIO’s London office.
That person was also responsible for price testing all of CIO’s other London-based portfolios.
34.
On April 4, 2012, CIO-VCG completed its price-testing process for the SCP for
the end of March 2012. It applied the relevant thresholds to adjust downward the fair value of
the SCP by approximately $17 million compared to the traders’ marks and maintained the
previous month’s liquidity reserve of approximately $31 million.
35.
During its price-testing process for quarter-end marks, CIO-VCG observed that
most of the SCP traders’ marks migrated to the aggressive end of the bid/offer spread. CIOVCG questioned one of the SCP traders about this shift. The trader did not explain the shift but
merely stated, “Talk to management.” CIO-VCG did not disclose to anyone its observations
concerning the shift in the SCP traders’ marking methodology until questions were being raised
about a collateral dispute, which is summarized below, on April 20, 2012. CIO-VCG also did
not share the details of its exchange with the SCP trader.
36.
CIO-VCG calculated a significant difference between its independent prices and
the SCP traders’ marks. During its price-testing process, it calculated that the mid-market value
of the SCP based on its independent prices was approximately $192 million less than the value
based on the SCP traders’ marks. It subsequently identified an error in its calculations, which
increased the difference from $192 million to approximately $275 million. A March 30, 2012
Internal Audit report on CIO-VCG contained an Action Plan under which CIO-VCG should
disclose this discrepancy to CIO management. However, that action plan was not required to be
fully implemented until June 30, 2012, and CIO-VCG only disclosed the $17 million fair value

9

adjustment based on marks that fell outside of its thresholds. Consequently, CIO management
was not alerted to the significant difference between the SCP traders’ marks and the CIO-VCG
calculated mid-market valuations, which warranted further analysis.
37.
Shortly after April 4, 2012, CIO Finance, with the approval of CIO management
and JPMorgan Senior Management, increased the existing $31 million liquidity reserve by $155
million, based on a determination that certain tranches in the SCP portfolio had become illiquid
as of March 30. The traders’ marks, as adjusted by CIO-VCG, were then incorporated in the
financial information provided for CIO in JPMorgan’s earnings release on April 13, 2012 and in
the firm’s May 10, 2012 report for the first quarter of 2012.
Large Collateral Calls and Increasing Losses Prompt
Multiple Reviews of CIO-VCG and the Traders’ Marks
38.
On April 20, 2012, JPMorgan Senior Management was informed that the firm had
received several collateral calls—requests from trading counterparties for payment or the posting
of collateral based on their differing views of the fair value—concerning positions in the SCP.
The total amount in dispute was approximately $520 million.
39.
A collateral dispute with a CDS counterparty can sometimes be an indication that
a firm’s internal price for an instrument does not accurately reflect its fair value. Accordingly, in
April 2012, the size of the collateral disputes over the SCP raised concerns by JPMorgan Senior
Management about the pricing of the SCP positions. In an April 20, 2012 email, a member of
JPMorgan Senior Management observed that the collateral disputes were not “a good sign on our
valuation process” in the SCP.
40.
At the same time that the collateral disputes were being escalated to JPMorgan
Senior Management, the SCP was also sustaining large daily losses. This development was
inconsistent with what CIO had told JPMorgan Senior Management to expect prior to the April
13 earnings release, and JPMorgan Senior Management was concerned about the losses and the
traders’ explanations of what was happening to the SCP positions and their strategy for dealing
with the risks to the SCP. On or about April 27, JPMorgan Senior Management asked a senior
trader from the IB and a senior risk officer to evaluate the portfolio on an urgent basis. Shortly
afterwards, the IB trader and risk officer were put in charge of managing and reducing the risk in
the SCP, and the SCP traders were relieved of all trading and pricing responsibilities.
Additionally, on a going-forward basis, positions in the SCP were to be marked to consensus
mid-market prices published by Markit.
41.
In late April and early May, JPMorgan Senior Management mobilized resources
from various parts of the firm—the IB’s valuation experts, Internal Audit, which had prior
experience with CIO-VCG’s price-testing process, and the Controller’s office, which included
JPMorgan’s fair value accounting experts—as well as the Legal Department and an outside law
firm to conduct reviews of the SCP traders’ marks and CIO-VCG’s price-testing process. At the
time, JPMorgan was planning to file with the Commission its report for the first quarter of 2012
in early May 2012. In part due to the questions being raised about the valuation of the SCP,
JPMorgan Senior Management, with approval of the Audit Committee, decided to postpone the
filing to May 10. JPMorgan Senior Management delayed the filing so that it had additional time

10

to assess whether CIO’s first quarter results, which had been publicly released on April 13, were
in fact compliant with GAAP and should be disclosed again in the quarterly report.
The Investment Bank’s Review
42.
On April 25, 2012, a member of JPMorgan Senior Management asked the
Valuation Control Group in the firm’s IB (“IB-VCG”) to price-test the SCP traders’ marks for
March 30, 2012 as if the positions had been held by the IB. IB-VCG also reviewed the pricetesting work that had been done by CIO-VCG at the end of March 2012. The IB-VCG review
was conducted under the supervision of the IB’s Chief Financial Officer.
IB-VCG Valuation “In Line with the Counterparties”
43.
The next day, IB-VCG performed a preliminary analysis of the SCP traders’
marks. On a conference call that day, IB-VCG staff informed CIO management and CIO-VCG
that “[t]he rough initial result [of its analysis] . . . seems to, to be in line with the mark-to-market
differences you see on the collateral calls. . . . In terms of dollar value, the number seems pretty
much in line . . . with the counterparties.” In other words, IB-VCG’s preliminary valuation of
the SCP positions was in line with those of CIO’s trading counterparties, who had valued the
SCP at several hundreds of millions of dollars less than the SCP traders did.
44.
During the conference call, CIO-VCG explained to IB-VCG staff that in setting
thresholds around independent prices during its month-end price-testing process, it often
consulted with the SCP traders—whose valuations it was supposed to validate—“to see if they
have any market input to decide whether, you know, if it’s, that’s wrong, that’s correct, et
cetera.” CIO-VCG also informed IB-VCG that, when completing its price-testing process, it
used dealer quotes selected by SCP traders. IB-VCG staff believed that this process of
consulting the traders had the potential to significantly impair the independence and
effectiveness of the CIO-VCG process.
45.
On Saturday, April 28, 2012, at a meeting with members of JPMorgan Senior
Management and CIO management, the IB’s CFO presented IB-VCG’s analysis of the SCP
traders’ marks. He reviewed with the attendees a spreadsheet that detailed IB-VCG’s work to
date (“IB-VCG Spreadsheet”). At that meeting, at least one of the positions in the IB-VCG
Spreadsheet was reviewed on a column-by-column basis in order to describe the data included in
each individual column.
46.
As of this time, JPMorgan Senior Management and CIO management knew that
the SCP traders’ marks were $275 million greater than independent mid-market prices computed
by CIO-VCG based on a combination of broker quotes and data from consensus pricing services.
IB-VCG relied exclusively upon consensus pricing services, and the IB-VCG Spreadsheet
calculated that the SCP traders’ marks were approximately $767 million greater than the values
placed on the SCP positions by consensus mid-market prices published by Markit and Totem.
47.
As part of its analysis, IB-VCG staff calculated an approximate bid-offer spread,
based on market information from March 30, 2012, for six SCP positions, including several of
the largest positions and some with the greatest total dollar value differences between trader
marks and IB-VCG’s consensus pricing. The IB-VCG Spreadsheet contained data regarding 133
11

positions and reflected, among other things, that for the six positions for which it calculated an
approximate bid-offer spread, the traders’ quarter-end marks were outside the bid-offer spreads
that IB-VCG had approximated.
48.
After presenting IB-VCG’s analysis, the IB’s CFO began to calculate the profitand-loss impact if CIO marked the SCP to the conservative end of the bid-offer spread, rather
than to mid-market prices, as a price-taker would have done (since price-takers often buy and sell
at prices that are inferior to the consensus, mid-market Markit or Totem prices). This analysis
showed that adjusting marks to the conservative end of the bid-offer spread would have further
reduced the value of the SCP by approximately $250 million, resulting in an over $1 billion
difference between the traders’ marks and a price-taker’s marks at the conservative end of the
bid-offer spread. JPMorgan Senior Management elected not to pursue this marking methodology
with respect to the March 2012 quarter-end marks because, among other reasons, it understood
that using mid-market prices was acceptable under GAAP.
Spreadsheet Errors
49.
IB-VCG also reviewed the process that CIO-VCG had applied to the traders’
quarter-end marks. During this review, IB-VCG learned that in March 2012 CIO-VCG used a
spreadsheet in its price-testing process into which data had been manually entered, and that this
spreadsheet contained certain errors and reflected differences from the IB-VCG methodology
that may have had the effect of understating the difference between the traders’ marks and the
independent mid-market prices derived by CIO-VCG. On May 8, 2012, IB-VCG forwarded an
email to one member of JPMorgan Senior Management explaining these issues. IB-VCG and
CIO-VCG were instructed to work together to address the errors and other issues.
50.
The next day, IB-VCG corrected one such error, which involved the calculation of
the difference between the value of the SCP based on the traders’ marks and CIO-VCG’s
independent prices. Before the correction, the difference was believed to be approximately $275
million. After the correction, the difference increased to $512 million. IB-VCG informed
JPMorgan Senior Management of the correction and the quantitative impact it had.
51.
Based on the price-testing work of IB-VCG and other information, the
management of the IB expressed concerns to JPMorgan Senior Management about the potential
for mismarking of the SCP and whether CIO VCG was an effective control over the SCP. On
May 6, 2012, for example, a senior IB executive explained to a member of JPMorgan Senior
Management that the securities in the SCP had “very good price discovery mechanisms” (i.e.,
could effectively be priced in the marketplace) and that he could not recall a variance between
trader marks and independent prices in the IB “greater than $50mm that remained at any month
end across the ENTIRE IB’s positions.”
52.
In light of their concerns relating to CIO, two senior IB executives initially
expressed some reservations regarding the scope of their sub-certifications that JPMorgan
required officers in the various business lines to provide in connection with its quarterly and
annual filings. One of the executives apprised JPMorgan Senior Management that in light of the
CIO related information to which he was privy, he had a conversation with an outside lawyer
concerning the scope of his certification obligations. After relaying that conversation to the

12

other Investment Bank executive with certification obligations, both executives signed their subcertifications.
The Internal Audit Review
53.
In addition to the IB-VCG review, on or around May 2, 2012, JPMorgan Senior
Management instructed Internal Audit to review the CIO-VCG process, including whether it had
been applied consistently over past quarters. Also on May 2, at the end of a meeting of the Audit
Committee of JPMorgan’s Board of Directors, the Audit Committee, having just been informed
of the losses recently suffered, separately requested that Internal Audit review CIO.
54.
The Internal Audit team discovered deficiencies with the thresholds CIO-VCG
had applied at March 30. As noted above, JPMorgan policy required that CIO-VCG set a
threshold around its independent price for each SCP position that was representative of the
average spread between the bids and the offers received from dealers for the position. Because
the threshold was applied on each side of the independent price, in order to reflect the bid-offer
spread the threshold on each side would be one-half of the entire spread.
55.
By May 9, 2012, the Internal Audit team learned that in validating the SCP
traders’ quarter-end marks in March 2012, CIO-VCG had in some cases applied the entire bidoffer spread (rather than one half of the spread) on each side of its independent prices. The result
was a threshold that was twice the size of the bid-offer spread and beyond the range of
reasonable fair value estimates. The Internal Audit team calculated that, had CIO-VCG applied
the thresholds appropriately, it would have adjusted the traders’ quarter-end marks downward by
$307 million—$290 million more than the $17 million adjustment CIO-VCG had actually made
at month end.
56.
On May 10, the Internal Audit team collected its work in a draft memo (“Internal
Audit Draft Memo”), which stated, among other things, that CIO-VCG was “inconsistent in the
application of [its] own thresholds.”
57.
Although Internal Audit completed this work in the days prior to May 10, it did
not fully share this information with JPMorgan Senior Management and did not circulate the
Internal Audit Draft Memo to JPMorgan Senior Management or the Audit Committee.
The Controller’s Review
58.
On April 28, 2012, JPMorgan Senior Management asked the Controller’s staff to
assess whether the traders’ quarter-end marks complied with GAAP and to review the
effectiveness of CIO-VCG’s quarter-end internal control process.
59.
The Controller’s staff made several significant observations. One was that, as
losses in the SCP increased in March 2012, the traders departed from their historical practice of
marking the positions close to the mid-point between the bids and offers received from dealers.
Instead, they marked many positions at the aggressive end of the bid-offer spreads, i.e., they
marked the positions in a manner that resulted in smaller mark-to-market losses. JPMorgan
Senior Management was informed of this fact in late April 2012. The traders justified their
marks to the Controller’s staff by explaining that the market had become volatile and dislocated.
13

This volatility, the SCP traders claimed, caused significant intraday price movements that may
help explain the difference between the SCP traders’ marks and consensus pricing services. To
test the volatility explanation, the Controller’s staff analyzed intraday pricing information, and
determined that the difference between the SCP traders’ marks and the mid-market prices was
less than the average daily price movement. While accepting the SCP traders’ justification,
however, the Controller’s staff failed to adequately assess whether CIO could transact at the
price where the SCP was marked.
60.
For two quarter end marks assigned by the SCP traders, the Controller’s staff also
detected significant differences from mid-market consensus pricing that were not supported by
pricing data received by the SCP traders on the date that the mark was assigned. When the
Controller’s staff questioned these marks, one of the SCP traders agreed that they were too wide
as compared to the mid-market price. This fact had not been adequately considered by CIOVCG during its actual price testing process in connection with the first quarter of 2012, nor was
this fact given appropriate scrutiny by the Controller’s staff. Consequently, the Controller’s staff
did not escalate this information to JPMorgan Senior Management.
The Special Review by Outside Counsel
61.
In addition to the foregoing reviews, on or around May 1, 2012, JPMorgan
retained an outside law firm to provide advice regarding disclosure and to review, among other
things, whether the independence of the CIO-VCG process had been improperly compromised
by the involvement of the SCP traders. By May 10, 2012, when JPMorgan filed its first quarter
report, the law firm had interviewed the employee of CIO-VCG who had price-tested the SCP
marks, the executive to whom he reported, and other members of CIO management. The law
firm also had collected and reviewed a limited number of the relevant emails and Bloomberg
chats from the first quarter of 2012.
The Process for Synthesizing and
Escalating Information from the Various Reviews
62.
JPMorgan Senior Management led a process that involved daily—sometimes
twice daily—meetings and calls in which participants involved in the different reviews discussed
what they and their teams were doing and learning. Despite that process, a number of significant
facts learned in the course of the various reviews were not shared in these group meetings and
calls and were not otherwise escalated to JPMorgan Senior Management. This in turn led to
JPMorgan’s incomplete understanding of deficiencies relating to the CIO-VCG process in March
2012.
63.
JPMorgan Senior Management’s emphasis on confidentiality and sharing
information on a need-to-know basis contributed to this incomplete understanding. JPMorgan
Senior Management was concerned about sensitive information relating to CIO’s positions being
widely distributed and imposed restrictions on the creation and sharing of work product relating
to those positions. These instructions affected the ability of those conducting the reviews to
share, learn from, and build upon each other’s work.

14

64.
On April 29, 2012, the Controller’s staff was instructed not to “discuss [its work]
with people outside the immediate group” and to exercise caution in committing its findings to
writing.
65.
A member of JPMorgan Senior Management also instructed IB-VCG to “keep
[its] analysis in a relatively tight group.” On April 29, 2012, an IB executive confirmed to the
member of JPMorgan Senior Management that IB-VCG “speaks to no one,” including the
Controller’s staff, “without getting my express approval first.”
66.
Finally, the Internal Audit team was instructed to maintain strict confidentiality in
connection with its review.
67.
JPMorgan Senior Management did not receive all relevant information for another
reason: some employees conducting the reviews failed to appreciate the significance of certain of
the facts they had learned and their relevance to the quarterly report that was about to be filed.
For example, in looking back on his work after learning in late June that the integrity of the
traders’ marks was in question, a London-based employee primarily responsible for the
Controller’s review conducted an after-the-fact assessment, noting that he “[s]hould have better
understood the $767 [million] diff.,” i.e., IB-VCG’s calculation of the disparity between the SCP
traders’ quarter-end marks and Markit and Totem consensus, mid-market prices. The employee
further noted that he “[s]hould have pressed [CIO-VCG] more on how the tolerances (thresholds)
were determined” and “should have picked up that the tolerances determined by adding whole
bid-offer,” a fact already known to members of the Internal Audit team prior to May 10, 2012.
Although executives were in contact with those responsible for the various reviews, some of
those employees failed to timely analyze and escalate to JPMorgan Senior Management
important facts that they had discovered.
JPMorgan Senior Management’s
Response to the Information It Received
68.
Despite the inadequate information sharing and escalation described above,
significant information learned in the management-commissioned reviews was escalated to
JPMorgan Senior Management. This information, which related to the adequacy of the CIOVCG process that produced the $17 million fair value adjustment to the traders’ quarter-end
marks, included the following:
a. As losses began to mount, SCP traders began consistently marking at or
near the very edge of the advantageous side of the bid-offer spread.
b. There was a collateral dispute of over $500 million.
c. Independent analysis by IB-VCG of the SCP traders’ quarter-end marks
was “in line with . . . the counterparties.” Specifically, the value of the
SCP based on trader marks was approximately $767 million more than the
value based on mid-point consensus pricing.
69.
Management also learned of the following facts that directly related to CIO-VCG
and the processes it was using in March 2012:
15

a. The CIO-VCG process relied on manual spreadsheets that contained
errors, one of which caused CIO-VCG to understate the disparity between
its independent prices and the traders’ marks by $237 million.
b. The SCP traders provided some of the quotes that were used in CIOVCG’s price-testing process and this process “need[ed] to be enhanced to
ensure independence.”
70.
In response to what it was learning prior to May 10, JPMorgan Senior
Management decided to enhance CIO-VCG’s valuation policies. To assist with this task, the
persons conducting the reviews recommended certain changes, and a member of JPMorgan
Senior Management drafted revisions to CIO-VCG procedures, which were shared with
JPMorgan Senior Management and CIO management on May 5, 2012. On May 7, 2012, a senior
CIO executive circulated a “proposed operational approach to VCG price testing” that contained
additional policy revisions. Both sets of changes were implemented before May 10, 2012.
71.
Collectively, the new policies were intended to remediate several of the issues
discovered by the management-commissioned reviews of CIO-VCG and the traders’ marks:
a. Disparity between CIO-VCG independent prices and traders’ marks. The
revised policies significantly curtailed the size of thresholds that CIO-VCG
could apply, directing that the difference between a trader’s mark and CIOVCG’s independent price could not exceed $500,000 for an index position
and $2,000,000 for a tranche position.
b. Trader involvement in the VCG process. The revised policies required CIOVCG to “source broker quotes independently from the market,” rather than
through the traders, thereby “eliminating any reliance on [the traders] for
sourcing of market data.”
c. Variance between Markit and CIO-VCG’s independent prices. The revised
policies stated that, for positions where CIO-VCG could rely on dealer
quotes in calculating independent prices, CIO-VCG must obtain at least two
quotes and, if two are not available, it must use Markit or Totem as an input.
The revised policies also provided that, even when dealer quotes are
obtained, “mid prices derived from selected dealer quotes should be
compared . . . to Markit/Totem sourced data and any material differences . . .
must be reported to the CFO of CIO and must be reconciled.”
d. Inadequate oversight over sole CIO-VCG price-tester. The revised policies
introduced a new protocol for escalating to management valuation disputes
between CIO-VCG and the traders, requiring the involvement of JPMorgan
risk personnel and the Chief Financial Officer of CIO.
72.
In addition to these policy changes, in early May the staff of IB-VCG prepared a
remedial plan to address the spreadsheet errors it had identified in CIO-VCG’s price-testing
process, and to ensure proper review of the spreadsheets. On May 8, 2012, after CIO finance

16

management and CIO-VCG concurred in the remedial plan, IB-VCG described it to JPMorgan
Senior Management.
The Reviews of CIO-VCG Are Not
Addressed with the Audit Committee
73.
The responsibility for overseeing JPMorgan’s management on behalf of the firm’s
stockholders—including oversight of management’s responsibilities for internal controls—
ultimately rests with JPMorgan’s Board of Directors. The Board, in turn, discharges its oversight
function through several Board committees. One of the principal committees is the Audit
Committee, which is charged with overseeing JPMorgan’s efforts to assure that it has effective
internal controls, which are critical to the integrity of the firm’s financial reports and compliance
with applicable policies and laws.
74.
To assist the Audit Committee in carrying out its responsibility, the Audit
Committee’s Charter requires JPMorgan management to provide updates to the Committee on all
“significant operating and control issues in internal audit reports,” the “initiation and status of
significant special investigations,” the “identification and resolution status of material
weaknesses” in controls, and any “reportable conditions in the internal control environment,
including any significant deficiencies.” These updates serve an important internal control
function, allowing the Audit Committee to fulfill its oversight role by, among other things,
keeping the Board up-to-date on significant matters, assessing whether to approve the filing of
quarterly and annual reports, and evaluating whether the Committee should conduct its own
independent investigation of any issues raised with it.
75.
In late April and early May 2012, while JPMorgan’s Senior Management was
devoting daily attention to CIO-VCG and the SCP traders’ quarter-end marks—in large measure
to ensure that CIO results reported in its upcoming quarterly report would be accurate—it also
was in contact with members of the Audit Committee.
76.
However, while JPMorgan Senior Management was informed of, and was
addressing, various issues with internal controls at CIO-VCG, JPMorgan Senior Management
did not engage in a considered assessment, before the firm filed its first quarter report on May
10, 2012, to determine if these matters constituted a significant deficiency or material weakness
in the firm’s internal control over financial reporting and therefore had to be disclosed to the
firm’s Audit Committee. Nor, more broadly, did JPMorgan Senior Management disclose to the
Audit Committee its concerns regarding the operation of CIO-VCG.
77.
On May 2, 2012, the Audit Committee met with some members of JPMorgan
Senior Management. The focus of the meeting was on the mounting losses in the SCP portfolio.
Despite the requirement to keep the Audit Committee apprised of the significant control issues
that were under review, there was no discussion of the IB-VCG or Controller reviews related to
CIO-VCG and the traders’ marks, although that work was underway. There was also no
discussion of the fact that an outside law firm had been retained to advise on disclosures to be
made in the first quarter Form 10-Q that related to CIO and to assess certain aspects of the CIOVCG process, including whether the SCP traders exercised undue influence on the process.

17

78.
During a full meeting of the Board of Directors hours before the filing of
JPMorgan’s first quarter report on May 10, 2012, JPMorgan Senior Management mentioned that
reviews of what occurred in CIO were underway, including by Internal Audit, legal, the
Controller’s staff, and risk management. But, JPMorgan Senior Management did not discuss the
details of or facts learned in the IB-VCG, Controller, or Internal Audit reviews.
79.
Because the Audit Committee was not apprised of the initiation of the reviews or
facts learned as a result of those reviews, it was unable to provide input on the issues before the
filing of JPMorgan’s first quarter report, and was unable to engage with those doing the work to
ensure that it was sufficient from the perspective of the Audit Committee.
80.
As noted above, the Audit Committee was not made aware before JPMorgan filed
its first quarter report of the facts learned by various members of the review teams, including that
CIO-VCG’s March 2012 price-testing process was compromised by spreadsheet errors, that SCP
traders may have exerted influence over that process, or that CIO-VCG applied valuation
thresholds that were in some instances twice the applicable spread.
81.
Other information learned by various members of the review teams that further
called into question CIO-VCG’s March 2012 quarter-end valuation process was not shared with
the Audit Committee. At the end of the first quarter, CIO-VCG made a fair value adjustment of
$17 million to the traders’ marks. However, certain facts raised issues as to the adequacy of this
adjustment and the process through which it was made, including the $520 million in collateral
disputes over SCP positions, the $767 million disparity between the SCP traders’ marks and
consensus, mid-market prices, the fact that the traders marked some of the largest notional SCP
positions outside the bid-offer spread approximated by IB-VCG, and the fact that the traders
began to mark the SCP at the aggressive end of the bid-offer spread when losses began to mount.
82.
Finally, the Audit Committee was not apprised of, or included in, JPMorgan
Senior Management’s efforts to remedy the control issues at CIO-VCG by revising valuation
policies to ensure proper oversight by CIO management. As a result, the Audit Committee did
not have any input into the proposed changes or an understanding of the reasons that motivated
them.
Subsequent Disclosures by JPMorgan
83.
Based on the information available to it, the Audit Committee approved of the
content of JPMorgan’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q that was filed on May 10, 2012. On July
13, 2012, JPMorgan disclosed that a material weakness existed in its internal control over
financial reporting stemming from the “effectiveness of CIO’s internal controls over valuation of
the synthetic credit portfolio.” In its amended Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2012 filed on
August 9, 2012, JPMorgan disclosed that this material weakness finding “was the result of issues
in certain interrelated and interdependent control elements comprising that process, including
insufficient engagement of CIO senior finance management in the valuation control process in
light of the increased size and heightened risk profile of the synthetic credit portfolio during the
first quarter of 2012, and in the effectiveness of certain procedures employed during the first
quarter of 2012 by the CIO Valuation Control Group in performing the price verifications.”

18

84.
JPMorgan also corrected prior statements concerning its disclosure controls and
procedures. In its May 10 Form 10-Q, JPMorgan stated, “As of the end of the period covered by
this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the
Firm’s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls
and procedures were effective.” On August 9, 2012, when JPMorgan disclosed that it had
determined that a material weakness existed at CIO as of March 31, 2012, it also disclosed that,
“[a]s a result of that determination, the Firm’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer also concluded that the Firm’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were not effective at March 31,
2012.”
V.
As a result of the conduct described above, JPMorgan violated Sections 13(a),
13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-11, 13a-13, and 13a-15
thereunder.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in JPMorgan’s Offer.
Accordingly, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, it is hereby ORDERED that:
A.
JPMorgan cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any
future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules
13a-11, 13a-13, and 13a-15 thereunder.
B.
JPMorgan shall, within ten (10) business days of the entry of this Order, pay a
civil money penalty in the amount of $200,000,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3717.
Payment must be made in one of the following ways:
(1)

JPMorgan may transmit payment electronically to the
Commission, which will provide detailed ACH transfer/
Fedwire instructions upon request;

(2)

JPMorgan may make direct payment from a bank account via
Pay.gov through the SEC website at
http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

(3)

JPMorgan may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or
United States postal money order, made payable to the Securities
and Exchange Commission and hand- delivered or mailed to:

19

Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch
HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169
Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
JPMorgan Chase & Co. as Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these
proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Andrew M.
Calamari, Regional Director – New York Regional Office, Division of Enforcement, Securities
and Exchange Commission, 3 World Financial Center, Suite 400, New York, NY 10281.
C.
Such civil money penalty may be distributed pursuant to Section 308(a) of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (“Fair Fund distribution”). Regardless of whether any
Fair Fund distribution is made, amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to
this Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax
purposes. To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, JPMorgan agrees that in any
Related Investor Action, it shall not argue that it is entitled to, nor shall it benefit by, offset or
reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of JPMorgan’s
payment of a civil penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”). If the court in any Related Investor
Action grants such a Penalty Offset, JPMorgan agrees that it shall, within 30 days after entry of a
final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay
the amount of the Penalty Offset to the United States Treasury or to a Fair Fund, as the
Commission directs. Such a payment shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall
not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For
purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action” means a private damages action brought
against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based on substantially the same
facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this proceeding.
D.
JPMorgan shall pay all reasonable administrative costs and expenses of any
distribution, including the fees and expenses of a tax administrator, within thirty (30) days after
receipt of an invoice for such services.
By the Commission.

ANNEX A
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan”) admits to the facts set forth below and
acknowledges that its conduct violated the federal securities laws:
RELEVANT ENTITIES AND PERSONS
1.
JPMorgan, a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York, New York,
is a global banking and financial services firm whose common stock is registered with the
Commission under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and traded on The New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol “JPM.”
2.
CIO is a unit of JPMorgan and part of the firm’s Corporate/Private Equity
reporting segment. Among other things, CIO is responsible for investing excess deposits from
JPMorgan’s banking arm. CIO maintains offices in New York, New York and London, United
Kingdom.
3.
JPMorgan “Senior Management,” as that term is used herein, refers to one or
more of the following individuals who held the listed positions as of May 10, 2012: the
JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer, the JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer, the JPMorgan Chief
Risk Officer, the JPMorgan Controller, and the JPMorgan General Auditor.
THE MISMARKING OF JPMORGAN’S
SYNTHETIC CREDIT PORTFOLIO
JPMorgan, CIO, and the Synthetic Credit Portfolio
4.
In 2007, CIO created an investment portfolio, the SCP, which was designed to
provide a hedge against adverse credit events. It invested in derivatives that could be expected to
generate profit during adverse credit events, such as widespread corporate defaults. The
positions in the SCP consisted of credit derivative indices and portions (or “tranches”) of those
indices, both of which were constructed to track a collection of credit default swaps (“CDS”)
referencing the debt of corporate issuers.
5.
The SCP was invested in two primary index groups: CDX, a group of North
American and Emerging Markets indices, and iTraxx, a group of European and Asian indices.
Some indices referenced companies considered to be investment grade and others referenced
companies considered to be high-yield (which generally means that their credit risk is viewed as
higher). Investors in CDX and iTraxx indices, including CIO, can be “long” risk, which is
equivalent to being a seller of CDS protection, or “short” risk, which is equivalent to being a
buyer of CDS protection.
6.
Beginning in 2008, the SCP’s investment strategy generally consisted of holding a
net short risk position in high-yield indices and tranches, which meant that the SCP was
positioned to realize gains if high-yield companies were to default on their corporate debt. The
composition of the book changed from time to time in response to CIO’s assessment of market
conditions.

7.
In December 2011, in preparation for complying with the capital adequacy
standards of the Third Basel Accord, the SCP traders were instructed to reduce the SCP’s use of
regulatory capital. To achieve this—and, in light of improving economic conditions, to reduce
the SCP’s credit protection profile—CIO management and the traders in charge of the SCP
considered reducing the size of the SCP’s short risk position in high-yield investments. There
were substantial costs associated with this strategy. To avoid these costs, CIO management and
traders therefore decided to add investments to the SCP’s existing long risk investment-grade
positions to offset the short risk high-yield position. However, as CIO built its long risk
investment-grade positions, which included a large investment in an index known as the CDX
North American Investment Grade Index Series 9 10-year, it also added substantially to its
existing high-yield short position. JPMorgan did not have risk limits restricting the notional size
of the SCP, and CIO’s trading strategy led to a large increase in the notional size of the SCP.
During the first quarter of 2012, CIO tripled the net notional amount of the SCP. As of March
31, 2012, the SCP contained 132 trading positions with a net notional amount of approximately
$157 billion.
Traders Mismark the SCP as Losses Mount
8.
Like many other public companies, JPMorgan reported its results, which
incorporated the mark-to-market profit and loss of the SCP, at the end of each quarter in
accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). Under JPMorgan
policy, the SCP traders were required to assign valuations (or “marks”) to the positions in the
SCP at fair value. Both GAAP and JPMorgan’s accounting policy required that the SCP traders
do so by making a good-faith estimate of the fair value of each SCP position based on
information available in the marketplace. Under GAAP, the positions in the SCP had to be
marked “within the bid-ask spread” at the point that is “most representative of fair value in the
circumstances,” with a particular emphasis on the price where the traders could reasonably
expect to transact. GAAP also allows for the use of mid-market pricing “as a practical expedient
for fair value measurements within a bid-ask spread.”
9.
At the end of each business day, the SCP traders had to mark the positions in the
SCP and report to CIO management a summary of the portfolio’s mark-to-market profits and
losses for the day. Additionally, the traders had to provide their valuations for the SCP to the
middle office at CIO so that the information could be incorporated into the books and records of
JPMorgan.
10.
The SCP generated sizeable profits for JPMorgan over the period from 2007 to
2011. In the first quarter of 2012, however, it began experiencing substantial mark-to-market
losses. By early March 2012, the most senior SCP trader, who was a managing director within
CIO, instructed the other SCP traders to stop reporting losses to CIO management unless there
was a market-moving event that could easily explain the losses. In response, a junior SCP trader
changed his daily marking methodology for the SCP. Previously, he had derived for each SCP
position a bid-offer spread from dealer quotes he had received and then assigned a mark that was
generally equivalent to the mid-point in that spread. In response to the most senior trader’s
instruction, the junior trader began to assign marks that often were at the most aggressive point
in the bid-offer spread received that day (i.e., the point that resulted in higher valuations of the
SCP positions). For some SCP positions, the junior trader assigned marks in March that were

2

altogether outside every dealer’s bid and offer received that day. As a result of these marking
practices, the SCP traders intentionally understated mark-to-market losses in the SCP.
11.
In March 2012, the junior trader began to maintain a spreadsheet which showed
that, by March 15, 2012, the difference between the daily prices he had assigned to the SCP and
the average mid-market point between the best bids and offers he had received from dealers had
grown to $292 million. Within a few days, the difference had grown further to $432 million.
The traders, however, revealed significantly smaller losses in daily reports to CIO management
about the portfolio’s performance than were indicated by mid-market pricing.
12.
On March 30, 2012, the last trading day in the first quarter of 2012, the SCP
traders informed the most senior trader in the morning that losses for that day alone could reach
$250 million. In response, the most senior trader directed the junior trader not to mark the SCP
at the close of business in London, as JPMorgan policy required, but instead to wait for the
markets in New York to close because trading information from New York might support higher
valuations for the SCP positions.
13.
The most senior trader also instructed the junior trader to use the “best” prices
(i.e., the most advantageous prices within the bid-offer spread) in marking the SCP. On March
30, the junior trader marked the SCP positions in accordance with these instructions, and
reported to CIO management an estimated loss of $138 million. Over the next several weeks, the
traders continued to understate mark-to-market losses in the SCP until their authority over the
portfolio was taken away from them on or around April 29, 2012, when JPMorgan Senior
Management asked a senior Investment Bank (“IB”) trader and senior risk officer to take
responsibility for the portfolio.
JPMorgan Issues Its First Quarter
Results and Subsequently Issues a Restatement
14.
On April 13, 2012, JPMorgan issued its earnings release for the quarter ending
March 31, 2012, which was filed on Form 8-K with the Commission. Also on April 13,
JPMorgan Senior Management conducted an earnings call with analysts and investors. The
earnings release disclosed that JPMorgan’s consolidated quarterly income before income tax
expense was $7.641 billion. These results included the understated losses for the SCP, which
was based on the SCP traders’ marks as of March 30, 2012.
15.
One month later, on May 10, 2012, JPMorgan filed on Form 10-Q its report for
the first quarter, which ended on March 31, 2012, disclosing that CIO had experienced
significant mark-to-market losses in the SCP during the second quarter to date. Also on May 10,
2012, JPMorgan Senior Management conducted a call with analysts, during which the firm
disclosed that CIO had suffered losses of approximately $2 billion during the second quarter to
date and that there could be additional losses, that the trading strategy that resulted in the losses
was “flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed, and poorly monitored,” that “we’ve
had teams from audit, legal, risk, and various control functions . . . involved in extensive review
of what happened,” and that “[w]e have more work to do but it’s obvious at this point that there
are many errors, sloppiness, and bad judgment.” The $2 billion calculation was based on marks
for positions in the SCP that were derived from independent pricing sources and not from the

3

SCP traders; therefore, the full year-to-date loss figure was not affected by its subsequent
conclusions concerning the integrity of the SCP traders’ marks.
16.
Two months later, on July 13, 2012, JPMorgan announced that it would restate its
results for the first quarter of 2012 because it had discovered “information that raises questions
about the integrity of the [SCP] marks” and was no longer confident that the marks used to
prepare the first quarter results “reflect good faith estimates of fair value at quarter end.” On
August 9, 2012, JPMorgan filed an amended Form 10-Q with restated results for the first quarter.
The restatement had the effect of moving certain SCP losses from the second quarter to the first
quarter. Specifically, the restatement reduced the revenues of JPMorgan’s Corporate/Private
Equity reporting segment in the first quarter by $660 million, from $1.689 billion to $1.029
billion, and the firm’s consolidated quarterly income before income tax expense from the
previously-reported $7.641 billion to $6.981 billion.
JPMORGAN’S INEFFECTIVE INTERNAL ACCOUNTING CONTROLS
AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
17.
JPMorgan’s May 10, 2012 quarterly report on Form 10-Q contained its financial
statements for the first quarter of the year, management’s discussion of the firm’s various
businesses, and other information. In addition, the report stated that JPMorgan’s management
evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they
were effective.
18.
As discussed below, between late April and May 10, 2012, JPMorgan engaged in
an extensive process involving work performed by the Controller’s office, the Internal Audit
department (“Internal Audit”), valuation experts from the Investment Banking Division (“IB”),
and in-house and outside counsel in an effort to evaluate the SCP’s quarter-end marks and to
understand the CIO valuation control process and the differences between that process and the
valuation control process of the IB. As a result, by May 10, various executives and employees of
the firm had learned of deficiencies as of March 31, 2012 in CIO’s internal controls. Due to
failures to timely escalate information and instructions that had the effect of hindering the
sharing of information, not all of these deficiencies had been escalated to JPMorgan Senior
Management prior to May 10, 2012. And, as to the information that was escalated, JPMorgan
Senior Management did not make a considered assessment as to whether critical facts existed—
including any significant deficiency or material weakness in internal controls—that had to be
disclosed to the Audit Committee. Consequently, JPMorgan Senior Management did not
disclose the existence of any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses to the Audit
Committee before JPMorgan filed its quarterly report on May 10, 2012.
19.
On July 13, 2012, at the same time JPMorgan disclosed to investors that it would
restate its results for the first quarter of 2012, the firm announced that a material weakness in
internal control over financial reporting had existed at CIO as of March 31, 2012. As a result of
the material weakness, JPMorgan also announced that its management had concluded that
JPMorgan’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2012.

CIO Internal Controls in the First Quarter of 2012
20.
As part of fulfilling the requirements to devise and maintain systems of internal
accounting controls, financial institutions such as JPMorgan need to have internal controls that
adequately monitor and test the accuracy and integrity of, among other things, the valuations of
the firm’s trading portfolios such as the SCP. CIO-VCG served as a significant control for
ensuring that certain assets and liabilities of CIO, including the positions in the SCP, were
measured at fair value in accordance with GAAP in JPMorgan’s books and records and in the
quarterly and annual reports the firm filed with the Commission.
21.
For the SCP, CIO-VCG carried out its responsibility by price-testing the marks
that the SCP traders assigned to the portfolio’s positions on the last business day of every month.
Under firm policy applicable during the first quarter of 2012, CIO-VCG performed this pricetesting function by undertaking the following steps:
a. First, CIO-VCG had to calculate, as a benchmark, an independent price for
each of the SCP positions. A CIO-VCG policy and procedure document
indicates that, for index positions, these independent prices were to be
obtained from Markit Limited Group (“Markit”), a service that provides
consensus-based prices for indices. For tranches, CIO-VCG obtained
independent prices from dealer quotes, which it checked against Totem,
another consensus pricing service offered by Markit, for any significant
discrepancies.
b. After calculating an independent price for each SCP position, CIO-VCG
had to establish and apply a threshold (or tolerance) around each price that
represented the average bid-offer spread for the security based on quotes
received from dealers. While it had authority to make an adjustment to
trader marks that fell within these thresholds, CIO-VCG considered such
marks to be presumptively marked at fair value and would not make any
adjustment to those marks.
c. If the SCP traders’ mark for a given position fell outside of the threshold,
CIO-VCG would record the excess as a loss (or profit) and make a
corresponding adjustment to the mark-to-market profit and loss for the
SCP.
d. Finally, if CIO-VCG determined that the market for a particular position
had become illiquid, CIO-VCG applied a pre-established formula to
calculate and record a liquidity reserve to account for the risk that certain
SCP positions could not be sold at fair value due to reduced liquidity in
the marketplace.
22.
The CIO-VCG staff actively involved in price-testing the SCP’s 132 positions at
the end of the first quarter of 2012 consisted of one person, who worked at CIO’s London office.
That person was also responsible for price testing all of CIO’s other London-based portfolios.

5

23.
On April 4, 2012, CIO-VCG completed its price-testing process for the SCP for
the end of March 2012. It applied the relevant thresholds to adjust downward the fair value of
the SCP by approximately $17 million compared to the traders’ marks and maintained the
previous month’s liquidity reserve of approximately $31 million.
24.
During its price-testing process for quarter-end marks, CIO-VCG observed that
most of the SCP traders’ marks migrated to the aggressive end of the bid/offer spread. CIOVCG questioned one of the SCP traders about this shift. The trader did not explain the shift but
merely stated, “Talk to management.” CIO-VCG did not disclose to anyone its observations
concerning the shift in the SCP traders’ marking methodology until questions were being raised
about a collateral dispute, which is summarized below, on April 20, 2012. CIO-VCG also did
not share the details of its exchange with the SCP trader.
25.
CIO-VCG calculated a significant difference between its independent prices and
the SCP traders’ marks. During its price-testing process, it calculated that the mid-market value
of the SCP based on its independent prices was approximately $192 million less than the value
based on the SCP traders’ marks. It subsequently identified an error in its calculations, which
increased the difference from $192 million to approximately $275 million. A March 30, 2012
Internal Audit report on CIO-VCG contained an Action Plan under which CIO-VCG should
disclose this discrepancy to CIO management. However, that action plan was not required to be
fully implemented until June 30, 2012, and CIO-VCG only disclosed the $17 million fair value
adjustment based on marks that fell outside of its thresholds. Consequently, CIO management
was not alerted to the significant difference between the SCP traders’ marks and the CIO-VCG
calculated mid-market valuations, which warranted further analysis.
26.
Shortly after April 4, 2012, CIO Finance, with the approval of CIO management
and JPMorgan Senior Management, increased the existing $31 million liquidity reserve by $155
million, based on a determination that certain tranches in the SCP portfolio had become illiquid
as of March 30. The traders’ marks, as adjusted by CIO-VCG, were then incorporated in the
financial information provided for CIO in JPMorgan’s earnings release on April 13, 2012 and in
the firm’s May 10, 2012 report for the first quarter of 2012.
Large Collateral Calls and Increasing Losses Prompt
Multiple Reviews of CIO-VCG and the Traders’ Marks
27.
On April 20, 2012, JPMorgan Senior Management was informed that the firm had
received several collateral calls—requests from trading counterparties for payment or the posting
of collateral based on their differing views of the fair value—concerning positions in the SCP.
The total amount in dispute was approximately $520 million.
28.
A collateral dispute with a CDS counterparty can sometimes be an indication that
a firm’s internal price for an instrument does not accurately reflect its fair value. Accordingly, in
April 2012, the size of the collateral disputes over the SCP raised concerns by JPMorgan Senior
Management about the pricing of the SCP positions. In an April 20, 2012 email, a member of
JPMorgan Senior Management observed that the collateral disputes were not “a good sign on our
valuation process” in the SCP.

6

29.
At the same time that the collateral disputes were being escalated to JPMorgan
Senior Management, the SCP was also sustaining large daily losses. This development was
inconsistent with what CIO had told JPMorgan Senior Management to expect prior to the April
13 earnings release, and JPMorgan Senior Management was concerned about the losses and the
traders’ explanations of what was happening to the SCP positions and their strategy for dealing
with the risks to the SCP. On or about April 27, JPMorgan Senior Management asked a senior
trader from the IB and a senior risk officer to evaluate the portfolio on an urgent basis. Shortly
afterwards, the IB trader and risk officer were put in charge of managing and reducing the risk in
the SCP, and the SCP traders were relieved of all trading and pricing responsibilities.
Additionally, on a going-forward basis, positions in the SCP were to be marked to consensus
mid-market prices published by Markit.
30.
In late April and early May, JPMorgan Senior Management mobilized resources
from various parts of the firm—the IB’s valuation experts, Internal Audit, which had prior
experience with CIO-VCG’s price-testing process, and the Controller’s office, which included
JPMorgan’s fair value accounting experts—as well as the Legal Department and an outside law
firm to conduct reviews of the SCP traders’ marks and CIO-VCG’s price-testing process. At the
time, JPMorgan was planning to file with the Commission its report for the first quarter of 2012
in early May 2012. In part due to the questions being raised about the valuation of the SCP,
JPMorgan Senior Management, with approval of the Audit Committee, decided to postpone the
filing to May 10. JPMorgan Senior Management delayed the filing so that it had additional time
to assess whether CIO’s first quarter results, which had been publicly released on April 13, were
in fact compliant with GAAP and should be disclosed again in the quarterly report.
The Investment Bank’s Review
31.
On April 25, 2012, a member of JPMorgan Senior Management asked the
Valuation Control Group in the firm’s IB (“IB-VCG”) to price-test the SCP traders’ marks for
March 30, 2012 as if the positions had been held by the IB. IB-VCG also reviewed the pricetesting work that had been done by CIO-VCG at the end of March 2012. The IB-VCG review
was conducted under the supervision of the IB’s Chief Financial Officer.
IB-VCG Valuation “In Line with the Counterparties”
32.
The next day, IB-VCG performed a preliminary analysis of the SCP traders’
marks. On a conference call that day, IB-VCG staff informed CIO management and CIO-VCG
that “[t]he rough initial result [of its analysis] . . . seems to, to be in line with the mark-to-market
differences you see on the collateral calls. . . . In terms of dollar value, the number seems pretty
much in line . . . with the counterparties.” In other words, IB-VCG’s preliminary valuation of
the SCP positions was in line with those of CIO’s trading counterparties, who had valued the
SCP at several hundreds of millions of dollars less than the SCP traders did.
33.
During the conference call, CIO-VCG explained to IB-VCG staff that in setting
thresholds around independent prices during its month-end price-testing process, it often
consulted with the SCP traders—whose valuations it was supposed to validate—“to see if they
have any market input to decide whether, you know, if it’s, that’s wrong, that’s correct, et
cetera.” CIO-VCG also informed IB-VCG that, when completing its price-testing process, it

7

used dealer quotes selected by SCP traders. IB-VCG staff believed that this process of
consulting the traders had the potential to significantly impair the independence and
effectiveness of the CIO-VCG process.
34.
On Saturday, April 28, 2012, at a meeting with members of JPMorgan Senior
Management and CIO management, the IB’s CFO presented IB-VCG’s analysis of the SCP
traders’ marks. He reviewed with the attendees a spreadsheet that detailed IB-VCG’s work to
date (“IB-VCG Spreadsheet”). At that meeting, at least one of the positions in the IB-VCG
Spreadsheet was reviewed on a column-by-column basis in order to describe the data included in
each individual column.
35.
As of this time, JPMorgan Senior Management and CIO management knew that
the SCP traders’ marks were $275 million greater than independent mid-market prices computed
by CIO-VCG based on a combination of broker quotes and data from consensus pricing services.
IB-VCG relied exclusively upon consensus pricing services, and the IB-VCG Spreadsheet
calculated that the SCP traders’ marks were approximately $767 million greater than the values
placed on the SCP positions by consensus mid-market prices published by Markit and Totem.
36.
As part of its analysis, IB-VCG staff calculated an approximate bid-offer spread,
based on market information from March 30, 2012, for six SCP positions, including several of
the largest positions and some with the greatest total dollar value differences between trader
marks and IB-VCG’s consensus pricing. The IB-VCG Spreadsheet contained data regarding 133
positions and reflected, among other things, that for the six positions for which it calculated an
approximate bid-offer spread, the traders’ quarter-end marks were outside the bid-offer spreads
that IB-VCG had approximated.
37.
After presenting IB-VCG’s analysis, the IB’s CFO began to calculate the profitand-loss impact if CIO marked the SCP to the conservative end of the bid-offer spread, rather
than to mid-market prices, as a price-taker would have done (since price-takers often buy and sell
at prices that are inferior to the consensus, mid-market Markit or Totem prices). This analysis
showed that adjusting marks to the conservative end of the bid-offer spread would have further
reduced the value of the SCP by approximately $250 million, resulting in an over $1 billion
difference between the traders’ marks and a price-taker’s marks at the conservative end of the
bid-offer spread. JPMorgan Senior Management elected not to pursue this marking methodology
with respect to the March 2012 quarter-end marks because, among other reasons, it understood
that using mid-market prices was acceptable under GAAP.
Spreadsheet Errors
38.
IB-VCG also reviewed the process that CIO-VCG had applied to the traders’
quarter-end marks. During this review, IB-VCG learned that in March 2012 CIO-VCG used a
spreadsheet in its price-testing process into which data had been manually entered, and that this
spreadsheet contained certain errors and reflected differences from the IB-VCG methodology
that may have had the effect of understating the difference between the traders’ marks and the
independent mid-market prices derived by CIO-VCG. On May 8, 2012, IB-VCG forwarded an
email to one member of JPMorgan Senior Management explaining these issues. IB-VCG and
CIO-VCG were instructed to work together to address the errors and other issues.

8

39.
The next day, IB-VCG corrected one such error, which involved the calculation of
the difference between the value of the SCP based on the traders’ marks and CIO-VCG’s
independent prices. Before the correction, the difference was believed to be approximately $275
million. After the correction, the difference increased to $512 million. IB-VCG informed
JPMorgan Senior Management of the correction and the quantitative impact it had.
40.
Based on the price-testing work of IB-VCG and other information, the
management of the IB expressed concerns to JPMorgan Senior Management about the potential
for mismarking of the SCP and whether CIO VCG was an effective control over the SCP. On
May 6, 2012, for example, a senior IB executive explained to a member of JPMorgan Senior
Management that the securities in the SCP had “very good price discovery mechanisms” (i.e.,
could effectively be priced in the marketplace) and that he could not recall a variance between
trader marks and independent prices in the IB “greater than $50mm that remained at any month
end across the ENTIRE IB’s positions.”
41.
In light of their concerns relating to CIO, two senior IB executives initially
expressed some reservations regarding the scope of their sub-certifications that JPMorgan
required officers in the various business lines to provide in connection with its quarterly and
annual filings. One of the executives apprised JPMorgan Senior Management that in light of the
CIO related information to which he was privy, he had a conversation with an outside lawyer
concerning the scope of his certification obligations. After relaying that conversation to the
other Investment Bank executive with certification obligations, both executives signed their subcertifications.
The Internal Audit Review
42.
In addition to the IB-VCG review, on or around May 2, 2012, JPMorgan Senior
Management instructed Internal Audit to review the CIO-VCG process, including whether it had
been applied consistently over past quarters. Also on May 2, at the end of a meeting of the Audit
Committee of JPMorgan’s Board of Directors, the Audit Committee, having just been informed
of the losses recently suffered, separately requested that Internal Audit review CIO.
43.
The Internal Audit team discovered deficiencies with the thresholds CIO-VCG
had applied at March 30. As noted above, JPMorgan policy required that CIO-VCG set a
threshold around its independent price for each SCP position that was representative of the
average spread between the bids and the offers received from dealers for the position. Because
the threshold was applied on each side of the independent price, in order to reflect the bid-offer
spread the threshold on each side would be one-half of the entire spread.
44.
By May 9, 2012, the Internal Audit team learned that in validating the SCP
traders’ quarter-end marks in March 2012, CIO-VCG had in some cases applied the entire bidoffer spread (rather than one half of the spread) on each side of its independent prices. The result
was a threshold that was twice the size of the bid-offer spread and beyond the range of
reasonable fair value estimates. The Internal Audit team calculated that, had CIO-VCG applied
the thresholds appropriately, it would have adjusted the traders’ quarter-end marks downward by
$307 million—$290 million more than the $17 million adjustment CIO-VCG had actually made
at month end.

9

45.
On May 10, the Internal Audit team collected its work in a draft memo (“Internal
Audit Draft Memo”), which stated, among other things, that CIO-VCG was “inconsistent in the
application of [its] own thresholds.”
46.
Although Internal Audit completed this work in the days prior to May 10, it did
not fully share this information with JPMorgan Senior Management and did not circulate the
Internal Audit Draft Memo to JPMorgan Senior Management or the Audit Committee.
The Controller’s Review
47.
On April 28, 2012, JPMorgan Senior Management asked the Controller’s staff to
assess whether the traders’ quarter-end marks complied with GAAP and to review the
effectiveness of CIO-VCG’s quarter-end internal control process.
48.
The Controller’s staff made several significant observations. One was that, as
losses in the SCP increased in March 2012, the traders departed from their historical practice of
marking the positions close to the mid-point between the bids and offers received from dealers.
Instead, they marked many positions at the aggressive end of the bid-offer spreads, i.e., they
marked the positions in a manner that resulted in smaller mark-to-market losses. JPMorgan
Senior Management was informed of this fact in late April 2012. The traders justified their
marks to the Controller’s staff by explaining that the market had become volatile and dislocated.
This volatility, the SCP traders claimed, caused significant intraday price movements that may
help explain the difference between the SCP traders’ marks and consensus pricing services. To
test the volatility explanation, the Controller’s staff analyzed intraday pricing information, and
determined that the difference between the SCP traders’ marks and the mid-market prices was
less than the average daily price movement. While accepting the SCP traders’ justification,
however, the Controller’s staff failed to adequately assess whether CIO could transact at the
price where the SCP was marked.
49.
For two quarter end marks assigned by the SCP traders, the Controller’s staff also
detected significant differences from mid-market consensus pricing that were not supported by
pricing data received by the SCP traders on the date that the mark was assigned. When the
Controller’s staff questioned these marks, one of the SCP traders agreed that they were too wide
as compared to the mid-market price. This fact had not been adequately considered by CIOVCG during its actual price testing process in connection with the first quarter of 2012, nor was
this fact given appropriate scrutiny by the Controller’s staff. Consequently, the Controller’s staff
did not escalate this information to JPMorgan Senior Management.
The Special Review by Outside Counsel
50.
In addition to the foregoing reviews, on or around May 1, 2012, JPMorgan
retained an outside law firm to provide advice regarding disclosure and to review, among other
things, whether the independence of the CIO-VCG process had been improperly compromised
by the involvement of the SCP traders. By May 10, 2012, when JPMorgan filed its first quarter
report, the law firm had interviewed the employee of CIO-VCG who had price-tested the SCP
marks, the executive to whom he reported, and other members of CIO management. The law

10

firm also had collected and reviewed a limited number of the relevant emails and Bloomberg
chats from the first quarter of 2012.
The Process for Synthesizing and
Escalating Information from the Various Reviews
51.
JPMorgan Senior Management led a process that involved daily—sometimes
twice daily—meetings and calls in which participants involved in the different reviews discussed
what they and their teams were doing and learning. Despite that process, a number of significant
facts learned in the course of the various reviews were not shared in these group meetings and
calls and were not otherwise escalated to JPMorgan Senior Management. This in turn led to
JPMorgan’s incomplete understanding of deficiencies relating to the CIO-VCG process in March
2012.
52.
JPMorgan Senior Management’s emphasis on confidentiality and sharing
information on a need-to-know basis contributed to this incomplete understanding. JPMorgan
Senior Management was concerned about sensitive information relating to CIO’s positions being
widely distributed and imposed restrictions on the creation and sharing of work product relating
to those positions. These instructions affected the ability of those conducting the reviews to
share, learn from, and build upon each other’s work.
53.
On April 29, 2012, the Controller’s staff was instructed not to “discuss [its work]
with people outside the immediate group” and to exercise caution in committing its findings to
writing.
54.
A member of JPMorgan Senior Management also instructed IB-VCG to “keep
[its] analysis in a relatively tight group.” On April 29, 2012, an IB executive confirmed to the
member of JPMorgan Senior Management that IB-VCG “speaks to no one,” including the
Controller’s staff, “without getting my express approval first.”
55.
Finally, the Internal Audit team was instructed to maintain strict confidentiality in
connection with its review.
56.
JPMorgan Senior Management did not receive all relevant information for another
reason: some employees conducting the reviews failed to appreciate the significance of certain of
the facts they had learned and their relevance to the quarterly report that was about to be filed.
For example, in looking back on his work after learning in late June that the integrity of the
traders’ marks was in question, a London-based employee primarily responsible for the
Controller’s review conducted an after-the-fact assessment, noting that he “[s]hould have better
understood the $767 [million] diff.,” i.e., IB-VCG’s calculation of the disparity between the SCP
traders’ quarter-end marks and Markit and Totem consensus, mid-market prices. The employee
further noted that he “[s]hould have pressed [CIO-VCG] more on how the tolerances (thresholds)
were determined” and “should have picked up that the tolerances determined by adding whole
bid-offer,” a fact already known to members of the Internal Audit team prior to May 10, 2012.
Although executives were in contact with those responsible for the various reviews, some of
those employees failed to timely analyze and escalate to JPMorgan Senior Management
important facts that they had discovered.

11

JPMorgan Senior Management’s
Response to the Information It Received
57.
Despite the inadequate information sharing and escalation described above,
significant information learned in the management-commissioned reviews was escalated to
JPMorgan Senior Management. This information, which related to the adequacy of the CIOVCG process that produced the $17 million fair value adjustment to the traders’ quarter-end
marks, included the following:
a. As losses began to mount, SCP traders began consistently marking at or
near the very edge of the advantageous side of the bid-offer spread.
b. There was a collateral dispute of over $500 million.
c. Independent analysis by IB-VCG of the SCP traders’ quarter-end marks
was “in line with . . . the counterparties.” Specifically, the value of the
SCP based on trader marks was approximately $767 million more than the
value based on mid-point consensus pricing.
58.
Management also learned of the following facts that directly related to CIO-VCG
and the processes it was using in March 2012:
a. The CIO-VCG process relied on manual spreadsheets that contained
errors, one of which caused CIO-VCG to understate the disparity between
its independent prices and the traders’ marks by $237 million.
b. The SCP traders provided some of the quotes that were used in CIOVCG’s price-testing process and this process “need[ed] to be enhanced to
ensure independence.”
59.
In response to what it was learning prior to May 10, JPMorgan Senior
Management decided to enhance CIO-VCG’s valuation policies. To assist with this task, the
persons conducting the reviews recommended certain changes, and a member of JPMorgan
Senior Management drafted revisions to CIO-VCG procedures, which were shared with
JPMorgan Senior Management and CIO management on May 5, 2012. On May 7, 2012, a senior
CIO executive circulated a “proposed operational approach to VCG price testing” that contained
additional policy revisions. Both sets of changes were implemented before May 10, 2012.
60.
Collectively, the new policies were intended to remediate several of the issues
discovered by the management-commissioned reviews of CIO-VCG and the traders’ marks:
a. Disparity between CIO-VCG independent prices and traders’ marks. The
revised policies significantly curtailed the size of thresholds that CIO-VCG
could apply, directing that the difference between a trader’s mark and CIOVCG’s independent price could not exceed $500,000 for an index position
and $2,000,000 for a tranche position.

12

b. Trader involvement in the VCG process. The revised policies required CIOVCG to “source broker quotes independently from the market,” rather than
through the traders, thereby “eliminating any reliance on [the traders] for
sourcing of market data.”
c. Variance between Markit and CIO-VCG’s independent prices. The revised
policies stated that, for positions where CIO-VCG could rely on dealer
quotes in calculating independent prices, CIO-VCG must obtain at least two
quotes and, if two are not available, it must use Markit or Totem as an input.
The revised policies also provided that, even when dealer quotes are
obtained, “mid prices derived from selected dealer quotes should be
compared . . . to Markit/Totem sourced data and any material differences . . .
must be reported to the CFO of CIO and must be reconciled.”
d. Inadequate oversight over sole CIO-VCG price-tester. The revised policies
introduced a new protocol for escalating to management valuation disputes
between CIO-VCG and the traders, requiring the involvement of JPMorgan
risk personnel and the Chief Financial Officer of CIO.
61.
In addition to these policy changes, in early May the staff of IB-VCG prepared a
remedial plan to address the spreadsheet errors it had identified in CIO-VCG’s price-testing
process, and to ensure proper review of the spreadsheets. On May 8, 2012, after CIO finance
management and CIO-VCG concurred in the remedial plan, IB-VCG described it to JPMorgan
Senior Management.
The Reviews of CIO-VCG Are Not
Addressed with the Audit Committee
62.
The responsibility for overseeing JPMorgan’s management on behalf of the firm’s
stockholders—including oversight of management’s responsibilities for internal controls—
ultimately rests with JPMorgan’s Board of Directors. The Board, in turn, discharges its oversight
function through several Board committees. One of the principal committees is the Audit
Committee, which is charged with overseeing JPMorgan’s efforts to assure that it has effective
internal controls, which are critical to the integrity of the firm’s financial reports and compliance
with applicable policies and laws.
63.
To assist the Audit Committee in carrying out its responsibility, the Audit
Committee’s Charter requires JPMorgan management to provide updates to the Committee on all
“significant operating and control issues in internal audit reports,” the “initiation and status of
significant special investigations,” the “identification and resolution status of material
weaknesses” in controls, and any “reportable conditions in the internal control environment,
including any significant deficiencies.” These updates serve an important internal control
function, allowing the Audit Committee to fulfill its oversight role by, among other things,
keeping the Board up-to-date on significant matters, assessing whether to approve the filing of
quarterly and annual reports, and evaluating whether the Committee should conduct its own
independent investigation of any issues raised with it.

64.
In late April and early May 2012, while JPMorgan’s Senior Management was
devoting daily attention to CIO-VCG and the SCP traders’ quarter-end marks—in large measure
to ensure that CIO results reported in its upcoming quarterly report would be accurate—it also
was in contact with members of the Audit Committee.
65.
However, while JPMorgan Senior Management was informed of, and was
addressing, various issues with internal controls at CIO-VCG, JPMorgan Senior Management
did not engage in a considered assessment, before the firm filed its first quarter report on May
10, 2012, to determine if these matters constituted a significant deficiency or material weakness
in the firm’s internal control over financial reporting and therefore had to be disclosed to the
firm’s Audit Committee. Nor, more broadly, did JPMorgan Senior Management disclose to the
Audit Committee its concerns regarding the operation of CIO-VCG.
66.
On May 2, 2012, the Audit Committee met with some members of JPMorgan
Senior Management. The focus of the meeting was on the mounting losses in the SCP portfolio.
Despite the requirement to keep the Audit Committee apprised of the significant control issues
that were under review, there was no discussion of the IB-VCG or Controller reviews related to
CIO-VCG and the traders’ marks, although that work was underway. There was also no
discussion of the fact that an outside law firm had been retained to advise on disclosures to be
made in the first quarter Form 10-Q that related to CIO and to assess certain aspects of the CIOVCG process, including whether the SCP traders exercised undue influence on the process.
67.
During a full meeting of the Board of Directors hours before the filing of
JPMorgan’s first quarter report on May 10, 2012, JPMorgan Senior Management mentioned that
reviews of what occurred in CIO were underway, including by Internal Audit, legal, the
Controller’s staff, and risk management. But, JPMorgan Senior Management did not discuss the
details of or facts learned in the IB-VCG, Controller, or Internal Audit reviews.
68.
Because the Audit Committee was not apprised of the initiation of the reviews or
facts learned as a result of those reviews, it was unable to provide input on the issues before the
filing of JPMorgan’s first quarter report, and was unable to engage with those doing the work to
ensure that it was sufficient from the perspective of the Audit Committee.
69.
As noted above, the Audit Committee was not made aware before JPMorgan filed
its first quarter report of the facts learned by various members of the review teams, including that
CIO-VCG’s March 2012 price-testing process was compromised by spreadsheet errors, that SCP
traders may have exerted influence over that process, or that CIO-VCG applied valuation
thresholds that were in some instances twice the applicable spread.
70.
Other information learned by various members of the review teams that further
called into question CIO-VCG’s March 2012 quarter-end valuation process was not shared with
the Audit Committee. At the end of the first quarter, CIO-VCG made a fair value adjustment of
$17 million to the traders’ marks. However, certain facts raised issues as to the adequacy of this
adjustment and the process through which it was made, including the $520 million in collateral
disputes over SCP positions, the $767 million disparity between the SCP traders’ marks and
consensus, mid-market prices, the fact that the traders marked some of the largest notional SCP

14

positions outside the bid-offer spread approximated by IB-VCG, and the fact that the traders
began to mark the SCP at the aggressive end of the bid-offer spread when losses began to mount.
71.
Finally, the Audit Committee was not apprised of, or included in, JPMorgan
Senior Management’s efforts to remedy the control issues at CIO-VCG by revising valuation
policies to ensure proper oversight by CIO management. As a result, the Audit Committee did
not have any input into the proposed changes or an understanding of the reasons that motivated
them.
Subsequent Disclosures by JPMorgan
72.
Based on the information available to it, the Audit Committee approved of the
content of JPMorgan’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q that was filed on May 10, 2012. On July
13, 2012, JPMorgan disclosed that a material weakness existed in its internal control over
financial reporting stemming from the “effectiveness of CIO’s internal controls over valuation of
the synthetic credit portfolio.” In its amended Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2012 filed on
August 9, 2012, JPMorgan disclosed that this material weakness finding “was the result of issues
in certain interrelated and interdependent control elements comprising that process, including
insufficient engagement of CIO senior finance management in the valuation control process in
light of the increased size and heightened risk profile of the synthetic credit portfolio during the
first quarter of 2012, and in the effectiveness of certain procedures employed during the first
quarter of 2012 by the CIO Valuation Control Group in performing the price verifications.”
73.
JPMorgan also corrected prior statements concerning its disclosure controls and
procedures. In its May 10 Form 10-Q, JPMorgan stated, “As of the end of the period covered by
this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the
Firm’s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls
and procedures were effective.” On August 9, 2012, when JPMorgan disclosed that it had
determined that a material weakness existed at CIO as of March 31, 2012, it also disclosed that,
“[a]s a result of that determination, the Firm’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer also concluded that the Firm’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were not effective at March 31,
2012.”
