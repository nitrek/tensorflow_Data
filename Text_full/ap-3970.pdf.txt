In the Matter of
DAVID S. HALL, P.C.
ORDER REGARDING DAVID S.
d/b/a THE HALL GROUP CPAs,
HALL’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY
DAVID S. HALL, CPA,
DISPOSITION
MICHELLE L. HELTERBRAN COCHRAN, CPA,
and SUSAN A. CISNEROS

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
in this matter on April 26, 2016. On July 1, 2016, Respondents David S. Hall, P.C. d/b/a The
Hall Group CPAs, and David S. Hall, CPA (collectively, Hall), filed a motion for summary
disposition.
Hall argues that this proceeding is barred by collateral estoppel (issue preclusion) and res
judicata (claim preclusion), based on The Hall Group, CPAs and David S. Hall, CPA, PCAOB
Release No. 105-2016-015 (Apr. 26, 2016) (PCAOB Order) (available at https://pcaobus.org/
Enforcement/Decisions/Documents/105-2016-015-Hall.pdf (last accessed July 7, 2016)). See
Motion at 1-3, 14. The PCAOB Order, of which I take official notice, was the result of a settled
proceeding, the substantive findings of which Hall neither admitted nor denied. See PCAOB
Order at 2; 17 C.F.R. § 201.323. The PCAOB Order found that Hall violated certain PCAOB
rules and auditing standards in connection with the audits of three issuers in 2012 and 2013. See
PCAOB Order at 3. The PCAOB therefore ordered a censure against both Respondents, a threeyear associational bar as to David S. Hall, CPA, a three-year registration revocation as to The
Hall Group, CPAs, and a civil penalty of $10,000. See id. at 14-15.
Collateral estoppel bars relitigation of an issue actually litigated and resolved in a valid
court determination essential to a prior judgment, even if the issue arises in a different claim.
See Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 892 (2008). Collateral estoppel requires proof that: (1) the
issue at stake was identical to the one involved in the prior action; (2) the issue was actually
litigated in the prior action; and (3) the determination of the issue in the prior action was a
necessary part of the judgment in that earlier action. See RecoverEdge L.P. v. Pentecost, 44 F.3d
1284, 1290 (5th Cir. 1995). Issues resolved by consent typically are not presented to a court to
be “actually litigated and determined,” or made a necessary part of the judgment. I.A.M. Nat’l

Pension Fund, Benefit Plan A v. Indus. Gear Mfg. Co., 723 F.2d 944, 949 (D.C. Cir. 1978).
There are exceptions, such as follow-on Commission enforcement actions based upon consent
judgments, where the judgments “unambiguously bar[] [the respondent] from making any future
challenge to the allegations in the complaint.” See Siris v. SEC, 773 F.3d 89, 96 (D.C. Cir.
2014). But in general, consent judgments are not accorded collateral estoppel effect in either the
United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit or the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. See Amador Cty. v. Salazar, 640 F.3d 373, 384 (D.C. Cir. 2011);
Avondale Shipyards, Inc. v. Insured Lloyd’s, 786 F.2d 1265, 1272 (5th Cir. 1986) (citing Kaspar
Wire Works, Inc. v. Leco Eng’g & Mach., Inc., 575 F.2d 530, 539 (5th Cir. 1978)); I.A.M. Nat.
Pension Fund, 723 F.2d at 949.
The PCAOB Order was unquestionably entered by consent, and Hall’s contention that
“[t]he issues were actually litigated” is patently wrong. See PCAOB Order at 2; Motion at 12.
Nor does the PCAOB Order unambiguously bar Hall from making any future challenge to its
findings in non-PCAOB proceedings. See PCAOB Order at 2. Therefore, no aspect of the
present proceeding is barred by collateral estoppel, and there is no need for further briefing on
the issue.
Whether res judicata applies here is a more difficult question. “Res judicata bars
litigation of any claim for relief that was available in a prior suit between the parties or their
privies, whether or not the claim was actually litigated.” See Gordon Brent Pierce, Securities
Act of 1933 Release No. 9555, 2014 WL 896757, at *9 (Mar. 7, 2014) (internal quotation marks
omitted), pet. denied, 786 F.3d 1027 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Res judicata requires proof of: (1) a final
judgment on the merits in a prior suit; (2) an identity of the cause of action in both the earlier and
the later suit; and (3) an identity of parties or their privies in the two suits. See id.; see also
Russell v. SunAmerica Sec., Inc., 962 F.2d 1169, 1172-73 (5th Cir. 1992) (adding requirement
that the prior judgment must have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction). There is
overlap in the underlying transactions, although the OIP encompasses sixteen audits and thirtyfive engagement quality reviews rather than just the three audits and reviews described in the
PCAOB Order. See OIP at 12-14. Moreover, privity between the PCAOB and the Commission
in this context appears to be a question of first impression. See Motion at 5-9; cf. Jones v. SEC,
115 F.3d 1173, 1180-81 (4th Cir. 1997) (Commission and NASD, FINRA’s predecessor, are not
in privity for res judicata purposes). Resolution of Hall’s res judicata argument would benefit
from full briefing.
It is therefore ORDERED that the motion for summary disposition filed by Respondents
David S. Hall, P.C. d/b/a The Hall Group CPAs, and David S. Hall, CPA, is DENIED IN PART
as outlined above. The Division’s response to the motion need only address res judicata.
