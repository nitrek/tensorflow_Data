ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR INTERLOCUTORY REVIEW AND PETITION TO
APPLY THE COMMISSION’S AMENDED RULES OF PRACTICE
Petition filed:
Last brief received:

July 25, 2016
August 3, 2016

Lynn Tilton; Patriarch Partners, LLC; Patriarch Partners VII, LLC; Patriarch Partners
XIV, LLC; and Patriarch Partners XV, LLC (collectively, “Respondents”), petition the
Commission for interlocutory review of an administrative law judge’s order that the hearing in
this proceeding begin on October 24, 2016. Respondents also petition for interlocutory review of
the law judge’s refusal to seek an extension of the deadline for filing an initial decision (currently
set to expire on November 12, 2016) under Commission Rule of Practice 360.1 Respondents

See 17 C.F.R. § 200.360(a)(2). Respondents style their filing as a “petition directly to the
Commission” and, “in the alternative,” as a petition for interlocutory review. Because
interlocutory review under Rule of Practice 400 “is the exclusive remedy of a hearing officer’s
ruling prior to Commission consideration of the entire proceeding,” we construe their request
regarding the hearing date and initial decision deadline as a petition for interlocutory review. See

further petition for an order that would apply the Commission’s recent amendments to the Rules
of Practice (the “Amended Rules”)2 to this proceeding. The Division of Enforcement (the
“Division”) opposes Respondents’ petition.
Respondents’ petition for interlocutory review is denied. The law judge’s rulings
regarding the hearing date and initial decision deadline are not appropriate for immediate
Commission review. With respect to the Amended Rules, the Commission has already
determined how the Amended Rules should apply to pending proceedings.
I.

Background

The Commission instituted this proceeding on March 30, 2015, alleging that Respondents
violated the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.3 Two days later,
Respondents filed an injunctive action in federal district court on the ground that, among other
things, the presiding administrative law judge’s appointment violated the Appointments Clause
of Article II of the U.S. Constitution.
As Respondents pursued their civil suit, this proceeding continued. Among other things,
the parties exchanged witness and exhibit lists and expert reports. The law judge also conducted
a prehearing conference on May 7, 2015, and scheduled a hearing to begin on October 13, 2015.
On June 30, 2015, the district court dismissed Respondents’ civil suit for lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction, concluding that Respondents must first raise their claims through the
administrative remedial scheme established by Congress.4 Respondents appealed to the court of
appeals, which stayed the Commission’s administrative proceeding on September 17, 2015,
while it considered Respondents’ appeal. The court of appeals affirmed the district court’s
dismissal of Respondents’ suit on June 1, 2016, and ordered that its stay be vacated.5
On July 8, 2016, two days after the stay was ultimately lifted,6 attorneys from Gibson,
Dunn & Crutcher LLP filed notices of appearance on behalf of Respondents.7 Respondents and

. . . administrative law judge . . . upon its own initiative,” 15 U.S.C. § 78(d)-1(b), we find no
basis for doing so for the same reasons we find interlocutory review inappropriate.

In response to a motion for clarification from the Commission, the court of appeals
confirmed on June 28, 2016 that “the stay is vacated, subject, however, to a continuation of the

3
the Division jointly proposed that the law judge schedule a hearing date for early December
2016. On July 15, 2016, the law judge declined to do so, stating that “a December 2016 hearing
date [wa]s inconsistent with a timely resolution of this proceeding consistent with 17 C.F.R. §
201.360” and ordered the parties to propose a hearing date in September 2016.
On July 20, 2016, Respondents requested that the law judge reconsider and vacate her
July 15 order. Respondents also requested, in the alternative, that the law judge certify her July
15 order for interlocutory review. That same day, Respondents also requested that the law judge
ask the chief administrative law judge to submit a motion to the Commission requesting an
extension of time for filing an initial decision.8
Later that day, the law judge rescheduled the hearing for October 24, 2016, but denied
Respondents’ request for a December 2016 hearing date. The law judge explained:
This case involves a single individual respondent and four related entities,
charged with violations of Advisers Act Sections 206(1), 206(2), and
206(4) 9 and Rule 206(4)-8. 10 More than five months elapsed from the
institution of this proceeding until the time this proceeding was stayed in
September 2015, with the hearing originally scheduled to commence on
October 13, 2015. Most of the prehearing steps had already been
completed, as noted in the July 15 Order. The Second Circuit vacated its
stay order on June 1, 2016, thus making the parties aware that this
proceeding would soon continue.
Respondents’ hiring new counsel and intent to file a large number of
prehearing motions are not an adequate basis for substantial delay. It is
also unnecessary for Respondents to file numerous motions simply to
preserve issues, such as constitutional issues, for appeal; they may simply
note such objections for the record. As to Respondents’ concerns about

Respondents declined to file such a motion, and the stay expired on July 6, 2016.

Attorneys from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP noticed their withdrawal on the
same day. Attorneys from Brune Law P.C. noticed their appearance as Respondents’ counsel on
April 13, 2015, and have remained Respondents’ counsel of record since that date.

including use of subpoenas, to compel attendance of witnesses, or can

necessary.
The law judge also declined to certify her July 15 order for interlocutory review, finding that
Respondents’ request “patently fails to meet the standards of 17 C.F.R. § 201.400(c) and must be
denied.” Finally, the law judge did not grant their request for an extension of the initial decision
deadline and did not certify that ruling for interlocutory review.
II.
A.

Analysis

Respondents’ petition does not raise issues appropriate for interlocutory review.

The Commission’s “emphatic preference—which embodies the ‘general rule’ disfavoring
piecemeal, interlocutory appeals—is that claims should be presented in a single petition for
review after ‘the entire record [has been] developed’ and ‘after issuance by the law judge of an
initial decision.’”11 A party’s disagreement with a law judge’s determination “does not make a
ruling ‘appropriate for interlocutory review.’”12 Interlocutory review is appropriate “only in a
truly unusual case, where serious and prejudicial error [is] plainly apparent upon even a cursory
review of the record, and where deferring review until issuance of an initial decision might well
postpone an inevitable later vacatur and remand.”13 Indeed, Rule 400 provides that petitions for
interlocutory review are “disfavored” and will be granted only in “extraordinary circumstances”
to “make clear that petitions for interlocutory review . . . rarely will be granted.”14 We do not
find such extraordinary circumstances to be present here.
The law judge decided to set the hearing for October 2016 rather than December 2016
and did not request an extension of the initial decision deadline.15 Setting a hearing date and
deciding whether to seek an extension of time to file an initial decision fits squarely within the
law judge’s authority under Rule of Practice 111 to “regulat[e] the course of a proceeding.”16

That rule is “‘broadly worded’ to accommodate a law judge’s discretion to manage a case plan
within the limits of our Rules of Practice and governing statutes.”17 The Commission has
repeatedly emphasized that it will not grant petitions for interlocutory review of such “factbound, discretionary procedural rulings.”18 Moreover, the law judge’s decisions about when to
hold the hearing and whether to request an extension of time in which to issue an initial decision
involve quintessentially mixed questions of law and fact that are inappropriate for interlocutory
review.19
These decisions also do not satisfy the standards for obtaining certification of a ruling for
interlocutory review from the law judge—that (1) the ruling “involves controlling questions of
law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion” and (2) an “immediate
review of the order may materially advance completion of the proceeding.”20 As the law judge
recognized, the rulings that Respondents seek to challenge “fail[] to meet the[se]

standards.”21 And “issues that do not satisfy Rule 400(c) will almost never be appropriate for
interlocutory consideration by the Commission.”22
Respondents argue that interlocutory review is appropriate because the present hearing
schedule denies them “the opportunity to fully and fairly litigate their defense” and violates their
“right to counsel of [their] choice by effectively punishing Respondents for changing counsel
recently.” But the Supreme Court has made clear that “only an unreasoning and arbitrary
‘insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay’ violates the right to
the assistance of counsel.”23 This is not a case in which there are “extraordinary circumstances”
warranting postponement, such as when respondents are left without assistance of counsel at or
near the hearing date through no fault of their own.24 Although Respondents recently replaced

We do not believe that granting interlocutory review will materially advance completion of
the proceeding. To the contrary, immediate Commission review of the law judge’s pre-hearing
decisions is more likely to delay the proceedings further. If the law judge’s pre-hearing
decisions are later determined to be incorrect, those decisions can “‘be effectively reviewed postjudgment’” by vacatur and remand. Nat. Blue Res., 2015 WL 470453, at *4 (quoting Dearlove,
2006 SEC LEXIS 3191, at *6 n.7) (finding that review of law judge’s refusal to postpone hearing
date was likely to delay proceeding further and could be effectively reviewed on appeal); accord
Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 107 (2009) (determining that, even though a
ruling “may burden litigants in ways that are only imperfectly reparable by appellate reversal,”
that possibility “has never sufficed” to warrant immediate interlocutory review (quoting Digital
Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863, 872 (1994))); United States v. Breeden, 366
F.3d 369, 375 (4th Cir. 2004) (finding a trial court’s order granting or denying a continuance not
subject to interlocutory review because the order could be “effectively reviewed postjudgment”); Scholl v. Felmont Oil Corp., 327 F.2d 697, 699–700 (6th Cir. 1964) (stating that
“[t]he denial of a motion for a continuance is not a final decision from which an appeal will lie”
but that “the propriety of such an order is subject to review by the Court of Appeals if and when
the case is properly before the court on a later appeal from the final decision in the case”).

some of their attorneys, they have been represented by other attorneys from Brune Law P.C.
throughout this proceeding.
Nor are we persuaded by Respondents’ claim that their new counsel will have insufficient
time to review what they describe as a voluminous and complex record. When the court of
appeals initially stayed this proceeding, the hearing was set to begin in three weeks and, as the
Division notes, many phases of the proceeding had been completed, including the exchange of
witness and exhibit lists and expert reports. Once the court of appeals lifted that stay on July 6,
the law judge essentially granted the parties an additional 13 weeks in which to prepare by
rescheduling the hearing for October 24.25 The Commission has consistently declined to grant
interlocutory review based on similar claims of insufficient time to review large or complex
records.26 Moreover, Respondents’ claims about their alleged inability to prepare adequately, the
Division’s alleged failure to produce documents and information, and key witnesses’ alleged

for a postponement until less than a week before the hearing).

unavailability are, at this point, too speculative to interrupt the proceedings and order immediate
review.27
B.

The Commission has specified how the Amended Rules apply to pending
proceedings.

The Commission has already considered how the Amended Rules should apply to
pending proceedings, and many of the Amended Rules will apply to this proceeding. For
example, in adopting the Amended Rules, the Commission concluded that it would be “just and
practicable” for the amendments to Rules 180 (Sanctions), 232 (Subpoenas), 235 (Prior Sworn
Statements), and 320 (Evidence Admissibility) to apply to proceedings where, as here, the
hearing will begin after the effective date (which is September 27, 2016).28 The Commission
similarly concluded that rules concerning appellate procedure (e.g., Rule 410) will apply to
appeals filed on or after the Amended Rules’ effective date.29
Nonetheless, Respondents request that the Commission order that the Amended Rules
concerning the timing of proceedings, depositions and expert discovery, and dispositive motions
also apply to this proceeding. The Commission has already determined that this is not “just and
practicable.”30 The Amended Rules apply to pending proceedings “depending on the stage of the
proceeding.”31 This is a case that was stayed on the eve of a final hearing, after discovery had
virtually been completed and the parties had made pre-trial disclosures of witness lists and expert
reports. Applying these Amended Rules to such a case—which would, among other things,
entail the parties’ conducting depositions—runs counter to the Commission’s determination that
for cases in a sufficiently advanced posture, application of these Amended Rules would delay
resolution and “unduly disrupt pending proceedings.”32 Respondents provide no compelling
reasons why we should treat their case uniquely from all the other pending cases in our
administrative tribunals, and deviate from our decision that the availability of the Amended
Rules for litigants in pending proceedings should depend on the stage of their proceeding.

See, e.g., Midwestern Gas Transmission Co. v. FERC, 589 F.2d 603, 622 (D.C. Cir. 1978)
(finding that parties’ “alleged injury falls far short of what is required to overcome the Court’s
interest in denying consideration until the issues are more sharply defined”). We note, however,
that such issues rarely, if ever, would be appropriate for interlocutory review by the Commission.
