Amendments to Regulation D, Form D and Rule 156
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rules.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission, which today in separate
releases amended Rule 506 of Regulation D, Form D and Rule 144A under the Securities
Act of 1933 to implement Section 201(a) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act and
Section 926 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, is
publishing for comment a number of proposed amendments to Regulation D, Form D and
Rule 156 under the Securities Act. These proposed amendments are intended to enhance
the Commission’s ability to evaluate the development of market practices in Rule 506
offerings and to address concerns that may arise in connection with permitting issuers to
engage in general solicitation and general advertising under new paragraph (c) of Rule
506. Specifically, the proposed amendments to Regulation D would require the filing of
a Form D in Rule 506(c) offerings before the issuer engages in general solicitation;
require the filing of a closing amendment to Form D after the termination of any
Rule 506 offering; require written general solicitation materials used in Rule 506(c)
offerings to include certain legends and other disclosures; require the submission, on a
temporary basis, of written general solicitation materials used in Rule 506(c) offerings to
the Commission; and disqualify an issuer from relying on Rule 506 for one year for

future offerings if the issuer, or any predecessor or affiliate of the issuer, did not comply,
within the last five years, with Form D filing requirements in a Rule 506 offering. The
proposed amendments to Form D would require an issuer to include additional
information about offerings conducted in reliance on Regulation D. Finally, the proposed
amendments to Rule 156 would extend the antifraud guidance contained in the rule to the
sales literature of private funds.

I.

INTRODUCTION
We are adopting today, in separate releases, amendments to Rule 506 of

Regulation D 8 and to Form D 9 to implement Section 201(a)(1) of the Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”) 10 and Section 926 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). 11 Rule 506 was
originally adopted as a non-exclusive safe harbor under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), the statutory exemption from Securities Act
registration for transactions by an issuer “not involving any public offering.” 12 To
implement Section 201(a)(1) of the JOBS Act, we are adding new paragraph (c) to Rule
506, which permits issuers to use general solicitation and general advertising
(collectively, “general solicitation”) when conducting an offering pursuant to this new
paragraph, provided that all purchasers of the securities are accredited investors and the
issuer takes reasonable steps to verify that such purchasers are accredited investors. 13 We

17 CFR 230.506. The Commission adopted Rule 506 and Regulation D in 1982 as a result of the
Commission’s evaluation of the impact of its rules on the ability of small businesses to raise capital. See
Revision of Certain Exemptions From Registration for Transactions Involving Limited Offers and Sales,
Release No. 33-6389 (Mar. 8, 1982) [47 FR 11251 (Mar. 16, 1982)]. Over the years, the Commission has
revised various provisions of Regulation D in order to address, among other things, specific concerns
relating to facilitating capital raising as well as abuses that have arisen under Regulation D. See, e.g.,
Additional Small Business Initiatives, Release No. 33-6996 (Apr. 28, 1993) [58 FR 26509 (May 4, 1993)]
and Revision of Rule 504 of Regulation D, the “Seed Capital” Exemption, Release No. 33-7644 (Feb. 25,
1999) [64 FR 11090 (Mar. 8, 1999)].

Pub. L. No. 111-203, sec. 926, 124 Stat. 1376, 1851 (July 21, 2010) (codified at 15 U.S.C. 77d note).

12

15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(2). As with the Section 4(a)(2) statutory exemption, Rule 506 is available only to the
issuer of the securities and not to any affiliate of the issuer or to any other person for resales of the issuer’s
securities. See 17 CFR 230.500(d).

Eliminating the Prohibition Against General Solicitation and General Advertising in Rule 506 and Rule
144A Offerings, Release No. 33-9415 (July 10, 2013) (“Rule 506(c) Adopting Release”). In addition to

6

are also adding a new check box to Form D to require issuers to indicate that they are
relying on Rule 506(c) for their offering. 14 To implement Section 926 of the Dodd-Frank
Act, we are adding new paragraph (d) to Rule 506, which disqualifies issuers and other
market participants from relying on Rule 506 if “felons and other ‘bad actors’” are
participating in the offering. 15 We are also amending the form of the signature block to
Form D to include a certification whereby issuers claiming a Rule 506 exemption will
confirm that the offering is not disqualified from reliance on Rule 506.
We anticipate that new Rule 506(c) will have a significant impact on Rule 506
offerings and on current capital-raising practices. Among other things, we anticipate that
issuers using Rule 506(c) will be able to reach a greater number of potential investors
than is currently the case in Rule 506 offerings, thereby increasing their access to sources
of capital. 16 As a result, accredited investors may be able to find and potentially invest in
a larger and more diverse pool of investment opportunities, which could result in a more
efficient allocation of capital by accredited investors. On the other hand, we recognize
the concerns raised by a number of commenters that a general solicitation for a Rule
506(c) offering would attract both accredited and non-accredited investors and could

these requirements, under new Rule 506(c), all terms and conditions of Rule 501 and Rules 502(a) and
502(d) of Regulation D [17 CFR 230.501 and 502(a) and (d)] must be satisfied.
14

As discussed in Section II.A of this release, Form D is the notice of an offering of securities made
without registration under the Securities Act in reliance on an exemption provided by Regulation D or
Section 4(a)(5) of the Securities Act.
15

Disqualification of Felons and Other “Bad Actors” from Rule 506 Offerings, Release No. 33-9414 (July
10, 2013).
16

Currently, under Rule 506(b) [17 CFR 230.506(b)], an issuer may sell securities, without any limitation
on the offering amount, to an unlimited number of “accredited investors,” as defined in Rule 501(a) of
Regulation D, and to no more than 35 non-accredited investors who meet certain “sophistication”
requirements. The availability of Rule 506(b) is subject to the terms and conditions of Rules 501 and 502
and is conditioned on the issuer, or any person acting on its behalf, not offering or selling securities through
any form of “general solicitation or general advertising.”

result in an increase in fraudulent activity in the Rule 506 market, as well as an increase
in unlawful sales of securities to non-accredited investors.
Many comments submitted on the Rule 506(c) Proposing Release, including the
comments submitted by the Investor Advisory Committee, urged the Commission to
propose or adopt other amendments to Regulation D or to Form D 17 that they believed
would be appropriate in connection with the adoption of the amendments to implement
Section 201(a) of the JOBS Act. 18 For example, several commenters suggested that we
amend Regulation D to provide that the availability of the new Rule 506(c) exemption be
conditioned on compliance with the Form D filing requirement, 19 require Form D to be
filed in advance of any general solicitation 20 and add to the information requirements of

To facilitate public input on JOBS Act rulemaking before the issuance of rule proposals, the
Commission invited members of the public to make their views known on various JOBS Act initiatives in
advance of any rulemaking by submitting comment letters to the Commission’s website at
http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/jobsactcomments.shtml. The comment letters relating to Section 201(a) of
the JOBS Act submitted in response to this invitation are located at http://www.sec.gov/comments/jobstitle-ii/jobs-title-ii.shtml. The comment letters submitted in response to the Rule 506(c) Proposing Release
are located at http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-07-12/s70712.shtml. Many commenters submitted
comment letters both before and after the issuance of the Rule 506(c) Proposing Release. Our references to
comment letters in this release that are not dated refer to the comment letters submitted in response to the
Rule 506(c) Proposing Release. Dated comment letters refer to those submitted before the issuance of the
Rule 506(c) Proposing Release or by commenters that submitted multiple letters.
18

See, e.g., letters from Fund Democracy, Inc. (“Fund Democracy”); North American Securities
Administrators Association, Inc. (“NASAA”); Consumer Federation of America (“Consumer Federation”);
SEC Investor Advisory Committee (“Investor Advisory Committee”). The Investor Advisory Committee
was established in April 2012 pursuant to Section 911 of the Dodd-Frank Act to advise the Commission on
regulatory priorities, the regulation of securities products, trading strategies, fee structures, the
effectiveness of disclosure, initiatives to protect investor interests and to promote investor confidence and
the integrity of the securities marketplace. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Investor Advisory
Committee to submit findings and recommendations for review and consideration by the Commission.
On October 12, 2012, the Investor Advisory Committee unanimously approved and submitted
recommendations to the Commission titled, Recommendations of the Investor Advisory Committee
Regarding SEC Rulemaking to Lift the Ban on General Solicitation and Advertising in Rule 506 Offerings:
Efficiently Balancing Investor Protection, Capital Formation and Market Integrity. The recommendations
are available at http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/investor-advisory-committee-2012/iac-general-solicitationadvertising-recommendations.pdf.

Form D. 21 In light of the fact that the financial thresholds in the definition of “accredited
investor” that relate to natural persons have not been updated since their adoption in
1982, 22 some commenters recommended that the Commission also amend the definition
of “accredited investor” as it relates to natural persons. 23 Other commenters suggested
that we propose rules governing the content and manner of general solicitations used in
offerings conducted pursuant to the new Rule 506(c) exemption, particularly with respect
to offerings by private funds. 24 Several commenters also recommended that we require
the filing or submission of general solicitation materials used pursuant to the new Rule

State of South Carolina (“South Carolina Securities Commissioner”); State Corporation Commission,
Division of Securities and Retail Franchising, Commonwealth of Virginia (“Virginia Division of

Federation; Massachusetts Securities Division (July 2, 2012); NASAA.
22

See Release No. 33-6389. For natural persons, Rule 501(a) defines an accredited investor as a person
whose individual net worth, or joint net worth with that person’s spouse, exceeds $1 million, excluding the
value of the person’s primary residence (the “net worth test”) or who had an individual income in excess of
$200,000 in each of the two most recent years, or joint income with that person’s spouse in excess of
$300,000 in each of those years, and has a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in the
current year (the “income test”).
Although the Dodd-Frank Act did not change the amount of the $1 million net worth test, it did change
how that amount is to be calculated – by excluding the value of a person’s primary residence. This change
took effect upon the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, and in December 2011, we amended Rule 501 to
incorporate this change into the definition of accredited investor. See Net Worth Standard for Accredited
Investors, Release No. 33-9287 (Dec. 21, 2011) [76 FR 81793 (Dec. 29, 2011)].
23

See, e.g., letters from AARP; Consumer Federation; Investment Company Institute (“ICI”); Investor
Advisory Committee; Massachusetts Securities Division (July 2, 2012); Ohio Division of Securities (July 3,
2012). Several commenters noted that under the Commission’s proposal in 2007 to partially lift the
prohibition on general solicitation for offerings sold only to “large accredited investors,” such investors
who were natural persons would have been required to have at least $400,000 in annual income or $2.5
million in investments. See letters from AFL-CIO and AFR; Fund Democracy; AARP. One commenter,
however, opposed increasing the thresholds for accredited investor status. See letter from National Small
Business Association (June 12, 2012).

506(c) exemption, whether to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), 25
to an electronic “drop box” to be created by the Commission specifically to receive
general solicitation materials 26 or as an exhibit to Form D. 27
In light of these comments and the magnitude of the change that the elimination
of the prohibition against general solicitation represents to the Rule 506 market, we are
proposing today a number of amendments in conjunction with the adoption of new Rule
506(c). These amendments are intended to enhance the Commission’s understanding of
the Rule 506 market by improving compliance with Form D filing requirements,
expanding the information requirements of Form D, primarily with respect to Rule 506
offerings, and requiring the submission, on a temporary basis, of written general
solicitation materials used in Rule 506(c) offerings to the Commission. We believe that
the elimination of the prohibition against general solicitation for Rule 506(c) offerings
will have a significant impact on the Rule 506 market, including the types of issuers that
raise capital using Rule 506, the investors who are solicited and ultimately purchase
securities in the offerings, the intermediaries that participate in this market, the practices
employed by issuers and intermediaries and the amount of capital that will be raised. To
review and analyze these changes more effectively, and to facilitate the assessment of the
effects of such changes on investor protection and capital formation, the Commission
staff will need better tools to evaluate this changing market than are currently provided
25

See letters from AFL-CIO and AFR; BetterInvesting (recommending that “the SEC require all public
solicitation materials under Rule 506 to be independently reviewed for compliance (perhaps by an
independent authority such as FINRA, which already reviews broker-dealer advertising) before or after the
public solicitation” (emphasis omitted)); ICI.

See letters from Massachusetts Securities Division (July 2, 2012); Ohio Division of Securities (July 3,

by the existing filing and information requirements of Form D. Further, we believe that
the proposed changes to the filing and information requirements of Form D could assist
the enforcement efforts of both federal and state regulators, which rely on Form D as an
important source of information about the private offering market.
Specifically, with respect to Form D and to Regulation D as it relates to Form D,
we are proposing to:
•

amend Rule 503 of Regulation D to require: (1) the filing of a Form D no
later than 15 calendar days in advance of the first use of general solicitation in
a Rule 506(c) offering; and (2) the filing of a closing Form D amendment
within 30 calendar days after the termination of a Rule 506 offering;

•

amend Form D to require additional information primarily in regard to
offerings conducted in reliance on Rule 506; and

•

amend Rule 507 of Regulation D to disqualify an issuer from relying on Rule
506 for one year for future offerings if the issuer, or any predecessor or
affiliate 28 of the issuer, did not comply, within the last five years, with all of
the Form D filing requirements in a Rule 506 offering.

In addition, in light of the ability of issuers to publicly advertise Rule 506(c)
offerings, we are concerned that prospective investors may not be sufficiently informed
as to whether they are qualified to participate in these offerings, the type of offerings
being conducted and certain potential risks associated with such offerings. To address
these concerns, we are proposing new Rule 509 of Regulation D, which would require
28

An “affiliate” is defined in Rule 501(b) of Regulation D [17 CFR 230.501(b)] as a person that directly,
or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under common control
with, the person specified.

11

issuers to include prescribed legends in any written communication that constitutes a
general solicitation in any offering conducted in reliance on Rule 506(c) (“written general
solicitation materials”). Private funds would also be required to include a legend
disclosing that the securities being offered are not subject to the protections of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Investment Company Act”) and additional
disclosures in written general solicitation materials that include performance data so that
potential investors are aware that there are limitations on the usefulness of such data and
provide context to understand the data presented. 29 We are proposing to disqualify an
issuer from relying on Rule 506 for future offerings if such issuer, or any predecessor or
affiliate of the issuer, has been subject to any order, judgment or court decree enjoining
such person for failure to comply with proposed Rule 509.
We are also proposing to amend Rule 156 under the Securities Act, 30 which
interprets the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with sales
literature used by investment companies, to apply to the sales literature of private funds
because we believe it is important for private funds to consider the Commission’s views
on the applicability of the antifraud provisions to their sales literature. We are also
soliciting comment on a recommendation made by commenters on the Rule 506(c)
Proposing Release to mandate additional manner and content restrictions on written
general solicitation materials used by private funds.
As the Commission will need to be aware of developments in the Rule 506 market
29

A private fund is an issuer that would be an investment company, as defined in Section 3 of the
Investment Company Act, but for the exclusion from the definition of “investment company” in Section
3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of that Act. We also refer in this release to “pooled investment funds” because
that term is used in Form D. Issuers that rely on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act
are a subset of pooled investment funds.
30

17 CFR 230.156.

12

after the effectiveness of Rule 506(c), we are proposing Rule 510T to require issuers, on
a temporary basis, to submit any written general solicitation materials used in their
Rule 506(c) offerings to the Commission no later than the date of the first use of these
materials. Such materials would be required to be submitted through an intake page on
the Commission’s website. We are not proposing, at this time, that these materials would
be available to the public; therefore, issuers would not file their written general
solicitation materials through the Commission’s EDGAR system. We are proposing to
disqualify an issuer from relying on Rule 506 for future offerings if such issuer, or any
predecessor or affiliate of the issuer, has been subject to any order, judgment or court
decree enjoining such person for failure to comply with proposed Rule 510T.
We also appreciate the need to undertake a broader effort to review and analyze
the market impact and developing market practices resulting from permitting general
solicitation in connection with offerings relying on new Rule 506(c). Accordingly, we
will evaluate the use of Rule 506(c) by issuers and market participants, and, in particular,
the steps they take to verify that the purchasers of the offered securities are accredited
investors. We have directed the Commission staff to execute a comprehensive work plan
upon the effectiveness of Rule 506(c) to review and analyze the use of Rule 506(c) (the
“Rule 506(c) Work Plan”), which will involve a coordinated effort of staff from the
Division of Corporation Finance, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis
(“DERA”), the Division of Investment Management, the Division of Trading and
Markets, the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (“OCIE”) and the
Division of Enforcement. The Commission staff will, among other things:

13

•

evaluate the range of purchaser verification practices used by issuers and other
participants in these offerings, including whether these verification practices
are excluding or identifying non-accredited investors;

•

evaluate whether the absence of the prohibition against general solicitation has
been accompanied by an increase in sales to non-accredited investors;

•

assess whether the availability of Rule 506(c) has facilitated new capital
formation or has shifted capital formation from registered offerings and
unregistered non-Rule 506(c) offerings to Rule 506(c) offerings;

•

examine the information submitted or available to the Commission on Rule
506(c) offerings, including the information in Form D filings and the form and
content of written general solicitation materials submitted to the Commission;

•

monitor the market for Rule 506(c) offerings for increased incidence of fraud
and develop risk characteristics regarding the types of issuers and market
participants that conduct or participate in Rule 506(c) offerings and the types
of investors targeted in these offerings to assist with this effort;

•

incorporate an evaluation of the practices in Rule 506(c) offerings in the
staff’s examinations of registered broker-dealers and registered investment
advisers; 31 and

•

coordinate with state securities regulators on sharing information about Rule
506(c) offerings.

31

OCIE currently examines multiple types of market participants that have involvement in private
offerings, including registered broker-dealers that advise issuers on private placements and registered
investment advisers that advise clients investing in private placements or advise private funds that offer
fund interests pursuant to private offerings.

14

Implementation of the Rule 506(c) Work Plan will assist the Commission in
evaluating the development of market practices in Rule 506(c) offerings. The
amendments we propose today would, if adopted, support the Rule 506(c) Work Plan by
enhancing the timeliness, quality and completeness of information on the issuers,
investors and financial intermediaries that participate in the Rule 506 market and by
requiring the submission of written general solicitation materials to the Commission. The
proposed amendments would also assist the Commission’s efforts to protect investors and
to evaluate the development of market practices in Rule 506(c) offerings and would
support future Commission consideration of any additional changes related to
Rule 506(c), consistent with the Commission’s mission of protecting investors,
maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation.
In addition, many commenters stated, and we agree, that the definition of
accredited investor as it relates to natural persons should be reviewed and, if necessary or
appropriate, amended. The Commission staff has begun a review of the definition of
accredited investor as it relates to natural persons, including the need for any changes to
this definition following the effectiveness of Rule 506(c). We further discuss the
definition of accredited investor, and request comment on the definition, in Section V of
this release.

PROPOSED AMENDMENTS RELATING TO FORM D
A.

Background

Form D is the notice of an offering of securities conducted without registration

15

under the Securities Act in reliance on Rule 504, 505 or 506 of Regulation D. 32 Under
Rule 503 of Regulation D, an issuer offering or selling securities in reliance on Rule 504,
505 or 506 of Regulation D must file a notice of sales on Form D with the Commission
for each new offering of securities no later than 15 calendar days after the first sale of
securities in the offering. 33 Form D is currently organized around 16 numbered items or
categories of information. The information required to be provided in a Form D filing
includes basic identifying information, such as the name of the issuer of the securities and
the issuer’s year and place of incorporation or organization; information about related
persons (executive officers, directors and promoters); the exemption or exemptions being
claimed for the offering; and factual information about the offering, such as the duration
of the offering, the type of securities offered and the total offering amount. Although the
requirement to file a Form D pursuant to Rule 503 was a condition of Rules 504, 505 and
506 when all of these rules were originally adopted, 34 it is currently not a condition of
those rules. Instead, under Rule 507 of Regulation D, an issuer will be disqualified from

32

Regulation D contains separate exemptions for limited offerings in Rules 504, 505 and 506. Rule 504
[17 CFR 230.504] exempts the offer and sale of up to $1 million of securities in a 12-month period by
issuers that are not subject to reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
“Exchange Act”). Rule 505 [17 CFR 230.505] exempts offerings by issuers of up to $5 million of
securities in a 12-month period. Form D also applies to offerings of securities without registration in
reliance on the exemption contained in Section 4(a)(5) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(5)].
33

This 15-day time frame has remained unchanged since the adoption of Regulation D in 1982. In 2008,
we revised Rule 503 to provide that when a Form D filing otherwise would be due on a weekend or holiday
it will be deemed due on the next business day. Electronic Filing and Revision of Form D, Release No. 338891 (Feb. 6, 2008) [73 FR 10592 (Feb. 27, 2008)].
34

In 1988, the Commission proposed to eliminate the requirement to file a Form D as a condition to the
availability of the Regulation D exemptions, noting that “[c]ommenters have frequently criticized” this
condition. Regulation D, Release No. 33-6759 (Mar. 3, 1988) [53 FR 7870 (Mar. 10, 1988)]; Regulation
D, Release No. 33-6812 (Dec. 20, 1988) [54 FR 309 (Jan. 5, 1989)] (reproposing the elimination of Rule
503 as a condition of the Regulation D exemptions after commenters expressed concern over the effect of
the proposals on enforcement efforts and potential impairment of private rights of action). In 1989, the
Commission removed the filing of Form D as a condition to the Regulation D exemptions. Regulation D,
Release No. 33-6825 (Mar. 15, 1989) [54 FR 11369 (Mar. 20, 1989)].

16

using Regulation D if it, or a predecessor or affiliate, is enjoined by a court for failure to
comply with Rule 503. 35 The Commission can waive any such disqualification upon a
showing of good cause. 36
At the time the Commission adopted Regulation D and Form D in 1982, the Form
D filing requirements in Rule 503 were intended to serve an important data collection
function, including, among other things, for the Commission’s rulemaking efforts. 37
Until 2008, however, issuers made Form D filings in paper format, making the extraction
of information for large-scale statistical analysis problematic. 38 In 2008, we adopted rule
and form amendments that mandated the electronic filing of Form D on the
Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system in a
structured format. 39 As a result of these amendments, which were phased in from

35

See Release No. 33-6759 (“As proposed, the filing obligation under Rule 503 would continue but would
no longer be a condition to the exemption. In order to provide an incentive for filing the Form D in a
timely manner, the Commission is proposing new Rule 507, which would disqualify an issuer from the use
of the Regulation D exemptions if it had been found to have violated Rule 503.”); Release No. 33-6825
(adopting Rule 507 as proposed).
36

Rule 507(b) [17 CFR 230.507(b)].

37

We stated in the proposing release for Regulation D:
An important purpose of the notice … is to collect empirical data which will provide a basis for further
action by the Commission either in terms of amending existing rules and regulations or proposing new
ones …. Further, the proposed Form will allow the Commission to elicit information necessary in
assessing the effectiveness of Regulation D as a capital raising device for small businesses.

Proposed Revision of Certain Exemptions from the Registration Provisions of the Securities Act of 1933
for Transactions Involving Limited Offers and Sales, Release No. 33-6339 (Aug. 7, 1981) [46 FR 41791,
41799 (Aug. 18, 1981)].
38

In 1996, we proposed to eliminate the Form D filing requirement entirely and replace it with an issuer
obligation to complete a Form D and retain it for a period of time. Phase Two Recommendations of Task
Force on Disclosure Simplification, Release No. 33-7301 (May 31, 1996) [61 FR 30405 (June 14, 1996)].
After reviewing comments on the proposal, we decided to retain the requirement because the information
collected in Form D filings was still useful to us “in conducting economic and other analyses of the private
placement market.” Phase Two Recommendations of Task Force on Disclosure Simplification, Release
No. 33-7431 (July 18, 1997) [62 FR 39755, 39756 (July 24, 1997)].
39

See Release No. 33-8891. At that time, we substantially revised Form D to simplify and restructure the
form, eliminate outdated information requirements and update and supplement other information
requirements. For example, we added requirements to provide revenue range information for the issuer, or

17

September 2008 to March 2009, Form D filings are now machine-readable, and the
Commission, its staff, other securities regulators and the public at large now have a
greater ability to analyze the Regulation D offering market through the information
supplied in electronic Form D filings. In addition, the information in Form D filings has
been useful for a number of other purposes, such as serving as a source of information for
investors 40 and facilitating the enforcement of the federal securities laws and the
enforcement efforts of state securities regulators and FINRA. 41 For example, state
securities regulators typically rely on Form D as their sole notice that a Rule 506 offering
is being conducted because securities issued in Rule 506 offerings are “covered
securities” under Section 18(b)(4)(D) of the Securities Act 42 and therefore are exempt
from state blue sky registration requirements.
We understand that some issuers are not making a Form D filing for Rule 506
offerings because the filing of Form D is not a condition of Rule 506. In addition, we are
limited in our ability to gather information about Rule 506 offerings at the
commencement of these offerings because Form D currently is not required to be filed
until 15 calendar days after the first sale of securities in the offerings; and the absence of
net asset value range information in the case of pooled investment funds (subject to an option in both cases
to decline to disclose); more specific information on the registration exemption claimed as well as
information on any exclusion claimed from the definition of “investment company” under the Investment
Company Act; information on the date of first sale in the offering; and information on whether the offering
is expected to last over a year.
40

Id. (noting that the Commission’s website “advises potential investors in Regulation D offerings to
check whether the company making the offering has filed a Form D notice and advises that ‘[i]f the
company has not filed a Form D, this should alert you that the company might not be in compliance with
the federal securities laws’”).
41

Id. (stating that “[t]he staffs of state securities regulators and [FINRA] also use Form D information to
enforce securities laws and the rules of securities self-regulatory organizations”).
42

15 U.S.C. 77r(b)(4)(D). Although Securities Act Section 18 preempts state registration and review of
offerings of “covered securities,” the states have investigated and brought a number of enforcement actions
alleging fraud and deceit in Rule 506 offerings. See, e.g., letter from NASAA (stating that, in 2011, “state
regulators took more than 200 enforcement actions related specifically to Rule 506 offerings”).

18

a closing filing requirement means that the Commission does not have a complete picture
of Rule 506 offerings, such as the total amount of capital actually raised in these
offerings. Other than the newly adopted requirement for issuers to indicate in Form D
whether they are relying on Rule 506(c), Form D does not require information specific to
Rule 506(c) offerings, such as information about the issuer’s plans to engage in general
solicitation, any practices used to satisfy the verification requirement in Rule 506(c) and
the types of investors participating in Rule 506(c) offerings.
Accordingly, we are proposing a number of amendments to Regulation D and
Form D. These amendments would require the advance filing of Form D for Rule 506(c)
offerings, require the filing of an amendment to Form D after termination of a Rule 506
offering, expand the information requirements in Form D for offerings conducted under
Rule 506 and disqualify issuers from using Rule 506 for future offerings until one year
has elapsed after the required Form D filings are made if they, or their predecessors or
affiliates, failed to comply, within the past five years, with the Form D filing
requirements for a Rule 506 offering.
B.

Timing of the Filing of Form D

We are proposing to amend Rule 503 to require issuers that intend to engage in
general solicitation for a Rule 506(c) offering to file an initial Form D in advance of
conducting any general solicitation activities. Currently, Rule 503 requires an issuer to
file a Form D not later than 15 calendar days after the first sale of securities in a
Regulation D offering. Under the proposed amendment, if an issuer has not otherwise
filed a Form D for a Rule 506(c) offering, it would be required, at least 15 calendar days
before commencing general solicitation for the offering, to file an initial Form D that

19

includes the information required by the following items of Form D (the “Advance Form
D”):
•

Item 1. Basic identifying information on the issuer;

•

Item 2. Information on the issuer’s principal place of business and contact
information;

•

Item 3. Information on related persons;

•

Item 4. Information on the issuer’s industry group;

•

Item 6. Identification of the exemption or exemptions being claimed for the
offering;

•

Item 7. Indication of whether the filing is a new filing or an amendment;

•

Item 9. Information on the type(s) of security to be offered; 43

•

Item 10. Indication of whether the offering is related to a business
combination;

•

Item 12. Information on persons receiving sales compensation; 44 and

•

Item 16. Information on the use of proceeds from the offering.

After the filing of an Advance Form D, the issuer would be required to file an
amendment providing the remaining information required by Form D within 15 calendar
days after the date of first sale of securities in the offering, as is currently required by
Rule 503. 45

43

An issuer would be required to include the information required by Item 9 only to the extent that the
information is known at the time of filing the Advance Form D.
44

An issuer would be required to include the information required by Item 12 only to the extent that the
information is known at the time of filing the Advance Form D.
45

An issuer that has already filed a Form D containing complete information with respect to a Rule 506(c)
offering would not be required to file an Advance Form D. This could occur, for example, when the use of

20

A number of commenters on the Rule 506(c) Proposing Release, including
numerous state securities regulators and several investor organizations, suggested that the
Commission require Form D to be filed in advance of any general solicitation in Rule
506(c) offerings. 46 Some of these commenters stated that the advance filing of Form D
would enable state securities regulators and investors, after seeing an advertisement or
other notice for an offering, to more easily determine whether an issuer is at least
attempting to comply with Rule 506(c). 47 One commenter noted that state securities
regulators routinely review Form D filings to ensure that the offerings actually qualify for
an exemption under Rule 506 and to look for “red flags” that may indicate that an
offering may be fraudulent. 48 Other commenters stated that, with the advance filing of
Form D, state securities regulators would be in a better position to ensure that no bad

general solicitation begins after the offering is underway and the first sale of securities has occurred for
which a Form D has been filed more than 15 calendar days before the commencement of general
solicitation in the offering.
46

See, e.g., letters from AARP; AFL-CIO and AFR; Consumer Federation; Commissioner of Securities,
State of Hawaii (“Hawaii Commissioner of Securities”); Indiana Securities Division; Massachusetts
Securities Division (July 2, 2012) (noting that an advance filing requirement for Form D “will notify
federal and state regulators that these offerings are in the marketplace, and they will give potential investors
an opportunity to obtain basic information about the issuer and the offering”); Commissioner of Securities,
State of Missouri (“Missouri Commissioner of Securities”); Commissioner of Securities and Insurance,
State of Montana (“Montana Commissioner of Securities”); NASAA (noting that without an advance filing
requirement for Form D and a filing requirement that is a condition of the exemption, “[a]n investigator
who sees an advertised offering will have no simple way of knowing whether the issuer is engaged in a
compliant Rule 506 offering or is merely advertising an unregistered, non-exempt public offering”); Fund
Democracy, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation, AFL-CIO and AFR (May 24, 2012); Nevada
Securities Division; Ohio Division of Securities; South Carolina Securities Commissioner; Virginia
Division of Securities.
The Investor Advisory Committee recommended that the Commission require issuers to file either a new
“Form GS” or a revised version of Form D as a precondition for relying on Rule 506(c). See letter from
Investor Advisory Committee.
47

See, e.g., letters from NASAA; Missouri Commissioner of Securities; Nevada Securities Division.

See letter from NASAA. See also letter from Missouri Commissioner of Securities (stating that “filing
the Form D better equips the state securities regulators to ensure compliance with Federal and state
securities laws”).

21

actors are participating in a Rule 506 offering 49 and to answer questions from investors
who contact them after seeing an advertised offering. 50
On the other hand, one commenter stated that the current 15-calendar day time
frame to file a Form D following a sale provides a reasonable period for an issuer to
prepare and submit the form while providing appropriate notice to regulators of a new
Regulation D offering. 51 This commenter also argued that an issuer may not be certain of
whether it will rely on Rule 506(b) or Rule 506(c) ahead of time. 52
We appreciate these recommendations and recognize the concerns as well. We
believe that requiring issuers to file an Advance Form D would assist the Commission’s
efforts to evaluate the use of Rule 506(c). Although the Commission does not anticipate
that its staff will review each Advance Form D filing as it is being made, the Advance
Form D would be useful to the Commission and the Commission staff, as it would
enhance the information available to the Commission to analyze offerings initiated under
Rule 506(c), including issuers that initiated Rule 506(c) offerings but were unsuccessful
in selling any securities through these offerings or chose alternative forms of raising
capital. Currently, Form D is required to be filed only after the first sale of securities,
which means that issuers that offered securities, but did not complete a sale, are not
required to file a Form D, thereby limiting the Commission’s ability to determine which
issuers are facing challenges raising capital under Rule 506(c) and whether further steps
by the Commission are needed to facilitate issuers’ ability to raise capital under
49

Rule 506(c). We also understand that the Advance Form D would be useful to state
securities regulators and to investors in gathering timely information about Rule 506(c)
offerings and the use of Rule 506(c).
We appreciate the sensitivity that some issuers may have regarding the disclosure
of detailed information about a contemplated offering before the issuer has made a final
decision to raise capital in a Rule 506(c) offering or before the first sale of securities has
occurred. For this reason, we propose that the Advance Form D for Rule 506(c) offerings
require only the information set forth above, with a requirement to file an amendment to
the Form D that includes the remainder of the information required by Form D (including
information regarding the terms of the offering that may not have been known at the time
of the filing of the Advance Form D and therefore omitted from the Advance Form D,
such as those called for by Item 9 and Item 12 of Form D) following the completion of a
sale of securities in a Rule 506(c) offering on the timetable currently required under Rule
503. An issuer that wishes to provide all of the information required by Form D in the
Advance Form D may do so, obviating the need to file an additional amendment unless
otherwise required under Rule 503. An issuer could also file an Advance Form D
without contemplating a specific offering, in order to have the flexibility to conduct an
offering using general solicitation. We believe that this approach would allow the
Commission to gather the information that it needs through Advance Form D filings
without unnecessarily burdening issuers or requiring issuers to disclose specific
information about capital-raising plans before these plans have been determined.

23

Request for Comment
1.

We are proposing that issuers file an Advance Form D no later than 15 calendar
days before the commencement of general solicitation in a Rule 506(c) offering.
Is such an advance filing useful and appropriate for an effective analysis of the
Rule 506(c) market? Should the 15-calendar day period be increased or
decreased? Why or why not? Should the filing deadline be tied to the
commencement of general solicitation or the commencement of the offering,
whether or not general solicitation is used?

2.

What should the consequences be for failing to timely file an Advance Form D for
a Rule 506(c) offering? Should the filing of the Advance Form D be a condition
to Rule 506(c) so that failure to file results in the immediate loss of Rule 506(c) as
an exemption from Securities Act registration for the offering at issue?

3.

We are proposing to require the filing of an Advance Form D no later than 15
calendar days before the first use of general solicitation in a Rule 506(c) offering.
We recognize, however, the possibility that a communication could be
inadvertently disseminated beyond the intended audience without the issuer’s
knowledge or authorization. What should be the consequences for the issuer
under such circumstances? Should there be a different filing deadline for the
Advance Form D when there is an inadvertent general solicitation? For example,
under Rule 100(a)(2) of Regulation FD, 53 the information in a non-intentional
selective disclosure must be publicly disclosed “promptly” after the issuer knows
(or is reckless in not knowing) that the information selectively disclosed was both

53

17 CFR 243.100(a)(2).

24

material and non-public. Should a similar filing deadline be considered for an
inadvertent general solicitation?
4.

Should issuers be permitted to file an Advance Form D even if no specific
offering is contemplated? Why or why not? How would this impact the
usefulness of the Advance Form D data? We have identified certain information
that we believe should be included in the Advance Form D. Is the information
proposed for the Advance Form D the appropriate information to be provided at
that point of the offering? Is there other information that issuers should provide in
the Advance Form D? Would it be more difficult for issuers to provide certain
information in an Advance Form D? If so, which information?

5.

We are proposing that an issuer have the option of either filing an Advance
Form D for Rule 506(c) offerings to provide certain information required by
Form D, with the complete Form D information provided in a subsequent
amendment to Form D filed no later than 15 calendar days after the first sale of
securities, or providing all of the required Form D information in the Advance
Form D, if known at that point in the offering. Should issuers be provided this
option? Or should issuers be limited to providing certain specified information in
the Advance Form D and required to file a subsequent amendment, after the first
sale of securities, to provide the remainder of the information required by Form
D? Would allowing issuers to have the option of providing all of the information
required by Form D no later than 15 calendar days before they commence general
solicitation (as compared to the current requirement of no later than 15 calendar
days after the first sale of securities) affect the quality or usefulness of the Form D

25

information for purposes of the Commission’s efforts to analyze the Rule 506
market? For example, what is the likelihood that issuers will be in a position to
provide all of the information required by Form D no later than 15 calendar days
before the commencement of general solicitation?
6.

What would be the benefits of requiring the Advance Form D for Rule 506(c)
offerings? What would be the costs to issuers, market participants and other
parties? Would the requirement to file an Advance Form D deter issuers from
conducting Rule 506(c) offerings? Would the requirement to file an Advance
Form D have differing or unique effects on certain types of issuers, such as
Exchange Act reporting companies, non-reporting companies, foreign companies
or private funds?

7.

Would potential investors or other market participants review Advance Form D
filings on a real-time basis? If so, how would they use the information in the
filings? How would state securities regulators use the Advance Form D filings?

8.

Are there situations in which an Advance Form D filing should not be required?
If so, what are these situations?

9.

Should an Advance Form D filing be required before or at the commencement of
all offerings under Rule 506, or all offerings under Regulation D? If not, why?

10.

Are any other rule amendments necessary if the Commission were to require the
advance filing of Form D for Rule 506(c) offerings, as proposed?
C.

Form D Closing Amendment for Rule 506 Offerings

We are also proposing to amend Rule 503 to require the filing of a final
amendment to Form D within 30 calendar days after the termination of any offering
conducted in reliance on Rule 506. Regulation D does not currently contain a
26

requirement to file a final amendment to Form D. When Regulation D was originally
adopted, issuers were required to amend the Form D filing every six months during the
course of an ongoing offering and were required to make a final Form D filing within 30
days of the final sale of securities in the offering. 54 In 1986, we eliminated these
requirements, anticipating that removing the final Form D filing requirement would have
negligible consequences for investors and would result in some savings for both issuers
and the Commission. 55
A number of commenters on the Rule 506(c) Proposing Release suggested that
the Commission reinstate a closing Form D filing requirement to enhance the flow of
information to the Commission, other regulators and investors, and to improve the ability
of the Commission and others to track the use of Rule 506. 56 For example, one
commenter stated that the “information provided in a closing amendment will be
invaluable to the Commission and states in determining the extent to which issuers are
making exempt public offerings.” 57
In order to gather more complete information about the size and characteristics of
the Rule 506 offering market, we believe that it would be appropriate to propose
requiring the filing of a closing amendment for offerings conducted in reliance on
Rule 506. The proposed requirement would be in addition to the existing provisions of
Rule 503 that require the filing of an amendment to Form D to correct a material mistake
54

See Release No. 33-6389.

of fact or error in a previously filed Form D, to reflect a change in information provided
in a previously filed Form D except in certain instances, and on an annual basis for
offerings that are ongoing. The filing of a separate closing amendment within 30 days
after termination of the offering would not be required if all of the information that would
be included in such an amendment has already been provided in a Form D filing and the
issuer has checked the box for a closing filing in such filing.
As noted above, the Commission today has a greater ability to analyze the
Regulation D offering market due to electronically-filed Forms D. In recent years, the
Regulation D market has also grown considerably in size and significance. 58 These
factors suggest that collecting information upon the termination of Rule 506 offerings
would provide greater benefits than it did in 1986, when this requirement was eliminated.
We propose to require the filing of a closing amendment to Form D for offerings
under both Rule 506(b) and Rule 506(c). This is, in part, to enable more complete
analysis and comparison of the use of long-standing Rule 506(b) and new Rule 506(c).
In addition, because the overwhelming majority of Regulation D offerings are conducted
in reliance on Rule 506, and these offerings account for substantially all of the capital
reported as being raised under Regulation D, this approach should provide the
Commission with substantially complete information about the Regulation D market

58

Offerings Using the Regulation D Exemption, 2009-2012 (July 2013), available at

Study”).

without imposing additional compliance burdens on smaller offerings conducted in
reliance on Rule 504 or Rule 505. 59
A closing Form D amendment, in conjunction with changes to Form D to require
additional information on Rule 506 offerings, as discussed below, would provide the
Commission with more complete information about Rule 506 offerings. For example,
under current rules, information about the amount of capital raised in a Regulation D
offering is limited to the “total amount sold” as of the date of the last Form D filing. Any
amounts sold between the date of the last Form D filing and the date the offering is
terminated are not currently required to be reported on Form D. As a result, the actual
amount of capital raised at the time the offering is terminated cannot be conclusively
determined. 60
Under our proposal, the closing amendment would be due no later than 30
calendar days after termination of the offering; 61 in contrast, Rule 503 formerly required
a closing amendment to be made no later than 30 days “after the last sale of securities” in
the offering. 62 Our proposed change addresses the potential concern that issuers may not
know, at the time a sale is made, that such sale will be the last sale of securities in the
offering. As proposed, the closing amendment must be filed when the issuer terminates
the offering, whether after the final sale of securities in the offering or upon the issuer’s
determination to abandon the offering. Until the closing amendment is filed, the offering
59

See id. (in 2012, approximately 95% of Regulation D offerings claimed reliance on Rule 506; these
offerings accounted for approximately 99% of capital reported as being raised under Regulation D for the
year).
60

For example, in 2010, issuers sought to raise $1.2 trillion in reported Regulation D offerings, but only
$905 billion was reported as sold at the time of the initial filing. See id.

is deemed to be ongoing and the issuer would be subject to the current Rule 503
requirements to file amendments to Form D at least annually and otherwise as needed to
reflect changes in previously filed information and to correct material mistakes and
errors. 63
Request for Comment
11.

Should we require a closing Form D amendment for Rule 506 offerings, as
proposed? Why or why not? Should the closing amendment requirement apply
to all Regulation D offerings, as was the case when Regulation D was originally
adopted? Alternatively, should the closing amendment requirement apply only to
offerings under new Rule 506(c)? Are there situations where a closing
amendment to Form D should not be required? If so, what are these situations?
For example, should no closing amendment be required if no sales of securities
have been made?

12.

As proposed, a closing Form D amendment would be required to be filed not later
than 30 calendar days after the termination of a Rule 506 offering. Should we use
a different time frame for the filing of the closing Form D amendment? If so,
why and how long?

13.

We have not proposed that the filing of a closing amendment be a condition of
Rule 506. If the closing amendment were a condition of Rule 506 and an issuer
failed to make the required filing, the issuer would lose the exemption for the
entire offering at issue, including sales that were made while the issuer was in

17 CFR 230.503(a)(3).

30

compliance with Rule 503. Should the filing of a closing Form D amendment be
a condition to Rule 506(b) or Rule 506(c)?
14.

As proposed, the closing amendment must be filed within 30 calendar days after
the issuer terminates the offering. Should we provide a more detailed explanation
of what constitutes the termination of an offering?

15.

What would be the costs to issuers of filing a closing Form D amendment?
Would a requirement to file a closing Form D amendment deter issuers from
conducting Rule 506 offerings? Are there any costs or benefits that we have not
discussed? If so, please specify.

16.

What are the alternatives to requiring a closing amendment to Form D? For
example, rather than requiring a closing amendment to Form D for all Rule 506
offerings, should the Commission only require an amendment when an issuer sells
an amount of securities in excess of a certain percentage (for example, 10%)
above the amount reported as sold in the last Form D or Form D amendment
previously filed for the offering?

17.

Rule 503(a)(3)(ii) currently requires issuers to file an amendment to a previously
filed Form D to reflect changes in the information provided, subject to certain
enumerated exceptions. Should the proposed closing amendment to Form D serve
as a substitute for this type of Form D amendment? If the proposed closing
amendment requirement is adopted, should Rule 503(a)(3)(ii) be eliminated or
simplified, so that only certain changes (e.g., the size of the offering) would
trigger the obligation to amend Form D?

31

18.

Alternatively, in light of the proposal to impose disqualification from reliance on
Rule 506 for failures to comply with Rule 503, as discussed in Section II.E below,
should the Commission further amend Rule 503(a)(3)(ii), or provide additional
guidance, in regard to the circumstances in which an amendment to Form D is or
is not required? For example, should the Commission amend Rule 503 to set
forth additional situations in which an amendment to Form D would not be
required to reflect a change in the information provided in a previously filed
Form D? Conversely, should the Commission amend Rule 503 to require the
filing of an amendment to Form D to reflect a change in information where such
amendment is not currently required under Rule 503?

19.

As discussed in Section II.D below, we are proposing amendments to Form D to
require additional information, primarily with respect to Rule 506 offerings.
After an issuer files a Form D that includes this additional information, any
change to this information (for example, a change in the number of purchasers
who qualified as accredited investors or the methods used to verify accredited
investor), would generally require the filing of an amendment to Form D under
current Rule 503. Should the Commission amend Rule 503 so that an amendment
to Form D would not be required when there is a change to some or any of this
information? If so, which information and why?

20.

Should issuers conducting ongoing offerings pursuant to Rule 506(c) be required
to amend their Form D filings more frequently than on an annual basis to provide,
to the extent that such information has not already been provided in a previous
Form D filing, updated information regarding the dollar amount of any securities

32

sold during such period pursuant to such offering, and any other securities of the
same class (or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
securities of the same class) sold during such period pursuant to an exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act? If yes, how frequently?
For example, on a semi-annual basis or a quarterly basis?
21.

Rule 503 requires an amendment to a previously filed Form D to correct a
material mistake of fact or error “as soon as practicable after discovery of the
mistake or error” and an amendment to a Form D to reflect a change in the
information previously provided, except in certain situations, “as soon as
practicable after the change.” Would such non-specific filing deadlines make it
difficult for market participants to determine whether an issuer is disqualified
from reliance on Rule 506 for failure to comply with Form D filing obligations,
including the determination of when a cure period expires? Should the
Commission consider amending Rule 503 to set forth more specific time frames
for filing these amendments to Form D?

22.

Should the Commission amend Rule 503 so that an annual amendment for an
ongoing offering is required to be filed on a specified date, such as the one-year
anniversary of the initial filing of a Form D or Advance Form D?

23.

Should the Commission provide additional guidance on what constitutes a
“material mistake of fact or error” that would necessitate the filing of a Form D
amendment?

24.

Rule 503(a)(4) currently requires an issuer that files an amendment to a
previously filed Form D to provide current information in response to all

33

requirements of the form regardless of why the amendment is filed. Should the
Commission amend this requirement in Rule 503? If so, how? What are the costs
and benefits associated with this requirement?
25.

Should the presentation of information in a closing Form D amendment be
different than in an initial Form D filing or in other Form D amendments? If so,
how?

26.

If an issuer filed an Advance Form D but subsequently terminated the offering
without selling any securities, what information should the issuer be required to
provide regarding the offering in its closing amendment?

27.

Are any other rule amendments necessary if the Commission were to require the
filing of a closing amendment, as proposed? If so, please specify.
D.

Proposed Amendments to the Content Requirements of Form D

We are proposing revisions to Form D to add information requirements primarily
for Rule 506 offerings, which would enable the Commission to gather additional
information on the use of Rule 506 and thereby assist the Commission in evaluating the
impact of Rule 506(c) on the existing Rule 506 market. 64 We believe that such additional
information may also be useful to state securities regulators and to investors. In the Rule
506(c) Adopting Release, we adopted a revision to Form D to add a separate field or
check box in Item 6 of Form D for issuers to indicate whether they are relying on Rule

64

In April 2010, we proposed numerous changes to our rules related to offerings of asset-backed
securities. See Asset-Backed Securities, Release No. 33-9117 (Apr. 7, 2010) [75 FR 23328 (May 3, 2010)].
That proposal included proposed revisions to Form D for offerings of structured finance products. Those
proposed changes are still outstanding and are not being addressed in this release.

34

506(b) or Rule 506(c). 65 We believe that requiring issuers to indicate in Form D that they
are relying on Rule 506(c) will provide important information to assist in our efforts to
evaluate the use of general solicitation in Rule 506(c) offerings and the size of this
offering market as well as provide notice to state regulators and investors about issuers
seeking to rely on Rule 506(c). The proposed revisions to Form D set forth below would
require additional information on Rule 506 offerings, including information specific to
Rule 506(c) offerings, such as the types of general solicitation used and the methods used
to verify the accredited investor status of purchasers, which we also believe will be
useful.
A number of commenters on the Rule 506(c) Proposing Release recommended
that the Commission further expand the information requirements of Form D in regard to
offerings under Rule 506(c). 66 Some commenters stated that they supported amending
Form D to require more information about the issuer’s plans to engage in general
solicitation and how the issuer plans to verify that purchasers are accredited investors. 67
The Investor Advisory Committee recommended that the Commission adopt either a new
form or a revised version of Form D that would elicit information on, among other things,
the control persons of the issuer, counsel representing the issuer (if any), the issuer’s

65

We also revised Item 6 of Form D by renaming the check box for “Rule 506,” which will be renamed
“Rule 506(b),” and the check box for “Section 4(5),” which will be renamed “Section 4(a)(5)” to update the
reference to former Section 4(5) of the Securities Act.

See, e.g., letters from AARP; AFL-CIO and AFR; Consumer Federation; Investor Advisory Committee;
NASAA (referring to the recommendations in its July 3, 2012 letter); Massachusetts Securities Division
(referring to the recommendations in its July 2, 2012 letter).
67

See letters from AARP; AFL-CIO and AFR (stating that “the Commission should … expand Form D to
require additional information regarding both planned general solicitation and advertising activities and
plans for verification of accredited investor status”); Consumer Federation (stating that “[i]f the
Commission wishes to monitor [accredited investor verification] practices, and we believe it must, it can
best achieve that by requesting information on Form D regarding the issuer’s verification plans.”).

35

accountants or auditors (if any), the amount sought to be raised, a brief description of the
issuer’s general solicitation plans and a brief description of the issuer’s proposed business
and use of proceeds. 68 Another commenter proposed a list of expanded information
requirements for Form D, including disclosure of the issuer’s website; if the issuer is
selling interests in a pooled investment fund, disclosure of any adviser to the fund and
whether the adviser is registered as an investment adviser or is otherwise exempt; a
warning that finder’s fees may trigger state and federal salesperson and broker-dealer
registration requirements; and certification that the offering is not disqualified under the
proposed bad actor rules. 69 One commenter stated that Form D should be revised to
indicate whether an offering will be conducted by means of an Internet platform, and if
so, the identity of the Internet platform. 70 A number of commenters stated that the
Commission should consider requiring additional information in Form D about the
issuers that propose to engage in general solicitation activities under Rule 506. 71
In contrast, one commenter urged the Commission not to require additional
disclosures in Form D on the issuer’s proposed business and use of proceeds. This
commenter asserted that Form D currently requires appropriate information on the
identity of the issuer and a factual description of the offerings. 72

See letter from Massachusetts Securities Division (July 2, 2012).

71

See, e.g., letters from Consumer Federation (stating that “[t]he Form D filing requirement could provide
greater benefit to investors as well if its content was expanded to include basic information about the
issuer”); Fund Democracy, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation, AFL-CIO and AFR (May 24, 2012)
(stating that “[t]he Commission should also consider requiring disclosure of additional information in Form
D about issuers that propose to engage in [general solicitation] activities”).
72

See letter from MFA (Mar. 22, 2013). This commenter also recommended that investment advisers be
permitted to comply with any information requirement on Form D by either providing a reference to a
publicly available Form ADV applicable to a private fund or to any publicly available information filed

36

We believe that amending Form D to require additional information on Rule 506
offerings would enable the Commission to better analyze the impact on the existing
Rule 506 market of eliminating the prohibition against general solicitation in Rule 506(c)
offerings. This information would enhance the ability of the Commission to evaluate the
use of Rule 506(c) by requiring information in Form D on the types of investors that
participate in Rule 506(c) offerings, the issuer’s plans to engage in general solicitation
and methods used to satisfy the verification requirement in Rule 506(c). This information
may also be useful to investors seeking to learn more about an offering being conducted
pursuant to Rule 506(c) or about the types of issuers conducting these offerings. Finally,
this information may be useful in facilitating enforcement efforts should any fraud or
other securities law violations occur in these offerings. As discussed below, we propose
to revise existing Item 2, Item 3, Item 4, Item 5, Item 7, Item 9, Item 14 and Item 16 of
Form D and to add new Items 17 through 22 to Form D.
Item 2, which requires the issuer to provide principal place of business and
telephone contact information, would be amended to require the identification of the
issuer’s publicly accessible (Internet) website address, if any. We are proposing this
change because issuers are increasingly using their public websites as vehicles for the
dissemination of information to investors, while many investors are turning to company
websites as sources of information to aid in their investment decisions. 73 We believe that
the identification of the issuer’s public website address in Form D would be useful in
gathering additional information on the issuers that conduct offerings under Regulation
with a state regulator, depending on whether the investment adviser is registered with the Commission or
with a state.
73

See, e.g., Commission Guidance on the Use of Company Web Sites, Release No. 34-58288 (Aug. 1,
2008) [73 FR 45862 (Aug. 7, 2008)].

37

D. This proposed amendment would apply to offerings under Rule 504, Rule 505, Rule
506 and Section 4(a)(5).
Item 3, which requires information about “related persons” (executive officers,
directors, and persons performing similar functions for the issuer, as well as persons who
have functioned as a promoter of the issuer within the prior five years), would be
amended to require, when the issuer is conducting a Rule 506(c) offering, the name and
address of any person who directly or indirectly controls the issuer in addition to the
information currently required for “related persons.” We believe that more
comprehensive information about persons who exercise control over the issuer would be
helpful in obtaining a more complete picture of the issuers and other market participants
that are involved in Rule 506(c) offerings.
In 2008, we deleted the requirement in Item 3 to identify as “related persons”
owners of 10% or more of a class of the issuer’s equity securities. In proposing this
change to Item 3, we stated, among other things, that “we believe we can collect
sufficient information to satisfy the regulatory objectives of Form D by requiring only the
identification of executive officers, directors, and promoters.” 74 We also noted that
“issuers that are not reporting companies have raised privacy concerns with respect to the
requirement to identify 10% equity owners who are not executive officers, directors, or
promoters because they do not already have to disclose this information, and the
widespread availability of the information on our website may raise additional privacy
concerns for these companies as they seek to raise capital through a private offering.” 75

Release No. 33-8891.

75

Id.

38

While we continue to recognize these privacy concerns for issuers that conduct offerings
under Rules 504, 505 and 506(b), we believe that this additional information on
controlling persons who are not “related persons” could assist us in developing a more
comprehensive understanding of the market participants in the Rule 506(c) market.
Item 4, which requires the issuer to identify its industry group from a specified
list, would be amended to require the issuer to fill in a “clarification” field if the issuer
checks the “Other” box. Though Item 4 currently includes a number of different industry
group classifications, we believe that requiring the issuer to further describe its industry
group when it is not included in the pre-established list will enhance our understanding of
the types of issuers that are seeking to rely on Regulation D, while imposing a minimal
burden on the issuer. This information will assist us in having more complete
information regarding the range of industries of the companies using Rule 506. Without
this additional requirement, conclusions drawn regarding industry trends would exclude
all those issuers who checked “Other.” This proposed amendment would apply to
offerings under Rules 504, Rule 505, Rule 506 and Section 4(a)(5).
Item 5, which requires information on issuer size, would be amended to replace
the “Decline to Disclose” option with a “Not Available to Public” option. We are
proposing this change because we believe that an operating company that includes
information about its revenues, or a hedge fund or other investment fund that includes
information about its net asset value, in general solicitation materials for a Rule 506(c)
offering, or that otherwise makes such information publicly available, should be required
to provide revenue range or net asset value range information, as applicable, in Form D.
If, however, the issuer does not include this information in general solicitation materials

39

for a Rule 506(c) offering, does not otherwise make the information publicly available
and otherwise uses reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of such information,
we believe that the issuer should have the option of not providing such information by
choosing a “Not Available to Public” checkbox. This proposed amendment would also
apply to Rule 504 and Rule 505 offerings, as well as offerings under Section 4(a)(5).
Requiring issuers to include this information, to the extent they otherwise publicly
disclose it, would be useful to the Commission’s staff in evaluating the type or size of
issuers using these exemptions.
Item 7, which requires the issuer to state whether a Form D is an initial filing or
an amendment to a previously filed Form D, would be amended to add separate fields or
check boxes for issuers to indicate whether they are filing an Advance Form D or a
closing Form D amendment. We are proposing this change in connection with our
proposals to require the filing of an Advance Form D for Rule 506(c) offerings and the
filing of a final amendment to Form D after the termination of any offering conducted in
reliance on Rule 506. The addition of these check boxes would require issuers to identify
clearly in a Form D whether the Form D is an Advance Form D or a closing Form D
amendment and could provide information about the beginning and ending of offerings
that could be useful in analyzing the market.
Item 9, which requires information on the types of securities offered, would be
amended to require information, to the extent applicable, on the trading symbol and a
generally available security identifier (“security identifier”) for the offered securities. 76

76

We recognize that the CUSIP number is in common use domestically for this purpose, but anticipate that
other suitable identifiers may become available in the future.

40

In general, this amendment would be relevant only to issuers that have securities of the
same class as the offered securities traded on a national securities exchange, alternative
trading system (“ATS”) or any other organized trading venue. We are proposing this
change because we believe that requiring these types of issuers to provide the trading
symbol and security identifier for the securities being offered, if any, would provide
useful information on the nature of the securities being offered in Rule 506 offerings, as
well as assist us in additional data gathering with respect to these offerings, without
placing an undue burden on issuers. 77 This proposed amendment would also apply to
offerings under Rule 504, Rule 505 and Section 4(a)(5).
Item 14, which elicits information on whether securities have been or may be sold
to non-accredited investors and the number of investors who have already invested in the
offering, would be amended to add a table requiring, with respect to Rule 506 offerings,
information on the number of accredited investors and non-accredited investors that have
purchased in the offering, whether they are natural persons or legal entities and the
amount raised from each category of investors. We believe that this additional
information would be useful in determining, among other things, the composition of
investors who invest in Rule 506 offerings, the respective amounts they have invested,
and the types of offerings and issuers in which each category of investors invests.
Item 16, which requires information on the amount of the gross proceeds of the
offering that the issuer used or proposes to use for payments to related persons, would be
77

We note that, in 2007, we requested comment on whether it would be appropriate to require information
on CUSIP numbers and trading symbols in Form D and that we did not require this information in Form D
in connection with the Form D amendments we adopted in 2008. See Electronic Filing and Simplification
of Form D, Release No. 33-8814 (June 29, 2007) [72 FR 37376 (July 9, 2007)] and Release No. 33-8891.
In light of the adoption of Rule 506(c), we are proposing to require this information in Form D at this time
because we believe that this information would enable us to engage in expanded analysis of the Form D
data for Rule 506 offerings.

41

amended to require information on the percentage of the offering proceeds from a
Rule 506 offering that was or will be used: (1) to repurchase or retire the issuer’s
existing securities; (2) to pay offering expenses; (3) to acquire assets, otherwise than in
the ordinary course of business; (4) to finance acquisitions of other businesses; (5) for
working capital; and (6) to discharge indebtedness. This additional information
requirement would apply only to Rule 506 offerings by issuers that are not pooled
investment funds. This information would enable the Commission and investors to better
understand why issuers are seeking to raise capital using Rule 506.
The proposed new items of Form D – Items 17 through 22 – would require issuers
to provide the following additional information with respect to offerings conducted
pursuant to Rule 506:
•

the number and types of accredited investors that purchased securities in the
offering (e.g., natural persons who qualified as accredited investors on the
basis of income or net worth);

•

if a class of the issuer’s securities is traded on a national securities exchange,
ATS or any other organized trading venue, and/or is registered under the
Exchange Act, the name of the exchange, ATS or trading venue and/or the
Exchange Act file number and whether the securities being offered under Rule
506 are of the same class or are convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for such class;

•

if the issuer used a registered broker-dealer in connection with the offering,
whether any general solicitation materials were filed with FINRA;

42

•

in the case of a pooled investment fund advised by investment advisers
registered with, or reporting as exempt reporting advisers 78 to, the
Commission, the name and SEC file number for each investment adviser who
functions directly or indirectly as a promoter 79 of the issuer;

•

for Rule 506(c) offerings, the types of general solicitation used or to be used
(e.g., mass mailings, emails, public websites, social media, print media and
broadcast media); 80 and

•

for Rule 506(c) offerings, the methods used or to be used to verify accredited
investor status (e.g., principles-based method using publicly available
information, documentation provided by the purchaser or a third party,
reliance on verification by a third party, or other sources of information; one
of the methods in the non-exclusive list of verification methods in
Rule 506(c)(2)(ii); or another method).

Some of this additional information would be specific to Rule 506(c) offerings and would
enable the Commission to develop a greater understanding of the new Rule 506(c)
78

An exempt reporting adviser is an investment adviser that qualifies for the exemption from registration
under Section 203(l) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) [15 U.S.C. 80b-3(l)]
because it is an adviser solely to one or more venture capital funds, or under Rule 203(m)-1 under the
Advisers Act [17 CFR 275.203(m)-1] because it is an adviser solely to private funds and has assets under
management in the United States of less than $150 million. See Glossary of Terms to Form ADV.
79

The definition of promoter in Rule 405 [17 CFR 230.405] includes any person who, acting alone or in
conjunction with one or more other persons, directly or indirectly takes initiative in founding and
organizing the business or enterprise of an issuer or any person who, in connection with the founding and
organizing of the business or enterprise of an issuer, directly or indirectly receives in consideration of
services or property, or both services and property, 10 percent or more of any class of securities of the
issuer or 10 percent or more of the proceeds from the sale of any class of such securities. However, a
person who receives such securities or proceeds either solely as underwriting commissions or solely in
consideration of property shall not be deemed a promoter within the meaning of this paragraph if such
person does not otherwise take part in founding and organizing the enterprise.
80

We expect that the categories of social media, print media and broadcast media would be limited to
efforts by the issuer, or an agent of the issuer, to directly communicate to potential investors, such as paid
advertisements.

43

market. Other additional information requirements would apply to all Rule 506 offerings.
As stated above, the adoption of Rule 506(c) has increased the need for information on
Rule 506 offerings in general, in order to assess not only the nature and characteristics of
the new Rule 506(c) market but also the changing nature of the Rule 506 market as a
whole. We believe that requiring this additional information for all Rule 506 offerings
would be useful to the Commission, investors and state regulators.
Although the proposed revisions to Form D primarily require additional
information with respect to Rule 506 offerings, we note that the proposed revisions to
Item 2, Item 4, Item 5 and Item 9 would require additional information on offerings under
Rule 504, Rule 505 and Securities Act Section 4(a)(5). For the same reasons stated
above, we believe that if an issuer has made information on its size publicly available, or
does not take reasonable efforts to maintain such information as confidential, the issuer
should be required to provide this information under Item 5 of Form D for offerings
under the other Regulation D exemptions or under Section 4(a)(5). Similarly, we believe
that the proposed additional information in Item 2, Item 4 and Item 9 would provide
useful information on the nature of the issuers and the offered securities in regard to
offerings under Rule 504, Rule 505 or Section 4(a)(5), while any additional burden on
issuers in providing this information would be minimal.
Request for Comment
28.

Should we require issuers to provide additional information in Form D filings as
we have proposed? Should this additional information be required only for
Rule 506(c) offerings? If so, why and what should that information be? For
example, should the Commission require issuers to provide information in

44

Form D about counsel representing the issuer (if any) or the issuer’s accountants
or auditors (if any), as some have suggested? If the additional information were
required only for Rule 506(c) offerings, what impact would this requirement have
on the use of Rule 506(c) as compared to the use of Rule 506(b)? Are there
particular items of information that do not provide sufficiently useful information
or would be especially burdensome for issuers to provide? Should some of the
additional information that we propose to require in Form D not be required for
offerings under Rule 506(b)? If so, which requirements and why? Would the
additional information that we propose to request in Form D provide useful
information to state securities regulators in responding to inquiries from
constituents about offerings conducted under Rule 506 and in enforcement
efforts?
29.

What are the costs or burdens on issuers in providing the additional information in
Form D, as proposed? Are there ways to reduce any costs or burdens on issuers?
Would the requirement to provide this additional information result in issuers
choosing not to rely on Rule 506 to raise capital?

30.

Should some of the additional information that we propose to require in Form D
be required only in the closing amendment to Form D?

31.

Should the Commission define what it means for an issuer to make information
publicly available for purposes of Item 5, or to take reasonable efforts to maintain
such information as confidential? For instance, would confidential information
about an issuer that is publicly disseminated by a third party in violation of a duty
to keep such information confidential be deemed to be publicly available?

45

32.

Should the Commission amend Item 5 to require an issuer that conducts a
Rule 506(c) offering to provide information on its revenue range or aggregate net
asset value range, as applicable, regardless of whether the issuer has otherwise
made this information publicly available (for example, by including this
information in general solicitation materials)?

33.

Should the Commission amend Form D to include a check box for issuers to
indicate whether they are filing an Advance Form D or a closing amendment to
Form D, as proposed? Should there be other changes to Form D to indicate that
an issuer is filing an Advance Form D or a closing amendment?

34.

Should the Commission amend Form D to provide a checkbox to indicate that the
issuer is required to provide disclosure of prior “bad actor” events under
Rule 506(b)(2)(iii)?

35.

Should pooled investment funds be required to provide additional or different
information in connection with Rule 506(c) offerings? Should the Commission
require a pooled investment fund to disclose its investment adviser’s CRD 81
number rather than (or in addition to) its adviser’s SEC registration number?
Item 3 of Form D asks for the identity of the issuer’s promoter. Should
information on a pooled investment fund’s investment adviser be added to Item 3,
rather than the proposed Item 20? Does the proposed amendment to Item 3,
requiring disclosure of any controlling persons, raise any particular concerns for
pooled investment funds?

81

A Central Registration Depository (“CRD”) number is a system identification number assigned to each
investment adviser that registers or files reports with the SEC or a state through the Investment Adviser
Registration Depository website. The website facilitates registration of investment advisers and reporting
by exempt reporting advisers. CRD numbers also are assigned to broker-dealers.

46

36.

Should the Commission require issuers to provide more or less specific
information in Form D about the methods of general solicitation used in
Rule 506(c) offerings? Do certain methods of general solicitation raise particular
concerns from an investor protection standpoint? For example, are some methods
of general solicitation more likely to result in an increased risk of fraud or
manipulation or more likely to reach non-accredited investors? Should we require
additional information in Form D with respect to these methods of general
solicitation? If so, what information should we require issuers to provide
regarding these solicitation methods?

37.

Should the Commission require issuers to provide more or less specific
information on Form D about the methods used to verify accredited investor
status? If so, what information should the Commission require issuers to provide
regarding verification practices? For example, should we require issuers to
identify any registered broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, attorneys,
certified public accountants or other third parties that assisted the issuer with the
verification process?
E.

Proposed Amendment to Rule 507

We are proposing an amendment to Rule 507 of Regulation D that is intended to
improve Form D filing compliance in connection with Rule 506 offerings. Rule 507
currently only disqualifies an issuer from using Regulation D if the issuer, or a
predecessor or affiliate, has been enjoined by a court for violating the filing requirements
in Rule 503. We propose to amend Rule 507 so that, in addition to the existing
disqualification from Rules 504, 505 and 506 of Regulation D that arises from a court
injunction, an issuer would be disqualified automatically from using Rule 506 in any new
47

offering for one year if the issuer, or any predecessor or affiliate of the issuer, did not
comply, within the past five years, with Form D filing requirements in a Rule 506
offering; provided that such one-year period would commence following the filing of all
required Form D filings or, if the offering has been terminated, following the filing of a
closing amendment.
When Regulation D was originally adopted in 1982, compliance with Form D
filing obligations was a condition of Rules 504, 505 and 506. In 1989, the Commission
amended Regulation D to eliminate the filing of Form D as a condition to those rules. 82
The Commission did so with the expectation that the concurrent adoption of Rule 507
would provide an incentive for issuers to file Form D. 83 In fact, the disqualification
provision of Rule 507 has rarely been invoked since its adoption, 84 and we understand
that some issuers are not filing a Form D for Rule 506 offerings. 85

84

In order to invoke the Rule 507 disqualification provision, the Commission must first bring a civil
injunctive action in a federal district court and receive a court order enjoining the defendant from future
violations of Rule 503. The Commission has brought few such enforcement actions. See SEC v. Printz
Capital Management, No. 10-7379 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 15, 2011) (order enjoining defendants from, among other
things, failing to file a Form D for a Regulation D offering).
85

Many commenters have asserted that non-compliance with Form D filing obligations is widespread.
See, e.g., letters from Investor Advisory Committee (stating that “[i]t is generally acknowledged that a
significant number of issuers do not currently file Form D...”); AARP (stating that “[s]imply adding a
checkbox to a form that too often goes unfiled and then only after the fact is inadequate to the task at
hand.”); AFL-CIO and AFR (stating that “many issuers today flout the Form D filing requirement for such
offerings, further limiting the Commission’s ability to provide effective oversight”). See also Securities
and Exchange Commission, Office of Inspector General, Regulation D Exemption Process (Mar. 31, 2009)
(“OIG Report”), available at http://www.sec-oig.gov/Reports/AuditsInspections/2009/459.pdf (stating that
while the Commission staff “strongly encourage companies to comply with Rule 503, they are aware of
instances in which issuers have failed to comply with Rule 503…”). Based on its analysis of the filings
required by FINRA Rules 5122 and 5123 during the period of December 3, 2012 to February 5, 2013,
DERA estimates that as much as 9% of the offerings represented in the FINRA filings for Regulation D or
other private offerings that used a registered broker-dealer did not have a corresponding Form D filing. See
Section IX.B.4.a of this release.

Investor Advisory Committee, urged us to require the filing of Form D as a condition to
Rule 506(c), so that the failure to file a Form D would result in the loss of the exemption
for the offering. 86 One commenter stated that it generally supported conditioning the
availability of Regulation D on the filing of Form D, provided that an issuer that filed a
Form D in good faith but with inadvertent technical errors would have an adequate
opportunity to cure its mistake while relying on Regulation D. 87
Other commenters argued against conditioning Rule 506(c) on the filing of a
Form D. 88 One commenter stated that such a condition would have potential negative
effects on the private placement market. 89 Another commenter argued that if Rule 506(c)
were conditioned on the filing of a Form D, the consequences of losing the exemption
would be significantly disproportionate to the harm of failing to file the Form D,
including the loss of “covered security” status under Section 18 of the Securities Act. 90
One commenter maintained that conditioning the availability of the exemption on the
filing of a Form D would be inappropriate in light of the purpose of Form D to enable the
Commission to better understand and analyze how Regulation D is being used. 91
We believe it is appropriate to strengthen the incentives for issuers to comply with
Rule 503, which would make it more likely that the Commission will obtain Form D data

that provides a more complete perspective on Rule 506(c) offerings and the Rule 506
marketplace as a whole, thereby facilitating efforts by both the Commission and state
securities regulators to analyze developments in that marketplace. Further, we believe
that an effective incentive for issuers to comply with the Form D filing requirement is
one that results in meaningful consequences for failing to file the form, without requiring
action on the part of the Commission or the courts. We are nonetheless mindful that the
incentive should be commensurate to the obligation so that the failure to comply does not
give rise to disproportionate consequences.
Although we considered requiring compliance with Rule 503 as a condition of
Rule 506, or at least Rule 506(c), we have determined not to propose making Form D
filing a condition of Rule 506. We are reluctant to impose a sanction on an issuer as
severe as the loss of a Securities Act exemption, which would give purchasers rescission
rights and result in loss of “blue sky” pre-emption, 92 for failure to file a form that is
intended primarily to provide information to the Commission. If compliance with
Rule 503 were reinstated as a condition to Rule 506, then non-compliance at any stage of
an offering could result in the entire offering being held to violate Section 5 of the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. For example, in the case of a
continuous or long-lived offering, this could mean that an issuer’s failure to file an annual
amendment or closing amendment would trigger loss of the Securities Act exemption,
which would give purchasers rescission rights and result in loss of blue sky pre-emption
92

Section 18 of the Securities Act exempts “covered securities” from state review and registration
requirements. Under Section 18(b)(4)(D), “covered securities” is defined to include securities offered or
sold in transactions pursuant to Commission rules issued under Section 4(a)(2). Thus, if an offering fails to
comply with Rule 506, the securities offered and sold in the offering would not be “covered securities,” and
the issuer would violate state law unless it had complied with applicable review and registration
requirements or could avail itself of a state law exemption.

50

for offers and sales that occurred, in certain cases, years before the failure to file a Form
D triggered the loss of an exemption. We believe that the consequences of a Section 5
violation would be disproportionate in those circumstances. More generally, we are
concerned about possible disruptions in the Rule 506 market if market participants could
not be certain of the availability of Rule 506 for an offering until after the offering was
terminated and all filings required under Rule 503 were made. We are, however,
soliciting comment on whether Rule 506 should be conditioned on Form D filing
compliance.
Instead of making the Form D filing a condition to Rule 506, we propose to
amend Rule 507 by adding new paragraph (b), under which issuers would be disqualified
from using Rule 506 for future offerings if they, or their predecessors or affiliates, had
failed to comply within the past five years with the Form D filing requirements of
Rule 503 in connection with an offering under Rule 506. 93 Under proposed Rule 507(b),
disqualification would end one year after the required Form D filings are made or, if the
offering has been terminated, one year after a closing amendment is made. 94 We believe
that a one-year disqualification period, which would not commence until the required
filings are made, should create a significant incentive to file Form D on a timely basis
without unduly burdening market participants.
The proposed disqualification would not affect offerings of an issuer or an
affiliate that are ongoing at the time of the filing non-compliance, including the offering
for which the issuer failed to make a required filing, and these offerings could continue to

93

Existing Rule 507(b) would be redesignated as Rule 507(c).

94

See Proposed Rule 507(b).

51

rely on Rule 506 as long as the conditions of Rule 506 continue to be met.
Disqualification would apply only to future offerings. We further propose that
disqualification from using Rule 506 for future offerings would be subject to a cure
period and the waiver provisions in Rule 507, as discussed below. As with the proposed
closing amendment requirement and for the same reasons, we propose to apply new
Rule 507(b) to all offerings under Rule 506.
Under the proposal, disqualification would arise only with respect to noncompliance with Rule 503 that occurred after the effectiveness of new Rule 507(b). We
considered whether to apply the disqualification for failure to comply with the filing
requirement before the effective date of the rule. We are not proposing such a
requirement. We are proposing to include a five-year look-back period, so that noncompliance that occurred more than five years before the commencement of a Rule 506
offering would not trigger disqualification, even if the required Form D filings had not
been made. We believe that this limitation would avoid potential burdens on market
participants that might otherwise be created, such as the possibility of indefinite
disqualification in situations where it is not possible for the required Form D filings for a
previous offering to be made, without undermining the incentive for issuers in Rule 506
offerings to comply with their Form D filing obligations. A look-back period would also
reduce the cost of confirming whether an issuer is disqualified from reliance on Rule 506,
and could reduce the number of delinquent filings required to be made before the oneyear disqualification period starts to run. The look-back period would not extend past the
effective date of the rule, so issuers seeking to conduct a Rule 506 offering would assess
compliance with Rule 503 by looking back only to the effective date of the

52

disqualification rule.
Disqualification would arise based on non-compliance with Rule 503 by the
issuer and its predecessors and affiliates, as provided in current Rule 507. We believe
that proposed Rule 507(b) should be structured in this manner so that an issuer cannot
avoid disqualification by simply conducting future offerings through a successor or other
affiliated entity. We are soliciting comment on whether this approach is appropriate for
all issuers.
Because this approach creates potentially significant consequences for an issuer’s
future capital-raising activities based on its failure to file or amend the form for a current
or prior offering, we anticipate that proposed Rule 507(b), if adopted, could significantly
reduce non-compliance with Form D filing requirements for Rule 506 offerings. We
further believe that disqualification from using Rule 506 for a one-year period after all
required Form D filings have been made is a sufficient period of time to incentivize
compliance with Rule 503 while at the same time not serving as a disproportionate
penalty for the failure to file or amend Form D.
When we amended Regulation D to remove Rule 503 compliance as a condition
to Rules 504, 505 and 506, we noted that the Form D filing condition was subject to
frequent criticism. 95 As discussed above, however, the usefulness of Form D filings has
increased significantly since we required them to be filed in electronic form on EDGAR.
In addition, the proposed amendment differs from the prior Rule 503 condition in that the
amendment would impose disqualification only prospectively and would not apply to any
offerings that are ongoing at the time of filing non-compliance. Disqualification would
95

See Release No. 33-6759.

53

also be limited to one year after all Form D filing requirements have been satisfied, and
the look-back period for Rule 506 offerings that were not in compliance with Rule 503
would be limited to five years and would not extend to non-compliance that occurred
prior to the effective date of proposed Rule 507(b).
The proposed amendment also includes mitigating provisions that were not
applicable when compliance with Rule 503 was a condition to Regulation D. As
discussed below, under the proposal, there would be a cure period for late filings, as well
as recourse to the waiver provision of Rule 507, under which disqualification may be
waived by the Commission for good cause shown. We believe that these provisions
should help address concerns regarding the disproportionality and consequences of
inadvertent failures to file or amend Form D.
Cure period. We propose that, solely for purposes of determining whether
disqualification under Rule 507 would arise, issuers would generally be regarded as
having complied with the Rule 503 filing deadlines for a Form D or Form D amendment
if they filed the relevant filing within a cure period after the filing is due under Rule 503.
A number of commenters expressed concern about the possibility that an issuer
could be unfairly penalized for inadvertent technical errors relating to its Form D filing
and recommended that the Commission provide an opportunity for the issuer to correct
such errors. 96 We recognize this concern and therefore propose a cure period of 30

96

See, e.g., letters from MFA (Mar. 22, 2013) (stating that “[w]e generally support the filing of Form D
being made a condition to relying on Regulation D, provided that an issuer that filed the Form in good faith
but with inadvertent technical errors in the Form would have sufficient opportunity to cure its mistake
while maintaining its reliance on Regulation D…. Upon notice of such an error, a fund manager or issuer
should be provided a reasonable period of time to file a corrected Form D.”); Investor Advisory Committee
(stating that “[i]n implementing this recommendation [to condition a Regulation D exemption on the filing
of Form D], which is intended to encourage broad compliance with the filing requirement, the Committee
encourages the Commission also to consider incorporating measures to ensure that it does not impose

54

calendar days, which would be available in the case of an issuer’s failure to file a Form D
or Form D amendment on a timely basis. This provision is intended to allow an
additional period of time in which issuers could detect a failure to file or amend Form D
(for example, due to clerical error or technological problem) and make the requisite
filing. We believe that 30 calendar days is a sufficient period of time for issuers to
address an inadvertent error and that a longer period may have the effect of encouraging a
greater degree of non-compliance with the deadlines for Form D filings. By including a
cure period of 30 calendar days, we would provide issuers with certainty that the benefits
of Rule 506 would remain available so long as a failure to file Form D was corrected
during the specified time frame.
The proposed cure period would be available only for an issuer’s first failure to
file timely a Form D or Form D amendment in connection with a particular offering. We
believe that permitting issuers to repeatedly rely on the 30-day cure period for Form D
filings for the same offering would undermine incentives to comply with the filing
deadlines specified in Rule 503.
Waiver. Rule 507 currently provides that disqualification under the rule may be
waived by the Commission if the Commission determines “upon a showing of good
cause, that it is not necessary under the circumstances that exemption be denied.” 97 This
formulation is substantially the same as the waiver provision included in new
Rule 506(d), the bad actor disqualification provisions for Rule 506 adopted today. 98 We
believe that the Commission should have the ability to waive disqualification in situations
undue penalties for inadvertent violations by small, unsophisticated issuers.”).
97

Rule 507(b).

98

See Rule 506(d)(2)(ii).

55

where an issuer or its predecessors or affiliates have failed to comply with Rule 503,
provided that the issuer can demonstrate good cause that it is not necessary to deny the
exemption. For example, a waiver may be appropriate if an issuer can show that the
persons who controlled the issuer at the time of the failure to file no longer exercise
influence over it, or if curing the failure is impossible (for example, because a defaulting
affiliate no longer exists and therefore cannot make the missing Form D filings or
amendments) and good cause can otherwise be shown that it is not necessary in the
circumstances to deny the exemption.
Under current rules, the Commission has delegated authority to the Director of
the Division of Corporation Finance to grant disqualification waivers under Rule 507. 99
We anticipate that, if the proposal were adopted, we would similarly delegate authority
for waivers of disqualification under new Rule 507(b).
Request for Comment
38.

Is disqualifying issuers and their affiliates and successors from reliance on Rule
506 for future offerings an appropriate sanction to incentivize compliance with
Form D filing requirements? Why or why not? How would these amendments
affect the Rule 506 market?

39.

Proposed Rule 507(b) would not impose any consequences with respect to the
offering for which an issuer failed to file or amend a Form D as required, or for
other offerings that were ongoing at the time of the failure to file. Would
disqualification from reliance on Rule 506 for future offerings be a sufficient
incentive for issuers to comply with Form D filing requirements? Why or why

99

See Rule 30-1(c) of the Commission’s Rules of Organization and Program Management [17 CFR
200.30-1(c)].

56

not? Should an issuer engaged in an ongoing offering be permitted to continue
relying on Rule 506 if it or an affiliate failed to comply with the filing
requirements of Rule 503?
40.

Should the result be the same for failure to comply with all parts of Rule 503?
For example, should the result be the same when the issuer does not file an
amendment to a Form D as it would when the issuer does not make an Advance
Form D filing or an initial Form D filing? Should there be a distinction between
annual amendments to Form D and amendments required to correct a material
mistake of fact or error or to reflect a change in information?

41.

As proposed, outside of the cure period, disqualification under Rule 507(b) would
not be lifted until one year after all required Form D filings are made or, in the
case of offerings that had been terminated, a closing amendment is made. Is this
an appropriate requirement? If not, what are the alternatives?

42.

What would be an appropriate disqualification period as an alternative to the
proposal, such that issuers would be sufficiently incentivized to comply with
Form D filing obligations without unduly burdening capital formation under
Regulation D? Is the proposed one-year disqualification period appropriate, or
should the disqualification period be shorter or longer? Why?

43.

Under the proposal, disqualification would not be triggered by any failure to
comply with Rule 503 that occurred more than five years before the offering. Is it
appropriate to include a look-back period in this way? Why or why not? If so, is
the five-year period proposed appropriate, or should it be shorter or longer? If so,
why?

57

44.

The look-back period would not extend to the period prior to the effective date of
proposed Rule 507(b). Is it appropriate not to consider these filings before the
effective date of the rule? Why or why not?

45.

Are there particular situations where disqualification under Rule 507(b) should
not be triggered for failure to file a required Form D or Form D amendment?

46.

As proposed, issuers would be disqualified from using Rule 506 based on
noncompliance with Rule 503 within the past five years in connection with a
Rule 506 offering by their predecessors and affiliates. Is it appropriate to
disqualify issuers for non-compliance by their predecessors and affiliates? If not,
would it be too easy to avoid disqualification by using an affiliate or successor
entity to conduct a Rule 506 offering? How should the Commission address this
concern?

47.

Would portfolio companies that are affiliates of a private fund be unduly affected
by any disqualification triggered by noncompliance of the private fund, its
predecessors and its affiliates with Rule 503? If so, should the Commission treat
portfolio companies of private funds differently for disqualification purposes? If
yes, how?

48.

Is it appropriate to prohibit a private fund or its successors or affiliates from
engaging in a subsequent offering under Rule 506 if the private fund failed to
comply with Rule 503? For instance, if a private fund issuer fails to file its
Form D or the appropriate amendments in accordance with the filing requirements
of Rule 503, is it a disproportionate response to prohibit any private funds
affiliated with the private fund from relying on Rule 506? Should proposed

58

Rule 507(b) contain an express provision that excludes affiliated private funds
from such consequences?
49.

Is it appropriate to include a cure period for noncompliance with Rule 503?
Would the benefits of including a cure period justify the potential detriments,
such as undercutting issuers’ incentive to comply with the existing Rule 503 filing
deadlines? If a cure period is included, should it apply to all required Form D
filings, or only some? For example, should there be a cure period for the closing
amendment only? Or for amendments, but not the initial filing? Should the
Advance Form D have a cure period? Instead of providing a cure period, should
we move back the deadlines for Form D filings? Are there other alternatives to a
cure period or further provisions that the Commission should consider?

50.

The cure period is not available if the issuer has previously failed to comply with
a Form D filing deadline in connection with the same offering. Is this condition
appropriate? Why or why not? Should the cure period be available if the issuer
has failed to timely file a Form D or Form D amendment more than once in
connection with the same offering? If so, how many times in a single offering or
otherwise how frequently should an issuer be able to invoke the cure period?
Should the cure period become available again after a certain amount of time,
such as five years, has elapsed since the issuer previously failed to comply with a
Form D filing deadline? 100 Should we impose additional requirements or
conditions on an issuer’s ability to take advantage of the cure period? For

100

For example, should an issuer, such as a private fund, that is conducting a continuous offering be
permitted to have a cure period if five or more years have elapsed since the initial failure to timely file a
Form D?

59

example, should the cure period be unavailable if the failure to file Form D was
intentional? Would additional guidance be necessary to explain what constitutes
intentional or repeated failures to file? Should the issuer have to indicate that the
filing is late and state the reason for its being late? Should there be more specific
requirements to rely on the cure, such as the issuer suffered an intervening event
(for example, a clerical or technological problem)? Alternatively, should the cure
period be automatically available to all issuers without other conditions or
qualifications? Are there other events that should make the cure period
unavailable to an issuer?
51.

Should a cure period be available for repeated or intentional failures to comply
with Rule 503? If yes, should there be a look-back period for determining
whether failures to comply with Rule 503 are repeated?

52.

If a cure period is included, is the 30-day period we propose appropriate? Should
the cure period be shorter or longer? Should it be the same for all types of filings,
or should the Commission vary the cure period for different filings? For example,
should there be a shorter or longer cure period provided for the Advance Form D
filing, the closing amendment or other amendments, compared to other Form D
filings?

53.

As an alternative or in addition to a cure period, should we amend Rule 507 so
that disqualification can be triggered by a Commission cease-and-desist order as
well as court injunction? Should we add a provision similar to existing Rule
508, 101 under which insignificant deviations from the requirements of Rule 503

101

17 CFR 230.508. Under Rule 508, the failure to comply with a term, condition or requirement of

60

would not result in disqualification under proposed Rule 507(b) if the issuer could
demonstrate good faith and a reasonable attempt to comply with filing
requirements?
54.

Should we amend Rule 507 to disqualify an issuer from relying on Rule 506 for
future offerings if such issuer, or any predecessor or affiliate of the issuer, has
been subject to a Commission order requiring such person to cease-and-desist
from committing or causing any violation or future violation of proposed Rule
509 or proposed Rule 510T, both of which are discussed below?

55.

Should the Commission amend Form D to provide a checkbox to indicate that the
issuer is relying on the proposed cure period?

56.

Is it appropriate to amend Rule 507’s existing waiver provision so it applies to
proposed Rule 507(b)? Should we provide guidance regarding factors that the
Commission may take into account when considering whether to grant a waiver?

57.

Are there other methods for improving compliance with Rule 503 that the
Commission should consider? For example, should there be other consequences
for non-compliance with Form D filing requirements? Would the combination of
proposed Rule 507(b) and increased enforcement of existing Rule 503, which
could result in monetary penalties or imposition of disqualification under existing
Rule 507, provide a sufficient incentive to comply with these requirements?

Rule 504, Rule 505 or Rule 506 will not result in the loss of the exemption from the registration
requirements of Section 5 for any offer or sale of securities to a particular individual or entity, if the person
relying on the exemption shows the failure to comply did not pertain to a term, condition or requirement
directly intended to protect that particular individual or entity; the failure to comply was insignificant with
respect to the offering as a whole; and a good faith and reasonable attempt was made to comply with all
applicable terms, conditions and requirements of Rule 504, Rule 505 or Rule 506. Id.

61

58.

As an alternative to proposed Rule 507(b), should the availability of Rule 506 be
conditioned on compliance with Rule 503, as was the case when Regulation D
was originally adopted? If so, should compliance with Rule 503 be a condition to
both Rule 506(b) and Rule 506(c), as well as to Rules 504 and 505?
Alternatively, should compliance with Rule 503 be a condition to reliance on new
Rule 506(c) only? Should the availability of Rule 506 be conditioned on
compliance with all of the filing requirements of Rule 503 or should it be
conditioned on compliance with only some of the filing requirements of Rule 503
(and if so which filing requirements)? If compliance with Rule 503 is a condition
to Rule 506, should there be a mechanism for issuers to request a waiver from
Form D filing requirements? If so, how should that mechanism work? Are any
other rule amendments necessary if the Commission were to require compliance
with Form D filing requirements as a condition to reliance on Rule 506? If so,
what amendments?

III.

PROPOSED RULE AND RULE AMENDMENTS RELATING TO
GENERAL SOLICITATION MATERIALS
We are proposing new requirements and amendments to address investor

protection concerns arising from the ability of issuers, including private funds, to
generally solicit for their Rule 506(c) offerings. First, we propose to add new Rule 509 to
require all issuers to include: (i) legends in any written general solicitation materials used
in a Rule 506(c) offering; and (ii) additional disclosures for private funds if such
materials include performance data. Second, we propose amendments to Rule 156 under
the Securities Act that would extend the guidance contained in the rule to the sales
literature of private funds. Each of these proposals is discussed in greater detail below.

62

Finally, we request comment on manner and content restrictions for general solicitation
materials of private funds, a subject on which we received a number of comments and
suggestions.
A.

Mandated Legends and Other Disclosures for Written General
Solicitation Materials

In light of issuers’ ability to generally solicit their Rule 506(c) offerings, we are
proposing requirements for issuers to better inform potential investors as to whether they
are qualified to participate in these offerings, the type of offerings being conducted and
certain potential risks associated with such offerings. A number of commenters on the
Rule 506(c) Proposing Release recommended that the Commission adopt content
restrictions or other requirements with respect to general solicitation materials used by
issuers, such as private funds, in Rule 506(c) offerings. 102 For example, the Investor
Advisory Committee recommended that the Commission “take steps to ensure that any
performance claims in materials used as part of general solicitations are based on
appropriate performance reporting standards.” 103 Some commenters also recommended
that the Commission require the inclusion of legends, warning labels or mandatory risk
disclosures in general solicitation materials used in these offerings. 104
While we believe that further consideration following experience with offerings

Consumer Federation; Hawaii Commissioner of Securities; ICI; IDC; L. Neumann; Montana

Sens. Reed, Levin, Durbin, Harkin, Lautenberg, Franken and Akaka; South Carolina Securities
Commissioner; Virginia Division of Securities.

Letter from Investor Advisory Committee.

104

See letters from P. Rutledge (recommending a legend stating that all sales in the offering will be to
accredited investors); CFA Institute (recommending a prominent “surgeon’s general”-type warning label
and mandated disclosures that address the potential risks of Rule 506(c) offerings); BetterInvesting
(recommending mandatory risk disclosure language that would appear at the beginning of all general
solicitation materials).

63

under new Rule 506(c) is needed with respect to potential content restrictions for issuers’
general solicitation materials, we are proposing new Rule 509, which would require all
issuers to include the following prominent legends in all written general solicitation
materials:
•

The securities may be sold only to accredited investors, which for natural
persons, are investors who meet certain minimum annual income or net worth
thresholds; 105

•

The securities are being offered in reliance on an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and are not required to comply
with specific disclosure requirements that apply to registration under the
Securities Act;

•

The Commission has not passed upon the merits of or given its approval to the
securities, the terms of the offering, or the accuracy or completeness of any
offering materials;

•

The securities are subject to legal restrictions on transfer and resale and
investors should not assume they will be able to resell their securities; and

•

Investing in securities involves risk, and investors should be able to bear the
loss of their investment.

We believe that such legends would better inform potential investors as to
whether they are qualified to participate in Rule 506(c) offerings and certain potential
risks that may be associated with such offerings. Written general solicitation materials
105

This part of the legend may be modified in accordance with any higher standards that may be applicable
to the issuer, such as qualified clients (as defined by Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act [17 CFR 275.2053]) or qualified purchasers (as defined by Section 2(a)(51) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a2(a)(51)]).

64

may combine two or more of these required statements in a single sentence, provided that
each of the required disclosures is clear and easy to understand. Similarly, written
general solicitation materials may use any wording that clearly communicates the
information required to be disclosed. Compliance with the proposed legend
requirements, however, does not relieve an issuer from the requirement to take reasonable
steps to verify that purchasers in a Rule 506(c) offering are accredited investors.
We also recognize the specific concerns that commenters have expressed
regarding private funds’ ability to advertise to the general public, especially in light of the
fact that private funds raise a significant amount of capital in Rule 506 offerings. 106
Under Rule 506(c), private funds, such as hedge funds, venture capital funds and private
equity funds, will be permitted to engage in general solicitation in compliance with the
rule without losing the exclusions from the definition of “investment company” under
Section 3(c)(1) 107 or Section 3(c)(7) 108 of the Investment Company Act. 109 Several
commenters on the Rule 506(c) Proposing Release recommended that we impose
additional conditions on private funds that rely on Rule 506(c). In particular, these
commenters believed that general solicitation materials of private funds should be subject

15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(1) (excluding from the definition of “investment company” any “issuer whose
outstanding securities (other than short-term paper) are beneficially owned by not more than one hundred
persons and which is not making and does not presently propose to make a public offering of its
securities”).
108

15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(7) (excluding from the definition of “investment company” any “issuer, the
outstanding securities of which are owned exclusively by persons who, at the time of acquisition of such
securities, are qualified purchasers, and which is not making and does not at that time propose to make a
public offering of such securities”). The term “qualified purchaser” is defined in Section 2(a)(51) of the
Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. § 80a-2(a)(51)] and the rules thereunder.
109

See Rule 506(c) Adopting Release, at Section II.E (discussing the effect of Section 201(b) of the JOBS
Act, which provides that “[o]ffers and sales exempt under [amended Rule 506] shall not be deemed public
offerings under the Federal securities laws as a result of general advertising or general solicitation”).

65

to some form of content requirements and/or restrictions. 110 For example, some believed
that private funds engaging in general solicitation should be held to performance and
advertising standards that are analogous to mutual fund standards. 111 One of these
commenters suggested that the Commission develop a rule tailored to the manner in
which private funds calculate and present performance, rather than extending mutual fund
performance rules to private funds. 112 Some commenters made other suggestions, such as
requiring each private fund relying on Rule 506(c) to disclose that the private fund is not
registered with the Commission and should not be confused with a registered fund, such
as a mutual fund. 113
In response to these concerns, we are proposing that an additional legend and
disclosures be required for private fund written general solicitation materials. First, we
propose that private funds include a legend on any written general solicitation materials
that the securities offered are not subject to the protections of the Investment Company
Act. 114 We believe it is appropriate to include a legend regarding a private fund’s status
110

See, e.g., letters from AFL-CIO and AFR; Consumer Federation; Rep. Waters (supporting the
establishment of standards for reporting performance and fees by private funds); ICI (recommending the
imposition of content restrictions on private fund advertising and requiring certain disclosures in private
fund advertisements to avoid investor confusion with mutual funds).
111

See, e.g., letters from Fund Democracy; ICI; IDC; Sen. Levin; NASAA.

112

See letter from ICI (stating that “[w]e do not recommend that the content rule applicable to mutual fund
performance advertisements . . . be extended to private funds. We strongly recommend, rather, that the
Commission develop a rule tailored to the ways private funds calculate and present performance.”).
113

See, e.g., letters from Consumer Federation (stating that the Commission should require private fund
advertisements to include “a clear, prominent warning that they are not mutual funds and carry special
risks.”); Fund Democracy (stating that the Commission should “require explicit, large-font disclaimers that
hedge funds are not mutual funds and present special risks.”); ICI (recommending that the Commission
require disclaimers regarding the performance figures or measures displayed in any private fund
advertisements).
114

Private funds could combine the legend regarding the Investment Company Act with the legend
regarding disclosure obligations under the Securities Act to simply state that the securities offered are not
subject to the protections of the Investment Company Act or required to comply with specific disclosure
requirements that apply to registration under the Securities Act.

66

under the Investment Company Act because the Act provides important protections that
are not applicable to private funds or their investors. For example, the Investment
Company Act includes limitations on self-dealing, affiliated transactions and leverage
and requirements regarding independent board members, none of which apply to private
funds, and the proposed legend would serve to alert investors and the broader general
public to this fact. The legend also may help address any misimpression regarding the
level of statutory and regulatory protections that apply to investors in a private fund.
Second, we propose that Rule 509 require private funds to include certain
disclosures in any written general solicitation materials that include performance data.
These disclosures are similar to certain disclosures required by Rule 482 under the
Securities Act for advertisements and other sales materials of registered investment
companies. 115 Specifically, proposed Rule 509(c) would require any private fund written
general solicitation materials that include performance data to include a legend disclosing
that:
•

performance data represents past performance;

•

past performance does not guarantee future results;

•

current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data
presented;

115

17 CFR 230.482. We note that the Commission proposed amendments to Rule 482, which have not yet
been adopted, as part of its recent money market fund reform proposals. The proposed amendments would
require money market funds to include certain disclosure statements on advertisements and sales materials
designed to inform investors about the risks of investing in money market funds and the risks of a floating
net asset value, if applicable. See Money Market Fund Reform; Amendments to Form PF, Release No. 339408 (June 5, 2013) [78 FR 36834 (June 19, 2013)].
We are requesting comment on the extent to which “liquidity funds,” which are private funds that seek to
maintain a stable net asset value (or minimize fluctuations in their net asset values) and thus can resemble
money market funds, should be required to include similar disclosure statements in written general
solicitation materials.

67

•

the private fund is not required by law to follow any standard methodology
when calculating and representing performance data; and

•

the performance of the fund may not be directly comparable to the
performance of other private or registered funds.

The proposed rule would also require the legend to identify either a telephone number or
a website where an investor may obtain current performance data.
We believe that many investors, both sophisticated and unsophisticated, consider
performance to be a significant factor when selecting investments, including when
selecting private funds. 116 As such, we believe that the proposed disclosures are a
meaningful way to highlight that there are limitations on the usefulness of past
performance data, as well as the inherent difficulty of comparing performance of a
private fund with other private funds and with registered products, such as mutual funds.
Further, we are proposing to require that if a private fund’s written general
solicitation materials include performance data, then such data must be as of the most
recent practicable date considering the type of private fund and the media through which
the data will be conveyed, and the private fund would be required to disclose the period
for which performance is presented. 117 Because investors consider performance to be
one of the most significant factors when evaluating investments, we are concerned that
116

See Study Regarding Financial Literacy Among Investors (Aug. 30, 2012), available at
http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2012/917-financial-literacy-study-part1.pdf (Commission staff study
indicating that retail investors find information regarding investment performance to be useful and relevant
before purchasing an investment product); see also Proposed Amendments to Investment Company
Advertising Rules, Release No. 33-8101 (May 17, 2002) [67 FR 36712 (May 24, 2002)].
117

We are not proposing that private funds provide performance data for a specific period (e.g., as of the
most recently completed month) because we understand that the investment strategies employed by private
funds vary. For instance, the most recent practicable date for which performance data is available may
differ between a hedge fund with liquid assets and a private equity fund with illiquid and hard-to-value
assets.

68

private funds presenting non-current performance data may confuse, and even mislead,
investors regarding the fund’s current performance, particularly if the fund’s performance
has changed significantly after the period reflected in the advertisement. In addition, by
proposing to require disclosure of either a telephone number or a website where an
investor may obtain current performance data, we seek to address the concern that a
potential investor may be reviewing written general solicitation materials with
performance data that, although at the time it was published was as of the most recent
practicable date, could now be considered non-current because more current performance
data is available. 118
We are also proposing to require private funds that include performance data that
does not reflect the deduction of fees and expenses in their written general solicitation
materials to disclose that fees and expenses have not been deducted and that if such fees
and expenses had been deducted, performance may be lower than presented. We believe
it is important for investors to be informed about whether performance information
presented reflects the deduction of fees and expenses.
As proposed, the requirement to include these legends and other disclosures, as
applicable, would not be a condition of the Rule 506(c) exemption. Therefore, the failure
to include legends or other disclosures in any written general solicitation materials as
required by Rule 509 would not render Rule 506(c) unavailable for the offering. We
recognize the potentially disproportionate consequences that would result if an
inadvertent error in, or omission of, the legends or disclosures results in a violation of
118

Under the proposed rule, we intend current performance data to mean as of the last date on which the
private fund customarily determined the valuation of its portfolio securities. We do not expect a private
fund to value its portfolio for the sole purpose of providing updated current performance under proposed
Rule 509.

69

Section 5 of the Securities Act, as well as state securities laws and the uncertainty that
issuers would have regarding the availability of Rule 506(c) for their offerings.
Instead, we are proposing to amend existing Rule 507(a) so that Rule 506 would
be unavailable for an issuer if such issuer, or any of its predecessors or affiliates, has been
subject to any order, judgment or court decree enjoining such person for failure to
comply with Rule 509. We believe that the possibility of disqualification from reliance
on Rule 506 would provide issuers with sufficient incentive to comply with the
requirements of Rule 509, without penalizing them unduly for an inadvertent error in, or
the omission of, a legend or other required disclosure in written general solicitation
materials.
We recognize the Commission’s experience with Rule 507 as it relates to
compliance with the Form D filing requirements of Rule 503 and our belief today that the
incentives for compliance with these requirements must be strengthened. 119 We have
decided, however, not to propose that non-compliance with Rule 509 would result in
disqualification from reliance on Rule 506 without requiring action on the part of the
Commission or the courts. We recognize this differs from our treatment of noncompliance with Rule 503 under proposed Rule 507(b); however, we are concerned that
such a disqualification provision could result in disproportionate consequences for
inadvertent errors or omissions, particularly in light of the large amounts of written
communications that many issuers may use during the course of a Rule 506(c) offering
that could be viewed as written general solicitation materials triggering proposed
Rule 509. Consideration of an approach similar to proposed Rule 507(b) may be more
119

See Section II.E of this release.

70

appropriate after first assessing the level of compliance Rule 509 once it is in effect. In
this regard, we believe that it is reasonable to expect a higher level of compliance with
proposed Rule 509, which would require limited, standardized information about Rule
506(c) offerings, than the current level of compliance with Rule 503, which requires the
public filing of a Form D that notifies the market of the occurrence of an offering and
contains issuer- and offering-specific information. As a result, including the required
legends and other disclosures in written general solicitation materials would seem less
likely to raise any concerns for issuers. We believe that Rule 507(a), with its provision
that disqualification would occur only if a court takes injunctive action, may be better
suited for addressing the varied facts and circumstances that may cause an issuer not to
include the required legends and other disclosures in its written general solicitation
materials and for determining whether disqualification for this failure is appropriate.
While we are not proposing that compliance with Rule 509 be a condition to Rule 506(c)
or that non-compliance trigger disqualification without action on the part of the
Commission or courts, we are soliciting comment on both of these alternative
approaches.
We also are requesting comment on whether content restrictions should apply to
private fund general solicitation materials, but we are not proposing to prohibit private
funds from including performance information in general solicitation materials at this
time. The presentation of performance information, like other information used in
general solicitation and other materials, is subject to the antifraud provisions of the

71

federal securities laws. 120 Compliance with the proposed legend and disclosure
requirements does not relieve an issuer from the obligation to comply with these
antifraud requirements. We note that performance data for certain private funds are
available from other sources and that material deviations between reported performance
and performance included on general solicitation materials could be misleading. 121
Furthermore, as we noted in the Rule 506(c) Adopting Release, we believe it is
appropriate for advisers to private funds to review their compliance policies and
procedures and make appropriate updates to such policies and procedures, particularly if
the private funds intend to engage in general solicitation activity. 122

120

See, e.g., In the Matter of Oppenheimer Asset Management Inc. and Oppenheimer Alternative
Investment Management, LLC, Release No. IA-3566 (Mar. 11, 2013); In the Matter of Sentinel Investment
Management Corp., Release No. IA-3556 (Feb. 22, 2013) (settled enforcement action alleging that adviser
misrepresented to investors that client’s investments in private limited partnerships were growing and
performing well); In the Matter of Calhoun Asset Management, LLC, et al., Release No. IA-3428 (July 9,
2012) (settled enforcement action alleging that hedge fund adviser disseminated marketing materials that
contained misrepresentations about performance and unsupported performance returns); In the Matter of
Belal K. Faruki, Release No. IA-3405 (May 17, 2012) (settled enforcement action alleging hedge fund
adviser made material misrepresentations to an investor regarding the fund’s track record); In the Matter of
GMB Capital Management LLC, et al., Release No. IA-3399 (Apr. 20, 2012) (settled enforcement action
alleging hedge fund adviser made misrepresentations in marketing materials, meetings with potential
investors, and a website interview that the adviser subsequently reprinted and distributed to investors and
potential investors regarding the funds’ historic performance).
121

For instance, performance information must be reported to the Commission in a non-public filing on
Form PF. Question 17 of Form PF requires certain registered investment advisers managing private funds
to report to the Commission the private fund’s performance information as reported to current and
prospective investors. While Question 17 instructs advisers to provide the most representative performance
results if the fund reports different performance results to different groups of investors, we would expect an
adviser to be able to explain and justify the difference between performance information included in any
written communications used in a Rule 506(c) offering and that which is reported in such adviser’s Form
PF report, if applicable. Private funds may also voluntarily report performance data to publicly-available
databases.
122

See Rule 506(c) Adopting Release, at Section II.E (noting that “[w]e believe that investment advisers
that have implemented appropriate policies and procedures regarding, among other things, the nature and
content of private fund sales literature, including general solicitation materials, are less likely to use
materials that materially mislead investors or otherwise violate the federal securities laws.”).

72

Request for Comment
59.

Should we require all issuers to include the proposed legends in written general
solicitation materials? Why or why not? Are accredited investors already aware
of the information included in the proposed legends? Would the proposed
legends be effective in reducing the incidence of non-accredited investors
participating in Rule 506(c) offerings?

60.

Is it appropriate for the Commission to provide for disqualification from reliance
on Rule 506 for non-compliance with Rule 509? How would this affect the
Rule 506(c) market? Should the Commission amend Rule 507 to also include
Commission cease-and-desist and administrative proceedings? Would another
mechanism provide a better incentive for issuers to include legends and other
disclosures in written general solicitation materials that relied on a simpler
enforcement mechanism but did not impose an immediate disqualification?

61.

Should the Commission condition Rule 506(c) on compliance with the proposed
requirements of Rule 509? What effect would such a condition have on the
Rule 506 market? If compliance with Rule 509 were a condition of Rule 506(c),
should the Commission provide for a cure mechanism for inadvertent errors in, or
the omission of, legends or other required disclosure in the written general
solicitation materials? 123 If so, what should be the parameters of this cure
mechanism?

123

For example, Securities Act Rule 164 [17 CFR 230.164] permits an issuer or an offering participant to
cure an unintentional or immaterial failure to include the specified legend in any free writing prospectus, as
long as a good faith and reasonable effort is made to comply with the legend condition and the free writing
prospectus is amended to include the specified legend as soon as practicable after discovery of the omitted
or incorrect legend. In addition, if a free writing prospectus has been transmitted to potential investors
without the specified legend, the free writing prospectus must be retransmitted with the appropriate legend

73

62.

Do the proposed legends and required disclosures appropriately inform potential
investors as to whether they are qualified to participate in Rule 506(c) offerings,
the type of offerings being conducted and the potential risks that may be
associated with such offerings? If not, how could they be revised to do so?
Should additional legends or disclosures be required and, if so, what should these
additional legends or disclosures be?

63.

Should we have specific requirements for the legends and disclosures, such as for
type size, type style, location and proximity? If so, what should they be?
Alternatively, should we require the legends and disclosures to be presented in
any manner reasonably calculated to draw investor attention to them?

64.

Should we define the types of communications that constitute written general
solicitation materials for purposes of the proposed requirements of Rule 509? If
so, how should we define written general solicitation materials? For example,
should we refer to the definition of “written communications” in Rule 405 under
the Securities Act? 124 Should we specify that the term includes any electronic
communications?

65.

Should comparable disclosure be required to be provided in oral communications
used in a Rule 506(c) offering that constitute general solicitations? Why or why

by substantially the same means as, and directed to substantially the same investors to whom, it was
originally transmitted. Securities Act Rule 163 [17 CFR 230.163] provides a similar cure provision.
124

Rule 405 defines “written communications” as, except as otherwise specifically provided or the context
otherwise requires, any communication that is written, printed, a radio or television broadcast, or a graphic
communication. Rule 405 defines “graphic communication” as including all forms of electronic media,
including, but not limited to, audiotapes, videotapes, facsimiles, CD-ROM, electronic mail, Internet
websites, substantially similar messages widely distributed (rather than individually distributed) on
telephone answering or voice mail systems, computers, computer networks and other forms of computer
data compilation. “Graphic communication” does not include a communication that, at the time of the
communication, originates live, in real-time to a live audience and does not originate in recorded form or
otherwise as a graphic communication, although it is transmitted through graphic means.

74

not? Should the legends and required disclosures be required to be included in all
offering materials or just the materials used in connection with general solicitation
activities? How would issuers provide such disclosure?
66.

Are there alternative methods for encouraging important explanatory information
regarding performance to be given sufficient prominence in written general
solicitation materials? Would mandated legends be helpful in mitigating concerns
regarding fraudulent statements in written general solicitation materials?

67.

The proposed amendments do not specify the precise wording of any required
legends. Is that appropriate? Or should we require specific wording? If so, what
would that be?

68.

Should we specifically require disclosure of the date as of which any performance
data included in the written general solicitation materials was calculated? Should
we require all such performance data to be current as of the most recent
practicable date? To give issuers certainty, should we provide more specific
guidance as to what constitutes the most recent practicable date? Should we
require performance data to be provided for a specific period (e.g., for the last
one, five, and ten year periods)? Should we require such performance data to be
updated at specified intervals? If so, what interval or intervals would be
appropriate? Should we require a private fund to provide narrative disclosure
regarding the methodology used to calculate performance data? Will such
required disclosure become standardized or unwieldy and, therefore, less useful to
investors?

75

69.

If all purchasers in an offering receive a private placement memorandum that
includes all of the required legends, is it necessary that other materials also
include these legends?

70.

To what extent do issuers, including private funds, currently use legends similar
to those proposed in this release (for example, in the private placement
memoranda given to the potential investors)? To what extent do they use other
legends? Does this differ depending on the type of document used? For example,
do private placement memoranda contain more extensive legends than other
marketing materials?

71.

As proposed, private funds would be required to include a telephone number or a
website where an investor may obtain current performance data. Is this
requirement appropriate? Should private funds be required to provide
performance information on a website? Should private funds be allowed to
restrict access to such website through the use of passwords or other measures?

72.

Do the proposed disclosures relating to performance data appropriately inform
investors that there are limitations on the usefulness of past performance data and
the difficulty of comparing the performance of one private fund to other funds,
particularly in light of the fact that private funds are not required by law to
calculate or present performance pursuant to a standard methodology? If so,
how? If not, why not?

73.

If the amendments to Rule 482 proposed in the money market fund reform
proposals are adopted, 125 should we require liquidity funds to include similar

125

See Release No. 33-9408.

76

disclosure statements in written general solicitation materials? For example,
should we require liquidity funds to include a statement that the fund’s sponsor
has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and that an
investor should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the
fund at any time? Why or why not?
74.

Rule 506(c) may cause certain types of issuers that have historically registered
offerings under the Securities Act to instead conduct offerings under Rule 506(c).
These issuers also may use performance data in written general solicitation
materials. For example, non-traded REITs, which have historically included prior
performance data in Securities Act registration statements and sales literature,
may instead conduct Rule 506(c) offerings and provide similar data in written
general solicitation materials. Should we adopt legends or other disclosure
requirements that are tailored to additional types of issuers, such as non-traded
REITs? If so, which types of issuers should be required to include legends or
other required disclosure in their written general solicitation materials? What
information should be required?

75.

What are the costs or burdens on issuers in providing the legends and other
required disclosures, as proposed? Are there ways to reduce any costs or burdens
on issuers?

76.

Should we adopt additional or different legends or disclosure requirements for
written general solicitation materials used by private funds in Rule 506(c)
offerings when performance data is included?
B.

Proposed Amendments to Rule 156

We are also proposing to amend Rule 156 under the Securities Act to apply the
77

guidance contained in the rule to the sales literature of private funds. 126 We are proposing
the amendments because we believe it is important to provide guidance to private funds
in developing sales literature that is neither fraudulent nor misleading, particularly in
light of the Commission’s adoption of Rule 506(c). 127 We are of the view that private
funds should now be considering the principles underlying Rule 156 to avoid making
fraudulent statements in their sales literature.
Rule 156 provides guidance on the types of information in investment company
sales literature that could be misleading for purposes of the federal securities laws,
including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act 128 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act 129
and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. 130 Under these provisions, whether a statement involving a
material fact is misleading depends on an evaluation of the context in which it is made.
Rule 156 outlines certain situations in which a statement could be misleading. These
include certain general factors that could cause a statement to be misleading, 131 as well as
circumstances where representations about past or future investment performance 132 and

126

The term “private fund” would be defined in Rule 156 as an issuer that would be an investment
company, as defined in Section 3 of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a–3), but for Section
3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act. See proposed Rule 156(d). Rule 156(c) under the Securities Act defines
“sales literature” to include “any communication (whether in writing, by radio, or by television) used by
any person to offer to sell or induce the sale of securities of any investment company.”
127

See Rule 506(c) Adopting Release.

129

15 U.S.C. 78j(b).

130

17 CFR 240.10b-5.

131

A statement could be misleading because of other statements being made in connection with the offer of
sale or sale of the securities in question; the absence of explanations, qualifications, limitations, or other
statements necessary or appropriate to make such statement not misleading; or general economic or
financial conditions or circumstances. See Rule 156(b)(1).
132

Representations about past or future investment performance about an investment company could be
misleading because of statements or omissions made involving a material fact, including situations where
portrayals of past income, gain, or growth of assets convey an impression of the net investment results

78

statements involving a material fact about the characteristics or attributes of an
investment company 133 could be misleading. 134
The Commission adopted Rule 156 as an interpretive rule to provide guidance in
certain areas which, based on the Commission’s regulatory experience with investment
company sales literature, had proven to be particularly susceptible to misleading
statements. 135 Just as the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
apply to the offer and sale of securities issued by an investment company, those same

achieved by an actual or hypothetical investment which would not be justified under the circumstances,
including portrayals that omit explanations, qualifications, limitations, or other statements necessary or
appropriate to make the portrayals not misleading; and representations, whether express or implied, are
made about future investment performance, including: (a) representations, as to security of capital, possible
future gains or income, or expenses associated with an investment; (b) representations implying that future
gain or income may be inferred from or predicted based on past investment performance; or (c) portrayals
of past performance, made in a manner which would imply that gains or income realized in the past would
be repeated in the future. See Rule 156(b)(2).
133

A statement involving a material fact about the characteristics or attributes of an investment company
could be misleading because of statements about possible benefits connected with or resulting from
services to be provided or methods of operation which do not give equal prominence to discussion of any
risks or limitations associated therewith; exaggerated or unsubstantiated claims about management skill or
techniques, characteristics of the investment company or an investment in securities issued by the
company, services, security of investment or funds, effects of government supervision, or other attributes;
and unwarranted or incompletely explained comparisons to other investment vehicles or to indexes. See
Rule 156(b)(3).
134

We note that the Commission proposed amendments to Rule 156, which have not yet been adopted, to
address concerns that emanated from target date funds but are applicable to all investment companies. The
proposed amendments would provide that a statement suggesting that securities of an investment company
are an appropriate investment could be misleading in two circumstances: (i) a statement could be
misleading because of the emphasis it places on a single factor as the basis for determining that an
investment is appropriate; or (ii) a statement suggesting that securities of an investment company are an
appropriate investment could be misleading because of representations that investing in the securities is a
simple investment plan or that it requires little or no monitoring by the investor. See Investment Company
Advertising: Target Date Retirement Fund Names and Marketing, Release No. 33-9126 (June 16, 2010) [75
FR 35920 (Jun. 23, 2010)].
If the Commission were to adopt those amendments, we anticipate that such amendments would also apply
to private fund sales literature because we believe the descriptions of what statements could be misleading
(for example, a statement emphasizing a single factor as the basis for determining that an investment is
appropriate) would apply equally to statements made in the sales literature of private funds.
135

See Mutual Fund Sales Literature Interpretive Rule, Release No. 33-6140 (Oct. 26, 1979) [44 FR 64070
(Nov. 6, 1979)].

79

provisions apply to the offer and sale of securities issued by a private fund. 136 We note
that some commenters on the Rule 506(c) Proposing Release requested that the
Commission clarify whether the interpretive guidance in Rule 156 also applies to private
funds. 137 Accordingly, the Commission believes it is important to provide interpretive
guidance to private funds regarding the types of information in sales literature that could
be fraudulent or misleading.
While the adoption of Rule 506(c) is the impetus for proposing amendments to
Rule 156 to extend its guidance to private funds, the proposed amendments would apply
to all private funds, including private funds engaged in general solicitation activity under
Rule 506(c). This reflects our view that statements or representations have the potential
to mislead investors regardless of the type of offering, investors’ level of sophistication or
whether such materials are used in a general solicitation. 138
Rule 156 does not prohibit or permit any particular representations or
presentations. The circumstances in which statements or representations in investment
company sales materials may be viewed as misleading appear to be similar to the
circumstances in which statements or representations in private fund sales materials may
be viewed as misleading. Based on enforcement and regulatory experience regarding
private funds, we believe that the areas identified in Rule 156 as being vulnerable to
misleading statements in investment company sales literature are similarly vulnerable

136

In addition, statements by an investment adviser to any investor or prospective investor in a private
fund that are fraudulent or materially misleading also violate Section 206 of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C.
80b-6(4)] and Rule 206(4)-8 under the Advisers Act [17 CFR 275.206(4)-8].
137

See letters from ICI and NASAA.

138
For example, misleading statements or representations could be made in materials for an offering
pursuant to Rule 506(b).

80

with respect to private fund sales literature. For example, the Commission has brought
enforcement actions against private fund advisers and others for material
misrepresentations to investors and prospective investors regarding past or future
investment performance and characteristics or attributes of the private fund. Such actions
have included instances in which defendants were charged with misrepresenting a private
fund’s prior investment performance, 139 exaggerating their personal employment history
and qualifications, 140 omitting information regarding their disciplinary history, 141
misrepresenting information about the holdings of the fund’s investment portfolio, 142
making fraudulent claims that the fund was performing better than the major stock
indexes, 143 and falsely valuing the fund’s investments. 144
As the Commission previously described in connection with amendments to
Rule 156, we have been particularly concerned that representations regarding past
performance or future investment performance could be misleading given that many
investors consider performance to be one of the most significant factors when selecting or
evaluating mutual funds. 145 The Commission explained that it was concerned that past
performance information that did not contain an adequate explanation of other facts may

create unrealistic investor expectations or mislead potential investors. 146 The
amendments were intended to address concerns about: (i) advertising performance
without providing adequate disclosure of unusual circumstances that have contributed to
fund performance; (ii) advertising performance without providing adequate disclosure of
the performance period or that more current information about performance is available
and it may be lower than advertised performance; and (iii) advertising performance based
on selective time periods without providing disclosure that would permit an investor to
evaluate the significance of performance that is based on selective time periods. 147 The
Commission also highlighted how some funds addressed these concerns through narrative
disclosure when performance presentations were provided. 148
Request for Comment
77.

Are there certain types of private funds that will find it difficult to apply the
guidance in Rule 156 to their sales literature? If so, which types of private funds
and why? Are there changes to the guidance in Rule 156 that would be
appropriate to consider in connection with the extension of the guidance to private
funds?

146

See Amendments to Investment Company Advertising Rules, Release No. 33-8294 (Sept. 29, 2003) [68
FR 57760 (Oct. 6, 2003)].
147

See Release No. 33-8101.

148

For example, the Commission noted that such narrative disclosures were designed to inform investors
that: (i) the advertised performance was achieved through the fund’s use of particular investment strategies
under specified circumstances that are not likely to recur (e.g., disclosing that a significant portion of the
advertised performance was attributable to the allocation of an initial public offering of securities to the
fund but indicated that such allocation would not likely continue in the future); (ii) the advertised
performance is not the fund’s current performance and that due to market volatility or other factors, the
fund’s performance changes over time or that the fund’s current performance may be lower than the
advertised performance; or (iii) the fund’s performance may be volatile or that the advertised performance
is not representative of the fund’s historical performance. Id.

Are there additional amendments to Rule 156 that would help to clarify the
obligations of private funds under the antifraud provisions?

79.

If the amendments to Rule 156 proposed in the target date fund rulemaking are
adopted, 149 we anticipate making such amendments also applicable to sales
literature of private funds. Is there any reason such guidance should not apply to
sales literature of private funds?

80.

Would antifraud guidance be useful regarding issues that may arise with respect
to sales literature disseminated by other types of issuers in connection with
offerings pursuant to Rule 506(c), such as non-traded REITs? Would similar
guidance be appropriate for other types of issuers, such as statements that sales
material should present a balanced discussion of risk and reward, and be
consistent with representations in offering documents? What are the expected
costs and benefits with respect to any such guidance?
C.

Request for Comment on Manner and Content Restrictions for
Private Funds

As noted above, some commenters have expressed particular concern that
eliminating the prohibition against general solicitation may create more opportunities for
private funds to distribute misleading and fraudulent information. 150 Commenters
recommending content restrictions expressed concern that general solicitation materials
for private funds raise a substantial risk of investor confusion, and may cause an investor
to draw unwarranted conclusions when comparing the performance of private funds,
which are not subject to standardized performance calculation and reporting
149

See Release No. 33-9126.

150

See, e.g., letters from AFL-CIO and AFR; Consumer Federation; ICI; IDC.

83

requirements, to the performance of other funds. 151 Commenters also noted that, among
other things, private fund portfolios tend to be more illiquid and difficult to value than
registered investment companies, which may result in misleading performance data due
to faulty valuations. 152 Some commenters have also suggested that, until the Commission
can develop standardized performance methodologies, private funds should be prohibited
from including performance data in general solicitation materials. 153 Other commenters,
however, have stated that the risk of investor harm is limited because only accredited
investors can purchase private funds offered under Rule 506(c). 154
With respect to performance calculations for private funds, we note that the
methodologies can vary for a number of reasons, such as the type of the fund,
151

See, e.g., letters from ICI (noting that comparisons may be particularly difficult when a private fund is
compared to a mutual fund, which is subject to specific calculation methodologies for performance data);
and IDC (stating that “[i]nvestors viewing mutual fund advertisements and private fund advertisements
may see wide variations in performance information, without any explanation or way to understand the
bases for the differences”).
152

See, e.g., letters from NASAA (explaining that “the investment strategies of private funds are typically
more opaque, risky, and illiquid than those of mutual funds”); ICI (May 21, 2012) (noting that private
funds often “invest in securities that are difficult to value or relatively illiquid” and citing a 2003 NASD
sweep of broker-dealers that found several areas of concern in hedge fund advertisements and sales
literature, including with respect to the presentation of performance data). Commission staff in our Office
of Investor Education and Advocacy also recently issued an investor bulletin regarding hedge funds,
advising investors that “[h]edge funds do not need to follow any standard methodology when calculating
performance, and they may invest in securities that are relative illiquid and difficult to value.” See Office
of Investor Education and Advocacy, Investor Bulletin: Hedge Funds (Oct. 2012), available at
http://sec.gov/investor/alerts/ib_hedgefunds.pdf.
153

See, e.g., letters from ICI (recommending a prohibition on use of performance advertising by private
funds until the Commission can develop a new rule regarding such advertising); IDC; Consumer Federation
(recommending that “the Commission should at the very least adopt clear standards for the reporting of
performance and fees by private funds, and delay their eligibility from engaging in general solicitation and
advertising until such time as those standards are in place.”).
154

See, e.g., letters from BlackRock (stating its belief that “the requirement that only sophisticated
institutions and individuals may ultimately purchase interests in these funds . . . eliminates the risk that
investors could be harmed as a result of a manager engaging in general advertising or solicitation”) and
MFA (Sept. 28, 2012) (stating that “only sophisticated investors may purchase interests in hedge funds,
including those that in the future are offered and sold in reliance on revised Rule 506”). See also letter
from MFA (June 20, 2013) (asserting that the Dodd-Frank Act and the Commission’s regulatory
implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act have significantly strengthened regulatory oversight of investment
advisers to hedge funds).

84

assumptions underlying the calculations and investor preferences. Given that legitimate
reasons may result in different approaches to calculating performance for private funds,
we have determined not to propose standardized calculation methodologies for
performance of private funds without further study.
We believe that the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and the
requirement that purchasers of a private fund offered under Rule 506(c) be accredited
investors, provide a level of investor protection and thus we are not proposing to prohibit
or restrict the use of performance data at this time. We are soliciting specific comment
on this issue as well as on whether other manner and content restrictions related to the
removal of the prohibition against general solicitation are necessary or appropriate for
Rule 506(c) offerings by private funds or other issuers. As stated previously, we have
directed the Commission staff to review and analyze developments in the new Rule
506(c) market, including the form and content of written general solicitation materials
submitted to the Commission. 155
Request for Comment
81.

Commenters have expressed concern about private funds including performance
information in general solicitations materials. Should the Commission apply any
content restrictions to performance advertising by private funds? Why or why
not? Should the Commission apply content standards to specific types of
performance advertising (e.g., model or hypothetical performance)? Why or why
not? Are there current practices that would be affected? If the performance
information is otherwise truthful and not misleading, what should the

155

See Section I of this release.

85

Commission consider in deciding whether any content restriction is appropriate or
necessary? Does the fact that investors in a private fund engaged in a Rule 506(c)
offering must be accredited to purchase securities suggest a level of financial
sophistication such that content restrictions in general, or certain content
restrictions specifically, should not be required?
82.

How do the different types of private funds (e.g., hedge funds, private equity
funds, venture capital funds, and securitized asset funds) calculate and present
performance? Should private funds be subject to standardized performance
reporting? If so, what reporting standard(s) should apply? Is there any standard
that is widely used by private funds and should we consider requiring the use of
such standard? Would one standardized performance reporting methodology be
appropriate for different types of private funds?

83.

Should the use of performance claims by a private fund as part of a general
solicitation be conditioned on a requirement that the private fund be subject to an
audit by an independent public accountant? Would such a requirement provide
some level of protection that the performance claims were at least based on
valuations of assets audited by an independent third party? To what extent do
private funds typically have such an audit?

84.

Is there a concern that, without content restrictions, materials used as part of
general solicitations may vary depending upon who is selling the product (e.g., a
broker-dealer’s material subject to FINRA rules may differ from an issuer’s
materials)?

86

85.

Is investor confusion (or confusion by the general public) a concern with respect
to a private fund’s general solicitation materials? If so, what is the specific nature
of that confusion given that ultimately only accredited investors may invest in
private funds engaged in a Rule 506(c) offering?

86.

Should the Commission draw a distinction between general solicitation activity
engaged in by a private fund relying on Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment
Company Act compared to a fund relying on Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment
Company Act? 156 If so, how and why? General solicitation can be conducted
through a broad array of media, including, but not limited to, print advertisements,
billboards, television, the Internet and radio. Which ones will be most likely used
in private fund offerings? Are there certain types of media that present
heightened investor protection concerns?

IV.

PROPOSED TEMPORARY RULE FOR MANDATORY SUBMISSION OF
WRITTEN GENERAL SOLICITATION MATERIALS
We are proposing new Rule 510T of Regulation D to require that an issuer

conducting an offering in reliance on Rule 506(c) submit to the Commission any written
general solicitation materials prepared by or on behalf of the issuer and used in
connection with the Rule 506(c) offering. Under the proposed rule, the written general
solicitation materials must be submitted no later than the date of first use of such
materials in the offering. We are proposing the rule as a temporary rule that would expire
two years after its effective date.
In connection with the Rule 506(c) Proposing Release, a number of commenters
recommended that the Commission require materials used in general solicitations under
156

See notes 107 and 108.

87

Rule 506(c) to be filed with, or furnished to, either the Commission or FINRA. Some
commenters recommended that we require the submission of all proposed general
solicitation materials as an exhibit to Form D. 157 Other commenters, including the
Investor Advisory Committee, suggested the creation of a publicly-available online
electronic “drop box” on the Commission’s website into which all general solicitation
materials (whether in print, audio or video forms) could be deposited, together with a
cover form identifying the issuer using the general solicitation materials and the
circumstances under which the materials are to be used, with the Rule 506(c) exemption
conditioned on such filings being made either before first use or promptly after first
use. 158 Still other commenters recommended that we consider requiring the pre-filing of
all general solicitation materials under Rule 506(c) with FINRA, regardless of whether
any broker-dealer involved in the offering is exempt from registration under the
Exchange Act. 159 These commenters generally asserted that such a requirement is needed
as a safeguard for investor protection.
The Commission will need to understand developments in the Rule 506 market
after the effectiveness of Rule 506(c). One of these developments would be the market
practices through which issuers would solicit potential purchasers of securities offered in
reliance on Rule 506(c). We believe that it is important that the Commission have the
ability to assess these market practices. Proposed Rule 510T would facilitate this

2012).

See letters from Investor Advisory Committee; Consumer Federation.

159

See letters from AFL-CIO and AFR; BetterInvesting (recommending that “the SEC require all public
solicitation materials under Rule 506 to be independently reviewed for compliance (perhaps by an
independent authority such as FINRA, which already reviews broker-dealer advertising) before or after the
public solicitation” (emphasis omitted)); ICI.

88

assessment by requiring issuers to submit any written general solicitation materials used
in their Rule 506(c) offerings no later than the date of the first use of these materials.
Such materials would be required to be submitted through an intake page on the
Commission’s website. To allow the Commission to assess market developments prior to
the adoption of proposed Rule 510T, the Commission will establish and make available
for use the intake page upon the effectiveness of Rule 506(c). Doing so will allow
issuers, investors and other market participants to submit voluntarily any written general
solicitation materials used in Rule 506(c) offerings. The submitted materials would be
considered by the Commission staff as part of the Rule 506(c) Work Plan.
We are not proposing, at this time, that issuers file their written general
solicitation materials through the Commission’s EDGAR system. Written general
solicitation materials submitted to the Commission pursuant to proposed Rule 510T
would not be treated as being “filed” or “furnished” for purposes of the Securities Act or
Exchange Act, including the liability provisions of those Acts. As the written general
solicitation materials would be submitted to the Commission for the purpose of furthering
the Commission’s understanding of the market practices in the Rule 506 market, we are
not proposing to make the written general solicitation materials publicly available on the
Commission’s website. 160 Oral communications used to solicit potential purchasers of
securities offered through Rule 506(c) offerings would not be subject to proposed Rule
510T. We believe that limiting the requirements of proposed Rule 510T in this manner is
reasonable as we expect that many issuers will prefer to use written general solicitation
materials due to the potentially greater reach and lower costs of such solicitation
160
We do not contemplate that the submitted written general solicitation materials would be subject to a
staff review similar to that conducted on Securities Act registration statements.

89

methods. Thus, we expect that requiring the submission of only written general
solicitation materials should provide us with an efficient way to assess developments in
the Rule 506 market.
Compliance with proposed Rule 510T would not be a condition of Rule 506(c).
As with the proposed Rule 509 requirement that issuers include legends and other
disclosures in written general solicitation materials, we believe that conditioning the
availability of Rule 506(c) on such compliance could lead to disproportionate
consequences in the event of non-compliance. Instead, we are proposing to amend
existing Rule 507(a) so that Rule 506 would be unavailable for an issuer if such issuer, or
any of its predecessors or affiliates, has been subject to any order, judgment or court
decree enjoining such person for failure to comply with Rule 510T. As with proposed
Rule 509, we believe that the possibility of disqualification from reliance on Rule 506
would provide issuers with sufficient incentive to comply with the requirement of Rule
510T, without penalizing them unfairly for an inadvertent error or failure to submit
written general solicitation materials. We also believe that Rule 507(a), with its
provision that disqualification would occur only if a court issues an injunction, may be
better suited for addressing the varied facts and circumstances that may cause an issuer
not to submit written general solicitation materials and for determining whether
disqualification for this failure is appropriate.
As noted above, we are proposing Rule 510T as a temporary rule that will expire
two years after the effective date of proposed Rule 510T. We believe that a two-year
period would provide sufficient time for the Commission and the Commission staff to

90

assess many of the market practices used to solicit potential purchasers of securities
offered through Rule 506(c) offerings and determine whether further action is warranted.
Request for Comment
87.

Should we require the submission of written general solicitation materials used in
Rule 506(c) offerings, as proposed? Should oral communications that constitute
general solicitation be required to be submitted in some form? If so, how should a
requirement to submit general solicitation materials be applied to telephone
solicitations, solicitations through broadcast media or oral communications?

88.

What are the appropriate ramifications for an issuer that fails to submit written
general solicitation materials? Should failure to submit general solicitation
materials disqualify an issuer from using Rule 506 for future offerings without
court action? Should a cure period be provided? Should submission of written
general solicitation materials be a condition to the Rule 506(c) exemption?

89.

What are the benefits and costs of requiring the submission of written general
solicitation materials in Rule 506(c) offerings? If the staff were able to conduct
only limited review of a small portion of the materials submitted, how does that
impact an assessment of costs and benefits?

90.

Should the submitted written general solicitation materials be made publicly
available on the Commission’s website? Would the availability of such materials
on the Commission’s website give undue credibility to the materials and create
the impression that submitted materials have been reviewed and/or approved by
the Commission?

91

91.

Should written general solicitation materials be required to be submitted as an
exhibit to Form D? Why or why not? Could submission of these materials
publicly, through EDGAR or another means, have the effect of encouraging
broadened investor interest in these offerings, beyond what the offerors would
achieve by engaging in their own general solicitation efforts? Would this be in
the interests of investors?

92.

Should the written general solicitation materials be submitted at a time other than
the date of first use of such materials? For example, currently, free writing
prospectuses in the form of media publications or broadcasts that include
information about the issuer, its securities, or the offering provided, authorized, or
approved by or on behalf of the issuer or an offering participant and that are
published or disseminated by unaffiliated media must be filed within four
business days after the issuer or offering participant becomes aware of its
publication or first broadcast. Should a similar deadline be considered for the
submission of written general solicitation materials that are in the form of media
publications or broadcasts and that include information provided or authorized by
the issuer or an offering participant?

93.

Should a requirement to submit written general solicitation materials be applied to
all Rule 506(c) offerings, or should certain issuers or certain Rule 506(c) offerings
be excluded or exempted from such a requirement? If yes, what issuers or
offerings should be excluded or exempted? Should smaller issuers or smaller
offerings be excluded or exempted?

92

94.

As proposed, only the issuer relying on Rule 506(c) would have an obligation
under Rule 510T to submit written general solicitation materials to the
Commission, even if the materials were prepared and disseminated by an offering
participant on behalf of the issuer. Should this requirement extend to the
submission of all written general solicitation materials used by other offering
participants in the same offering? Would this requirement further the
Commission’s assessment of the market practices used by issuers in Rule 506(c)
offerings?

95.

How would a requirement that written general solicitation materials be submitted
to the Commission affect the amount or quality of information in such materials?
How would it affect the use of Rule 506(c)?

96.

Should the proposed requirement for issuers to submit written general solicitation
materials be in the form of a temporary rule? Should this requirement be made a
permanent one? If it is in the form of a temporary rule, is the proposed two-year
period sufficient for purpose of understanding the market practices used by
issuers to solicit potential purchasers in Rule 506(c) offerings?

V.

REQUEST FOR COMMENT ON THE DEFINITION OF “ACCREDITED
INVESTOR”
Many commenters stated, and we agree, that the definition of accredited investor

as it relates to natural persons should be reviewed and, if necessary or appropriate,
amended. Several commenters recommended that the accredited investor definition be
revised to include a financial knowledge or investment experience component 161 and/or a

161

See letters from AARP; BetterInvesting; CFA Institute; Consumer Federation; ICI; Massachusetts
Securities Division (July 2, 2012). One commenter recommended adding “knowledgeable employees” to

93

threshold based on the amount of securities investments owned by the purchaser, which,
in their view, may be a more appropriate proxy for financial sophistication. 162
At the outset, we note that amending the definition of “accredited investor” raises
a number of issues separate from the implementation of Section 201(a). The accredited
investor definition is subject to a number of independent regulatory requirements that
mandate review and consideration of the definition. For example, Section 415 of the
Dodd-Frank Act mandates the completion of a study by the Government Accountability
Office (“GAO”) regarding the appropriate criteria for determining the financial
thresholds or other criteria for qualifying as an accredited investor not later than three
years after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, which would be July 20, 2013.
Under Section 413(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission is required to undertake a
review of the accredited investor definition as it relates to natural persons in its entirety
four years after the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, and once every four years
thereafter. Also, Section 413(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act stipulates that the net worth
standard shall be $1 million, excluding the value of a person’s primary residence, until
July 2014.
Because any change we would propose to the definition of accredited investor
would benefit from our consideration of these mandated reviews as well as from the

the accredited investor definition. See letter from MFA (May 4, 2012). Another commenter suggested
having the Commission offer investor education classes whereby investors who meet a lower financial
threshold but pass a qualifying test could be granted accredited investor status. See letter from Cambridge
Innovation Center (June 13, 2012).
All of the commenters that recommended that the Commission amend the definition of accredited investor
focused on the definition as it relates to natural persons. See, e.g., letters from AARP; AFL-CIO and AFR;
BetterInvesting; CFA Institute; Consumer Federation; ICI; Investor Advisory Committee; Massachusetts
Securities Division (July 2, 2012).
162

See letters from AARP; Consumer Federation; ICI.

94

ability to consider modifications to the net worth standard, we are not proposing any
amendments to the accredited investor definition at this time. Nonetheless, in light of the
considerations that commenters raised, the Commission staff has begun a review of the
definition of accredited investor as it relates to natural persons, including the need for any
changes to this definition following the effectiveness of Rule 506(c). This review, which
we anticipate will be completed in a timely manner, will encompass, among other things,
both the question of whether net worth and annual income should be used as the tests for
determining whether a natural person is an accredited investor and the question of what
the thresholds should be for those and other potential tests. We believe that it would be
appropriate to coordinate the review and consideration of the accredited investor
definition required by Section 413(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act with the completion of the
Commission staff’s ongoing review and the GAO study.
Request for Comment
97.

Are the net worth test and the income test currently provided in Rule 501(a)(5)
and Rule 501(a)(6), respectively, the appropriate tests for determining whether a
natural person is an accredited investor? Do such tests indicate whether an
investor has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that
he or she is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of a prospective
investment? If not, what other criteria should be considered as an appropriate test
for investment sophistication?

98.

Are the current financial thresholds in the net worth test and the income test still
the appropriate thresholds for determining whether a natural person is an
accredited investor? Should any revised thresholds be indexed for inflation?

95

99.

Currently, the financial thresholds in the income test and net worth test are based
on fixed dollar amounts (such as having an individual income in excess of
$200,000 for a natural person to qualify as an accredited investor). Should the net
worth test and the income test be changed to use thresholds that are not tied to
fixed dollar amounts (for example, thresholds based on a certain formula or
percentage)?

VI.

ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR COMMENT
We are also soliciting comment on the following additional matters:

100.

Should it be a condition of Rule 506(c) that, prior to any sale of a security in
reliance on the Rule, the purchaser shall have received an offering document
containing specified information? If so, should such information requirements be
the same as, or more or less inclusive than, the information requirements set forth
in Rule 502(b) of Regulation D (which apply only when an issuer sells securities
under Rule 505 or Rule 506 to a purchaser that is not an accredited investor)?

101.

Should an issuer subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13 or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act be permitted to use Rule 506(c) if it is not current in its
reporting obligations?

VII.

GENERAL REQUEST FOR COMMENT
We request and encourage any interested person to submit comments regarding

the proposed rule and form amendments, specific issues discussed in this release, and
other matters that may have an effect on the proposed rules. We request comment from
the point of view of issuers, investors and other market participants. With regard to any
comments, we note that such comments are of particular assistance to us if accompanied

96

by supporting data and analysis of the issues addressed in those comments. Commenters
are urged to be as specific as possible.
VIII. PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
A.

Background

The proposed rule and form amendments contain “collection of information”
requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). 163
The titles of these requirements are:
•

“Form D” (OMB Control No. 3235-0076); 164 and

•

“Rule 506(c) General Solicitation Materials” (a proposed new collection of
information).

We are submitting these requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”)
for review and approval in accordance with the PRA and its implementing regulations. 165
We are applying for an OMB control number for the proposed new collection of
information in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507(j) and 5 CFR 1320.13, and OMB has not
yet assigned a control number to the new collection. If adopted, responses to the new
collection of information would be mandatory. An agency may not conduct or sponsor,
and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information requirement unless
it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

Form D was adopted pursuant to Sections 2(a)(15), 3(b), 4(a)(2), 19(a) and 19(c)(3) of the Securities
Act (15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(15), 77c(b), 77d(a)(2), 77s(a) and 77s(c)(3)).

Burden and Cost Estimates Related to the Proposed Amendments
1.

Proposed Amendments Relating to Form D

We adopted Regulation D and Form D as part of the establishment of a series of
exemptions for offerings and sales of securities under the Securities Act. Form D
contains collection of information requirements, requiring an issuer to file a notice of sale
of securities pursuant to Regulation D or Section 4(a)(5) of the Securities Act. The Form
D is required to include basic information about the issuer, certain related persons and the
offering. This information is needed for implementing the exemptions and evaluating
their use. The information collection requirements related to the filing of Form D with
the Commission are mandatory to the extent that an issuer elects to make an offering of
securities in reliance on the relevant exemption. Responses are not confidential. The
hours and costs associated with preparing and filing forms and retaining records
constitute reporting and cost burdens imposed by the collection of information
requirements.
We are proposing to require the advance filing of Form D for Rule 506(c)
offerings and to require the filing of a closing amendment to Form D after the termination
of all Rule 506 offerings. In addition, we are proposing to amend Item 2 of Form D to
require the identification of the issuer’s publicly accessible (Internet) website address, if
any; Item 3 of Form D to require, in Rule 506(c) offerings, the name and address of
controlling persons, in addition to the information currently required for “related
persons;” Item 4 of Form D to require the issuer to briefly describe its industry group if
the issuer checks the “Other” box; Item 5 of Form D to replace the “Decline to Disclose”
option with a “Not Available to Public” option; Item 7 of Form D to add separate fields

98

or check boxes for issuers to indicate whether they are filing a Form D in advance of a
Rule 506(c) offering or a closing Form D amendment for a Rule 506 offering; Item 9 of
Form D to require information on the ticker symbol and security identifier for the offered
securities, if any; Item 14 of Form D to add a table requiring information, in regard to
Rule 506 offerings, on the number of accredited investors and non-accredited investors,
whether they are natural persons or entities, and the amount raised from each category of
investor; and Item 16 of Form D to require information, if the issuer is not a pooled
investment fund, on the percentage of the offering proceeds from a Rule 506 offering that
was or will be used (1) to repurchase or retire the issuer’s existing securities; (2) to pay
offering expenses; (3) to acquire assets, otherwise than in the ordinary course of business;
(4) to finance acquisitions of other businesses; (5) for working capital; and (6) to
discharge indebtedness.
We are also proposing to add new items to Form D, which would require the
following additional information in regard to offerings conducted under Rule 506: the
number and types of accredited investors that purchased securities in the offering; for
Rule 506(c) offerings, the methods used to verify accredited investor status and the types
of general solicitation used; if a class of the issuer’s securities is traded on a national
securities exchange, ATS or any other organized trading venue, and/or is registered under
the Exchange Act, the name of the exchange, ATS or trading venue and/or the Exchange
Act file number and whether the securities being offered under Rule 506 are of the same
class or are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for such class; if the issuer
used a registered broker-dealer in connection with the offering, whether any general
solicitation materials were filed with FINRA; and in the case of pooled investment funds,

99

the name and SEC file number for each investment adviser who functions directly or
indirectly as a promoter of the issuer.
We anticipate that if the proposed amendments to require the advance filing of
Form D for Rule 506(c) offerings, the filing of a closing amendment to Form D after the
termination of Rule 506 offerings, and additional information in Form D are adopted, the
burden for responding to the collection of information in Form D would increase for most
issuers. For purposes of the PRA, we estimate that the annual compliance burden of the
collection of information requirements for issuers making Form D filings after these
proposed amendments would be an aggregate 32,736 hours of issuer personnel time and
$39,283,200 for the services of outside professionals per year. Our methodologies for
deriving the above estimates are discussed below.
The table below shows the current total annual compliance burden, in hours and
in costs, of the collection of information pursuant to Form D in connection with the rule
and form amendments to implement Section 201(a) of the JOBS Act we are adopting
today. For purposes of the PRA, prepared in connection with the amendments to Form D
adopted today, we estimate that, over a three-year period, the average burden estimate
will be four hours per Form D filing. Our burden estimate represents the average burden
for all issuers. This burden is reflected as a one hour burden of preparation on the
company and a cost of $1,200 per filing. In deriving these estimates, we assume that
25% of the burden of preparation is carried by the issuer internally and that 75% of the
burden of preparation is carried by outside professionals retained by the issuer at an
average cost of $400 per hour. The portion of the burden carried by outside professionals

100

is reflected as a cost, while the portion of the burden carried by the issuer internally is
reflected in hours.

We believe that the proposed amendments to Form D, if adopted, would increase
the existing paperwork burden of the form by requiring additional information in Form D,
particularly with respect to Rule 506 offerings. In addition, while we do not anticipate
that these proposed rule and form amendments will result in an increase in the number of
Regulation D offerings, we believe that the paperwork burden of the form would increase
as a result of the advance filing requirement for Rule 506(c) offerings and the
requirement to file an additional amendment after the termination of Rule 506
offerings. 167 We estimate that the paperwork burden associated with filing the required
information on Form D over the span of a particular offering would increase to
approximately 6 hours per offering. 168
The table below illustrates the total annual compliance burden of the collection of
information in hours and in cost under the proposed amendments to Regulation D and

166

The information in this column is based on the 18,187 new Form D filings that were actually made in
2012, plus the additional 3,637 filings we estimate would be filed in the first year after the effective date of
Rule 506(c).
167

As discussed in Section IX.B.4.a of this release, there is evidence that some issuers are not filing Form
D for their offerings in compliance with Rule 503.
168
The estimate of approximately 6 hours per offering is a blended average of the paperwork burden for all
offerings for which a Form D is required to be filed, not only offerings under Rule 506.

Form D. The burden estimates were calculated by multiplying the estimated number of
responses by the estimated average amount of time it would take an issuer to prepare and
review a Form D filing consistent with the assumptions above. We continue to estimate
that 25 percent of the burden of preparation is carried by the company internally and that
75 percent of the burden of preparation is carried by outside professionals retained by the
issuer at an average cost of $400 per hour. The portion of the burden carried by outside
professionals is reflected as a cost, while the portion of the burden carried by the issuer
internally is reflected in hours.

Rule 506(c) General Solicitation Materials

We are proposing new Rule 510T of Regulation D to require that an issuer
conducting an offering in reliance on Rule 506(c) submit to the Commission any written
general solicitation materials prepared by or on behalf of the issuer and used in
connection with the Rule 506(c) offering. Under the proposed rule, the written general
solicitation materials must be submitted to the Commission through an intake page on the
Commission’s website no later than the date of first use of such materials in the offering.
Written general solicitation materials submitted to the Commission in this manner would
not be publicly available on the Commission’s website. We are proposing Rule 510T as
a temporary rule that will expire two years after the effective date of proposed Rule 510T.
In addition, we are proposing a number of legends and other disclosures that would need

102

to be included in written general solicitation materials used in Rule 506(c) offerings. All
such materials would need to disclose that only accredited investors can purchase in the
Rule 506(c) offering. All such materials used by private funds would need to disclose
that the securities offered are not subject to the protections of the Investment Company
Act. And finally, any private fund that includes performance data in its written general
solicitation materials would need to disclose certain information about the performance
data. We propose to prescribe the basic elements of the disclosures but not the exact
wording. We do not believe that any of the disclosures would be burdensome to prepare.
For purposes of the PRA, we estimate that the annual compliance burden of this
collection of information requirement for issuers conducting Rule 506(c) offerings would
be an aggregate 7,274 hours of issuer personnel time. We estimate that compliance with
the proposed requirements related to written general solicitation materials would result in
an estimated burden of two hours per offering under Rule 506(c). This estimated two
hour burden includes the time it would take to prepare any applicable disclosures for the
written general solicitation materials and to submit such materials through the
Commission’s website. Our burden estimate represents the average burden for all issuers
per Rule 506(c) offering. In deriving this estimate, we assume that 100% of the burden
of preparation will be carried by the issuer internally, which is reflected as an hourly
burden.
Although it is not possible to predict the number of future offerings made in
reliance on Rule 506(c) with any degree of accuracy, particularly because Rule 506(c) is
not yet effective, for purposes of this analysis we estimate that there would be 3,637 Rule

103

506(c) offerings per year. 169 We assume for purposes of this analysis that all Rule 506(c)
offerings will involve the use of written general solicitation materials. 170 Based on this
estimated number of Rule 506(c) offerings and an estimated burden of two hours per
Rule 506(c) offering, we estimate that the annual compliance burden of this collection of
information requirement for the first year in which issuers would be required to submit
written general solicitation materials to the Commission pursuant to Rule 510T would be
an aggregate of 7,274 hours of issuer personnel time.
C.

Request for Comment

We request comment in order to: (i) evaluate whether the proposed collections of
information are necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the
Commission, including whether the information will have practical utility; (ii) evaluate
the accuracy of our estimate of the burden of the proposed collections of information; (iii)

169

As a reference point for the potential increase in the total number of Rule 506 offerings after the
adoption of Rule 506(c), we use the impact of another past rule change on the market for Regulation D
offerings. In 1997, the Commission amended Rule 144(d) under the Securities Act [17 CFR 230.144(d)] to
reduce the holding period for restricted securities from two years to one year, thereby increasing the
attractiveness of Regulation D offerings to investors and to issuers. See Revision of Holding Period
Requirements in Rules 144 and 145, Release No. 33-7390 (Feb. 20, 1997) [62 FR 9242 (Feb. 28, 1997)].
There were 10,341 Form D filings in 1996. This was followed by a 20% increase in the number of Form D
filings in each of the subsequent three calendar years, reaching 17,830 by 1999. We assume that there
could be a similarly significant increase in the overall number of Rule 506 offerings following the adoption
of Rule 506(c). We also assume, for purposes of this analysis, that this 20% increase will be comprised
entirely of Rule 506(c) offerings because of the benefits to issuers in using general solicitation, including
wider access to accredited investors, and because non-accredited investors reportedly purchased securities
in only 11% of the Rule 506 offerings conducted between 2009 and 2012. See Ivanov/Bauguess Study.
According to DERA, for the year ended December 31, 2012, there were 18,187 new Form D filings. A
20% increase in this number would result in a total of 21,824 new Regulation D offerings. Assuming the
entire 20% increase is comprised of Rule 506(c) offerings, this would result in an estimated 3,637 Rule
506(c) offerings per year after adoption of the rule.
170

Not all Rule 506(c) offerings will involve the use of written general solicitation materials and not all
private funds will include performance data in their written general solicitation materials but we cannot
predict with any degree of accuracy how issuers will conduct their Rule 506(c) offerings. Therefore, for
purposes of this analysis, we are assigning two hours per Rule 506(c) offering, which we think represents a
reasonable estimate of the average cost to issuers in Rule 506(c) offerings of complying with the proposed
information requirements related to written general solicitation materials.

104

determine whether there are ways to enhance the quality, utility and clarity of the
information to be collected; and (iv) evaluate whether there are ways to minimize the
burden of the collections of information on those who respond, including through the use
of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology.
Persons submitting comments on the collection of information requirements
should direct the comments to the Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk
Officer for the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, and send a copy to Elizabeth M. Murphy,
Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC
20549-1090, with reference to File No. S7-06-13. Requests for materials submitted to
OMB by the Commission with regard to these collections of information should be in
writing, refer to File No. S7-06-13, and be submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, 100 F Street, NE, Washington,
DC 20549. OMB is required to make a decision concerning the collections of
information between 30 and 60 days after publication of this release. Consequently, a
comment to OMB is best assured of having its full effect if OMB receives it within 30
days of publication.
IX.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
As directed by Section 201(a)(1) of the JOBS Act, the Commission has amended

Rule 506 of Regulation D to permit general solicitation for offers and sales of securities
made pursuant to Rule 506, provided that all purchasers of the securities are accredited
investors and the issuer takes reasonable steps to verify their accredited investor status.
This rule amendment has raised a number of concerns with respect to the Commission’s

105

ability to evaluate and assess the changing nature of the Rule 506 market and investor
awareness of the risks associated with offerings under Rule 506(c). We are proposing
amendments to Regulation D, Form D and Rule 156 of the Securities Act to address these
concerns.
The proposed amendments to Form D and Regulation D as it relates to Form D
would:
•

require the advance filing of Form D in Rule 506(c) offerings;

•

require the filing of a closing amendment to Form D after the termination of a
Rule 506 offering;

•

require issuers to provide additional information in Form D primarily in
regard to Rule 506 offerings; and

•

disqualify an issuer from relying on Rule 506 for future offerings until one
year after the required Form D filings are made if the issuer, or any
predecessor or affiliate of the issuer, did not comply, within the last five years,
with Form D filing requirements in a Rule 506 offering.

These proposed amendments are intended to enhance the Commission’s ability to
evaluate the development of market practices in Rule 506 offerings. In addition, these
proposed amendments are expected to support and facilitate examination and
enforcement efforts by the Commission and other regulators.
We are also proposing a new rule in Regulation D and an amendment to Rule 156
designed to address investor protection concerns arising from the ability of issuers to
engage in general solicitation in their Rule 506(c) offerings. The new rule and the
amendment to Rule 156 would:

106

•

require written general solicitation materials used in these offerings to include
certain legends and other disclosures; and

•

extend the interpretive guidance contained within Rule 156 to the sales
literature of private funds.

Further, we are soliciting comment on whether manner or content restrictions should be
imposed on general solicitation materials used by private funds.
We are proposing a new rule in Regulation D to require issuers, on a temporary
basis, to submit any written general solicitation materials used in their Rule 506(c)
offerings to the Commission. Such materials would be required to be submitted through
an intake page on the Commission’s website no later than the date of the first use of the
materials in a Rule 506(c) offering. If adopted, this new rule would expire two years
after the effective date of the rule.
We are mindful of the costs imposed by and the benefits obtained from our rules.
The discussion below addresses the potential economic effects of these proposed
amendments, including the likely benefits and costs of the amendments and their
potential impact on efficiency, competition and capital formation. 171 These costs and
benefits are not a result of the statutory mandate of Section 201(a) and are affected by the
discretion we may exercise in implementing measures to supplement the implementation
of the statutory mandate as contained in the amendments we are adopting today.
171

Section 2(b) of the Securities Act and Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act require the Commission, when
engaging in rulemaking that requires it to consider whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the
public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action would promote
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 15 U.S.C. 77b(b); 15 U.S.C. 78c(f). Section 23(a)(2) of the
Exchange Act requires the Commission, in adopting rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact
that any new rule would have on competition and prohibits the Commission from adopting any rule that
would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the
Exchange Act. 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).

107

A.

Broad Economic Considerations

As we highlight in our baseline analysis below, we note that a large percentage of
current Rule 506 offerings are conducted by small issuers, which is consistent with the
original Commission initiative in the early 1980s to facilitate capital formation by small
issuers. 172 We stated at that time that an important purpose of the Form D filing
requirement was “to collect empirical data which will provide a basis for further action
by the Commission either in terms of amending existing rules and regulations or
proposing new ones. Further, the proposed Form would allow the Commission to elicit
information necessary in assessing the effectiveness of Regulation D as a capital raising
device for small businesses.” 173
As previously noted, we substantially revised Form D in 2008 to mandate its
filing in electronic form. 174 At that time, we highlighted that a searchable electronic
database of machine-readable filings would enable both federal and state securities
regulators to analyze exempt securities transactions more effectively, thereby improving
coordination among regulators and enhancing investor protections. 175 Since the adoption
of the electronic Form D, we have been able to systematically extract information from
the machine-readable filings, which are the best source of data about Rule 506 offerings
and the basis of the baseline information provided below.
With the adoption of Rule 506(c), issuers are expected to have access to a greater
number of capital sources because they will be able to generally solicit investors through
172

Form D and Regulation D were adopted in 1982. Release No. 33-6389 (adopting Form D as a
replacement for Forms 4(6), 146, 240 and 242).

a variety of means, thereby lowering search costs. While participating investors must be
accredited investors, and Rule 506(c) requires issuers to take reasonable steps to verify
that such persons are accredited investors, it is possible that some verification methods
could lead to participation by non-accredited investors. Non-accredited investors who are
not detected by reasonable verification methods could then participate in Rule 506(c)
offerings for which they may not be well suited. There is also an increased likelihood of
non-accredited investor participation in Rule 506(c) offerings if verification methods are
deficient. Both of these likelihoods increase with issuers’ ability to generally solicit their
offers to an audience of potential investors through broader communication and
advertising channels.
The proposed enhancements to the Form D filing requirements are prompted, in
part, by the additional investor protection concerns associated with the ability to
generally solicit private offerings. The proposed additional information and filing
requirements should also enable the Commission to better evaluate the effectiveness of
general solicitation in raising capital for small businesses.
All of these proposed rules could also impose certain costs on issuers, including
filing burdens, reduced flexibility in offering methods and disclosure of potentially
sensitive information. We discuss these potential costs in relation to the anticipated
benefits in the sections below.
B.

Economic Baseline

To assess the economic impact of the proposed rules, we are using as our baseline
the regulation of private offerings as it exists today, including the adoption of
Rule 506(c), which removes the prohibition on general solicitation for offerings under
Rule 506. We also include in our baseline the provisions enacted with the adoption of the
109

bad actor rule, which disqualifies issuers and other market participants from relying on
Rule 506 if “felons and other ‘bad actors’” are participating in the offering. Because
these provisions are being adopted today, the information provided below regarding the
current state of the private offering market in the United States does not include data
related to the use of general solicitation in Rule 506(c) offerings or the disqualification of
bad actors, because no such data exist. Hence, some of our analysis of the potential
impact of the proposed rules considers the anticipated effects of the adoption of Rules
506(c) and 506(d). As a result, many of the potential costs and benefits are difficult to
quantify with any degree of certainty, especially as the practices of market participants
are expected to evolve and adapt to the ability to generally solicit in Rule 506(c)
offerings. To the extent applicable, we will consider developments in the private offering
market subsequent to the adoption of today’s rule amendments in any future assessment
of the potential economic impact of the rules proposed today.
The baseline analysis that follows is in large part based on information collected
from Form D filings submitted by issuers relying on Regulation D to raise capital, which
is based on issuer reporting practices and requirements that could change because of the
proposed amendments. As we describe in more detail below, we believe that we do not
have a complete view of the Rule 506 market, particularly with respect to the amount of
capital raised. Currently, issuers are required to file an initial Form D within 15 days of
the first sale of securities, and are required to report additional sales through amended
filings only under certain conditions. In addition, issuers do not report all required
information, either due to error or because they do not wish to make the information
public. Commenters have suggested and we also have evidence that some issuers are not

110

filing a Form D for their offerings in compliance with Rule 503. 176 Consequently, the
analysis that follows is necessarily subject to these limitations in the current Form D
reporting process.
Some of the proposed rules, such as an Advance Form D filing for Rule 506(c)
offerings, a closing Form D amendment for Rule 506 offerings, and expanded
information requirements in Form D primarily in regard to Rule 506 offerings, seek to
address these reporting limitations and are intended to result in more complete
information on the Rule 506 market.
1.

Size of the Exempt Offering Market

Exempt offerings play a significant role in capital formation in the United States.
Offerings conducted in reliance on Rule 506 account for 99% of the capital reported as
being raised under Regulation D from 2009 to 2012, and represent approximately 94% of
the number of Regulation D offerings. 177 The significance of Rule 506 offerings is
underscored by the comparison to registered offerings. In 2012, the estimated amount of
capital reported as being raised in Rule 506 offerings (including both equity and debt)
was $898 billion, compared to $1.2 trillion raised in registered offerings. 178 Of this $898
billion, operating companies (issuers that are not pooled investment funds) reported
raising $173 billion, while pooled investment funds reported raising $725 billion. 179 The
amount reported as being raised by pooled investment funds is comparable to the amount
of capital raised by registered investment funds. In 2012, registered investment funds
176

See note 85.

177

See Ivanov/Bauguess Study.

178

See id.

179

See id.

111

(which include money market mutual funds, long-term mutual funds, exchange-traded
funds, closed-end funds and unit investment trusts) raised approximately $727 billion. 180
In 2011, the estimated amount of capital (including both equity and debt) reported
as being raised in Rule 506 offerings was $849 billion compared to $985 billion raised in
registered offerings. 181 Of the $849 billion, operating companies reported raising $71
billion, while pooled investment funds reported raising $778 billion. 182 More generally,
when including offerings pursuant to other exemptions – Rule 144A, Regulation S and
Section 4(a)(2) – significantly more capital appears to be raised through exempt offerings
than registered offerings (Figure 1). 183

180

In calculating the amount of capital raised by registered investment funds, we use the net amounts (plus
reinvested dividends and reinvested capital gains), which reflect redemptions, and not gross amounts, by
open-ended registered investment funds because they face frequent redemptions, and do not have
redemption restrictions and lock-up periods common among private funds. In addition, we use the new
issuances of registered closed-end funds and the new deposits of registered unit investment trusts. See
2013 Investment Company Institute Factbook, available at http://www.icifactbook.org.

112

Figure 1: Capital Raised in U.S. Capital Markets during 2009-2012 184

At present, issuers are required to file a Form D not later than 15 days after the
first sale of securities in a Regulation D offering and an amendment to the Form D only
under certain circumstances. Since issuers are not required to submit a filing when an
offering is completed, and submit amendments only under certain circumstances, we
have no definitive information on the final amounts raised. Figure 2, below, illustrates
that at the time of the initial Form D filing, only 39% of offerings by non-pooled
investment fund issuers were completed relative to the total amount sought. Separately,
70% of pooled investment funds state their total offering amount to be “Indefinite” in
their Form D filings. As a result, the initial Form D filings of these pooled investment
funds likely do not accurately reflect the total amount of securities offered or sold.

184

The 2012 non-ABS Rule 144A offerings data is based on an extrapolation of currently available data
through May 2012 from Sagient Research System’s Placement Tracker database. For more detail, see the
Ivanov/Bauguess Study.

Affected Market Participants

The amendments to Rule 506 we are adopting today in a separate release will
affect a number of different market participants. Issuers of securities in Rule 506
offerings include both reporting and non-reporting operating companies and pooled
investment funds. Investment advisers organize and sponsor pooled investment funds
that conduct Rule 506 offerings. Intermediaries that facilitate Rule 506 offerings include
registered broker-dealers, finders and placement agents. Investors in Rule 506 offerings
include accredited investors (both natural persons and legal entities) and non-accredited
investors who meet certain “sophistication” requirements. Affected market participants
might also include investors that are not eligible to participate in Rule 506(c) offerings,
but do because of poor investor verification standards or fraudulent activities. Each of
these market participants is discussed in further detail below.

114

a.

Issuers

Based on the information submitted in 112,467 new and amended Form D filings
between 2009 and 2012, there were 67,706 new Regulation D offerings by 49,740 unique
issuers during this four-year period. 185 The size of the average Regulation D offering
during this period was approximately $30 million, whereas the size of the median
offering was approximately $1.5 million. 186 The difference between the average and
median offering sizes indicates that the Regulation D market is comprised of many small
offerings, which is consistent with the view that many smaller businesses are relying on
Regulation D to raise capital, and a smaller number of much larger offerings.
Some information about issuer size is available from Item 5 in Form D, which
requires issuers in Regulation D offerings to report their size in terms of revenue ranges
or, in the case of pooled investment funds, net asset value ranges. All issuers can
currently choose not to disclose this size information, however, and a significant majority
of issuers that are not pooled investment funds declined to disclose their revenue ranges
in the Forms D that they filed between 2009 and 2012. For those that did, most reported
a revenue range of less than $1 million (Figure 3). 187 During the 2009-2011 period,
approximately 10% of all public companies raised capital in Regulation D offerings; in

See id. The average and median amounts are calculated based on the amounts sold by Regulation D
issuers as reported in their Form D filings. A study of unregistered equity offerings by publicly-traded
companies over the period 1980-1996 finds that the mean offering amount was $12.7 million, whereas the
median offering amount was $4.5 million. See Michael Hertzel, Michael Lemmon, James Linck and Lynn

2012, approximately 6% of such companies did so. 188 These public companies tended to
be smaller and less profitable than their industry peers, which illustrates the importance
of the private capital markets to smaller companies, whether public or private. 189

During this period, pooled investment funds conducted approximately 24% of the

of capital raised in Regulation D offerings. 190 More than 75% of pooled investment
funds declined to disclose their net asset value range. The proposed amendments to Form

those that are not pooled investment funds), except for issuers who do not include such
information in general solicitation materials under Rule 506(c) or otherwise make this
information publicly available.

Between 2009 and 2012, approximately 66% of Regulation D offerings were of
equity securities, and almost two-thirds of these were by issuers other than pooled
investment funds. 191 Non-U.S. issuers accounted for approximately 19% of the amount
of capital raised in Regulation D offerings, indicating that the U.S. market is a significant
source of capital for these issuers. 192

Investors

We have relatively little information on the types and number of investors in
Rule 506 offerings. Form D currently requires issuers in Rule 506 offerings to provide
information about the total number of investors who have already invested in the offering
and the number of persons who do not qualify as accredited investors. 193 In 2012,
approximately 153,000 investors participated in offerings by operating companies, while
approximately 81,000 investors invested in offerings by pooled investment funds. 194
Because some investors participate in multiple offerings, these numbers likely
overestimate the actual number of unique investors in these reported offerings. We do
not know what fraction of these investors are natural persons or entities because Form D
does not require any other information on the types of investors. 195 In offerings under
Rule 506(b), both accredited investors and up to 35 non-accredited investors who meet
certain “sophistication” requirements are eligible to purchase securities. In offerings
under new Rule 506(c), only accredited investors will be eligible to purchase securities.
Information collected from Form D filings indicates that most Rule 506 offerings
do not involve broad investor participation. More than two-thirds of these offerings have
ten or fewer investors, while less than 5% of these offerings have more than 30 investors.
Although Rule 506 currently allows for the participation of non-accredited investors who
meet certain sophistication requirements, such non-accredited investors purchased

as whether they are natural persons or legal entities.

Number of Investors

As stated above, between 2009 and 2012, the size of the median Regulation D
offering, based on the information in Form D filings, was approximately $1.5 million.
The presence of so many relatively small offerings suggests that a sizable number of
current investors in Rule 506 offerings are natural persons or legal entities in which all
equity owners are natural persons. This is because smaller offerings may not provide
sufficient scale for institutional investors to earn a sizable return. Institutional investors

typically have a larger investible capital base and more formal screening procedures
compared to investors who are natural persons, and the associated costs of identifying
potential investments and monitoring their investment portfolio lead them to make larger
investments than natural persons. 198 As for whether natural persons investing in these
offerings are accredited investors or non-accredited investors, almost 90% of the
Regulation D offerings conducted between 2009 and 2012 did not involve any nonaccredited investors. 199
While we do not know what percentage of investors in Rule 506 offerings are
natural persons, the vast majority of Regulation D offerings are conducted without the
use of an intermediary, 200 suggesting that many of the investors in Regulation D offerings
likely have a pre-existing relationship with the issuer or its management because these
offerings would not have been conducted using general solicitation. This category of
investors is likely to be much smaller than the total number of eligible investors for Rule
506(c) offerings, which is potentially very large. We estimate that at least 8.7 million
U.S. households, or 7.4% of all U.S. households, qualified as accredited investors in
2010, based on the net worth standard in the definition of “accredited investor” (Figure
6). 201

See Ivanov/Bauguess Study.

200

An analysis of all Form D filings submitted between 2009 to 2012 shows that approximately 11% of all
new offerings reported sales commissions of greater than zero because the issuers used intermediaries. See
Ivanov/Bauguess Study. We assume that the lack of a commission indicates the absence of an
intermediary.
201

This estimate is based on net worth and household data from the Federal Reserve Board’s Triennial
Survey of Consumer Finances 2010. Our calculations are based on all 32,410 observations in the 2010
survey.

120

Figure 6: Number of U.S. Households that Qualify as Accredited Investors Based
on 2010 Net Worth

Our analysis, however, leads us to believe that only a small percentage of these
households are likely to participate in securities offerings, especially exempt offerings.
First, as mentioned above, data from Form D filings in 2012 suggests that fewer than
234,000 investors (of which an unknown subset are natural persons) participated in
Regulation D offerings, which is small compared to the 8.7 million households that
qualify as accredited investors. Second, evidence suggests that only a small fraction of
the total accredited investor population has significant levels of direct stockholdings.
Based on an analysis of retail stock holding data for 33 million brokerage accounts in
2010, only 3.7 million accounts had at least $100,000 of direct investments in equity
securities issued by public companies listed on domestic national securities exchanges,
while only 664,000 accounts had at least $500,000 of direct investments in such equity

121

securities (Figure 7). 202 Assuming that investments in publicly-traded equity securities
are a gateway to investments in securities issued in exempt offerings, and accredited
investors with investment experience in publicly-traded equity securities are more likely
to participate in an exempt offering than accredited investors who do not, the set of
accredited investors likely to be interested in investing in Rule 506(c) offerings could be
significantly smaller than the total accredited investor population.

the Commission has assets under management of approximately $4.6 billion; the median
size of assets under management for these registered investment advisers is $258 million.
Approximately one-fourth of registered investment advisers (2,842) currently
advise (or advised) private funds that filed Form D between 2002 and 2012, while
another 1,250 registered investment advisers currently advise (or advised) private funds
that did not file Form D during the same period. The registered investment advisers
advising private funds that submitted Form D filings during this period had average
assets under management of $8.7 billion, while the ones advising private funds that did
not submit Form D filings had average assets under management of $8.6 billion.
Registered investment advisers that did not advise private funds (6,623) are considerably
smaller, with average assets under management of $2.1 billion.

Broker-Dealers

As of December 2012, there were 4,450 broker-dealers registered with the
Commission who file on Form X-17A-5, with average total assets of approximately $1.1
billion per broker-dealer. The aggregate total assets of these registered broker-dealers are
approximately $4.9 trillion. Of these registered broker-dealers, 410 are dually registered
as investment advisers. The dually registered broker-dealers are larger (average total
assets of $6.4 billion) than those that are not dually registered. Among the dually
registered broker-dealers, we identified 24 that currently have or have had private funds
that submitted Form D filings between 2002 and 2012.
203

For the same time period, 2,303 exempt reporting advisers filed a Form ADV with the Commission.
Certain investment advisers that are ineligible to register with the Commission may also be exempt from
registration with any state.

Incidence of Fraud in Securities Offerings

As discussed above, commenters expressed concern that the use of general
solicitation in Rule 506(c) offerings could lead to greater incidence of fraud in this
market as those seeking to conduct fraudulent offerings would be able to directly solicit
unsophisticated investors. Our principal source of data about the Rule 506 market is
Form D filings and the incidence of fraud detected by us and other regulators. Because
data on the incidence of fraud in private securities offerings is extremely limited, we are
unable to estimate the extent of fraud in the existing market for privately offered
securities or the degree, if any, to which such fraud may increase upon the adoption of
Rule 506(c).
Some commenters suggested that we look to our experience with offerings
conducted pursuant to Rule 504, as amended in 1992, as a means of evaluating the
potential for fraud in the Rule 506(c) market. We do not believe that our experience with
the 1992 amendments to Rule 504 is particularly instructive with respect to the potential
incidence of fraud resulting from our implementation of Section 201(a) of the JOBS
Act. 204
204

In 1992, when we amended Rule 504 to eliminate the prohibition against general solicitation, we also
provided that the securities issued in these Rule 504 offerings would not be “restricted securities” for
purposes of resale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. As a result, a non-reporting company
could sell up to $1 million of immediately freely-tradable securities in a 12-month period and be subject
only to the antifraud and civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws.
By 1998, we concluded that securities issued in these Rule 504 offerings facilitated a number of fraudulent
secondary transactions in the over-the-counter markets, and that these securities were issued by “microcap”
companies, characterized by thin capitalization, low share prices and little or no analyst coverage.
Moreover, we stated that, while “we believe that the scope of abuse is small in relation to the actual usage
of the exemption, we also believe that a regulatory response may be necessary.” As the freely-tradable
nature of the securities facilitated the fraudulent secondary transactions, we proposed to “implement the
same resale restrictions on securities issued in a Rule 504 transaction as apply to transactions under the
other Regulation D exemptions,” in addition to reinstating the prohibition against general solicitation.
Although we recognized that resale restrictions would have “some impact upon small businesses trying to
raise ‘seed capital’ in bona fide transactions,” we believed that such restrictions were necessary so that

124

Several commenters echoed concerns regarding the potential of fraud related to
private funds in the Rule 506(c) market. 205 Empirical evidence on the extent of fraud
involving private funds is not readily available. While a few economic studies suggest
that certain hedge funds engage in various types of misreporting, such as misrepresenting
past performance, 206 delaying disclosure of returns 207 and inflating returns at the end of
the fiscal year in order to earn higher fees, 208 these studies do not provide information
about the extent or magnitude of any such misreporting activities. In a 2003 report, the
Commission staff noted that there was no evidence that hedge funds were
disproportionately involved in fraudulent activity and that the charges brought by the
Commission in 38 enforcement actions against hedge fund advisers and hedge funds
between 1999 and 2003 were similar to the charges against other types of investment
advisers. 209 Evidence on the extent of fraud involving other types of pooled investment
funds also is sparse. A more recent study has identified 245 lawsuits (both federal and
“unscrupulous stock promoters will be less likely to use Rule 504 as the source of the freely tradable
securities they need to facilitate their fraudulent activities in the secondary markets.” Revision of Rule 504
of Regulation D, the “Seed Capital” Exemption, Release No. 33-7541 (May 21, 1998) [63 FR 29168,
29169].
In contrast, issuers using Rule 506(c) can sell only to accredited investors, and the securities issued in these
offerings are deemed to be “restricted securities” for purposes of resale under Rule 144. As a result,
schemes involving price manipulation to defraud unknowing investors in the immediate resale of securities
purchased directly from issuers (colloquially referred to as “pump and dump” schemes) are not the types of
fraud we believe are likely to occur in Rule 506(c) offerings, given the holding period requirement in Rule
144(d) and other structural impediments, such as restricted transfer legends on stock certificates.

shown that venture capital funds that are older and have a larger presence in terms of size
and network are less likely to be sued. 210
For comparison purposes, a recent study using enforcement actions brought by the
Commission and private securities class action lawsuits to measure the incidence of fraud
in the registered offering market found that approximately 3% of registered initial public
offerings during the period from 1995 to 2007 were associated with allegations of
fraud. 211 This study used the filing of a securities lawsuit against an issuer for financial
misreporting during the initial public offering process as the proxy for detected fraud.
The analysis covered 3,297 initial public offerings that resulted in 110 cases. The study
determined that the incidence of fraud increased to 12% when securities law violations
committed in years subsequent to the initial public offering were included. These are
cases where fraud was detected and the Commission filed or instituted enforcement
action; at best, they represent a lower bound on incidence of fraud in those markets.
While we cannot estimate the extent of fraud in the market for privately offered
securities, we do know, based upon our own experience enforcing the federal securities
laws and the enforcement efforts of criminal authorities and state securities regulators,
that fraud exists in this market. One of the primary objectives of the amendments to
Regulation D and Form D being proposed today is to increase the information available
to the Commission about the Rule 506 market so that we can better assess, and, if
necessary, take steps to respond to, fraudulent practices in the market for privately

Current Practices

The potential economic impact of the proposed amendments will depend on the
current practices of issuers and market participants in Rule 506 offerings – specifically,
on the extent to which issuers currently file Form D and their incentives for doing so in
the future. The analysis below provides an assessment of current compliance rates with
respect to Form D filing requirements.
a.

Missing Form D Filings

Issuers that use an exemption under Regulation D to raise capital are required to
file a Form D not later than 15 days after the first sale of securities in the offering;
however, the filing of Form D is not a condition to the use of Regulation D. Commenters
have indicated that a number of issuers in Regulation D offerings do not file the form,
even though the filing of Form D is a requirement of Regulation D. Assessing the
prevalence of current non-compliance is difficult because a Form D filing is often the
only public record of a Regulation D offering. We can provide an estimate of filing
compliance for issuers under Rule 506 that use a registered broker-dealer in these
offerings and for private funds that are managed by a Commission-registered investment
adviser. 212 Because information related to private offerings for these sets of issuers is
available in other filings, we can determine, in certain cases, when a Form D should have
been but was not filed. In the analyses below, we present evidence on the corresponding
212

Broker-dealers registered with FINRA are required to file private placement memoranda under FINRA
Rules 5122 and 5123 for their or their client’s private offering. Sections 203 and 204 of the Advisers Act
[15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-3 and 80b-4] authorize the Commission to collect the information required by Form
ADV. Investment advisers that are required to register with the Commission and exempt reporting advisers
are required to file Form ADV with the Commission. The form includes disclosure of Regulation D
offerings that they conduct for their client issuers.

127

rate at which we observe Form D filings. It should be noted that our estimates are subject
to some degree of error because in some instances it is possible that that a Form D was
filed even though we could not match it to a specific offering. In other instances, a Form
D may not have been filed because the issuer may be relying on another exemption from
Securities Act registration that does not require a Form D filing, such as the statutory
exemption under Section 4(a)(2). Our estimates of compliance for issuers that use a
registered investment adviser or broker-dealer also may not reflect the rate of compliance
among issuers that do not. To the extent that Forms D are more likely to be filed when a
registered entity is involved, there could be a greater rate of non-compliance among the
remaining Rule 506 offerings that do not involve a registered investment adviser or
broker-dealer. 213
Form D and Form ADV reconciliation. Our estimate of Form D filing
compliance among Commission-registered investment advisers that manage private funds
is based on their requirement to report to the Commission on Form ADV the Regulation
D offerings that they conduct. We matched the Form D file numbers reported on Form
ADV filings from 2012 to the actual Form D and Form D amendments filed on EDGAR.
This created a universe of 18,276 private funds identified on Form ADV filings for the
period between 2002 and 2012. 214 The matching was done in two steps. First, we
matched the file number of each Regulation D offering as reported by the investment
adviser on Form ADV to the file numbers in EDGAR. 215 Second, if there was no file
213

Approximately 20% of Rule 506 offerings use either a broker-dealer or investment adviser.

214

We chose this period because Form D file numbers are not available for Form D filings submitted prior
to January 1, 2002.
215

Some advisers identify a private fund’s Form D file number as a series of 9s because they may not be
able to locate the fund’s Form D file number (particularly with respect to Form D filings made prior to

128

number for the Regulation D offering, we matched by private fund name. We compared
the name of the private fund reported by the investment adviser in its Form ADV to the
issuer names in the Form D and Form D amendment filings. Conducting both steps
resulted in an 89% match – i.e., during the period from 2002 to 2012, as many as 11% of
the private funds advised by registered investment advisers did not file a Form D when
relying on the Regulation D exemption. This number, however, could overstate the
actual number of private funds that did not file a Form D due to typographical errors in
the name of the private fund or filing number. Also, registered investment advisers are
required to identify Form D filing numbers only for private funds that are currently
offering their securities. As a result, the Form ADV filings of advisers to private funds
that are closed to new investments or are no longer engaged in a Regulation D offering of
their securities are not required to disclose a Form D filing number.
Form D and FINRA filing reconciliation. Our estimate of Form D filing
compliance among registered broker-dealers that facilitate private offerings is based on
their compliance with FINRA Rules 5122 and 5123 (the latter rule took effect on
December 3, 2012), which requires member firms that sell securities in certain private
offerings to file with FINRA copies of any private placement memorandum, term sheet or
other offering document used in these offerings (or amendments thereof) or, alternatively,
to file a notice stating that no such offering document was used. 216 As of December 31,

January 1, 2002 because such file numbers are not available through an EDGAR search). Advisers may
also mask the Form D file number to maintain the anonymity of a private fund’s name. These factors will
understate the number of funds that file Form D and Form D amendments. Thus, in such cases we
attempted to match by fund name.
216

Not all broker-dealers that sell securities in private offerings have to file private placement memoranda
with FINRA under FINRA Rules 5122 and 5123. FINRA filings represent a small proportion of
Regulation D offerings. For example, if a broker-dealer is not registered as a member of FINRA, they will

129

2012, FINRA oversaw nearly 4,300 brokerage firms. 217 During the period from
December 3, 2012 to February 5, 2013, FINRA received 366 filings under this rule. Each
private offering could have multiple broker-dealers and consequently the 366 filings
could represent fewer than 366 unique offerings. Further, FINRA rules require filing by
broker-dealers associated with a Regulation D or other private offerings, not all of which
require the filing of Form D. A Form D filing is only required by issuers that undertake
Regulation D offerings. We cannot identify how many of the 366 filings are related to
non-Regulation D offerings.
We matched these FINRA filings to the Form D and Form D amendment filings
received on EDGAR. The matching was done in multiple steps. First, we matched using
the issuer CIK number and the Form D filing number 218 contained in each of the separate
filings. Then, for each unmatched FINRA filing, we searched the issuer name, and
variants of the name, in EDGAR to determine if a Form D was filed for that issuer’s
offering. Applying both procedures resulted in a 91% match – i.e., during this threemonth period, subject to the limitations described above, as many as 9% of the offerings
represented in the FINRA filings for Regulation D or other private offerings that used a
registered broker did not have a corresponding Form D.

not file with FINRA. Further only those private offerings that have retail investors, i.e., natural persons,
trigger the requirement for the broker-dealer to file the private placement memorandum with FINRA.

Legends and Other Disclosures in Regulation D
Offering Materials

Prior to the effectiveness of Rule 506(c), general solicitation has not been
permitted for private offerings under Rule 506. Although advertising by issuers is
prohibited, issuers may provide some material or information to intermediaries and
interested investors regarding themselves and their offering. Because this information is
not filed with the Commission, we do not know if legends and relevant disclosures are
included in any such material.
C.

Analysis of the Amendments Relating to Form D

We are proposing amendments to Form D and Regulation D as they relate to
Form D in order to enhance our understanding of the Rule 506 market, particularly the
impact of the adoption of Rule 506(c). These proposed amendments would:
•

require the filing of Form D 15 calendar days in advance of the first use of
general solicitation in a Rule 506(c) offering;

•

require the filing of a closing amendment to Form D within 30 calendar days
after the termination of a Rule 506 offering;

•

require issuers to provide additional information in Form D primarily with
respect to Rule 506 offerings; and

•

disqualify an issuer from relying on Rule 506 for future offerings until one
year after the required Form D filings are made if the issuer, or any
predecessor or affiliate of the issuer, did not comply, within the last five years,
with Form D filing requirements in a Rule 506 offering.

The proposals relating to the Form D filing requirements are intended to improve the
availability of Form D information to the Commission that would enable it to evaluate

131

market developments in the Rule 506 market. The amendments to the information
requirements of Form D would enable the Commission to obtain more complete
information about the Rule 506 market than it has now, especially with respect to the
composition of investors and the general solicitation practices and verification methods
employed in Rule 506(c) offerings.
1.

Advance Filing of Form D for Rule 506(c) Offerings

We are proposing to amend Rule 503 of Regulation D to require issuers that
intend to engage in general solicitation for Rule 506(c) offerings to file an initial Form D
with certain information 15 calendar days in advance of any general solicitation for the
offering. We believe that requiring issuers to file an Advance Form D would assist the
Commission’s efforts to evaluate the use of Rule 506(c). The Advance Form D would be
useful to the Commission and the Commission staff, as it would enhance the information
available to the Commission to analyze issuers that attempted to conduct Rule 506(c)
offerings but were unsuccessful in selling any securities through these offerings or chose
alternative forms of raising capital. Currently, Form D is required to be filed only after
the first sale of securities, which means that issuers that attempted to, but did not,
complete a sale are not required to file a Form D, thereby limiting the Commission’s
ability to determine which issuers are facing challenges raising capital under Rule 506(c)
and whether further steps are needed to facilitate issuers’ ability to raise capital under
Rule 506(c). We also understand that the Advance Form D would be useful to state
securities regulators and to investors in gathering timely information about the use of
Rule 506(c).
On the other hand, to the extent that an Advance Form D filing signals planned

132

capital-raising activity and related details to potential competitors, some issuers may be
reluctant to use Rule 506(c) when they might otherwise. The proposed Advance Form D
filing requirement could thus deter some issuers from using Rule 506(c) as they would be
forced to indicate their capital raising plans to a limited extent prior to commencing their
general solicitation activities. In addition, the proposed Advance Form D filing
requirement could impose market timing costs to the extent that an issuer would like to
move quickly but has not yet filed an Advance Form D. We have proposed an advance
filing deadline that we think appropriately balances the benefits of advance notice with
these market timing costs. Nevertheless, many issuers may choose to file an Advance
Form D just in case they decide to conduct a Rule 506(c) offering. As a result, many
Advance Form D filings may not reflect the true intent of issuers to conduct these
offerings. If there are large numbers of issuers that frequently engage in this practice,
there could be a sizable number of premature, and possibly even meaningless, notices of
Rule 506(c) offerings; however, requiring specific information about the anticipated
offering could decrease the likelihood that issuers file an Advance Form D when they do
not intend to conduct an offering in the near term.
To complete an Advance Form D would cause issuers to incur costs; however,
because the information in Advance Form D mirrors the information required to be filed
within 15 days of the first sale of securities, the additional expense to collect the
information for the Advance Form D would be offset by the lack of any need to do so for
the subsequent filings.
2.

Form D Closing Amendment for Rule 506 Offerings

We are also proposing to amend Rule 503 to require the filing of a final

133

amendment to Form D within 30 calendar days after the termination of a Rule 506
offering. Requiring a closing filing through a Form D amendment upon the termination
of a Rule 506 offering, in combination with the changes to Form D to require additional
information on Rule 506 offerings, would provide more complete information of the total
amounts of capital raised in these offerings by the types of investor and the methods used
to verify accredited investor status in Rule 506(c) offerings.
At present, issuers are required to file a Form D within 15 days of the first sale of
securities in a Regulation D offering and amendments to the Form D under certain
circumstances. As a result, if the total offering amount remains the same or is increased
by less than 10%, any capital raised or any change in the composition of subscribing
investors, subsequent to the last filing for the offering, is not required to be reported in a
Form D. For example, in 2010, issuers sought to raise $1.2 trillion in reported Regulation
D offerings, but only $905 billion was reported as sold at the time of the initial Form D
filing. 219 Thus, based on the available information, we are not able to determine the
actual amount raised. A requirement to file a closing amendment to Form D for a
Rule 506 offering that confirms the actual amount raised in the offering could provide
more complete information.
Without a closing Form D amendment requirement, it may be difficult to clearly
ascertain, for example, all of the methods of general solicitation that issuers used in
Rule 506(c) offerings or the types of investors solicited in these offerings, particularly if
any changes in solicitation methods or targeted investors after the initial Form D filing
are not otherwise required to be reported. In such case, any analysis of the information in
219

See Ivanov/Bauguess Study. For issuers that reported their offering amount as ‘Indefinite’, we assumed
that amount offered is equal to amount raised.

134

Form D filings would be based on incomplete data, which may limit the intended benefits
of collecting the Form D information. Updated and more conclusive data on Rule 506
offerings from closing Form D amendments would provide the Commission with a more
complete account of the flow of capital in the Rule 506 market, how the flow relates to
offering characteristics and the potential associated risks and would assist the
Commission in evaluating whether further regulatory action is necessary.
Requiring a closing Form D amendment for Rule 506 offerings would likely come
at a nominal cost to issuers in terms of filing another notice, particularly because the
filing would be substantially similar to the initial Form D filing or prior Form D
amendments for the offering.
3.

Amendments to the Content Requirements of Form D

The information about Regulation D offerings collected to date and described in
this release illustrates and underscores the importance of the non-registered offering
market to the U.S. economy. Form D is the primary source of information for the
Commission to assess the Regulation D market. Much of what we know about the size
and characteristics of the private offering market comes from Form D filings. The
continued collection of this information following the elimination of the prohibition
against general solicitation in Rule 506(c) offerings will be an important tool for
determining the ongoing impact of Rule 506(c).
A number of the proposed amendments to Form D would require additional
information specific to Rule 506(c) offerings, which would enable the Commission to
develop a greater understanding of the new Rule 506(c) market, particularly with respect
to those matters where limited to no information would otherwise be available. Other

135

proposed revisions to Form D would require additional information in regard to both
Rule 506(b) offerings and Rule 506(c) offerings, which would permit a more complete
analysis and comparison of the use of current Rule 506(b) and new Rule 506(c). 220
Without a substantially similar set of information collected for both Rule 506(b) and
506(c) offerings, the effects of the use of general solicitation on the Rule 506 market may
be difficult to measure or identify. Increased consistency in the reporting of information
in Form D filings for offerings under Rules 506(b) and 506(c) would promote the
availability of comparable data for the two types of offerings and, consequently, may
result in a more complete assessment of the effects of the elimination of the prohibition
against general solicitation on raising capital under Regulation D. In addition, because
the overwhelming majority of Regulation D offerings are conducted in reliance on
Rule 506, this should provide the Commission with substantially more complete
information about the Regulation D market generally, which, when considered along with
the information collected as part of the Commission’s Rule 506 review program, would
help the Commission evaluate the need for additional action to enhance investor
protection.
On the other hand, the proposed amendments to Form D may result in higher
compliance costs for issuers conducting offerings in reliance on Rule 506(b) and new
Rule 506(c). Issuers relying on Rule 506(b) would have to provide more information
than is currently the case in regard to Form D, which would be coupled with the risk of
disqualification from using Rule 506 in future offerings, under proposed Rule 507(b), if
they or their affiliates or predecessors fail to comply with the additional Form D filing
220
A number of the proposed revisions to Form D would also require additional information in regard to
offerings under Rule 504, Rule 505, and Section 4(a)(5).

136

requirements. Nevertheless, we believe that the additional burden to provide the
additional required information to be minimal. The proposed amendments would also
require, depending on the circumstances, additional information under Items 5 and 9 of
Form D with respect to offerings under Rule 504, Rule 505 or Section 4(a)(5), which, as
discussed below, we do not believe would result in materially higher compliance costs for
issuers conducting these offerings.
Issuers may view the increased reporting requirements as a greater regulatory
burden and a loss of commercial privacy, 221 which could put certain issuers at a
competitive disadvantage if the costs are sufficient to deter them from raising capital in
the private offering market. Requiring issuers to report more information in Form D
could also result in some issuers choosing to consider other capital-raising options.
A discussion of a number of the proposed amendments to Form D is set forth
below.
a.

Investor Types

The proposed amendment to Item 14 (Investors) of Form D would require
information, with respect to Rule 506 offerings, on the number of investors under the
following categories: natural persons who are accredited investors, legal entities that are
accredited investors, and if applicable, non-accredited natural persons and non-accredited
legal entities. The additional required information would include the amount raised from
each of the four categories of investors. At present, Form D requires information on the
total amount of capital expected to be raised and the number of accredited and non221

Issuers may not wish to reveal certain information such as the timing of amounts offered and raised,
including whether an offering was successfully completed, which could inform other market participants,
including competitors, about the issuers’ ability to finance investments.

137

accredited investors that have purchased securities in a particular offering. We do not
have information on the number of investors who are natural persons or legal entities, or
the amounts raised from each of these investor categories. The proposed amendment
would thus require more detailed information on the composition of investors in the
Rule 506 market than is currently available. Because all purchasers in Rule 506(c)
offerings must be accredited investors, and offerings under Rule 506(b) can have no more
than 35 non-accredited investors who meet certain sophistication requirements,
disaggregated data regarding the number of each type of investor and the amount
invested by accredited and non-accredited investors would provide a more complete view
of their participation in the Rule 506 market.
Understanding the composition of investors in Rule 506 offerings as between
natural persons and legal entities would also be important for risk assessment purposes.
Institutional investors usually have a greater amount of resources at their disposal and
therefore are more likely to have better information and greater sophistication when
considering the potential risks and benefits of a particular investment, as compared to
natural persons. 222 To the extent that natural persons are less sophisticated and more
prone to be targets of fraud than institutional investors, understanding how many natural
persons are participating in Rule 506(c) offering could help identify those Rule 506(c)
offerings that raise greater investor protection concerns. This information could also help
the Commission better understand how general solicitation is used with respect to the
types of investors. Additionally, concerns about verification methods to assess accredited
investor status are greatest as it relates to natural persons. Having a better understanding
222

See note 198.

138

of the involvement of natural persons in Rule 506(c) offerings would assist the
Commission in its assessment of the efficacy of the verification provisions.
Issuers relying on Rule 506(c) will be collecting such information as part of their
verification of accredited investor status for Rule 506(c) offerings. We do not expect the
requirement that issuers report this information on Form D to impose significant
additional costs.
b.

Issuer Size

The proposed amendment to Item 5 (Issuer Size) of Form D would replace the
“Decline to Disclose” option with “Not Available to Public” option. This change to
Form D would assist the Commission in obtaining a greater amount of information on the
size of issuers that conduct Rule 506 offerings. This proposed amendment would also
apply to offerings under Rule 504, Rule 505 and Section 4(a)(5). At present, a majority
of Form D filings do not provide information on the size of the issuer’s revenue (if the
issuer is an operating company) or net asset value (if the issuer is a hedge fund or other
investment fund). It is likely that some issuers keep this information private for
competitive purposes and therefore do not make this information widely available. For
those issuers that already make this information publicly available, or that do not
currently make a reasonable effort to keep such information confidential, reporting their
size range in a Form D filing would not impose a material cost. Having this information
would provide a more complete picture of the Rule 506 market and allow the
Commission to more accurately assess the impact of allowing general solicitation on
capital formation across issuer sizes. This information would be particularly useful in
better understanding the effects of general solicitation on capital formation by small

139

businesses, a set of issuers that otherwise face significantly greater challenges than larger
issuers in finding investors.
c.

Issuer Industry Group

Industry information is an important issuer characteristic that helps in assessing
the effectiveness of private markets in promoting capital formation across industry
groups. An analysis of Form D filings over the period 2009-2012 indicates that the
“Other” category was checked in over 15% of offerings. 223 The proposed amendment to
Item 4 (Industry Group) would require an explanation to be provided when an issuer
checks “Other” as its industry. This would allow a better assessment of the
representation of a particular industry or sub-industry in Regulation D offerings and help
the Commission evaluate whether industry classifications are appropriately defined in
Form D.
d.

Control Persons

The proposed amendment to Item 3 (Related Persons) to include controlling
persons when the issuer seeks to use general solicitation in a Rule 506(c) offering will
expand the set of persons covered under the existing list of related persons that includes
promoters, directors and executive officers. Thus, a beneficial owner who has a
significant equity stake in an issuer but may not be a managing executive would now
need to be identified. This information may be helpful to the Commission in developing
a more comprehensive understanding of the issuers and other market participants that are
involved in Rule 506(c) offerings.
Including information regarding control persons would enable investors to better
223

See Ivanov/Bauguess Study.

140

identify persons who may be in positions to influence the Rule 506(c) offering. The
identity information could also be useful if questions arise about the offering. Issuers
would incur additional reporting costs when there are control persons that are not also
related persons. In many instances this information is readily available and easy to
collect, particularly to the extent that issuers identify controlling shareholders under the
bad actor provisions we are adopting today. Issuers could, however, find this amendment
burdensome as they may want to keep information on controlling persons private.
There could be instances where some shareholders who own a significant stake in
the issuers’ equity but are passive owners are incorrectly identified as control persons in a
publicly filed form. Because this information would be required only for Rule 506(c)
offerings, issuers would not face these privacy concerns if they do not rely on Rule
506(c) for their offering.
e.

Trading Venue and Security Identifiers

Proposed Item 18 would require issuers to identify if any of its securities are
traded on a national securities exchange, ATS or any other organized trading venue. If
the issuer answers in the affirmative, it is required to identify the names of such trading
venues where its securities are being traded and the SEC file number for such class of
securities. The issuer, under proposed Item 18, would also need to identify if the
securities to be sold in the offering are of the same class as the class of securities listed or
quoted on the trading venue. Further, the proposed amendment to Item 9 (Types of
Securities Offered) of Form D would require information on the trading symbol and

141

security identifier, such as a CUSIP number 224 or ISIN (International Securities
Identification Number), for the offered securities, if any.
These proposed amendments would apply to offerings under Rule 506 as well as
to offerings under Rule 504, Rule 505 and Section 4(a)(5). In many cases, the class of an
issuer’s security offered through a Rule 506 offering may not be eligible for trading on a
national securities exchange, ATS or any other organized trading venue, and may not
have an assigned security identifier.
For classes of securities where this information is available, regulators could link
the offered securities to financial information about the issuer and the class of security –
such as accounting data and security-price data – that is not available on Form D but is
available through common third-party data aggregation platforms and through the
associated trading venues. The inclusion of a security identifier in Form D would be
relevant information for a number of private offerings. For example, analysis of Form D
filings shows that approximately 10% of Exchange Act reporting companies conducted
Regulation D offerings during the period between 2009 to 2011. 225
The inclusion of this information could be useful to the Commission in evaluating
developments in the Rule 506 market in several ways. First, with respect to a security
identifier, linking Rule 506 offerings and financial information about the issuer from
other financial data providers would allow for a more effective evaluation of one part of
224

CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures) is a universally recognized
identification for more than 9 million unique financial instruments. The CUSIP system, owned by the
American Bankers Association and operated by Standard & Poor’s, facilitates the clearing and settlement
process of securities. The number consists of nine characters (including letters and numbers) that uniquely
identify a company or issuer and the type of security. See https://www.cusip.com/cusip/index.htm. CUSIP
is one of the most widely available securities identifiers and is available for the securities issued by
Exchange Act reporting companies.
225

142

the Rule 506 market. In particular, the availability of a security identifier would enable
us to automatically match and process financial and other information about the issuer in
a manner that would be significantly less burdensome than if we had to rely solely on a
firm name and other identifying information. Security identifiers also could facilitate
tracking multiple issuances by the same issuer, which might not otherwise be clear if a
security identifier exists but is not made available. In addition, identifying the trading
venue for an offered security could help us assess whether particular trading venues – or
the lack of trading venue – is associated with higher prevalence of fraud and other illegal
activities.
Identifying whether the securities being offered in reliance on Rule 506 are of the
same class of securities, or are convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for such
class of securities will provide additional informational linkages between publicly
available data and private offerings. The marginal cost to issuers of providing this
information is likely to be low because this information should be readily available to the
issuers of the offered securities.
f.

Use of Proceeds

The proposed amendment to Item 16 (Use of Proceeds) of Form D would require
issuers that are not pooled investment funds to report information on the portion of
proceeds (if any) from Rule 506 offerings that will be used to repurchase or retire the
issuer’s existing securities. This information would allow the Commission to distinguish
between offerings that raise capital to allow insiders and/or incumbent shareholders a
partial or full exit and offerings that use the proceeds for investments or capital
expenditures. This information could help us better distinguish the impact of the ability

143

to use general solicitation in Rule 506(c) offerings on capital formation versus investment
exit strategies, particularly for small businesses. It may also help inform investors and
the market generally about the issuer’s incentives or related risks. For example, proceeds
used towards redemption of securities could indicate that existing shareholders are
lowering their investment exposure in the issuer.
The proposed amendment also requires issuers, other than pooled investment
funds, that are relying on Rule 506 to provide more information on the use of offering
proceeds. Issuers will be required to indicate what part of the proceeds is being used to
pay for offering expenses, asset acquisition, working capital, business acquisition or
repayment of existing debts. For non-fund issuers, this information would help us
evaluate whether and how Rule 506 enhances capital formation that would be used for
new investments, consistent with the intent of the JOBS Act, as compared to refinancing
and capital restructuring. However, the additional information may reveal previously
non-public information about issuer plans that could put the issuer at a competitive
disadvantage. Moreover, an issuer may not be certain as to the ultimate use of proceeds
or may alter its intended use as time passes and market conditions change. In these cases,
the Form D information may not accurately reflect issuer plans or the issuer may be
required to file an amended Form D.
g.

Issuer Website

The proposed amendment to Item 2 (Principal Place of Business and Contact
Information) would require all Regulation D issuers to provide their publicly accessible
business website, if they have one. Websites for operating businesses have become
ubiquitous and are part of their contact information, and in some instances, businesses

144

could be operating only via the Internet and may not have a physical location. When
available, this information would be a useful component of issuer identification and
would not be burdensome to provide.
h.

Types of General Solicitation Used

The proposed amendments to Form D would include adding a requirement for
issuers to provide information on the types of general solicitation used in Rule 506(c)
offerings. The options would include oral communications, written communications,
such as mass mailings and emails, websites or television and the web link to the
advertising if the advertising is presented on a website. Having this information would
help the Commission perform reviews of the Rule 506 market to better understand how
the different methods of solicitation correspond to issuer behavior, including potentially
fraudulent activity, identified through the Commission’s Rule 506 review program.
i.

Verification Methods

The proposed amendments to Form D would include adding requirements for
issuers to provide information about how the investors in the offerings qualified as
accredited investors, such as a natural person on the basis of income or net worth, as well
as information on the types of methods used for verifying the accredited investor status of
purchasers. This information would help us assess the nature of the verification methods
used and how issuers are complying with the requirement to take reasonable steps to
verify the accredited investor status of purchasers in Rule 506(c) offerings. The
Commission may be able to use this information to analyze whether there are correlations
between certain verification methods and the incidence of fraud in the private offering
market. Similarly, information about verification practices learned through the

145

Commission’s Rule 506 review program could be applied to subsequent Commission
reviews of any practices, or combinations of practices and other offering characteristics,
associated with the increased likelihood of fraudulent activity.
4.

Proposed Amendment to Rule 507

The proposed amendment to Rule 507 would disqualify an issuer from using
Rule 506 for future offerings if the issuer, or its predecessors or affiliates, had conducted
an offering under Rule 506 in which, within the last five years, it or they did not comply
with the Form D filing requirements of Rule 503 in Rule 506 offerings. Disqualification
would extend for a period of one year after the filing of all required Forms D and Form D
amendments have been made. This provision should increase the incentive for issuers to
submit timely filings of Form D.
As described above, we could not locate Form D filings for approximately 10% of
Regulation D offerings where broker-dealers or registered investment advisers were
involved. 226 Although we cannot estimate the rate of compliance among the issuers of
the remaining 89% of Rule 506 offerings that do not use a registered investment adviser
or broker-dealer, it may be reasonable to assume that they are no more likely to file a
Form D, particularly to the extent that they undertake an offering without the assistance
of a regulated entity. This evidence suggests that many private issuers are failing to file a
Form D even though this is a requirement under Regulation D. By disqualifying an
issuer from relying on the Rule 506 exemption for one year for future offerings when the
issuer, or any predecessor or affiliate of the issuer, did not comply, within the last five

226
This evidence was based on 11 years of Form ADV filings by registered investment advisers, and three
months of data at the beginning of 2012 for broker-dealers filing offering documents with FINRA.

146

years, with Form D filing requirements in a Rule 506 offering, the Commission intends to
increase the incentive for issuers to comply with the Form D filing requirements.
Greater compliance with Form D filing requirements would provide a more
complete picture of the Regulation D market. It would enhance the Commission’s ability
to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the private offering market and the impact of
the elimination of the prohibition against general solicitation. As the Commission
obtains more comprehensive data on Regulation D offerings, it would be able to better
evaluate activity in Rule 506(b) and Rule 506(c) markets and undertake regulatory action
in a more informed manner. In particular, to the extent that certain issuer and offering
characteristics collected through Form D are associated with illegal market practices,
regulators would be in a better position to focus monitoring efforts on offerings that
present heightened investor protection concerns.
A better-informed view of capital-raising in the Rule 506 market could help the
Commission engage in targeted regulatory responses to the potential for fraudulent
activity in the Rule 506 market. To the extent that these regulatory responses decrease
fraudulent activity, they could promote investor protection and investor interests
potentially leading to higher participation by eligible investors, especially natural persons
who are accredited investors, and to greater capital-raising opportunities.
While the proposed disqualification provision is designed to encourage a higher
rate of compliance with the Form D filing requirements, it would make failure to file
costly to Rule 506 issuers if they or their successors and affiliates cannot rely on Rule
506 in a timely manner for future offerings and they would otherwise do so. The loss of

147

access to Rule 506 offerings could impair their competitiveness if they are unable to
secure alternative sources of capital at the same cost.
For those issuers that submit their Form D filings in a timely manner, the potential
for disqualification under proposed Rule 507 would pose little additional risk, such as
from an accidental failure to file a Form D or the late filing of a Form D that was not
identified and corrected during the cure period. Those issuers that, in the past, have
chosen not to file a Form D or filed it late may have a stronger incentive to file (i.e., the
risk of losing the ability to conduct a Rule 506 offerings in the future may outweigh the
cost of giving their competitors better access to certain capital-raising information). To
the extent that these issuers otherwise engage in legitimate capital raising activities, the
cost of conditioning the future use of Rule 506 on Form D filings could be
disproportionate to the benefit of having a public notice of their offering.
We are not proposing to disqualify an issuer from reliance on Rule 506 in its
current offering for failure to file a Form D for such offering; an issuer that does not
comply with the filing requirements will therefore not be subject to immediate costs, such
as the loss of an offering exemption and potential rescission rights of investors.
Disqualification for future offerings only would provide a less severe consequence for
inadvertent missed filings and late filings, and would limit the potential costs to more
active issuers of securities in private markets. In this regard, repeat issuers in Rule 506
offerings would be more affected by the disqualification provision but would be more
likely to understand the Rule 503 filing requirements.
The inclusion of a cure period and providing the disqualification to be lifted for
one-year after the required Form D filings have been made or by virtue of a waiver by the

148

Commission, would help moderate issuers’ costs of non-compliance in Form D filings.
At the same time, making issuers that repeatedly fail to file Form D ineligible for a cure
period will provide a strong incentive for timely compliance with the filing requirements.
This would increase the cost associated with non-compliance, although issuers that have
been disqualified from future use of Rule 506 would retain the option of applying for a
waiver. We believe that disqualifying an issuer from relying on Rule 506 for one year
may be a sufficient incentive for achieving higher filing compliance, and is not so severe
that it would deter issuers from using Rule 506 for their capital-raising activity.
D.

Analysis of the Proposed Rule and Rule Amendments Relating to
General Solicitation Materials

We are proposing a new rule under Regulation D and an amendment to a
Securities Act rule in connection with an issuer’s ability to engage in general solicitation
in Rule 506(c) offerings.
1.

Mandated Legends and Other Disclosures for Written
Solicitation Materials

We are proposing new Rule 509 of Regulation D to require issuers to include
legends in all written general solicitation materials used in a Rule 506(c) offering and to
require private funds to include an additional legend and other disclosures where the
written general solicitation materials include performance data. Specifically, issuers
would be required to include:
•

Eligibility legends that advise investors that securities offered under Rule
506(c) may be purchased only by accredited investors.

•

Risk legends that advise investors of the following: the securities are being
offered in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements of the

149

Securities Act and are not required to comply with specific disclosure
requirements under the Securities Act; the Commission has not passed upon
the merits of or given its approval to the securities, the terms of the offering,
or the accuracy or completeness of any offering materials; the securities are
subject to legal restrictions on transfer and resale and investors should not
assume they will be able to resell their securities; and investing in securities
involves risk and purchasers should be able to bear the loss of the entire
investment. Private funds would be required to include a legend informing
investors that the funds are not subject to the protections of the Investment
Company Act.
•

Performance disclosures in the case of private funds informing investors that
the performance data represents past performance, that past performance is
not indicative of future results, that the current performance may be lower or
higher than the performance presented, that performance data is not calculated
on a standardized basis as is required for registered funds, and that the
performance of the private fund may not be directly comparable to the
performance of other funds. Private funds also would be required to include
only performance data as of the most recent practicable date and to include a
telephone number or website where an investor may obtain current
performance data. Private funds also would be required to disclose the period
for which performance is presented and if performance data does not reflect
the deduction of fees and expenses, private funds would be required to

150

disclose that fees and expenses have not been deducted and that if such fees
and expenses had been deducted, performance may be lower than presented.
The inclusion of mandated legends would better inform potential investors as to
whether they are qualified to purchase in Rule 506(c) offerings. Including risk and
performance legends could make investors more aware of the potential risks associated
with such offerings and, with respect to offerings by private funds, could help investors
avoid confusing private funds with registered funds, which have a different risk and
regulatory profile. Performance disclosures for private funds would also assist potential
investors in assessing performance claims that may be included in the general solicitation
materials. These legends would alert potential investors to certain investment risks.
Even though only accredited investors are allowed to purchase in Rule 506(c)
offerings, advertising and other activities by issuers and intermediaries could induce nonaccredited investors to believe that they are eligible to participate in these investment
opportunities. Legends notifying them that only accredited investors are eligible to invest
in these offerings could help alert non-accredited investors as to their ineligibility to
participate.
We anticipate that the cost of including such legends in sales materials would be
minimal for issuers. In some instances, the legends may be of limited benefit to investors
because legends do not address whether the offering is fraudulent. It is possible that
some unsuspecting accredited investors might erroneously believe that the inclusion of
legends validates all of the information and risks regarding the offering. Further, it is
possible that because these legends may contain standardized language, investors might
discount the relevance of these legends.

151

Requiring additional disclosures for private funds, similar to those required by
Rule 482 under the Securities Act for registered investment companies, would increase
the likelihood that the performance data that is reported in the written general solicitation
material is timely and would provide additional information and context about the
performance presented. Because there are no standardized performance reporting
requirements for private funds, such disclosure would address some concerns about
investors being misled or confused in interpreting the performance information and may
decrease the likelihood of misleading or exaggerated performance information being
presented in private fund written general solicitation materials. While flexibility in
reporting performance data may be appropriate for private funds that have a varied scope
of investment strategies, performance calculation methodologies that are nonstandardized or complicated limit how much investors can appropriately glean from the
data advertised in the written material. The purpose for requiring these additional
disclosures is to provide context so investors can better understand fund performance
information.
The proposed requirement for private funds to include a telephone number or
website where an investor may obtain current performance data could impose costs,
including the cost of establishing a telephone line or establishing a website for this
information. We have attempted to address these costs by providing flexibility to
distribute the information either through a telephone number or a website. We have also
determined to not require that the telephone number be toll-free or collect. We believe
that most private funds (or their advisers) currently maintain either a telephone number or
website, though we recognize that some private funds or their advisers may incur

152

additional costs for staff and technology. The current information that a private fund
would be required to provide would only need to be as of the most recent practicable
date. Because this requirement would not require a private fund to calculate performance
for dates on which the fund would not otherwise be calculating performance, we believe
this will limit the costs incurred by private funds. In addition, updated current
performance would be provided as of the last date on which the private fund determined
the valuation of its portfolio securities. We do not expect a private fund to value its
portfolio solely for the purpose of providing updated current performance under proposed
Rule 509, which would not increase costs.
2.

Proposed Amendments to Rule 156

Rule 156 under the Securities Act is an interpretive rule that provides guidance on
the types of information in investment company sales literature that could be misleading
for purposes of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act
and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. We are proposing
amendments to Rule 156 to apply the guidance contained in the rule to sales literature
used by private funds. The sales literature and other offering materials used by private
funds are already subject to the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act
and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. The proposed amendments to
Rule 156 are intended to provide helpful guidance to private fund issuers in developing
sales literature that is neither fraudulent nor misleading. The proposal may also
encourage private funds to include additional disclosure regarding performance and other
statements or representations about the characteristics of the fund. Funds may incur some
costs in reviewing their sales literature for consistency with the interpretive guidance set

153

forth in Rule 156. We note, however, that private funds should already be reviewing
their sales literature for misleading statements to avoid violating the antifraud provisions
of the federal securities laws. Accordingly, we believe that the amendments to Rule 156
would not impose significant compliance costs on private funds.
3.

Request for Comment on Manner and Content Restrictions for
Private Funds

Commenters have suggested that there be standards or requirements that would
govern the content and/or manner of general solicitations by private funds in Rule 506(c)
offerings. As discussed above, there may be investor protection concerns with respect to
the offering materials used by private funds as these funds are not subject to specific
disclosure requirements in reporting their performance, unlike registered funds. Some
commenters have advocated that, in order to engage in general solicitation, the materials
used by private funds should be held to standards that are analogous to those that are
applicable to the materials used by mutual funds. They have also advocated for
restricting the use of performance data in general solicitation materials by private funds
until the Commission can develop standardized performance calculation and reporting
requirements. We recognize, however, that prescribing performance standards in general
solicitation materials could reduce the flexibility of issuers when methodologies for
calculating performance may vary for legitimate reasons, including investor preferences,
and could be burdensome for issuers, especially if their general solicitation materials are
otherwise not misleading.

154

E.

Analysis of Temporary Rule Relating to Mandatory Submission of
Written General Solicitation Materials

Proposed new Rule 510T in Regulation D would require an issuer conducting a
Rule 506(c) offering to submit to the Commission any written general solicitation
materials prepared by or on behalf of the issuer and used in connection with the Rule
506(c) offering. This requirement would enable the Commission to evaluate the use of
written general solicitation materials. It could also serve as a deterrent against potential
forms of misleading advertising or other fraud because the written general solicitation
materials would be submitted to the Commission and accessible to other securities
regulators. Having access to the written general solicitation material could help
regulators evaluate market practices.
The written general solicitation material would not be treated as filed or furnished
with the Commission and is therefore not subject to the particular liability provisions
under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act for filings. Conditioning the future
availability of Rule 506 on not being subject to any order, judgment or court decree for
failure to comply with proposed Rule 510T would provide incentives for submitting
written general solicitation material. Inclusion of a two-year sunset period for this rule
would provide a finite period of time (and information) for issuers to submit written
general solicitation materials for the Commission’s consideration in assessing general
solicitation in Rule 506(c) offerings and would therefore also limit issuers’ costs of
compliance.
Under the proposed rule, written general solicitation materials would be required
to be submitted no later than the date of first use of such materials. Issuers are required
to submit only written general solicitation materials, so to the extent issuers’ written

155

general solicitation materials do not change, they should not be costly to submit. If the
written general solicitation materials change or are updated during the course of an
offering, however, submission of these materials at multiple times could create an
increased burden for issuers.
F.

Analysis of Potential Impacts on Efficiency, Competition and Capital
Formation

The proposed amendments to the Form D filing requirements would enable the
Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of Regulation D market more systematically
and to more accurately determine the economic impact of eliminating the prohibition
against general solicitation in Rule 506 offerings. A more complete understanding of
how and where capital is being raised in offerings relying on Rule 506(b) or Rule 506(c)
would help the Commission better assess the risk in these markets and evaluate the
effectiveness of the use of general solicitation materials in capital-raising activity.
Appropriate and timely regulatory responses to Rule 506 market developments would
enhance investor protection, and could encourage greater investor participation in the
Rule 506 markets, which would lead to higher aggregate of capital formation. 227
The proposed amendments to the Form D filing requirements would also provide
the Commission, other regulators and investors with more information about market
participants and practices in the private offering market. The increased quantity and
quality of information about private offerings is designed to make it easier for regulators
to identify poor or inappropriate market practices, which may help deter fraudulent

227

See, e.g., Andrei Shleifer and Daniel Wolfenzon, Investor Protection and Equity Markets, 66 Journal of
Financial Economics 3 (2002).

156

activity. A better understood and regulated market would promote investor protection
and contribute to broader participation by accredited investors.
The inclusion of legends and additional disclosures would inform investors about
the differences between Rule 506(c) offerings and registered offerings, allowing for
greater transparency and better understanding of the differences in the underlying risks of
the two types of offerings. This would improve investor decision-making and thereby,
the allocative efficiency of capital in the Rule 506 market. The proposed amendments to
Securities Act Rule 156 may also make private funds and their investment advisers more
aware of potentially misleading statements in their sales literature and written general
solicitation material.
The elimination of the prohibition against general solicitation may enhance the
ability of accredited investors to identify and evaluate investment opportunities in private
funds that would not have previously been available. This could increase the level of
competition between private funds and registered funds and result in a shift in the flow of
invested capital from registered to private funds. The proposed amendments to require
legends and disclosures in written general solicitation materials are intended to limit such
a shift to only those investors that are qualified to participate in Rule 506(c) offerings.
We are not, however, able to quantify the magnitude of such a potential substitution of
investment in private funds and registered funds or the extent to which the proposed
legends will affect that shift.
We recognize the proposed rule and form amendments in this release could
increase the regulatory burden for issuers in the Rule 506(b) and Rule 506(c) markets,
which could drive potential issuers, especially small issuers, to the Rule 504 and Rule

157

505 markets. Some issuers may even find accessing public markets more attractive.
However, with the availability of general solicitation in Rule 506(c) offerings, the
benefits of using Rule 506(c) are still likely to justify the higher costs of complying with
the proposed rule and form amendments.
X.

SMALL BUSINESS REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT FAIRNESS ACT
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996

(“SBREFA”), 228 the Commission must advise the OMB as to whether a proposed
regulation constitutes a “major” rule. Under SBREFA, a rule is considered “major”
where, if adopted, it results or is likely to result in:
•

an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more (either in the form
of an increase or a decrease);

•

a major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or

•

significant adverse effects on competition, investment or innovation.

If a rule is “major,” its effectiveness will generally be delayed for 60 days pending
Congressional review.
We request comment on whether our proposed amendments would be a “major
rule” for purposes of SBREFA. We solicit comment and empirical data on:
•

the potential effect on the U.S. economy on an annual basis;

•

any potential increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries;
and

•

228

any potential effect on competition, investment or innovation.

Pub. L. No. 104-121, Tit. II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996).

158

We request those submitting comments to provide empirical data and other factual
support for their views to the extent possible.
XI.

INITIAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS
The Commission has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in

accordance with Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 229 This Initial Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis relates to the amendments to Regulation D and Form D and Rule 156
that we are proposing in this release.
A.

Reasons for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Action

The primary reason for, and objective of, the proposed amendments to Form D
and the proposed amendments to Regulation D relating to Form D is to improve the
Form D data collection process with respect to offerings under Rule 506 of Regulation D
and, in particular, to assist our efforts to assess the use of general solicitation in
Rule 506(c) offerings. We believe these amendments, in general, would improve our
Form D data collection efforts by providing a greater incentive for issuers to file Form D
and by amending the information requirements of Form D to require additional
information on Rule 506 offerings. Proposed Rule 509, which would require issuers to
include certain legends and other disclosures in written general solicitation materials used
in Rule 506(c) offerings, is intended to address investor protection concerns arising from
the ability of issuers to engage in general solicitation in these offerings. Proposed Rule
510T, which would require issuers to submit to the Commission any written general
solicitation materials used in Rule 506(c) offerings, is intended to facilitate the
Commission’s understanding of the market practices relating to how issuers solicit
229

See 5 U.S.C. 603.

159

potential purchasers through written general solicitation materials for their Rule 506(c)
offerings. The proposed amendments to Rule 156 are intended to provide helpful
antifraud guidance to those preparing sales literature for private funds.
We are proposing the amendments to Regulation D and Form D under the
authority in Sections 4(a)(2), 19(a) and 28 of the Securities Act, 230 as amended, and
Section 201(a) of the JOBS Act. 231 We are proposing the amendments to Rule 156 under
the authority in Section 19(a) of the Securities Act 232 and Sections 10(b) and 23(a) of the
Exchange Act. 233
B.

Small Entities Subject to the Proposed Rule and Form Amendments

For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, under our rules, an issuer, other
than an investment company, is a “small business” or “small organization” if it has total
assets of $5 million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal year and is engaged or
proposing to engage in an offering of securities which does not exceed $5 million. 234 For
purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, an investment company is a small entity if it,
together with other investment companies in the same group of related investment
companies, has net assets of $50 million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal
year. 235
The proposed amendments would apply to all issuers that conduct offerings under
Rule 506 and would affect small issuers (including both operating businesses and pooled
230

15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(2), 77s(a), and 77z-3.

160

investment funds that raise capital under Rule 506) relying on this exemption from
Securities Act registration. All issuers that sell securities in reliance on Rule 506 are
required to file a Form D with the Commission reporting the transaction. For the year
ended December 31, 2012, 16,067 issuers made 18,187 new Form D filings, of which
15,208 issuers relied on the Rule 506 exemption. Based on information reported by
issuers on Form D, there were 3,958 small issuers 236 relying on the Rule 506 exemption in
2012. This number likely underestimates the actual number of small issuers relying on
the Rule 506 exemption, however, because over 50% of issuers declined to report their
size. The proposed amendments to Rule 156 would apply to all private funds.
C.

Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance
Requirements

The proposed amendments to Regulation D and Form D would impose certain
reporting and compliance requirements on issuers that conduct Rule 506 offerings. The
proposed amendment to disqualify an issuer from relying on the Rule 506 exemption if
the issuer, or any predecessor or affiliate of the issuer, did not comply, within the last five
years, with Form D filing requirements in a Rule 506 offering would not add a new
reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirement because the filing of Form D is
currently a requirement of Regulation D. The proposed amendments to Regulation D to
require an Advance Form D filing for Rule 506(c) offerings, a closing Form D
amendment for Rule 506 offerings, temporary submission of written general solicitation
materials used in Rule 506(c) offerings, prescribed legends and disclosure in written
general solicitation materials used in Rule 506(c) offerings, as well as the proposed
236

Of this number, 3,627 of these issuers are not investment companies, and 331 are investment
companies. We also note that issuers that are not investment companies disclose only revenues on Form D,
and not total assets. Hence, we use the amount of revenues as a measure of issuer size.

161

amendments to Form D to require additional information, would, however, impose
additional reporting and compliance requirements on issuers that conduct offerings under
Rule 506 and, to a much lesser extent, offerings under Rule 504, Rule 505 and Section
4(a)(5). We expect that small entities would incur additional initial and ongoing costs
related to complying with these requirements. Initial costs include those associated with
preparing the first Form D filing that includes the required additional information in
Form D, preparing legends and disclosures to be included in written general solicitation
materials for Rule 506(c) offerings and submitting such materials to the Commission
prior to the date of first use. Ongoing costs include the additional costs arising from
providing this additional information in each subsequent filing of a Form D or Form D
amendment when required, including the prescribed legends in written general
solicitation materials, submitting updated or new written general solicitation materials to
the Commission and submitting Advance Form D filings for Rule 506(c) offerings and
closing amendments to Form D for Rule 506 offerings. The proposed amendments to
Rule 156 may cause small entities to incur some costs in reviewing their sales literature
for consistency with the interpretative guidance set forth in Rule 156, but we do not
expect these costs to be significant.
D.

Duplicative, Overlapping or Conflicting Federal Rules

The Commission believes that the proposed amendments would not duplicate,
overlap or conflict with other federal rules.
E.

Significant Alternatives

The Regulatory Flexibility Act directs us to consider significant alternatives that
would accomplish the stated objectives of our amendments, while minimizing any

162

significant adverse impact on small entities. In connection with the proposed
amendments, we considered several alternatives, including the following:
•

establishing different compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that
take into account the resources available to small entities;

•

further clarifying, consolidating or simplifying the proposed requirements;

•

using performance rather than design standards; and

•

providing an exemption from the proposed requirements, or any part of them,
for small entities.

The Commission is not proposing the establishment of different compliance or reporting
requirements or timetables for the rules, as proposed, for small entities. The Commission
believes that, as to small entities, differing compliance, reporting or timetable
requirements, a partial or complete exemption from the proposed requirements or the use
of performance rather than design standards would be inappropriate because these
approaches would detract from the completeness and uniformity of the Form D dataset
and, as a result, reduce the expected benefits of more consistent submission of Rule 506
information and improved collection of data for Commission enforcement and
rulemaking efforts. We believe that the proposed amendments to Rule 156 should apply
to all private funds, regardless of size. The Commission solicits comment, however, on
whether differing compliance, reporting or timetable requirements, a partial or complete
exemption, or the use of performance rather than design standards would be consistent
with the main goal of improving the Form D data collection process with respect to Rule
506 offerings.

163

F.

General Request for Comment

The Commission is soliciting comments regarding this analysis. In particular, the
Commission requests comment regarding:
•

the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed
amendments;

•

the existence or nature of the potential impact of the proposed amendments on
small entities as discussed in this analysis, as well as any effects that have not
been discussed; and

•

how to quantify the impact of the proposed amendments.

The Commission asks those submitting comments to describe the nature of any impact
and to provide empirical data to support the nature and extent of the impact. These
comments will be considered in the preparation of the Final Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis, if the proposed amendments are adopted, and will be placed in the same public
file as comments on the proposed amendments themselves.

issuer if such issuer, or any of its predecessors or affiliates, has been subject to any order,
judgment, or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction temporarily, preliminary or
permanently enjoining such person for failure to comply with § 230.503. No exemption
under § 230.506 shall be available for an issuer if such issuer, any of its predecessors or

Add § 230.509 to read as follows:

§ 230.509 Required legends and other disclosures.
(a) Required legends. An issuer shall include, in a prominent manner, the following
legends in any written communication that constitutes a general solicitation or general
advertising in any offering conducted in reliance on § 230.506(c):
(1) The securities may be sold only to “accredited investors,” which for natural
persons are investors who meet certain minimum annual income or net worth thresholds;
(2) The securities are being offered in reliance on an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and are not required to comply with
specific disclosure requirements that apply to registration under the Securities Act;

170

(3) The Commission has not passed upon the merits of or given its approval to
the securities, the terms of the offering, or the accuracy or completeness of any offering
materials;
(4) The securities are subject to legal restrictions on transfer and resale and
investors should not assume they will be able to resell their securities; and
(5) Investing in securities involves risk, and investors should be able to bear the
loss of their investment.
(b) Additional legend for private funds. If the issuer is a private fund, the issuer shall
include, in a prominent manner, in any written communication that constitutes a general
solicitation or general advertising in any offering conducted in reliance on this
§ 230.506(c), a legend disclosing that the securities offered are not subject to the
protections of the Investment Company Act.
(c) Required disclosure for performance data of private funds. If the issuer is a private
fund and includes performance data in any written communication that constitutes a
general solicitation or general advertising in any offering conducted in reliance on this
§ 230.506(c):
(1) The private fund shall include in such written communication a legend
disclosing that the performance data represents past performance; that past
performance does not guarantee future results; that current performance may be
lower or higher than the performance data presented; that the private fund is not
required by law to follow any standard methodology when calculating and
representing performance data; and that the performance of the private fund may
not be directly comparable to the performance of other funds. The legend should

171

also identify either a telephone number or a website where an investor may obtain
current performance data.
(2) All performance data must be as of the most recent practicable date
considering the type of private fund and the media through which the data will be
conveyed, and the private fund must disclose the period for which performance is
presented.
(3) If the performance presentation does not include the deduction of fees
and expenses, the private fund must disclose that the presentation does not reflect
the deduction of fees and expenses and that if such fees and expenses had been
deducted, performance may be lower than presented.

Note to § 230.509: A private fund is an issuer that would be an investment company, as
defined in section 3 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-3), but for
section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) (15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(1) or 80a-3(c)(7)) of that Act. If
applicable, a private fund may modify the required legend to reflect any higher minimum
requirements to purchase in the offering, such as for qualified clients, as defined in §
275.205-3(d)(1) of this chapter, and qualified purchasers, as defined in section 2(a)(51) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(51)) and the rules thereunder.

When to file:

o

For offerings under Rule 504, Rule 505 and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D and Section

4(a)(5) of the Securities Act, an issuer must file a new notice with the SEC for each new
offering of securities no later than 15 calendar days after the “date of first sale” of
securities in the offering as explained in the Instruction to Item 7. For this purpose, the

178

date of first sale is the date on which the first investor is irrevocably contractually
committed to invest, which, depending on the terms and conditions of the contract, could
be the date on which the issuer receives the investor’s subscription agreement or check.
An issuer may file the notice at any time before that if it has determined to make the
offering. An issuer must file a new notice with each state that requires it at the time set
by the state. For state filing information, go to www.NASAA.org. A mandatory capital
commitment call does not constitute a new offering, but is made under the original
offering, so no new Form D filing is required.
o

When an issuer intends to offer or sell securities under Rule 506(c) of Regulation D

and has not previously filed a Form D for the offering, the issuer must file a new notice
with the SEC for each new offering of securities no later than 15 calendar days prior to
the first use of general solicitation or general advertising for the offering. The advance
Form D is required to include the following information for such offering: the issuer’s
identity (Item 1), principal place of business and contact information (Item 2), related
persons (Item 3), industry group (Item 4), federal exemptions and exclusions claimed
(Item 6), type of filing (Item 7), type(s) of securities offered (Item 9), business
combination transaction (Item 10), sales compensation (Item 12), and use of proceeds
(Item 16). The information under Item 9 and Item 12 is required only to the extent that
the information is known at the time of the filing of the advance Form D.
*
o

*

*

*

*

An issuer must file an amendment to a previously filed notice for an offering:

179

- to provide the information required by Form D for each new offering of securities in
reliance on Rule 506(c) no later than 15 calendar days after the first sale of securities in
the offering;
- to correct a material mistake of fact or error in the previously filed notice, as soon as
practicable after discovery of the mistake or error;
- to reflect a change in the information provided in the previously filed notice, except as
provided below, as soon as practicable after the change;
- annually, on or before the first anniversary of the most recent previously filed notice, if
the offering is continuing at that time; and
- not later than 30 calendar days after termination of an offering conducted in reliance on
Rule 506, unless a previously filed Form D amendment for such issuer with respect to the
same offering includes the information that would have been disclosed in the amendment
following termination of such offering and such previously filed amendment indicates
that it is the closing amendment to the Form D for the offering.

*

*

*

*

Each executive officer and director of the issuer and person performing similar

180

managing partners of partnerships and managing members of limited liability companies;
and
•

Each person who has functioned directly or indirectly as a promoter of the issuer

within the past five years of first sale of securities or the date upon which the Form D
filing was required to be made, whichever date is later.
•

For offerings conducted in reliance on Rule 506(c) only, each person who directly or

indirectly controls the issuer.
If necessary to prevent the information supplied from being misleading, also provide a
clarification in the space provided.

If Other, provide a brief description of the issuer’s industry group in the space provided.
Item 5. Issuer Size.
•

Revenue Range (for issuers that do not specify “Hedge Fund” or “Other Investment

Fund” in response to Item 4): Enter the revenue range of the issuer or of all the issuers
together for the most recently completed fiscal year available, or, if not in existence for a
fiscal year, revenue range to date. Domestic SEC reporting companies should state
revenues in accordance with Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Domestic non-reporting companies should state revenues in accordance with U.S.
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Foreign issuers should calculate
revenues in U.S. dollars and state them in accordance with U.S. GAAP, home country
GAAP or International Financial Reporting Standards. If the issuer(s) has not otherwise

181

made information about its revenues publicly available (for example, in general
solicitation materials for an offering conducted in reliance on Rule 506(c)) and otherwise
uses reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of such information, enter “Not
Available to Public.” If the issuer’s(s’) business is intended to produce revenue but did
not, enter “No Revenues.” If the business is not intended to produce revenue (for
example, the business seeks asset appreciation only), enter “Not Applicable.”
•

Aggregate Net Asset Value (for issuers that specify “Hedge Fund” or “Other

Investment Fund” in response to Item 4): Enter the aggregate net asset value range of the
issuer or of all the issuers together as of the most recent practicable date. If the issuer(s)
has not otherwise made information about its net asset value publicly available (for
example, in general solicitation materials for an offering conducted in reliance on Rule
506(c)) and otherwise uses reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of such
information, enter “Not Available to Public.”
*

*

*

*

*

Item 7. Type of Filing. Indicate whether the issuer is filing a new notice, an advance
notice for an offering in reliance on Rule 506(c), an amendment to a notice that was filed
previously, or a closing amendment for an offering in reliance on Rule 506. If this is a
new notice, enter the date of the first sale of securities in the offering or indicate that the
first sale has “Yet to Occur.” For this purpose, the date of first sale is the date on which
the first investor is irrevocably contractually committed to invest, which, depending on
the terms and conditions of the contract, could be the date on which the issuer receives
the investor’s subscription agreement or check.
*

*

*

182

offered as to which this notice is filed. State the trading symbol and general available
security identifier, such as a CUSIP number or an International Securities Identification

into other securities, however, select “Debt” and any other appropriate types of securities
except for “Equity.” For purposes of this filing, use the ordinary dictionary and
commonly understood meanings of these categories. For instance, equity securities
would be securities that represent proportional ownership in an issuer, such as ordinary
common and preferred stock of corporations and partnership and limited liability
company interests; debt securities would be securities representing money loaned to an
issuer that must be repaid to the investor at a later date; pooled investment fund interests
would be securities that represent ownership interests in a pooled or collective investment
vehicle; tenant-in-common securities would be securities that include an undivided
fractional interest in real property other than a mineral property; and mineral property

mineral property.

offering. In addition, regardless of whether securities in the offering have been or may be
sold to persons who do not qualify as accredited investors, specify the total number of

183

investors who already have invested. For an offering conducted in reliance on Rule 506,
state the number of natural persons who are accredited investors and non-accredited
investors and purchased securities in the offering, the number of legal entities that are
accredited investors and non-accredited investors and purchased securities in the offering,

with, or reporting as an exempt reporting adviser to, the Commission.

general advertising used or to be used in the offering. If public website(s) or webcast(s)
