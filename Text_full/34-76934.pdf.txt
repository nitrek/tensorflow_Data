In the Matter of
DEAN ZENON PINARD

ORDER VACATING MUNICIPAL ADVISOR BAR
Dean Zenon Pinard seeks to vacate an administrative bar order dated December 8, 2011
(“bar order”) to the extent that it bars him from association with any municipal advisor.1 The
municipal advisor bar imposed on Dean Zenon Pinard was based solely on conduct occurring
prior to July 22, 2010, the effective date of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act.2 Accordingly, in our discretion, we vacate the bar order to the extent that it
prohibits Dean Zenon Pinard from associating with any municipal advisor, but otherwise leave
the bar unchanged.
By the Commission.

Secretary
