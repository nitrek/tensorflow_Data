BOARDROOM DIVERSITY

8

Why Diversity Matters

A board’s performance relies on its understanding of the
company and its operating environment. In today’s
business landscape, the board cannot properly fulfill this
responsibility without having directors who reflect the
composition of its stakeholders, particularly its
employees and customers.

Current State of Board Diversity in the U.S.
Findings from 2015 Spencer Stuart U.S. Board Index
Results are representative of S&P 500 companies

African-American
• 8.6% of directors were African-American in 2015, down slightly from 9.6% in 2010
• 75% of boards had at least one African-American director in 2015, compared with 82% of
boards in 2010

Hispanic/Latino
• 4.8% of directors were Hispanic/Latino in 2015, up slightly from 4.2% in 2010
• 47% of boards had at least one Hispanic/Latino director in 2015, compared with 44% of
boards in 2010

Asian Descent

boards in 2010

Current State of Diversity in the U.S.

• Women make up about 20% of all directors.
• Nearly 75% of boards have at least two women directors.

State of Board Diversity in the U.S.
• U.S. lags behind many countries in % of women on boards:
– Norway:

40.1%

– Sweden:

33.7%

– France:

33.5%

– U.K:

26.0%

– Italy:

25.8%

– AUS:

20.4%

– U.S:

19.8%

– Companies lacking in board diversity tend to suffer more governance-related
controversies than average. (MSCI Women on Boards Report 2015)

Current Practice in the U.S.
Findings from NACD Blue Ribbon Commissions (BRCs)
• While directors and stakeholders agree on
the importance of increasing boardroom
diversity, progress—particularly in the
United States—has been relatively slow
(2016 BRC).
• The sluggish transition to more diverse
boards has been antithetical to the pace of
business, technology, and human progress
in general (2012 BRC).

13

Current Practice in the U.S.
New Findings from NACD 2016-2017 Public Company Survey
• Boards largely rely on expanding their search criteria for new candidates in
diversifying their composition
• Very few boards are adjusting tenure-limiting mechanisms or adopting formal
quota to promote diversity.

14

Current Practice in the U.S.
Findings from NACD 2015-2016 Public Company Survey
• Boards of larger companies are far more likely than those of smaller companies to
discuss the diversity of their members.
• Half of the small-cap respondents say their boards did not discuss gender
diversity in the past year, and most did not discuss racial/ethnic or age diversity.

15

Global Snapshot: Australia
Diversity on Boards Campaign, 2010-2015
• Change brought about in a non-quota market
• Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)
– Called on boards to establish, measure, and annually report their diversity
policies
– Enlisted KPMG to produce annual gender diversity compliance report

• Male Champions of Change—coalition of high-profile business
men committed to increasing gender diversity and sharing
leading practices

16

Global Snapshot: United Kingdom
Diversity Campaign, 2011-2015
• Change brought about without a quota
• The Lord Davies Review—a government-backed commission examining
underrepresentation of women on boards—set targets:
–
–
–
–

FTSE-100 target of 25% by 2015; now 25% target for FTSE 350
Peer pressure – name and shame
Executive Search Firms ‐ Enhanced Voluntary Code of Conduct
Disclosure Rule – comply or explain

• Voluntary framework, led by business
– CBI—a not-for-profit, non-political membership association—pushed for change
– Group of UK board chairs and CEOs launched in 2010 set measurable goal for
companies in the FTSE-100
– Institutional investors pressured big businesses
– Board turnover (UK directors work under the assumption directors are no longer
independent of management after 9 years)

Global Snapshot: The Results

18

Barriers to Boardroom Diversity
Findings from NACD Blue Ribbon Commissions (2012 BRC)
Structural Factors
• Absence of tenure-limiting mechanisms, such as term limits.
– Solution: Preserve, enhance, or consider adding mechanisms to
increase director turnover.

• Small board sizes.
– Solution: Consider expanding the board’s size.

• Inadequate use of evaluations as a tool for board turnover.
– Solution: Give evaluations traction.

• Inadequate use of executive talent management to develop
directors from within.
– Solution: Enhance executive talent management programs in order to
expand the pool of diverse directors.

19

Barriers to Boardroom Diversity
Findings from NACD Blue Ribbon Commissions (2012 BRC)
Social Factors
• Little knowledge of where to find candidates.
– Solution: Expand horizons when seeking candidates.

• Overboarding of certain “star” board members.
– Solution: Move beyond the “star” diverse board members.

• Reluctance of sitting directors to leave a board.
– Solution: Adhere to term-limiting mechanisms to build turnover
acceptance.

• Consolidating diversity into one category and related
stereotyping.
– Solution: Do not “check the box.”

20

Barriers to Boardroom Diversity
Findings from NACD Blue Ribbon Commissions (2012 BRC)
Habitual Factors
• Failure to put diversity on the board’s agenda as a discussion
topic.
– Solution: Place diversity on the board’s agenda as a topic for
discussion and education.

• Tendency to seek only CEOs and experienced public company
directors for board seats.
– Solution: Move beyond CEOs in seeking to fill board seats.

• Existing lack of diversity on the nominating/governance
committee.
– Solution: Diversify nominating and governance committee
composition.

21

Goals and Leading Practices: Define Diversity
Findings from NACD Blue Ribbon Commissions (BRCs)
• A comprehensive definition must include
both identity—gender, race, ethnicity—and
skills, such as professional experience.
Given the nature of today’s business world,
neither aspect can be excluded (2012 BRC).
• Consideration of a candidate’s identity
diversity has to coincide with a
determination that the individual possesses
skills and experiences desirable by the
board (2012 BRC).
22

NACD’s Recommendations for Boards
From the Report of the NACD Blue Ribbon Commission on Diversity: Moving
From Interest to Action

1. DISCUSS
• Candid, in-depth board discussions about critical topics like diversity are at
the core of board contribution to any enterprise.
2. SELECT AND IMPLEMENT SOLUTIONS
• At minimum, review and evaluate board composition, expand horizons for
recruiting candidates, and improve director evaluations.
3. DISCLOSE
• Consider going beyond required disclosures and provide shareholders with a
thorough explanation of their director search process and the potential value
it brings to the company.

23

Government Initiatives for Board Gender Parity
• May 2014: Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) requested a GAO report
on the boardroom gender gap. The report was released in
December 2015 and indicated it could take 40 years to reach
gender parity in the boardroom.
• March 31, 2015: Nine public pension funds (including OPERS,
CalPERS, NYS-CRF) petitioned the SEC to require disclosure of
each director nominee’s gender, race, and ethnicity in a matrix or
chart.
• March 2, 2016: Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Maxine Waters (D-CA),
and other Democrats sent a letter to SEC Chair Mary Jo White
urging a speedier review of the diversity disclosure proposal by
the public pension funds.
• State Initiatives: Illinois, Massachusetts, and California have
passed resolutions urging for more women on boards.

24

Investor Initiatives for Board Gender Parity
• The Thirty Percent Coalition is an organization of executives,
institutional investors, corporate governance experts, and board
members that has the goal of 30 percent female representation on
public company boards.
– Work with companies on their recruitment strategies for women
– Push for increased SEC diversity disclosure
– Advocate for diversity through their members both publicly and privately

• Impact-investment funds are being created to generate social
change as well as financial returns. State Street Global Advisors
created an index (SHE) to invest in companies with high levels of
diversity.
– Received a $250 million investment from CalSTRS
– Aims to accumulate $1.5 to $2 billion in one year

25

CONCLUSION
• It will take a concerted effort from all vested parties to influence
change. Most importantly, it will take strong leadership and the
creation of a new organizational culture that will level the playing
field for access and inclusion.

• “The law can push open doors and tear down walls, but it will not
build bridges. That job belongs to you and me.”
