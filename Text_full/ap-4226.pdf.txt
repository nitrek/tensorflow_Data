ORDER POSTPONING
HEARING AND SCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on September 23, 2016,
alleging that Respondent has securities registered with the Commission, is delinquent in its
periodic filings, and has made materially false and misleading statements in reports filed with the
Commission. A hearing is scheduled for October 11, 2016.
To allow time for the Division of Enforcement to establish service of the OIP on
Respondent, I POSTPONE the hearing and ORDER a telephonic prehearing conference at 10:00
a.m. EDT on Thursday, October 13, 2016. Also by that date, the Division is directed to file a
declaration of service regarding whether Respondent was served with the OIP in accordance with
17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii). I note that if Respondent fails to timely file an answer, appear at
the prehearing conference, or otherwise defend the proceeding, it will be deemed in default, the
proceeding will be determined against it, and the registration of its securities will be revoked.
See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f).
