Recommendations about Expanding Simplified Disclosure for Smaller Issuers

AFTER CONSIDERING THAT:
1. 	 Small businesses have historically played a significant role as drivers of economic activity,
innovation and job creation in the United States.
2. 	 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) has provided for simplified
disclosure and reporting for smaller issuers for over 30 years. Under current Commission
rules, "smaller reporting companies" are companies that, among other things, have a public
float of less than $75 million in common equity, or, if unable to calculate the public float,
companies with less than $50 million in annual revenues. Similarly, a company is considered
a "non-accelerated filer" if it has a public float ofless than $7 5 million as of the last day of
the most recently completed second fiscal quarter.
3. 	 The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act), enacted on AprilS, 2012, created a
new category of company called an "emerging growth company," to which certain scaled
disclosure and other requirements apply at the time of the company's initial public offering
for up to five years. An emerging growth company is defined as a company with total annual
gross revenues of less than $1 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year.
4. 	 Emerging growth companies are provided with a number of accommodations with respect to
disclosure requirements that would also be beneficial for smaller reporting companies, as
these requirements place a disproportionate burden on smaller reporting companies in terms
of cost of, and time spent on, compliance.

THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS THAT:
1. 	 The Commission revise the definition of "smaller reporting company" to include companies
with a public float of up to $250 million. This will afford the following accommodations to a
broader range of smaller public companies:
a. 	 exemption from pay ratio rule;
b. 	 exemption from auditor attestation requirement; and
c. 	 exemption from providing a Compensation Discussion & Analysis.
2. 	 The Commission revise its rules to provide smaller reporting companies with the same
disclosure accommodations that are available to emerging growth companies. These include:
a. 	 exemption from the requirement to conduct shareholder advisory votes on
executive compensation and on the frequency of such votes;

b. 	 exemption from rules requiring mandatory audit firm rotation;
c. 	 exemption from pay versus performance disclosure; and
d. 	 allowing compliance with new accounting standards on the date that private
companies are required to comply.
3. 	 The Commission revise the definition of "accelerated filer" to include companies with a
public float of $250 million or more, but less than $700 million. As a result of such revision,
the requirement to provide an auditor attestation report under Section 404(b) of the SarbanesÂ­
Oxley Act would no longer apply to companies with public float between $75 million and
$250 million.
4. 	 The Commission exempt smaller reporting companies from XBRL tagging.
5. 	 The Commission exempt smaller reporting companies from filing immaterial attachments to
material contracts.
