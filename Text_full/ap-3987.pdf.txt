ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS RULINGS
Release No. 3987/July 14, 2016
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17013

In the Matter of
ORDER
ALLEN M. PERRES, and
WILLARD R. ST. GERMAIN

On June 7, 2016, I issued the initial decision in this proceeding. See Allen M. Perres,
Initial Decision Release No. 1022, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2006. Respondent Allen M. Perres did not
file a motion to correct manifest error of fact within ten days thereafter. See 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.111(h). However, he did request an extension of time within which to file a petition for
review, which the Commission granted. See Allen Perres, Securities Act of 1933 Release No.
10106 (June 27, 2016). His petition for review was due July 13, 2016. See id.
On July 13, 2016, a person purporting to be Perres’ counsel filed a “Reply to Initial
Decision of Administrative Law Judge.” The reply does not explicitly seek review of the initial
decision; instead, it “requests that the ALJ reconsider” the sanctioned imposed by the initial
decision. Reply at 2. In support of that request, the reply takes issue with numerous factual
findings of the initial decision.
Inasmuch as the reply constitutes a motion for reconsideration of the initial decision, I
lack the authority to act upon it. Inasmuch as the reply constitutes a motion to correct manifest
error of fact, it is untimely. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). Inasmuch as the reply constitutes
Perres’ petition for review, that is a matter for the Commission.
SO ORDERED.
