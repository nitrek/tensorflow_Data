ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17359

In the Matter of
ORDER OF FORTHWITH SUSPENSION
PURSUANT TO RULE 102(e)(2) OF THE
COMMISSION’S RULES OF PRACTICE

SAMUEL BRASLAU,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate to issue
an order of forthwith suspension of Samuel Braslau (“Braslau”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice (17 C.F.R. § 200.102(e)(2)).1
II.
The Commission finds that:
1.
Samuel Braslau, 55, at all relevant times was an attorney whose office was
located in Los Angeles, California. In Securities and Exchange Commission v. Samuel Braslau,
Rand J. Chortkoff and Stuart E. Rawitt, Civil Action No. CV 14-01290-ODW (C.D. Cal.), the
district court found that Braslau violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities
Act”) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b5 thereunder. The district court also permanently enjoined Braslau from violating those
provisions. The district court did not find that Braslau’s conduct in committing these violations
was not willful.
1 Rule 102(e)(2) provides, in pertinent part, that “[a]ny attorney who has been suspended or disbarred by a court of
the United States or any State . . . shall be forthwith suspended from appearing or practicing before the
Commission.”

2.
Braslau violated the federal securities laws by orchestrating a fraudulent
investment scheme to raise funds purportedly to produce a Hollywood movie entitled The
Smuggler that was never made. Braslau raised more than $1.7 million from more than 60
investors nationwide through the offer and sale of securities in the form of membership units in
Mutual Entertainment, LLC and Film Shoot, LLC, two companies that he controlled, for the
purported purpose of financing The Smuggler. Investors were recruited through a boiler room
call center and promised high returns on passive investments in The Smuggler. Braslau drafted
the documents used in these solicitations, in which he included statements about the use of the
proceeds that he knew were false. Rather than using the proceeds to make The Smuggler, 69
percent of the proceeds were paid to Braslau and others.
3.
On November 14, 2014, in a criminal action involving the same misconduct
alleged in the Commission’s action against Braslau, US v. Braslau et al, No. 2:14-cr-00044RGK, Braslau was convicted of eleven counts of mail fraud, five counts of wire fraud and one
count of making false statements to the Commission. The mail and wire fraud counts were
felony charges that involved moral turpitude. On April 27, 2015, Braslau was sentenced to 87
months in prison.
4.
On February 6, 2015, based on his criminal conviction, the State Bar Court of
California suspended Braslau from practicing law in California effective February 26, 2015.
III.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that Braslau has been (1) convicted of a
felony involving moral turpitude and (2) disbarred from the practice of law by the State Bar
Court of California, within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of
Practice.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED, that Samuel Braslau is forthwith suspended from
appearing or practicing before the Commission pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s
Rules of Practice.

By the Commission.
