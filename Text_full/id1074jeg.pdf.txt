INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
October 31, 2016

APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

James E. Grimes, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registrations of the registered securities of Respondents.
The revocation is based on Respondents’ failures to timely file required periodic reports with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
INTRODUCTION
On September 22, 2016, the Commission initiated this proceeding under Section 12(j) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with an order instituting proceedings (OIP). The OIP
alleges that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission under Exchange Act
Section 12(g) and have repeatedly failed to file timely periodic reports with the Commission, in
violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and/or 13a-13 thereunder.
Respondents were served with the OIP by September 26, 2016, and their answers were due by
October 11, 2016. Amarillo Mesquite Grill, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4230, 2016
SEC LEXIS 3797 (ALJ Oct. 6, 2016). On October 12, 2016, I noted that Respondents had not
filed answers and ordered them to show cause by October 24, 2016, why the registrations of their
securities should not be revoked by default due to their failures to file answers or otherwise
defend the proceeding. Amarillo Mesquite Grill, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4246,
2016 SEC LEXIS 3849. Respondents did not attend the telephonic prehearing conference held
on October 24, 2016, and to date have not filed answers or responded to the show cause order.

FINDINGS OF FACT
Respondents are in default for failing to file answers, attend the prehearing conference, or
otherwise defend the proceeding. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(1)-(2), .220(f), .221(f).
Accordingly, as authorized by Rule of Practice 155(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a), I find the
following allegations in the OIP to be true.
Amarillo Mesquite Grill, Inc., Central Index Key (CIK) No. 727089, is a forfeited Kansas
corporation located in Wichita, Kansas, with a class of securities registered with the Commission
pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with
the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period
ended October 27, 2002, which reported a net loss of $914,036 for the prior thirty-nine weeks.
Global Opportunity Fund LP, CIK No. 887724, is an Illinois corporation located in
Chicago, Illinois, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange
Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission,
having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-K for the period ended December
31, 2001, which reported a net loss of $91,037 for the prior twelve months.
Healthrenu Medical, Inc., CIK No. 791118, is a permanently revoked Nevada corporation
located in Houston, Texas, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g).
The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-QSB/A for the period
ended June 30, 2006, which reported a net loss of over $7.8 million for the prior nine months.
Hynes & Howes Insurance Counselors, Inc., CIK No. 205462, is an inactive Iowa
corporation located in Davenport, Iowa, with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-K for
the period ended September 30, 2010, which reported a net loss of $159,023 for the prior twelve
months.
In addition to their repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, Respondents failed to
heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance
requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations or, through their failures to maintain
valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not receive
such letters.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require public corporations to
file annual and quarterly reports with the Commission. “Compliance with those requirements is
mandatory and may not be subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice,
Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons.
denied, Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is
not required to establish violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.

See SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250,
1268 (D.D.C. 1978).
Respondents failed to file timely periodic reports. As a result,
Respondents failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
SANCTION
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
the registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an
opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of
the Exchange Act or rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will ensure that investors
are adequately protected, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of
the issuer’s violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability
involved, the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future
compliance, and the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway
Int’l Holdings, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May
31, 2006).
Respondents’ failures to file required periodic reports are serious because the failures
constitute violations of a central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic
reporting is “to supply investors with current and accurate financial information about an issuer
so that they may make sound [investment] decisions.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., 2006 SEC
LEXIS 1288, at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that Congress fashioned
for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the
sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977). Respondents’
violations are also recurrent in that they repeatedly failed to file periodic reports. See Nature’s
Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21,
2009) (respondent failed to file seven required periodic reports due over a two-year period);
Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26 (May
23, 2008) (respondent’s failure to make eight filings over an eighteen-month period considered
recurrent). Respondents are also culpable because they failed to heed delinquency letters sent to
them by the Division of Corporation Finance, even if, through their failures to maintain valid
addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, they did not receive
such letters. See China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3451,
at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that revocation may be warranted even without proof that
a respondent was aware of its reporting obligations). Finally, Respondents have not answered
the OIP, appeared at the prehearing conference, responded to the show cause order, or otherwise
participated in the proceeding to address whether they have made any efforts to remedy their past
violations. They have also made no assurances against further violations.
For the reasons described above, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of
investors to revoke the registrations of each class of Respondents’ registered securities.

ORDER
It is ORDERED that, under Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
registrations of each class of registered securities of Amarillo Mesquite Grill, Inc., Global
Opportunity Fund LP, Healthrenu Medical, Inc., and Hynes & Howes Insurance Counselors,
Inc., are hereby REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that rule, a party may file a petition for
review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of the initial decision. A party
may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial decision,
pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is
filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date
of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
Also pursuant to Rule 360, this initial decision will not become final until the
Commission enters an order of finality. 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(d). The Commission will enter an
order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion to correct a manifest error
of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the initial decision as to a
party. Id. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become final as to that party.
Id.
A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at
any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall
be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
