During the hearing, counsel occasionally referred to earlier portions of the hearing transcript. Those
transcript references were generally to the “rough,” or daily transcript because the final transcript
was not yet available. The page numbers in the rough transcript, however, did not always match the
corresponding page numbers in the final transcript. For this reason, transcript page references by
counsel may not correspond to the quoted language. The table below shows references to the rough
transcript in a question by counsel (“Original”) and the transcript cite in the final (“Revision”).
