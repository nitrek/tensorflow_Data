November 2, 2016

In the Matter of
Bill the Butcher, Inc.,
Hitor Group, Inc., and
Xun Energy, Inc.,

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Bill the Butcher, Inc. (CIK
No. 1375554), a defaulted Nevada corporation with its principal place of business listed
as Seattle, Washington with stock quoted on OTC Link (previously, “Pink Sheets”)
operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. (“OTC Link”) under the ticker symbol BILB,
because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended May 31, 2014. On
April 5, 2016, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation Finance to
Bill the Butcher, Inc. requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations, and Bill
the Butcher, Inc. did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a
valid address on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules (Rule 301 of
Regulation S-T, 17 CFR 232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual).

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Hitor Group, Inc. (CIK No.
1224006), a Nevada corporation with its principal place of business listed as Kirkland,
Washington with stock quoted on OTC Link under the ticker symbol HITR, because it
has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended September 30, 2014. On April 5,
2016, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation Finance to Hitor
Group, Inc. requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations, and Hitor Group,
Inc. received the delinquency letter on April 9, 2016, but failed to cure its delinquencies.
It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Xun Energy, Inc. (CIK No.
1435936), a revoked Nevada corporation with its principal place of business listed as
Portland, Oregon with stock quoted on OTC Link under the ticker symbol XNRG,
because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended August 31, 2014. On
April 29, 2016, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation Finance to
Xun Energy, Inc. requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations, and Xun
Energy, Inc. received the delinquency letter on May 4, 2016, but failed to cure its
delinquencies.
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of
investors require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed companies.
Therefore, it is ordered, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act

2

of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed companies is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on November 2, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EST on November
15, 2016.
By the Commission.
