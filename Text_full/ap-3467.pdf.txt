The Division of Enforcement has filed an affidavit of service reflecting that Respondent’s

C.F.R. §§ 201.160(a), .220(b).
It is ORDERED that on or before January 15, 2016, Respondent shall SHOW CAUSE
why this proceeding should not be determined against it due to its failure to file an Answer or
otherwise defend the proceeding. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). If
