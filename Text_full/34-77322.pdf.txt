ORDER DETERMINING WHISTLEBLOWER AWARD CLAIMS
On July 13, 2015, the Claims Review Staff (“CRS”) issued a Preliminary Determination
for Notice of Covered Action
,
(the “Covered Action”).1 The Preliminary Determination recommended that
(“Claimant 1”) receive a whistleblower award in the amount of
percent
of
the monetary sanctions collected or to be collected in the Covered Action, which should yield a
payment exceeding $1.8 million. The Preliminary Determination also recommended that
(“Claimant 2”) and
(“Claimant 3”) receive a joint whistleblower award in
percent
of the monetary sanctions collected or to be collected in the
the amount of
Covered Action, which should yield a payment of over $130,000.2

On October 12, 2015, Claimants 2 and 3 jointly challenged the Preliminary
Determination’s proposed award determinations asserting that a substantial increase in their
award percentage is warranted based on their joint contribution to the success of the Covered
Action. Claimant 1 did not contest the Preliminary Determination.

Based on our review of the underlying record (including the response filed by Claimants
2 and 3 to the award determinations), we have determined to adopt the award recommendations
of the Preliminary Determination. Our assessment of the appropriate award amounts is based
exclusively on the award factors that are specified in Rule 21F-6, 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-6. In
applying those factors, we have considered the relative contribution of the Claimants to the
success of the Covered Action. In doing so, we were mindful of the fact that the record firmly
demonstrates that the joint contribution of Claimants 2 and 3 was substantially less important
than that of Claimant 1.3
Accordingly, upon due consideration under Rules 21F-10(f) and (h), 17 C.F.R. §
240.21F-10(f) and (h), it is hereby ORDERED that Claimant 1 shall receive an award of
percent
of the monetary sanctions collected in this Covered Action, including any
monetary sanctions collected after the date of this Order. It is FURTHER ORDERED that
Claimants 2 and 3 shall receive a joint award of
of the monetary sanctions collected in
this Covered Action, including any monetary sanctions collected after the date of this Order.4

For example, it was Claimant 1’s tip that caused the investigative staff to open the investigation, and this occurred
approximately eighteen months before Claimants 2 and 3 submitted their information. In addition, Claimant 1 met
with the staff to provide useful information on several occasions after providing
original tip; during these
and answered numerous questions posed by the staff. Most
meetings, Claimant 1
of this assistance occurred before Claimants 2 and 3 submitted their information.

Unless Claimants 2 and 3 both advise the OWB to make a different allocation of the award within 10 days of the
issuance of this order, the OWB is directed to pay each of them individually 50% of their joint award.
