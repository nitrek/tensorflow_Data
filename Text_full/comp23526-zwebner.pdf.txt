INTRODUCTION
1.

The Commission brings this action to enjoin Defendant Asher Z.

23

Zwebner (“Zwebner”) from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal

24

securities laws. From no later than September 2010 through December 2011,

25

Zwebner engaged in a scheme to create a publicly-traded shell company, Crown

26

Dynamics Corp. (“Crown”), through a sham registered initial public offering

27

(“IPO”).

28

2.

Zwebner secretly controlled every aspect of Crown’s registration and

2

the IPO. He filed a false Form S-1 registration statement with the Commission on

3

behalf of the company, and after the registration became effective, placed Crown’s

4

free-trading shares with nominees residing in Israel, most of whom were unaware

5

of their role as nominees. Zwebner then gained physical control of their stock

6

certificates.

7

Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) a false Form 15c2-11under

8

Rule 15c2-11 of the Exchange Act, 17 CFR § 240.15c2-11, so that Crown’s

9

common stock would be quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board

10

He subsequently engaged a U.S. broker-dealer to submit to the

(“OTCBB”) and the OTC Link (an SEC-registered Alternative Trading System).

11

3.

Throughout the registration process, Zwebner omitted to disclose his

12

control over Crown, made false statements about Crown’s business purpose and

13

plans, and used unwitting nominees as the purported IPO purchasers.

14

Zwebner registered Crown’s offering and arranged for its stock to trade on the

15

OTCBB and on OTC Link, he secretly sold the Crown shell to stock promoter

16

Christopher D. Larson (“Larson”).

17

4.

After

As a result of the conduct alleged in this Complaint, Zwebner violated

18

Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 77(q)(a);

19

and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

20

(“Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5. Unless restrained

21

and enjoined, Zwebner is reasonably likely to continue to violate the federal

22

securities laws.

B.

Related Entities and Individuals

4

6.

During the relevant time period, Crown was a Delaware corporation.

5

On or about September 21, 2010, in its initial public offering registration statement,

6

Crown claimed it planned to develop a patent for a toothbrush. After its registration

7

became effective, the company’s stock began trading under the symbol CDYY and,

8

in January 2012, Crown announced a new product – an electronic monitoring

9

device called PomCom. During the relevant time period, Crown stock traded in the

10

U.S. on the over-the-counter market, and its IPO shares were issued in the U.S. by a

11

U.S. registered transfer agent. U.S. investors purchased and sold shares here and

12

through U.S. broker-dealers. Later in 2012, Crown merged into Airware Labs

13

Corp.

14

7.

Larson, age 44, resides in Arizona. During the relevant time period, he

15

purchased the Crown shell from Zwebner. The Commission has filed a separate

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
8.

The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b),

19

20(d) and 22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d) and 77v(a); and

20

Sections 21(d) and 27(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78aa(a).

21

9.

The Court has personal jurisdiction over Zwebner and venue is proper

22

in this District because, among other things, many of the acts and transactions

23

constituting the violations alleged in this Complaint occurred in this District. In

24

addition, venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a

25

substantial part of the events giving rise to the Commission’s claims occurred here.

26

10.

In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, Zwebner,

27

directly and indirectly, singly or in concert with others, has made use of the means

28

or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, the means or instruments of

facilities of a national securities exchange.

IV.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

4

A.

Zwebner Registers Crown’s IPO

5

11.

Crown was incorporated in Delaware in June 2010, purportedly by an

6

Israeli named Amir Rehavi (“Rehavi”). In reality, Rehavi was Zwebner’s nominee

7

and was unaware his name was associated with Crown or its securities. The record

8

owners of the company’s stock were Rehavi and another officer, Chana Zehavi

9

(“Zehavi”).

Crown purportedly issued 1.5 million shares each to Rehavi and

10

Zehavi shortly after the company was incorporated. In reality, however, Zwebner

11

controlled all three million shares.

12

12.

Two months after Crown was incorporated, Zwebner retained a U.S.

13

transfer agent to handle the issuance and cancellation of Crown’s share certificates.

14

Thereafter until he sold the Crown shell to Larson, Zwebner was the sole Crown

15

representative who communicated with the transfer agent.

16

13.

Zwebner misrepresented to the transfer agent that Rehavi was Crown’s

17

CEO. Crown’s agreement with the transfer agent purported to be signed by Rehavi

18

and witnessed by a New York County notary. In reality, both Rehavi’s and the

19

notary’s signatures were forged on the document. In September 2010, at Zwebner’s

20

instruction, the transfer agent shipped Rehavi’s and Zehavi’s share certificates to

21

Zwebner rather than to them as the named shareholders.

22

14.

On September 21, 2010, Crown filed a Form S-1 Registration

23

Statement with the Commission and, over the next year in response to the

24

Commission’s comments, filed seven amendments. Zwebner managed every aspect

25

of the securities registration process. He worked with a U.S. securities attorney to

26

prepare the Form S-1 and amendments thereto and respond to questions raised in

27

the Commission’s comment letters. Zwebner also worked with a firm he hired to

28

file the Form S-1 and other reports with the Commission.
-4-

Case 3:16-cv-01013-WQH-NLS Document 1 Filed 04/26/16 Page 5 of 17

1

15.

According to the third amendment to the Form S-1, filed on May 12,

2

2011, Crown acquired a patent for a toothbrush that it planned to license to third-

3

parties which would “design, manufacture and market a product based on the Patent

4

. . . .”

5

16.

Despite Zwebner’s control of the company and its registration process,

6

his name did not appear anywhere in the Form S-1 or subsequent filings with the

7

Commission. Zwebner’s conduct was illegal because Items 401(a) and 404(c) of

8

Regulation S-K, 17 CFR §§ 229.401(a) and 229.404(c), require disclosure of

9

officers, directors, promoters, and control persons and related transactions

10

conducted by them to be included as part of any Form S-1 filing. Zwebner knew,

11

or was reckless in not knowing, that Crown’s Form S-1 should have disclosed his

12

control of the company and ownership of its stock, but omitted to do so.

13

17.

While Crown’s request to register its securities was pending with the

14

Commission, Zwebner disguised himself as Crown’s nominal CEO, Rehavi, so the

15

Commission would send its comment letters to him rather than Rehavi.

16

accomplish this deception, on June 27, 2011, Zwebner created an email account that

17

had the address: amir.rehavi@gmail.com. The same day, Zwebner told company

18

counsel to provide the address to the Commission examiner who was reviewing the

19

Form S-1. As requested by Zwebner, on July 11, 2011, counsel sent the address to

20

the Commission. Thereafter, the Commission emailed three comment letters to that

21

address, each of which was addressed to Amir Rehavi. Because the email account

22

belonged to Zwebner, it was he – rather than Amir Rehavi – who received the

23

letters from the Commission.

24

address, it was unaware it was communicating with Zwebner rather than Rehavi,

25

the intended recipient of the communication.

26

18.

To

Zwebner arranged to sell the Crown shell even before its registration

became effective.

28

amendment to the Form S-1. The amendment misrepresented that management did

On August 22, 2011, Crown filed its seventh (and final)

-5-

Case 3:16-cv-01013-WQH-NLS Document 1 Filed 04/26/16 Page 6 of 17

1

“not have any current intentions, negotiations, or arrangements to merge or sell the

2

Company.” The statement was false because Zwebner had already arranged to sell

3

the company: just six days after filing the amendment, Zwebner notified Crown’s

4

outside auditor that the Crown shell had been sold and the transaction would close

5

in approximately two months. Zwebner therefore knew, or was reckless in not

6

knowing, that the amendment falsely disclosed there were no plans to sell the

7

company.

8

19.

9

On September 7, 2011, relying on the accuracy of the amendment, the

Commission declared Crown’s registration effective.

When the Commission

10

allowed the registration to go effective, it was unaware Zwebner was the company’s

11

undisclosed principal and that he already had arranged to sell the company –

12

including its free-trading shares that were supposed to be offered to public investors

13

in a not-yet-commenced IPO. Once the registration became effective, Crown could

14

commence its IPO.

15

B.

Zwebner and his Son Create a Fictitious IPO Subscriber List

16

20.

The next step in the scheme was to create freely-tradable shares that

17

would make Crown valuable to stock manipulators who might purchase the Crown

18

shell. To that end, Zwebner orchestrated a sham IPO pursuant to which he caused

19

shares to be issued to his nominees. In reality, however, Zwebner owned and

20

controlled the IPO shares both before and after the IPO.

21

21.

The final amendment to the Form S-1 described the procedures for

22

subscribing to the IPO that Zwebner never intended to follow. The procedures

23

stated that investors wishing to purchase IPO shares would be required to submit a

24

subscription agreement and deliver funds to Crown for the purchase. Instead of

25

conducting a real IPO, Zwebner engaged in an elaborate charade to make it appear

26

that Crown had done so. Zwebner and his son persuaded acquaintances to hand

27

over unsigned photocopies of their blank personal checks. In doing so, Zwebner

28
-6-

Case 3:16-cv-01013-WQH-NLS Document 1 Filed 04/26/16 Page 7 of 17

1

and his son hid from them the fact that they would be identified as Crown’s IPO

2

subscribers and that Crown stock certificates would be issued in their names.

3

22.

Once Zwebner had the checks, he or his son forged the payor

4

signatures, inserted “Crown Dynamics Corp” as the payee, and inserted $1,875 as

5

the payment amount. In many if not all cases, the checks were never presented for

6

payment.

7

purportedly purchased 62,500 shares (totaling 2.5 million shares). At least 24 of

8

the so-called subscribers – and most likely all 40 –never purchased Crown shares.

9

Zwebner knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the IPO subscriber list was

10

nothing more than a make-believe list of shareholders who never actually purchased

11

the stock.

12

23.

Zwebner constructed a list of 40 IPO subscribers, each of whom

Zwebner then provided the fabricated IPO shareholder list to Crown’s

13

transfer agent, along with a share issuance resolution purportedly signed by Crown

14

officer Zehavi. The resolution directed the transfer agent to issue share certificates

15

in the names of the 40 IPO subscribers and to ship them to Zwebner rather than the

16

named shareholders. The transfer agent followed the instruction and, on or about

17

October 24, 2011, sent all 40 share certificates to Zwebner. Most, if not all, of the

18

individuals named on the share certificates never received them or even knew of

19

their existence.

20

C.

Zwebner Arranges for Crown’s Stock to Trade Over-The-Counter

21

24.

The next phase in the scheme – one that was important to make the

22

Crown shell valuable to any potential stock manipulator who would purchase it –

23

was to create a trading market for the Crown shell.

24

25.

The OTCBB is a quotation service for securities that are not listed or

25

traded on NASDAQ or any other national securities exchange. While exchanges

26

(such as NASDAQ and NYSE) have specific listing and maintenance standards that

27

are stringently enforced, OTC quotation services (such as OTCBB) facilitate

28
-7-

Case 3:16-cv-01013-WQH-NLS Document 1 Filed 04/26/16 Page 8 of 17

1

quotation of unlisted securities. As such, any regulatory relationship between an

2

OTC quotation service and the companies may be limited or non-existent.

3

26.

For a company to have its securities quoted on the OTCBB, a Form

4

211 must be submitted to FINRA by a “market maker” regarding the company’s

5

securities. A market maker is a firm that stands ready to buy and sell a particular

6

stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price. The market

7

maker must demonstrate compliance with Rule 15c2-11 of the Exchange Act, 17

8

CFR § 240.15c2-11, before it can initiate a quote in a specific security. Rule 15c2-

9

11 requires that a market maker have a reasonable basis to believe the information

10
11

required is accurate in all material respects and from a reliable source.
27.

On or about September 8, 2011 – the day after the Commission

12

declared Crown’s registration effective – Zwebner arranged for a broker-dealer to

13

file a Form 211 regarding Crown’s securities so that quotations could be published

14

on the OTCBB. Zwebner was the broker-dealer’s exclusive contact for information

15

about Crown the broker-dealer needed in order to successfully clear the Form 211

16

with FINRA and commence publishing quotations regarding Crown’s securities.

17

28.

On or about September 14, 2011, the broker-dealer submitted a Form

18

211 regarding Crown’s securities to FINRA.

19

information that Zwebner had provided to the broker-dealer including, for example:

The application contained false

20

 that Amir Rehavi was Crown’s CEO;

21

 that Crown intended to license a toothbrush patent to third parties to

22

design, manufacture and market the product; and
 that Crown had not entered into any discussions or negotiations

23
24
25

concerning potential merger or acquisition candidates.
29.

Those statements were false because Rehavi never acted as CEO;

26

Crown did not intend any longer to pursue the toothbrush patent; and, less than a

27

month earlier, Zwebner had arranged to sell the Crown shell. When Zwebner

28
-8-

Case 3:16-cv-01013-WQH-NLS Document 1 Filed 04/26/16 Page 9 of 17

1

provided this information to the broker-dealer he knew, or was reckless in not

2

knowing, that it was untrue.

3

30.

In a letter dated September 20, 2011, FINRA informed the broker-

4

dealer that the Form 211 concerning Crown was deficient and requested additional

5

information including the following:

6

 a current shareholder list;

7

 a statement indicating whether anyone controlled Crown’s shares other

8

than the named shareholders;
 details on Crown’s IPO including copies of the IPO subscribers’

9
10

checks reflecting payment for their Crown shares; and
 details on Crown’s business plan.

11
12

31.

On or about September 20, 2011, the broker-dealer sent FINRA’s

13

comment letter to Zwebner and wrote: “I will await your responses once they are

14

available.” Zwebner provided the broker-dealer with information to forward to

15

FINRA.

16

32.

In a letter dated October 26, 2011 but sent via overnight delivery the

17

following day, the broker-dealer responded to FINRA’s deficiency letter based on

18

the information Zwebner had provided. Zwebner was fully aware of the contents of

19

the letter because, before sending it to FINRA, the broker-dealer showed it to him.

20

The letter included the following false information:

21
22
23
24

 the fraudulent shareholder list that Zwebner previously had provided to
Crown’s transfer agent;
 a statement misrepresenting that no one controlled Crown’s shares
other than the named shareholders;

25

 copies of the fraudulent IPO subscriber checks that Zwebner and his

26

son had obtained from their acquaintances and a statement

27

misrepresenting that the named officers/directors of Crown – rather

28

than Zwebner and his son – had solicited the IPO subscribers and that
-9-

Case 3:16-cv-01013-WQH-NLS Document 1 Filed 04/26/16 Page 10 of 17

1

they had purchased their shares. Based on information provided to it

2

by Zwebner, the broker-dealer represented the share certificates had

3

been delivered, without explaining that they had been sent to Zwebner

4

rather than to the named IPO subscribers; and

5

 a detailed description of Crown’s plan to license Crown’s product to

6

third-party manufacturers and marketers that omitted to state that

7

Zwebner was in the process of selling the company and had no

8

intention of following the stated business plan.

9
10
11

When Zwebner provided this information to the broker-dealer he knew, or was
reckless in not knowing, that it was false.
33.

On or about November 2, 2011, in reliance on the false information

12

about Crown that Zwebner had funneled through the broker-dealer, FINRA cleared

13

the Form 211, which allowed the broker-dealer to quote Crown’s stock on the

14

OTCBB and on OTC Link.

15

Zwebner Crown had received a clearance letter from FINRA.

16

34.

The following day, the broker-dealer informed

Zwebner now had a valuable commodity to sell: A fully-registered

17

shell company with 2.5 million free-trading shares, and a ready-made trading

18

market into which the shares could be sold. He was ready to complete the sale of

19

the Crown shell that he had arranged in August 2011.

20

D.

Zwebner Sells the Crown Shell to Larson

21

35.

In mid-November 2011, Zwebner had not yet completed the sale of the

22

Crown shell that he had announced to Crown’s auditor three months earlier. On or

23

about November 16, 2011, when the auditor asked Zwebner to pay long overdue

24

bills, Zwebner responded that he would pay “[a]s soon as Crown will be sold . . . .”

25

The sale was completed a month later.

26

36.

On or about December 6, 2011, Larson wired $300,000 from a bank

27

account titled to an entity he controlled to the trust account of an attorney, which

28

reflected that payment was for Crown. Two days later, the attorney wired $25,000
- 10 -

Case 3:16-cv-01013-WQH-NLS Document 1 Filed 04/26/16 Page 11 of 17

1

to Zwebner. On December 14, 2011, the attorney wired an additional $206,127 to

2

Zwebner through a financial cash change house in Jerusalem. On December 15,

3

2011, Larson wired an additional $25,000 from the same bank account he

4

controlled to another of the attorney’s trust accounts.

5

Zwebner’s Scienter: Other Wrongful Acts Demonstrating Zwebner’s Intent to

6

Fraudulently Create Public Shell Companies

7

37.

Zwebner knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose his control of

8

Crown and ownership of its stock in filings with the Commission.

9

knowingly or recklessly misrepresented that there were no plans to sell the

10

company and that the IPO subscribers were nothing more than a make-believe list

11

of shareholders who never actually purchased the stock. He also knowingly or

12

recklessly provided false information to the broker-dealer who in turn provided the

13

information to FINRA.

14

38.

He also

Crown was not Zwebner’s only foray into the public shell company

15

creation business. In several other instances in roughly the same time period in

16

which he launched Crown, Zwebner also created other phony shell companies using

17

the same blueprint he used for Crown.

18
19

39.

For example, Zwebner arranged sham registered offerings for the

following shell companies:

20

 Dynamic Applications Corp. now known as OWC Pharmaceutical

21

Research Corp. by virtue of a name change amendment agreed to on

22

November 25, 2014 (trading symbol OWCP) (registration effective on

23

May 15, 2008);

24

 Dynamic Ventures Corp. (registration effective on March 29, 2010);

25

 Advanced Ventures Corp. (registration effective on May 10, 2011);

26

 Safecode Drug Technologies Corp. (registration effective on

27

December 27, 2011); and

28
- 11 -

Case 3:16-cv-01013-WQH-NLS Document 1 Filed 04/26/16 Page 12 of 17

 Baby All Corp. now known as Santa Fe Petroleum, Inc. (trading

1
2
3

symbol SFPI).
40.

In his activities concerning these shell companies, Zwebner’s conduct

4

demonstrated the same pattern and practice he followed in setting up Crown. For

5

example, Zwebner caused registration statements to be filed with the Commission,

6

representing the companies would conduct IPOs and that they owned or had been

7

assigned patents (or pending patents) for products they purportedly planned to

8

develop. In each case he took physical possession of the named officers’ share

9

certificates that represented all of the outstanding shares before the IPO. As with

10

Crown, none of the registration statements filed with the Commission for these

11

companies identified Zwebner as a principal or even mentioned him at all.

12

41.

After the companies’ registrations became effective, Zwebner took

13

physical possession of the share certificates for stock that was purportedly sold to

14

IPO investors. As with Crown, at least some of the purported IPO investors were

15

Zwebner’s nominees who were unaware they had been listed as shareholders.

16
17

42.

Zwebner arranged for each of the companies’ shares to be traded over-

the-counter in the U.S., and he then sold some of the companies to third parties.
