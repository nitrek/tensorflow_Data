Case 1:16-cv-01950 Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 2 of 17

SUMMARY
I.

Ikenna Ikokwu and the Entity Defendants made material misstatements and failed to

disclose critical information to their clients when recommending that the clients invest in what
ultimately was exposed as a Ponzi-like fraud.
2.

In less than two years, between September 2012 and April2014, Ikokwu persuaded

more than twenty of Defendants' clients to invest a combined total of approximately $5 million in
securities issued by FutureGen Company ("FutureGen"), which was run by a man named Lawrence
Schmidt.
3.

In recommending the FutureGen investment, Ikowkwu fraudulently represented

himself as an objective and independent investment adviser his clients could trust for sound advice
regarding how best to protect and grow what was in many cases their retirement savings. Ikwokwu
also fraudulently told his clients that he did not receive compensation from any other party for
recommending a particular investment. Critically, Ikokwu failed to disclose that he received
substantial kickbacks from FutureGen for persuading his clients to invest in FutureGen securities.
4.

In addition, Ikokwu lied to investors and told them that he had conducted substantial

due diligence into FutureGen prior to recommending that they invest in its securities. Contrary to
that representation, Ikokwu did almost nothing to vet FutureGen as a potential investment for his
clients. He did not review any audited financial statements or any underlying documentation to
ascertain that money raised was invested properly and performing as Schmidt represented.
5.

Ikokwu also failed to disclose to Defendants' clients that he had reason to believe

FutureGen was an unsound inveshnent. Ikokwu solicited clients to invest in FutureGen securities,
in part, by touting that he and his family members had successfully invested in FutureGen and a
related company, Commercial Equity Partners

("~Commercial Equity'~).

2

However, lkokwu failed to

Case 1:16-cv-01950 Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 3 of 17

disclose to his clients that on July I, 2013, Commercial Equity defaulted on the largest investment
and owed Ikokwu's family over $450,000.
6.

Not only did Ikokwu fail to disclose that problem to his clients, he continued to

solicit clients to invest in FutureGen securities. In the following ten months, Defendants' clients
invested over $2.5 million in FutureGen securities, and Defendants benefited handsomely from
these investments, realizing over $60,000 in additional undisclosed commissions from FutureGen.
7.

While operating FutureGen, Schmidt siphoned off almost $2 million of investors'

money for his own benefit and used new investor money to pay off earlier investors. In April 2014,
while under scrutiny from the SEC, Schmidt fired all of FutureGen' s employees and fled the
country.
8.

In addition to engaging in a fraud that caused their clients to lose millions of dollars,

Defendants violated the fiduciary duty they owed to their clients. As a result of the conduct
described in this Complaint, Defendants Ikokwu, Ike Inc., and Money LLC violated Section 17(a)
of the Securities Act of1933 ("Securities Act") [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)] and Section IO(b) ofthe
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5
thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5], and Sections 206(1) and (2) ofthe Investment Advisers Act of
1940 ("Advisers Act") [15 U.S.C. § 80b-6]. Defendants Ikokwu and Ike, Inc. are also liable under
15(a)(l) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78o(a)]. In addition, Defendant Ikokwu is liable as a
controlling person under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78t(a)].

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
9.

The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b) and 20(d) of the

Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b) and 77t(d)], Section 2l(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.

§ 78u(d)] and Section 209(d) of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-9(d)] to enjoin such acts,

3

Case 1:16-cv-01950 Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 4 of 17

transactions, practices, and courses of business, to obtain disgorgetnent and civil penalties, and for
other appropriate relief.
10.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22(a) of the

Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)], Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.

§§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa], and Section 214(a) of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-14(a)].
11.

Venue lies in this judicial district pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15

U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa]. This district has been the
principal place of business for FutureGen since its inception, and this court is currently presiding

In addition, Defendants transact business within this judicial district, having conducted substantial
business with Schmidt and FutureGen, and certain of the acts, transactions, practices, and courses of
business relating to the violations of the federal securities laws charged herein occurred within this
judicial district.
12.

In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, Ikokwu and the Entity

Defendants, directly or indirectly, singly or in concert, made use of the means or instruments of
transportation or communication in, or instrumentalities of, interstate commerce, or the mails, or the

FACTS
I.

Defendants Defrauded Their Clients Regarding Investing in FutureGen
17.

Ikowku and the Entity Defendants mislead their investment advisory clients into

investing in FutureGen securities by, among other things: failing to disclose the kickbacks they
received from FutureGen; lying that Ikokwu had perfonned extensive due diligence into FutureGen
and the FutureGen securities; and touting his family's personal investments with Schmidt-related
entities, while failing to disclose that Schmidt had failed to pay a debt he owed to Ikokwu's family.

A.

Defendants Failed to Disclose That Ikokwu Received Secret Kickbacks for
Persuading Defendants' Clients to Invest in FutureGen Securities

18.

In less than two years, Defendants' clients collectively invested more than $5 million

in FutureGen securities.
19.

As part of their pitch to their investJnent advisory clients, Defendants touted the fact

that they were independent and did not receive any cotnmissions or other compensation for

5

Case 1:16-cv-01950 Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 6 of 17

recommending specific securities. Indeed, in written marketing materials Defendants provided to
clients and potential clients, they warned of the dangers of financial services providers who offer
their own investment products:
do you think [the financial service provider is] going to sell you someone
else's investment [where someone else makes the lion's share of the profits],
or, do you think they will sell you something where they get paid twice once on the sales cost and again on the management fees?
Defendants' marketing materials assured prospective clients that Defendants did not receive
undisclosed incentives for recommending certain investments.
20.

Ikokwu made similar representations in Money LLC's Form ADV Part 2B ("Form

ADV"), a disclosure brochure that Defendants were legally required to accurately prepare and
maintain. In the Form ADV, Ikokwu wrote:

21.

a.

"Other than salary, annual bonuses, and regular bonuses, Ike
lkokwu does not receive any economic benefit from any person,
company or organization in exchange for providing clients
advisory services through Winning the Money Game LLC."

b.

"Neither [Money LLC], nor its management persons, has any
relationship or arrangement with issuers of securities."

c.

"Neither [Money LLC] nor its supervised persons accept any
compensation for the sale of securities or other investment
products, including asset-based sales charges or services fees from
the sale of mutual funds;" and

d.

"[Money LLC] does not recommend that clients buy or sell any
security in which a related person to [Money LLC] has a material
financial interest."

Contrary to the representations in the marketing materials and required brochure,

Defendants received undisclosed kickbacks from FutureGen for persuading clients to invest in
FutureGen securities.

6

Case 1:16-cv-01950 Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 7 of 17

22.

In April2011, Ikokwu entered into an agreement with Sclunidt whereby Ikokwu

would receive referral fees ranging from 2.0% to 2.5o/o of the amount his clients invested in
FutureGen, depending on the total amount invested. After entering into this agreement, Defendants
began advising clients to invest in FutureGen securities.
23.

In 2013, Ikokwu entered into an updated agreement with FutureGen that increased

the kickback Ikokwu would receive if he successfully directed Defendants' clients to invest more
than $1 million collectively in the calendar year.
24.

Defendants convinced more than twenty clients to invest approximately $5 million

in FutureGen securities. Based on these investments, Ikokwu received approximately $130,000 in
undisclosed kickbacks from FutureGen, which greatly exceeded the management fees Ikokwu
earned providing investment advice.
25.

Defendants never disclosed this conflict of interest to their clients. Defendants did

not disclose that Ikokwu was a selling agent of FutureGen or that he received commissions for
advising and persuading his clients to invest in FutureGen. Instead, Defendants propagated the
myth that Ikokwu was acting as their investment adviser and providing independent advice in return
for the management fee they paid him.

B.

Defendants Lied About Their FutureGen Due Diligence

26.

Ikokwu also defrauded his clients when he told them that he conducted "extensive"

due diligence before he recommended investing in FutureGen securities, specifically promissory
notes. In addition, Defendants did not provide their clients with FutureGen's offering documents.
Rather, Defendants persuaded their clients to invest in FutureGen based on Ikokwu's assurances
that he had performed due diligence and that FutureGen promissory notes were a low-volatility

7

Case 1:16-cv-01950 Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 8 of 17

investment that would provide a steady II to I4 percent return. Ikokwu also told at least one client
that FutureGen had made a "special offering" with a ''I 7% [rate] for an I8 month term."
27.

Contrary to these representations, Defendants did almost no due diligence into

FutureGen before recommending it to their clients. Ikokwu did not review any audited financial
statements for FutureGen and never attempted to confirm whether any of FutureGen' s purported
investments actually existed and were performing.
28.

In March 20 14-less than one month before Schmidt fled the country and after

Defendants had induced their clients to invest approximately $5 million in FutureGen securitiesIkokwu first reviewed an unaudited 20 II FutureGen financial statement in his possession. After
reviewing this statement, Ikokwu emailed Schmidt: "If the 2011 financials are accurate, one would
have to question why clients are being asked to participate in [FutureGen' s] offerings." He stated
further: "I'm pretty sure you don't want me submitting this to the SEC as it does not paint a
favorable financial picture for [FutureGen]."
29.

Remarkably, even after sending this email to Schmidt, Defendants continued to

recommend that their clients invest in FutureGen securities.

C.

Defendants Failed to Disclose that Schmidt had Already Failed to Deliver as
Promised

30.

To persuade their clients to invest in FutureGen, Defendants regularly touted that

Ikokwu and his family had successfully invested in Schmidt-related entities. However, Defendants
failed to tell their clients that Schmidt had actually failed to pay back Ikokwu's family as promised,
because Defendants benefitted from the undisclosed kickbacks.
3I.

In 2009, Ikokwu began investing in pr01nissory notes offered by another Schmidt

company, Commercial Equity Partners ('""COintnercial Equity'} Prior to making his investment in
Commercial Equity, Ikokwu did not request or obtain audited financial statetnents, nor did he ask

8

Case 1:16-cv-01950 Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 9 of 17

for any verification that Commercial Equity had actually made any of the investments listed on its
unaudited financial statements. Subsequently, Ikokwu and his frunily members invested over
$600,000 collectively in Commercial Equity and FutureGen securities.
32.

In soliciting his clients to invest in FutureGen securities, lkokwu showed clients

copies of his and his family's account statements from Commercial Equity to demonstrate the
purported returns they received from Schmidt.
33.

Though Ikokwu used his family's investments with Schmidt as a selling point to

clients, he failed to inform those clients that Schmidt and Commercial Equity failed to pay lkokwu' s
family as promised.
34.

On July 1, 2013, a $450,000 Commerical Equity promissory note that Ikokwu's

family purchased came due. However, Commercial Equity was unable to pay back that financial
obligation.
35.

Through the summer of2013, lkokwu repeatedly requested that Commercial Equity

and Schmidt cure the default and pay the amount owed. Four months later, Schmidt sent Ikokwu's
family $45,250, which was about ten percent of the money Schmidt owed. Thereafter, Commercial
Equity paid Ikokwu's family periodic interest payments until January 31,2014, but did not pay any
additional principal on the obligation. In April2014, shortly before Schmidt fled the country,
FutureGen paid Ikokwu's family $100,000, purportedly relating to the delinquent obligation of
Commercial Equity.
36.

Ikokwu did not disclose to his clients, including those who made investments in

FutureGen securities after July I, 2013, that Schmidt and his companies were currently delinquent
on the largest investtnent Ikokwu and his fatnily had made with Schtnidt. Rather, Ikokwu continued

9

Case 1:16-cv-01950 Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 10 of 17

to recommend that Defendants' clients invest in FutureGen and he continued to receive secret
kickbacks for the money Defendants' clients invested in FutureGen.
37.

After July I, 2013 when Schmidt failed to repay Ikokwu's family, Defendants'

clients invested over $2.5 million in FutureGen. Ikokwu received more than $60,000 in kickbacks
for these investments, with the last payment coming approximately one week before Sclunidt fled
the country.
38.

The kickbacks from FutureGen made up the vast majority oflkokwu's income from

his financial advisory business in 2013 and 2014. Without the FutureGen payments Ikokwu's
advisory business would have operated at a loss.

II.

Defendants Violated The Anti-Fraud Provisions of the Federal Securities Laws
39.

During the relevant period, Ikokwu operated and controlled the Entity Defendants.

40.

All of the misrepresentations and omissions set forth herein, individually and in the

aggregate, are material. There is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider
the misrepresented facts and omitted information important, and/or that disclosure of the omitted
facts or accurate information would alter the "total mix" of information available to investors.
41.

In connection with the conduct described herein, Defendants acted knowingly and/or

recklessly. Among other things, Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that they were
making material misrepresentations and omitting material facts in connection with selling or
offering FutureGen securities.
42.

Ikokwu had ultimate authority for the false and misleading statements and omissions

made orally and in writings provided to his clients. He signed all investment advisory agreements
with Defendants~ clients and drafted and provided alltnarketing tnaterials to Defendants' clients.
Ikokwu drafted and approved the language in Money LLC's Form ADV filed with the Cmnmission.

10

Case 1:16-cv-01950 Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 11 of 17

Ikokwu was the only individual engaged in tnarketing, selling, and providing investment services to
Defendants' clients and potential clients.
43.

Through their material misrepresentations and omissions, Defendants knowingly,

recklessly, or negligently obtained money or property from investors.
44.

Through this scheme, Defendants knowingly, recklessly, or negligently engaged in

acts, transactions or courses of business that operated as a fraud or deceit upon their clients, and
offerees, purchasers and prospective purchasers of the FutureGen notes.

III.

Ikokwu And Ike Inc. Acted as Unregistered Broker-Dealers in Violation of the Federal
Securities Laws
45.

Ikokwu failed to observe the corporate distinction between Money LLC and Ike Inc.,

and provided investment advice to clients through Ike Inc., which was not registered as an
investment adviser or broker-dealer.
46.

Defendants charged new clients an initial implementation fee that was generally

between $1,000 and $2,500, or in certain cases 1 percent of the client's annual income. Ike Inc.
then charged clients placed in FutureGen securities an annual management fee of one to two percent
of the value of their investment. This annual management fee was disclosed in an investment
advisory agreement signed by Ikokwu and the investor.
4 7.

FutureGen promissory notes were one investment that Ikokwu recommended to

clients of Ike Inc. Typically, FutureGen promissory notes had I I to 14 percent annual rates of return
over terms ranging from 3 to 6 years. The money raised from investors was pooled by FutureGen
and purportedly used by Schmidt to generate returns frmn investing in tax liens and real estate.
48.

Ikokwu's clients could choose to receive periodic interest or have the interest

reinvested and paid at the end of the term of the note. The promissory note provided that the
interest would be secured by the tax liens purchased by FutureGen. Ikokwu did not directly provide

II

Case 1:16-cv-01950 Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 12 of 17

FutureGen offering materials to investors, and he did not know whether they received copies of the
offering memorandum from FutureGen.
49.

The FutureGen notes sold to investors as a result of the Defendants'

recommendations are securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(l) of the Securities Act [15
U.S.C. § 77b(a)(l)] and Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(10)], and the
fraud and other misconduct described herein was in the offer of, and/or in connection with the
purchase or sale of securities.
50.

Despite receiving these commissions from FutureGen, Ikokwu and Ike Inc. did not

register as a broker-dealer.

IV.

Defendants Violated the Advisers Act
51.

By advising their clients to invest in FutureGen securities in exchange for

compensation, Defendants acted as investment advisers within the meaning of Section 202(a)(ll)
ofthe Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-2(a)(ll)].
52.

Defendants' false and misleading statements in persuading their clients to invest in

FutureGen defrauded their clients in violation of the Advisers Act.
