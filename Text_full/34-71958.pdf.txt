Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers, Major
Security-Based Swap Participants, and Broker-Dealers; Capital Rule for Certain Security-

Based Swap Dealers

AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission. 

ACTION: Proposed rule. 

SUMMARY: In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 

Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”), pursuant to 

the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), is proposing recordkeeping, reporting, 

and notification requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers (“SBSDs”) and major 

security-based swap participants (“MSBSPs”), securities count requirements applicable to certain 

SBSDs, and additional recordkeeping requirements applicable to broker-dealers to account for 

their security-based swap and swap activities. The Commission also is proposing an additional 

capital charge provision that would be added to the proposed capital rule for certain SBSDs. 

Finally, the Commission is proposing technical amendments to the broker-dealer recordkeeping, 

reporting, and notification requirements.

B
	 ACKGROUND
On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law.1 Title VII of

the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title VII”) established a new regulatory framework for the over-thecounter (“OTC”) derivatives markets.2 In this regard, Title VII was enacted, among other
reasons, to reduce risk, increase transparency, and promote market integrity within the financial
system by, among other things: (1) providing for the registration and regulation of SBSDs and
MSBSPs; (2) imposing clearing and trade execution requirements on swaps and security-based
swaps, subject to certain exceptions; (3) creating recordkeeping and real-time reporting regimes;

1	

See Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, Pub. L. 111–203, 124 Stat.
1376 (2010).

2	

Pursuant to section 701 of the Dodd-Frank Act, Title VII may be cited as the “Wall Street Transparency
and Accountability Act of 2010.” See Pub. L. 111–203, 701. The Dodd-Frank Act assigns responsibility
for the oversight of the U.S. OTC derivatives markets to the Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (“CFTC”), and certain prudential regulators. The term prudential regulator is defined in
section 1(a)(39) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”) (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(39)) and that definition is
incorporated by reference in section 3(a)(74) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(74)). Pursuant to the
definition, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”), the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the Farm
Credit Administration, or the Federal Housing Finance Agency (collectively, the “prudential regulators”) is
the prudential regulator of an SBSD, MSBSP, swap participant, or major swap participant if the entity is
directly supervised by that agency. The Commission has oversight authority with respect to a securitybased swap as defined in section 3(a)(68) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(68)), including to
implement a registration and oversight program for a security-based swap dealer as defined in section
3(a)(71) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(71)) and a major security-based swap participant as
defined in section 3(a)(67) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(67)). The CFTC has oversight authority
with respect to a swap as defined in section 1(a)(47) of the CEA (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(47)), including to
implement a registration and oversight program for a swap dealer as defined in section 1(a)(49) of the CEA
(7 U.S.C. 1(a)(49)) and a major swap participant as defined in section 1(a)(33) of the CEA (7 U.S.C.
1(a)(33)). The Commission and the CFTC jointly have adopted rules to further define, among other things,
the terms swap, swap dealer, major swap participant, security-based swap, security-based swap dealer, and
major security-based swap participant. See Further Definition of ‘‘Swap,’’ ‘‘Security-Based Swap,’’ and
‘‘Security-Based Swap Agreement’’; Mixed Swaps; Security-Based Swap Agreement Recordkeeping,
Exchange Act Release No. 67453 (July 18, 2012), 77 FR 48208 (Aug. 13, 2012) (joint Commission/CFTC
final rule); Further Definition of ‘‘Swap Dealer,’’ ‘‘Security-Based Swap Dealer,’’ ‘‘Major Swap
Participant,’’ ‘‘Major Security-Based Swap Participant’’ and ‘‘Eligible Contract Participant”, Exchange
Act Release No. 66868 (Apr. 27, 2012), 77 FR 30596 (May 23, 2012) (joint Commission/CFTC final rule).

and (4) enhancing the Commission’s rulemaking and enforcement authorities with respect to all
registered entities and intermediaries subject to the Commission’s oversight.3
Section 764 of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 15F to the Exchange Act.4 Section
15F(f)(2) provides that the Commission shall adopt rules governing reporting and recordkeeping
for SBSDs and MSBSPs.5 Section 15F(f)(1)(A) provides that SBSDs and MSBSPs shall make
such reports as are required by the Commission, by rule or regulation, regarding the transactions
and positions and financial condition of the SBSD or MSBSP.6 Section 15F(f)(1)(B)(ii) provides
that SBSDs and MSBSPs without a prudential regulator (respectively, “nonbank SBSDs” and
“nonbank MSBSPs”) shall keep books and records in such form and manner and for such period
as may be prescribed by the Commission by rule or regulation.7 Section 15F(f)(1)(B)(i) provides
that SBSDs and MSBSPs for which there is a prudential regulator (respectively, “bank SBSDs”
and “bank MSBSPs”) shall keep books and records of all activities related to their business as an
SBSD or MSBSP in such form and manner and for such period as may be prescribed by the
Commission by rule or regulation.8 Section 15F(g) of the Exchange Act requires SBSDs and
MSBSPs to maintain daily trading records with respect to security-based swaps and provides that
the Commission shall adopt rules governing daily trading records for SBSDs and MSBSPs.9

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(f)(1)(B)(ii). A nonbank SBSD or nonbank MSBSP could be dually registered with

the Commission as a broker-dealer (respectively, a “broker-dealer SBSD” or “broker-dealer MSBSP”) or
registered with the Commission only as an SBSD or MSBSP (respectively, a “stand-alone SBSD” or
“stand-alone MSBSP”). Any of these registrants or a bank SBSD or bank MSBSP also could register with
the CFTC as a futures commission merchant (“FCM”), swap dealer, or major swap participant.

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(g).

Finally, section 15F(i)(2) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission shall adopt rules
governing documentation standards for SBSDs and MSBSPs.10
The Commission anticipates that a number of broker-dealers will register as SBSDs
(broker-dealer SBSDs) or potentially as MSBSPs (“broker-dealer MSBSPs).11 Further, the
Commission expects that some broker-dealers that are not registered as an SBSD or an MSBSP
nonetheless will engage in security-based swap and swap activities.12 The Commission has
authority under section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act to adopt rules requiring broker-dealers –
which would include broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs – to make and keep for
prescribed periods such records, furnish such copies thereof, and make and disseminate such
reports as the Commission, by rule, prescribes as necessary or appropriate in the public interest,

10	

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(i).

11	

While it is anticipated that some broker-dealers and banks will register as SBSDs in order to engage in
security-based swap activities, it is unclear whether broker-dealers or banks will register as MSBSPs. For
example, a broker-dealer or bank may be required to register as an MSBSP because of the nature of its
security-based swap activities. See 15 U.S.C. 78a(c)(67) (defining the term major security-based swap
participant); Further Definition of ‘‘Swap Dealer,’’ ‘‘Security-Based Swap Dealer,’’ ‘‘Major Swap
Participant,’’ ‘‘Major Security-Based Swap Participant’’ and ‘‘Eligible Contract Participant”, 77 FR 30596
(further defining the term major security-based swap participant). In this case, the broker-dealer or bank
may conclude that it is more efficient to register as an SBSD in order to engage in security-based swap
activities permitted of an SBSD but not of an MSBSP. Nonetheless, because a broker-dealer or bank could
register as an MSBSP, the proposed rules and the discussion in this release contemplate these categories of
registrants. A broker-dealer MSBSP would be subject to all the securities laws applicable to a brokerdealer, including capital, margin, segregation, recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities count
requirements, and to any additional requirements that would be applicable only to MSBSPs. Similarly, a
bank MSBSP would be subject to all laws and regulations applicable to a bank and to any additional
requirements that would be applicable only to MSBSPs.

12	

The term security-based swap dealer is defined in section 3(a)(71) of the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(71). The definition excludes an entity that enters into security-based swaps agreements for its own
account, either individually or in a fiduciary capacity, but not as a part of a regular business. See 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(71)(C). Further, section 3(a)(71)(D) provides that the Commission shall exempt from designation as
an SBSD an entity that engages in a de minimis quantity of security-based swap dealing in connection with
transactions with or on behalf of its customers and that the Commission shall promulgate regulations to
establish factors with respect to the making of any determination to exempt. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(71)(D).
The Commission has adopted Rule 3a71-2 to establish a de minimis exception under section 3(a)(71)(D) of
the Exchange Act. See 17 CFR 240.3a71-2; Further Definition of ‘‘Swap Dealer,’’ ‘‘Security-Based Swap
Dealer,’’ ‘‘Major Swap Participant,’’ ‘‘Major Security-Based Swap Participant’’ and ‘‘Eligible Contract
Participant”, 77 FR at 30635–30643.

for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act.13
The Commission also is proposing largely technical amendments to the broker-dealer
recordkeeping, reporting, and notification rules.14
Pursuant to sections 15F and 17(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission is proposing to
amend Rules 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5, and 17a-11 to establish a recordkeeping, reporting, and
notification program for broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs. The amendments to
13	

See 15 U.S.C. 78q(a)(1). Section 771 of the Dodd-Frank Act states that unless otherwise provided by its
terms, Subtitle B of Title VII (relating to the regulation of the security-based swap markets) does not divest
any appropriate Federal banking agency, the Commission, the CFTC, or any other Federal or State agency,
of any authority derived from any other provision of applicable law. See Pub. L. 111–203, 771.

14	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-3 (“Rule 17a-3”); 17 CFR 240.17a-4 (“Rule 17a-4”); 17 CFR 240.17a-5 (“Rule
17a-5”); 17 CFR 240.17a-11 (“Rule 17a-11”). The Dodd-Frank Act amended the definition of security in
section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act to include a security-based swap. See Pub. L. 111–203, 761(a)(2); 15
U.S.C. 78c(a)(10). Therefore, the term security as used in Rules 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5, and 17a-11 includes a
security-based swap, and any requirement in those rules relating to a security applies to a security-based
swap. The Commission, however, has issued temporary exemptive relief to address the effect that the
amendment to the definition of security would have on requirements in Exchange Act provisions and rules
that did not otherwise apply specifically to security-based swaps prior to the amendment. See Order
Granting Temporary Exemptions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Connection with the
Pending Revision of the Definition of “Security” to Encompass Security-Based Swaps, and Request for
Comment, Exchange Act Release No. 64795 (July 1, 2011), 76 FR 39927 (July 7, 2011) (“[R]egistered
broker-dealers will solely be exempt from those provisions and rules to the extent that those provisions or
rules do not apply to the broker’s or dealer’s security-based swap positions or activities as of July 15, 2011
– the day before the effectiveness of the change to the “security” definition. In other words, during the
exemptive period the application of current law will remain unchanged, and those particular Exchange Act
requirements will continue to apply to registered broker-dealers’ security-based swap activities and
positions to the same extent they apply currently. This approach is intended to help avoid undue market
disruptions resulting from the change to the “security” definition, while at the same time preserving the
current application of those particular provisions or rules to security-based swap activity by registered
broker-dealers. Thus, under this approach of preserving the status quo, no exemption will be provided in
connection with the [requirements in Exchange Act sections 17(a) and 17(b) and Rules 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5,
17a-8, and 17a-13] under the Exchange Act to the extent that those requirements currently apply to
registered broker-dealer activities or positions involving instruments that will be security-based swaps (but
registered broker-dealers will be exempted in connection with those requirements to the extent that the
requirements do not already apply to activities or positions involving those instruments.”); Order Extending
Temporary Exemptions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Connection with the Revision of the
Definition of “Security” to Encompass Security-Based Swaps, and Request for Comment, Exchange Act
Release No. 68864 (Feb. 7, 2013), 78 FR 10218 (Feb. 13, 2013) (extending exemptive relief through
February 11, 2014); Order Extending Temporary Exemptions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in
Connection with the Revision of the Definition of “Security” to Encompass Security-Based Swaps, and
Request for Comment, Exchange Release No. 71485 (Feb. 5, 2014) (extending exemptive relief with
respect to Rules 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5, 17a-11, and 17a-13 until the earliest compliance date set forth in any
final rules regarding recordkeeping and reporting requirements for SBSDs and MSBSPs). The
Commission expects that the adoption of the amendments contemplated herein would eliminate the need
for temporary exemptive relief from section 17(a) and section 17(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 17a-3,
17a-4, 17a-5, 17a-11, and 17a-13 thereunder.

Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 would establish additional recordkeeping requirements applicable to
broker-dealers that are not dually registered as an SBSD or MSBSP to the extent they engage in
security-based swap or swap activities.
Pursuant to section 15F of the Exchange Act, the Commission is proposing new Rules
18a-5 through 18a-9.15 These new rules would establish a recordkeeping, reporting, and
notification program for stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank
MSBSPs, and securities count requirements for stand-alone SBSDs.16 In addition, pursuant to
sections 15F and 17(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission is proposing new FOCUS Report
Form SBS (“Form SBS”) that would be used by all types of SBSDs and MSBSPs to report
financial and operational information and, in the case of broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer
MSBSPs, replace their use of Part II, Part IIA, Part IIB, or Part II CSE of the Financial and
Operational Combined Uniform Single Report (“FOCUS Report”).17
The proposed new rules are modeled on broker-dealer Rules 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5, 17a-11,
and 17a-13, and on the FOCUS Report. Specifically: (1) proposed Rules 18a-5 and 18a-6 (the
15	

The Commission has proposed new Rules 18a-1 through 18a-4 to establish capital and margin requirements
for SBSDs and MSBSPs, segregation requirements for SBSDs, and notification requirements with respect
to segregation for SBSDs and MSBSPs. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for SecurityBased Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for BrokerDealers, Exchange Act Release No. 68071 (Oct. 18, 2012), 77 FR 70213 (Nov. 23, 2012).

16	

The Commission is not proposing securities count requirements for stand-alone MSBSPs or bank SBSDs.
Broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs would be subject to the existing securities count rule

amendments to Rule 17a-13. While in this release Rule 17a-11 is referred to as a notification rule and Rule
17a-13 is referred to as a securities count rule, Rule 17a-11 can be viewed as a reporting rule and Rule 17a13 can be viewed as a recordkeeping rule. See Prompt Notice of Net Capital or Recordkeeping Violations,

type of broker-dealer. A more detailed discussion of the FOCUS Report appears below in section II.B.2. of
this release.

new recordkeeping rules) are modeled on Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4, respectively (the broker-dealer
recordkeeping rules);18 (2) proposed Rule 18a-7 and proposed Form SBS (the new reporting
rules) are modeled on Rule 17a-5 and on the FOCUS Report, respectively (the broker-dealer
reporting rules);19 (3) proposed Rule 18a-8 (the new notification rule) is modeled on Rule 17a-11
(the broker-dealer notification rule);20 and (4) proposed Rule 18a-9 (the new securities count
rule) is modeled on the Rule 17a-13 (the broker-dealer securities count rule).21
The broker-dealer recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and security count requirements
served as the model for the proposals because SBSDs and MSBSPs are expected to operate in
financial markets and effect financial transactions that are similar to the financial markets in
which broker-dealers operate and the financial transactions that broker-dealers effect.22 In
addition, as discussed below, the objectives of these broker-dealer requirements are similar to the
objectives underlying the proposals regarding security-based swaps. Moreover, the brokerdealer requirements have existed for many years and have established a system of recordkeeping
for securities transactions that reflect and support prudent business practices and accountability
of broker-dealers and have facilitated the ability of securities regulators to review and monitor
compliance with securities laws.23 Consequently, the Commission preliminarily believes the

broker-dealer requirements provide an appropriate template on which to model a recordkeeping,
reporting, and notification program for SBSDs and MSBSPs and a securities count program for
SBSDs. Furthermore, as discussed above, it is expected that some nonbank SBSDs will dually
register as broker-dealers in order to be able to offer customers a broader range of securitiesbased services than would be permitted of a nonbank SBSD.24 Therefore, establishing consistent
requirements could avoid potential competitive disparities between stand-alone SBSDs and
broker-dealer SBSDs with respect to their security-based swap business.
Additionally, in accordance with Title VII, the Commission recently proposed, among
other things, capital and margin requirements applicable to nonbank SBSDs and nonbank
MSBSPs, and segregation requirements applicable to SBSDs.25 The capital, margin, and
segregation proposals that would be applicable to SBSDs were modeled on the capital, margin,
and segregation requirements that are applicable to broker-dealers.26 The broker-dealer capital,
margin, segregation, recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities count requirements are
known collectively as the broker-dealer financial responsibility rules.27 The financial
responsibility rules collectively establish a comprehensive regulatory program designed to
promote the prudent operation of broker-dealers and the safeguarding of customer securities and
funds held by broker-dealers. The recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities count
requirements applicable to broker-dealers are an integral part of the financial responsibility rules
as they are designed to provide transparency into the business activities of broker-dealers and to
24	

Although a broker-dealer SBSD would be able to offer customers a broader range of securities-based
services than a bank SBSD, bank SBSDs are not expected to register as broker-dealers because of the
regulatory burden associated with complying with the requirements applicable to all three types of entities.

assist the Commission and other securities regulators in reviewing and monitoring compliance
with the capital, margin, and segregation requirements. Similarly, the proposed recordkeeping,
reporting, notification, and securities count requirements applicable to SBSDs and MSBSPs
along with the proposed capital, margin, and segregation requirements for these registrants are
designed to establish a comprehensive financial responsibility program for SBSDs and MSBSPs.
Like the broker-dealer rules, the proposed recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities
count requirements applicable to SBSDs and MSBSPs are designed to provide transparency into
the business activities of SBSDs and MSBSPs and assist the Commission in reviewing and
monitoring compliance with the proposed capital, margin, and segregation requirements
applicable to SBSDs and MSBSPs.
While the proposed recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities count rules are
modeled on the broker-dealer rules, stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs will not
engage in the same range of activities permitted of broker-dealers. For example, broker-dealers
are permitted to act as dealers with respect to all types of securities, whereas stand-alone SBSDs
would be permitted to act as dealers only with respect to security-based swaps and stand-alone
MSBSPs would not be permitted to act as dealers with respect to any types of securities.
Consequently, the proposed requirements in the new rules applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and
stand-alone MSBSPs reflect these differences and are narrower in scope than those applicable to
broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs. Further, the proposed requirements applicable
to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs are narrower in scope than those applicable to stand-alone
SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs for three reasons. First, as noted above, the recordkeeping and
reporting requirements for bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs – unlike those for nonbank SBSDs

12 


and nonbank MSBSPs – must be related to their business as an SBSD or MSBSP.28 Second, as
banks, these registrants are subject to existing recordkeeping and reporting requirements
administered by the prudential regulators and therefore to avoid potentially duplicative or
conflicting requirements, the Commission has proposed fewer requirements for these entities.
Third, the prudential regulators – rather than the Commission – will administer the capital,
margin, and other prudential requirements applicable to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs and, as
noted above, one of the purposes of the proposed recordkeeping requirements is to assist the
Commission in reviewing and monitoring compliance with the proposed capital and margin rules
applicable to nonbank SBSDs and nonbank MSBSPs, which the Commission will administer.29
The Commission recognizes that there may be alternative recordkeeping, reporting,
notification, and securities count programs that could be used as a model to design a
recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities count program for SBSDs and MSBSPs.
Accordingly, in response to the requests for comment in this release, interested parties are
encouraged to consider whether alternative approaches would be appropriate for SBSDs and
MSBSPs generally as well as for each type of potential registrant – broker-dealer SBSD, broker28

above, section 15F(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act provides that each bank SBSD and bank MSBSP shall
keep books and records of all activities related to the business as an SBSD or MSBSP in such form and
manner and for such period as may be prescribed by the Commission by rule or regulation (emphasis
added). See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(f)(1)(B)(i). Whereas, section 15F(f)(1)(B)(ii) of the Exchange Act provides
that each nonbank SBSD and nonbank MSBSP shall keep books and records in such form and manner and
for such period as may be prescribed by the Commission by rule or regulation. See 15 U.S.C. 78o10(f)(1)(B)(ii). Further, section 17(a) of the Exchange Act provides that broker-dealers shall make and
keep for prescribed periods such records, furnish such copies thereof, and make and disseminate such
reports as the Commission, by rule, prescribes as necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the
protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C.

participants for which there is a prudential regulator (“bank swap dealers” and “bank swap participants”).
See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(e)(1)(A); 7 U.S.C. 6s(e)(1)(A). The prudential regulators have proposed capital and
margin requirements for bank swap dealers, bank SBSDs, bank swap participants, and bank MSBSPs. See

dealer MSBSP, stand-alone SBSD, stand-alone MSBSP, bank SBSD, and bank MSBSP – taking
into account the unique characteristics and activities of each type of potential registrant.
Some of the current rules that are proposed to be amended and the proposed new rules
prescribe recordkeeping or reporting requirements based on requirements in other rules that have
been proposed but not yet adopted. For example, Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4, as proposed to be
amended, and proposed Rules 18a-5 and 18a-6 would directly or indirectly cross-reference
requirements in proposed Rule 901 of Regulation SBSR and proposed Rules 15Fh-1 through
15Fh-6 and proposed Rule 15Fk-1.30 Similarly, Rules 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5, and 17a-11, as
proposed to be amended, and proposed Rules 18a-5, 18a-6, 18a-7, and 18a-8 cross-reference
requirements in the proposed capital, margin, and segregation requirements for SBSDs and
MSBSPs.31 If a cross-referenced rule is modified from the proposal when adopted, the
Commission intends to make any necessary corresponding modifications to the rules proposed in
this release when they are adopted.
Finally, the Commission also is proposing to add a capital charge provision to proposed
Rule 18a-1.32 Proposed Rule 18a-1 would establish net capital requirements for stand-alone
SBSDs and is modeled on Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act (the broker-dealer net capital
rule) (“Rule 15c3-1”).33 The capital charge provision that would be added to proposed Rule 18a1, which is modeled on a provision in Rule 15c3-1, was inadvertently omitted from proposed
Rule 18a-1 when originally proposed. The Commission preliminarily believes that proposed
Rule 18a-1 should include a provision that parallels the capital charge in Rule 15c3-1.

The Commission staff consulted with staff from the prudential regulators and the CFTC
in drafting the proposals discussed in this release.34 In addition, the proposals of the CFTC were
considered in developing the Commission’s proposed recordkeeping, reporting, notification and
securities count rules for SBSDs and MSBSPs.
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on the general approach that would require SBSDs
and MSBSPs to comply with recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities count rules
modeled on the broker-dealer recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities count rules.
In addition, the Commission requests comment, including empirical data in support of
comments, in response to the following questions:
1.	 Will the entities that register as nonbank SBSDs engage in a securities business with
respect to security-based swaps that is similar to the securities business conducted by
broker-dealers? If not, describe how the securities activities of nonbank SBSDs will
differ from the securities activities of broker-dealers.
2.	 Will the entities that register as bank SBSDs engage in a securities business with respect
to security-based swaps that is similar to the securities business conducted by brokerdealers? If not, describe how the securities activities of bank SBSDs will differ from the
securities activities of broker-dealers.
3.	 How many broker-dealers will register as SBSDs? Describe the types of broker-dealers
that will register as SBSDs and the types of activities these broker-dealers currently
engage in? How many banks will register as SBSDs? Describe the types of banks that

Rules; and Chief Compliance Officer Rules for Swap Dealers, Major Swap Participants, and Futures
Commission Merchants, 77 FR 20128 (Apr. 3, 2012).

will register as SBSDs and the types of activities these banks currently engage in?
4.	 How many entities will register as MSBSPs? What types of entities? How many brokerdealers will register as MSBSPs? How many banks will register as MSBSPs?
5.	 Are there requirements in these proposed rules applicable to broker-dealer SBSDs and
broker-dealer MSBSPs but currently not applicable to stand-alone SBSDs or stand-alone
MSBSPs that should be applicable to standalone SBSDs or stand-alone MSBSPs, or vice
versa?
6.	 Are there requirements in these proposed rules applicable to broker-dealer SBSDs and
broker-dealer MSBSPs but currently not applicable to bank SBSDs or bank MSBSPs that
should be applicable to bank SBSDs or bank MSBSPs, or vice versa?
7.	 Are there provisions in the rules that the CFTC adopted governing recordkeeping and
reporting obligations of swap dealers and major swap participants that the Commission
should consider incorporating into the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for
SBSDs and MSBSPs? If so, please identify the specific provision and explain why the
Commission should incorporate it.
8.	 In the release adopting a further definition of major security-based swap participant, the
Commission stated that an entity’s security-based swap positions in general would be
attributed to a parent, other affiliate, or guarantor for purposes of the MSBSP analysis to
the extent that the counterparties to those positions would have recourse to that other
entity in connection with the position.35 The Commission further stated that an entity that
becomes an MSBSP by virtue of security-based swaps directly entered into by others
must be responsible for compliance with all applicable requirements with respect to those

‘‘Major Security-Based Swap Participant’’ and ‘‘Eligible Contract Participant”, 77 FR at 30689.

16 


security-based swaps (and must be liable for failures to comply), but may delegate
operational compliance with transaction-focused requirements to entities that directly are
party to the transactions.36 The Commission stated its preliminary belief that the same
approach should apply in the cross-border context when the guarantor and the guaranteed
persons are located in different jurisdictions.37 The Commission preliminarily believes
that certain of the recordkeeping requirements that would be applicable to MSBSPs under
the proposed amendments are transaction-focused and, therefore, that an MSBSP may
delegate operational compliance with them to the entities that are directly a party to the
transaction.38 For example, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed
requirements discussed below in section II.A.2. of this release under which MSBSPs
would need to make and keep current memoranda of proprietary orders, confirmations,
accountholder information, and records relating to certain business conduct standards are
transaction-focused. Similarly, the proposed requirements to retain communications
relating to the MSBSP’s “business as such” are transaction-focused. On the other hand,
the Commission preliminarily believes that other recordkeeping requirements proposed
for MSBSPs are entity-level requirements and, therefore an MSBSP would not be
permitted to delegate operational compliance with respect to these requirements to other
entities. For example, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed
requirement that an MSBSP make and keep current a general ledger (or other records)

would be applicable to MSBSPs are not transaction-focused and, therefore, the MSBSP could not delegate

requirements applicable to MSBSPs in proposed new Rules 18a-5 and 18a-6 that they
believe are transaction-focused and to explain their reasons for identifying them as such.
Commenters also are asked to identify any operational compliance challenges with
respect to the proposed recordkeeping requirements raised by attributing guaranteed
security-based swap positions to an MSBSP.

Introduction

As discussed above in section I. of this release, section 15F(f)(2) of the Exchange Act
provides that the Commission shall adopt rules governing recordkeeping for SBSDs and
MSBSPs.39 The Commission also has concurrent authority under section 17(a)(1) of the
Exchange Act to prescribe recordkeeping requirements for broker-dealers.40 Further, section
15F(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act provides that each bank SBSD and bank MSBSP shall keep
books and records of all activities related to its business as an SBSD or MSBSP in such form and
manner and for such period as may be prescribed by the Commission by rule or regulation.41
Section 15F(f)(1)(B)(ii) provides that each nonbank SBSD and nonbank MSBSP shall keep
books and records in such form and manner and for such period as may be prescribed by the
Commission by rule or regulation.42

Section 15F(g) of the Exchange Act prescribes statutory recordkeeping requirements
applicable to SBSDs and MSBSPs and requires the Commission to adopt rules with respect to
these statutory requirements.43 In particular, section 15F(g)(1) provides that each registered
SBSD and MSBSP shall maintain daily trading records of the security-based swaps of the
registered SBSD and MSBSP and all related records (including related cash or forward
transactions) and recorded communications, including electronic mail, instant messages, and
recordings of telephone calls, for such period as may be required by the Commission by rule or
regulation.44 Section 15F(g)(2) provides that the daily trading records shall include such
information as the Commission shall require by rule or regulation.45 Section 15F(g)(3) provides
that each registered SBSD and MSBSP shall maintain daily trading records for each counterparty
in a manner and form that is identifiable with each security-based swap transaction.46 Section
15F(g)(4) provides that each registered SBSD and MSBSP shall maintain a complete audit trail
for conducting comprehensive and accurate trade reconstructions.47 Finally, section 15F(g)(5)
provides that the Commission shall adopt rules governing daily trading records for SBSDs and
MSBSPs.48
Section 15F(i)(1) of the Exchange Act provides that each registered SBSD and MSBSP
shall conform with such standards as may be prescribed by the Commission, by rule or
regulation, that relate to timely and accurate confirmation, processing, netting, documentation,

and valuation of all security-based swaps.49 Section 15F(i)(2) provides that the Commission
shall adopt rules governing documentation standards for SBSDs and MSBSPs.50
After considering the anticipated business activities of SBSDs and MSBSPs, the
Commission is proposing to establish a recordkeeping program for these registrants under
sections 15F and 17(a) of the Exchange Act that is modeled on the recordkeeping program for
broker-dealers codified in Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4.51 Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 specify requirements
with respect to the records that a broker-dealer must make and keep current, as well as how long
and, the manner in which, these records and other records relating to a broker-dealer's business
must be maintained and preserved.52
In particular, Rule 17a-3 requires a broker-dealer to make and keep current certain books
and records.53 The required records include, among other records: blotters containing an
itemized daily record of all purchases and sales of securities; ledgers reflecting all assets and
liabilities, income and expense, and capital accounts; a securities record or ledger reflecting
separately for each security as of the clearance dates all “long” or “short” positions; a
memorandum of each brokerage order; a memorandum of each purchase or sale of a security for
the account of the broker-dealer; and copies of confirmations.54
49

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(i)(1).

50

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(i)(2). Pursuant to section 15F(i) of the Exchange Act, the Commission has proposed
Rule 15Fi-1 that would prescribe standards related to timely and accurate confirmation and documentation
of security-based swaps. See Trade Acknowledgment and Verification of Security-Based Swap
Transactions, Exchange Act Release No. 63727 (Jan. 14, 2011), 76 FR 3859 (Jan. 21, 2011).

Id. As noted above in section I. of this release, the Dodd-Frank Act amended the definition of security in
section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act to include a security-based swap. See Pub. L. 111–203, 761(a)(2); 15
U.S.C. 78c(a)(10). Therefore, each reference in Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 to a security includes a securitybased swap. The Commission, however, has issued temporary exemptive relief excluding security-based
swaps from the definition of security to the extent Commission rules did not otherwise apply specifically to
security-based swaps prior to the amendment. See Order Granting Temporary Exemptions under the

20 


Rule 17a-4 requires a broker-dealer to preserve additional records if the broker-dealer
makes or receives the type of record.55 The categories of records include, among other records,
check books, bank statements, bills receivable or payable, communications relating to the
broker-dealer’s business as such, and written agreements.56 The rule also establishes retention
periods for all records required to be made and kept current under Rule 17a-3 and preserved
under Rule 17a-4, and prescribes, among other things, how the records must be retained,
including requirements for firms that preserve their records electronically.57
The recordkeeping program codified in Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 is designed, among other
things, to promote the prudent operation of broker-dealers and assist the Commission, selfregulatory organizations (“SROs”), and state securities regulators in conducting effective
examinations of broker-dealers.58 As the Commission has stated,
In combination, Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 require broker-dealers to
create, and preserve in an accessible manner, a comprehensive
record of each securities transaction they effect and of their
securities business in general. These rules impose minimum
recordkeeping requirements that are based on standards a prudent
broker-dealer should follow in the normal course of business. The
requirements are an integral part of the investor protection function
of the Commission, and other securities regulators, in that the
preserved records are the primary means of monitoring compliance

with applicable securities laws, including antifraud provisions and
financial responsibility standards.59
Under the proposed recordkeeping program for SBSDs and MSBSPs, broker-dealer
SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs – as broker-dealers – would be subject to Rules 17a-3 and
17a-4.60 The Commission is proposing amendments to these rules to account for the securitybased swap and swap activities of broker-dealers, including broker-dealers registered as SBSDs
and MSBSPs, as well as to implement the specific recordkeeping requirements mandated under
the Dodd-Frank Act.61 Stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank
MSBSPs would be subject to proposed Rules 18a-5 and 18a-6, which are modeled on Rules 17a3 and 17a-4, respectively, as these rules are proposed to be amended.
Proposed Rules 18a-5 and 18a-6 would not include a parallel requirement for every
requirement in Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 because some of the requirements in Rules 17a-3 and 17a4 relate to activities that are not expected or permitted of SBSDs and MSBSPs. Further, the
proposed recordkeeping requirements that would be applicable to bank SBSDs and bank
MSBSPs are more limited in scope because, as discussed above in section I. of this release:
(1) the Commission’s authority under section 15F(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act is tied to
activities related to the conduct of business as an SBSD or MSBSP; (2) bank SBSDs and bank
MSBSPs are subject to recordkeeping requirements applicable to banks; and (3) the prudential
regulators – rather than the Commission – are responsible for capital, margin, and other
prudential requirements applicable to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs. For these reasons, the
proposed recordkeeping requirements that would be applicable to bank SBSDs and bank

Records to be Made and Kept Current

As discussed above, Rule 17a-3 requires a broker-dealer to make and keep current certain
records.63 The Commission is proposing to amend this rule to account for the security-based
swap and swap activities of broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer
MSBSPs.64 The Commission also is proposing additional largely technical amendments to Rule
17a-3.65 With respect to stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank
MSBSPs, the Commission is proposing new Rule 18a-5 – which is modeled on Rule 17a-3, as
proposed to be amended – to require these registrants to make and keep current certain records.66
For the reasons discussed above, proposed Rule 18a-5 does not include a parallel requirement for
every requirement in Rule 17a-3.67 In addition, paragraph (a) of proposed Rule 18a-5 contains

62	

As discussed below in section II.B.2. of this release, the Commission is proposing that bank SBSDs and
bank MSBSPs be subject to a limited reporting program of general information about their overall financial
condition based on discrete elements of the reporting program the prudential regulators have established for
banks.

63	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-3.

64	

Broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs would be required to make and keep current all the
records required of broker-dealers under Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended, plus the additional
records required specifically of an SBSD or MSBSP.

65	

The proposed technical amendments are discussed below in section II.A.2.b. of this release.

66	

See proposed Rule 18a-5.

67	

The Commission is not proposing to include in proposed Rule 18a-5 requirements that would parallel
requirements in paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(13), (a)(14), (a)(15), and (a)(16) of Rule 17a-3. These paragraphs
require broker-dealers to make and keep current records with respect to activities that stand-alone SBSDs
and stand-alone MSBSPs would not be expected or permitted to engage in or would not relate to a bank’s
business as an SBSD or MSBSP, or relate to rules that would not apply to stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone
MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs. Further, the Commission is not proposing to include in
proposed Rule 18a-5 requirements that would parallel requirements in paragraphs (a)(17), (a)(18), (a)(19),
and (a)(20) of Rule 17a-3. These requirements are designed to enhance the ability of regulators,
particularly State securities regulators, to conduct effective and efficient sales practice examinations. See
Books and Records Requirements for Brokers and Dealers Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 66
FR at 55818. By adopting these requirements, the Commission enabled States to adopt and enforce similar
rules on the State level under the National Securities Market Improvement Act of 1996. See National
Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104–290, 110 Stat. 3416 (1996). As discussed

one set of recordkeeping requirements applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone
MSBSPs and paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-5 contains a separate set of recordkeeping
requirements applicable to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs that are more limited in scope.68
As discussed above, section 15F(g) of the Exchange Act provides, among other things,
that each registered SBSD and MSBSP shall maintain: (1) daily trading records of the securitybased swaps of the registered SBSD and MSBSP; (2) daily trading records for each counterparty
in a manner and form that is identifiable with each security-based swap transaction; and (3) a
complete audit trail for conducting comprehensive and accurate trade reconstructions.69 Further,
section 15F(g)(2) provides that the daily trading records shall include such information as the
Commission shall require by rule or regulation.70 To implement section 15F(g) of the Exchange
Act, Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended, and proposed Rule 18a-5 include provisions that,
among other things, are designed to require information that would facilitate a comprehensive
and accurate trade reconstruction for each security-based swap transaction.
In this regard, the amendments to Rule 17a-3 and proposed Rule 18a-5 would require
broker-dealers, SBSDs, and MSBSPs to make and keep current daily trading records,71 ledger
accounts,72 a securities record,73 memoranda of brokerage orders,74 and/or memoranda of

below, the Commission has proposed external business conduct rules for SBSDs and MSBSPs and, as

compliance with these proposed external business conduct rules.

Rule 901 of Regulation SBSR, which would require market participants, including brokerdealers, SBSDs, and MSBSPs, to report certain data elements to security-based swap data
repositories.76
The following data elements that would be required to be reported under proposed Rule
901 also would need to be documented in the daily trading records, ledger accounts, memoranda
of brokerage orders, and/or memoranda of proprietary trades of security-based swap transactions
required under the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-3 and proposed Rule 18a-5: (1) the type of
security-based swap;77 (2) the reference security, index, or obligor;78 (3) the date and time of
execution;79 (4) the effective date;80 (5) the termination or maturity date;81 (6) the notional
amount;82 (7) the unique transaction identifier;83 and (8) the unique counterparty identifier.84

The following data elements that would be required to be reported under proposed Rule 901
would also need to be documented in the securities record of security-based swap transactions
required under the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-3 and proposed Rule 18a-5: (1) the
reference security, index, or obligor;85 (2) the unique transaction identifier;86 (3) the unique
counterparty identifier;87 (4) whether the security-based swap is cleared or not cleared;88 and
(5) if cleared, identification of the clearing agency where the security-based swap is cleared.89 In
addition, the securities record for security-based swaps would parallel the securities record for
securities by requiring a record of whether the security-based swap is a “long” or “short”
position.90
Where a data element that would need to be documented in the daily trading records of
security-based swap transactions under the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-3 or proposed
Rule 18a-5 is substantively the same as a data element that would need to be reported under
proposed Rule 901, the Commission preliminarily believes that the type of information that
would need to be documented in the daily trading records could be the same data element

Amendments to Rule 17a-3 and Proposed Rule 18a-5

Undesignated Introductory Paragraph
Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended, would contain an undesignated introductory
paragraph explaining that the rule applies to a broker-dealer, including a broker-dealer dually
registered with the Commission as an SBSD or MSBSP.92 The note further explains that an
SBSD or MSBSP that is not dually registered as a broker-dealer (i.e., a stand-alone SBSD, standalone MSBSP, bank SBSD, or bank MSBSP) is subject to the books and records requirements
under proposed Rule 18a-5.93
Similarly, proposed Rule 18a-5 would contain an undesignated introductory paragraph
explaining that the rule applies to an SBSD or an MSBSP that is not dually registered as a
broker-dealer.94 The note further explains that a broker-dealer that is dually registered as an
SBSD or MSBSP is subject to the books and records requirements under Rule 17a-3.95
Trade Blotters
Paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 17a-3 requires broker-dealers to make and keep current trade
blotters (or other records of original entry) containing an itemized daily record of all transactions
in securities, all receipts and deliveries of securities, all receipts and disbursements of cash, and
all other debits and credits.96 The Commission is proposing to amend paragraph (a)(1) of Rule
91	

Proposed Rule 901 may be modified when adopted, which could include changing or eliminating certain
data elements required to be reported under the rule. Any such modifications to the data elements could
change the Commission’s preliminary view on the comparability of the information to be recorded in the
daily trading records and the information to be reported pursuant to proposed Rule 901.

17a-3 to require that the blotters specifically account for security-based swaps, and proposing to
include parallel blotter requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-5 that
are modeled on paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended.97 In particular,
paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended, would require broker-dealers,
including broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs, to make and keep current blotters
containing an itemized daily record of all transactions in securities, including security-based
swaps, all receipts and deliveries of securities, all receipts and disbursements of cash, and all
other debits and credits.98 In order to document the attributes of security-based swaps, the
proposed amendments also would require that such records show the contract price of the
security-based swap, and include for each purchase and sale, the following information: (1) the
type of security-based swap; (2) the reference security, index, or obligor; (3) the date and time of
execution; (4) the effective date; (5) the termination or maturity date; (6) the notional amount;
(7) the unique transaction identifier; and (8) the unique counterparty identifier.99
Paragraph (a)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-5 mirrors paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 17a-3, as
proposed to be amended, and therefore, stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs would be
required to make and keep current the same types of blotters as broker-dealers.100 Paragraph
(b)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-5 similarly would require bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs to make
and keep current the same types of blotters but only with respect to their security-based swap
activities.101

General Ledger
Paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17a-3 requires broker-dealers to make and keep current ledgers
(or other records) reflecting all assets and liabilities, income and expense, and capital
accounts.102 These records reflect the overall financial condition of the broker-dealer and in the
Commission’s view can incorporate security-based swap activities without the need for a
clarifying amendment. Because the overall financial condition of stand-alone SBSDs and standalone MSBSPs is a matter of regulatory concern for the Commission, the Commission is
proposing to include a parallel provision in paragraph (a)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-5 that mirrors
paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17a-3.103 Consequently, stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs
would be required to make and keep current the same types of general ledgers.104
Ledgers for Customer and Non-Customer Accounts
Paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 17a-3 requires broker-dealers to make and keep current certain
ledger accounts (or other records) relating to securities and commodities transactions in customer
and non-customer cash and margin accounts.105 The Commission is proposing to amend
paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 17a-3 to require that the ledgers (or other records) specifically account
for security-based swaps, and to include parallel ledger requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of
proposed Rule 18a-5 that are modeled on paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be
amended.106 In particular, paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 17a-3 would be amended to include a
requirement that broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs,

security-based swap: (1) the type of security-based swap; (2) the reference security, index, or
obligor; (3) date and time of execution; (4) the effective date; (5) the termination or maturity
date; (6) the notional amount; (7) the unique transaction identifier; and (8) the unique
counterparty identifier.107
Paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 18a-5 is modeled on paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed
to be amended, and therefore, stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs would be required to
make and keep current the same types of ledgers (or other records).108 Unlike paragraph (a)(3)
of Rule 17a-3, paragraph (a)(3) of proposed Rule 18a-5 would not refer to “cash and margin
accounts” as these types of accounts involve activities that would not be permitted of stand-alone
SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs because they are not registered as broker-dealers.109 Paragraph
(b)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-5 similarly would require bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs to make
and keep current ledger accounts (or other records) relating to securities and commodity
transactions but only with respect to their security-based swap customers and non-customers.110

See paragraph (b)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-5. The Commission has proposed a definition of security-based
swap customer for the purposes of proposed Rule 18a-4. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation
Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital
Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70278. Proposed Rule 18a-4 – which is modeled on Rule
15c3-3 – would establish segregation requirements for SBSDs with respect to their security-based swap
customers. Id. at 70274–70288. The term security-based swap customer would be defined in proposed
Rule 18a-4 to mean any person from whom or on whose behalf the SBSD has received or acquired or holds
funds or other property for the account of the person with respect to a cleared or non-cleared security-based
swap transaction. Id. at 70278. The definition would exclude a person to the extent that person has a claim
for funds or other property which by contract, agreement or understanding, or by operation of law, is part of
the capital of the SBSD or is subordinated to all claims of security-based swap customers of the SBSD. Id.

30 


Stock Record
Paragraph (a)(5) of Rule 17a-3 requires broker-dealers to make and keep current a
securities record (also referred to as a “stock record”).111 This is a record of the broker-dealer’s
custody and movement of securities. The “long” side of the record accounts for the brokerdealer’s responsibility as a custodian of securities and shows, for example, the securities the firm
has received from customers and securities owned by the broker-dealer. The “short” side of the
record shows where the securities are located such as at a securities depository.
The Commission is proposing to amend paragraph (a)(5) of Rule 17a-3 to require that the
securities record specifically account for security-based swaps, and to include parallel securities
record requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed Rule 18a-5 that are modeled on
paragraph (a)(5) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended.112 Paragraph (a)(5) of Rule 17a-3,
as proposed to be amended, would contain separate provisions: one for securities other than
security-based swaps and one for security-based swaps.113 Specifically, paragraph (a)(5)(i)
would apply to securities other than security-based swaps and largely mirror the current text of
paragraph (a)(5) of Rule 17a-3.114 Paragraph (a)(5)(ii) would apply to security-based swaps.115
This paragraph would require a broker-dealer, including a broker-dealer SBSD and broker-dealer
MSBSP, to make and keep current a securities record or ledger reflecting separately for each
security-based swap: (1) the reference security, index, or obligor; (2) the unique transaction
identifier; (3) the unique counterparty identifier; (4) whether it is a “long” or “short” position in

the security-based swap; (5) whether the security-based swap is cleared or not cleared; and (6) if
cleared, identification of the clearing agency where the security-based swap is cleared.116
Paragraph (a)(4) of proposed Rule 18a-5 mirrors paragraph (a)(5) of Rule 17a-3 as
proposed to be amended, and therefore, stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs would be
required to make and keep current the same type of securities record.117 Paragraph (b)(3) of
proposed Rule 18a-5 similarly would require bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs to make and keep
current a securities record of the firm’s securities positions but only with respect to positions
related to their business as an SBSD or MSBSP.118
Memoranda of Brokerage Orders
Paragraph (a)(6) of Rule 17a-3 requires broker-dealers to make and keep current a
memorandum of each brokerage order, and of any other instruction, given or received for the
purchase or sale of a security. The memorandum must show the terms and conditions of each
brokerage order.119 The Commission is proposing to amend paragraph (a)(6) of Rule 17a-3 to
require broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs, to make and
keep current a memorandum of each brokerage order, given or received for the purchase or sale
of a security-based swap.120 The Commission is not proposing to include a parallel provision in
paragraph (a) of proposed Rule 18a-5 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs
because these registrants would not be permitted to engage in the business of effecting brokerage

orders in security-based swaps without registering as a broker-dealer or a bank.121 The
Commission is proposing to include a parallel provision that would be applicable to bank SBSDs
and bank MSBSPs in paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-5 that is modeled on paragraph (a)(6)
of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended.122
Paragraph (a)(6) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended, would contain separate
provisions: one for brokerage orders involving securities other than security-based swaps and
one for brokerage orders involving security-based swaps.123 Specifically, proposed paragraphs
(a)(6)(i)(A) and (B) would apply to securities other than security-based swaps and largely mirror
the current text of paragraph (a)(6) of Rule 17a-3.124 Proposed paragraph (a)(6)(ii) would apply
to brokerage orders involving security-based swaps.125 This paragraph would require a broker-

121	

Generally, persons engaged in brokerage activities are required to register as brokers under section 15(b) of
the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78o(b). Banks are permitted to engage in certain limited securities
brokerage activities. Specifically, section 3(a)(4) of the Exchange Act provides eleven exceptions to
broker-dealer registration for banks. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4). In addition, the Commission and the Federal
Reserve promulgated joint rules establishing further exemptions permitting banks to engage in certain
securities brokerage activities without registering as a broker-dealer. See Definitions of Terms and
Exemptions Relating to the ‘‘Broker’’ Exceptions for Banks, Exchange Act Release No. 56501 (Sept. 24,
2007), 72 FR 56514 (Oct. 3, 2007); 17 CFR 247.100–781. These exceptions and exemptions permit a bank
to act as a broker or agent in securities transactions provided they satisfy certain conditions. Section 716 of
the Dodd-Frank Act (“Swap Push-Out Provision”) generally prohibits providing certain types of federal
assistance, including FDIC insurance, to SBSDs and MSBSPs with respect to any swap, security-based
swap, or other activity of the SBSD or MSBSP. See Pub. L. 111–203, 716. The Swap Push-Out Provision
excludes MSBSPs that are insured depository institutions. See Pub. L. 111–203, 716(b)(2)(B). Further,
SBSDs that are insured depository institutions are permitted to engage in certain swap and security-based
swap activities under certain conditions and still qualify for federal assistance. See Pub. L. 111–203,
716(d) through (f). Thus, a bank SBSD or bank MSBSP may act as a broker or agent in a security-based
swap transaction. In such instances, the brokerage order record requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of
proposed Rule 18a-5 would apply.

See paragraph (b)(4) of proposed Rule 18a-5.

Rule 17a-3 would be redesignated as paragraph (a)(6)(i)(A) and paragraph (a)(6)(ii) would be redesignated
as paragraph (a)(6)(i)(B). The new requirement to make and keep current a memorandum of each securitybased swap brokerage order would be contained in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be
amended.

dealer, including a broker-dealer SBSD and broker-dealer MSBSP, to make and keep current a
memorandum of each brokerage order, and of any other instruction, given or received for the
purchase or sale of a security-based swap, whether executed or unexecuted. The memorandum
would need to include information that is similar to the information currently required under
Rule 17a-3 for brokerage orders.126 In addition, to account for the attributes of security-based
swaps, the memorandum would need to include: (1) the type of security-based swap; (2) the
reference security, index, or obligor; (3) the date and time of execution; (4) the effective date; (5)
the termination or maturity date; (6) the notional amount; (7) the unique transaction identifier;
and (8) the unique counterparty identifier.127
Paragraph (b)(4) of proposed Rule 18a-5 similarly would require bank SBSDs and bank
MSBSPs to document key terms of brokerage orders but only with respect to security-based
swaps.128 Consequently, proposed paragraph (b)(4) would not contain a provision for securities
that are not security-based swaps.129 Instead, the entire paragraph mirrors paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of
Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended, which, as discussed above, relates solely to securitybased swaps.130
Memoranda of Proprietary Orders
Paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 17a-3 requires broker-dealers to make and keep current a
memorandum of each purchase and sale for the account of the broker-dealer.131 Generally,

Commission is proposing to amend paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 17a-3 to require the terms of
security-based swap transactions to be documented, and to include parallel memorandum
requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed Rule 18a-5 that are modeled on paragraph
(a)(7) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended.132 Paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed
to be amended, would contain two separate provisions: one for securities other than securitybased swaps and one for security-based swaps.133 Specifically, proposed paragraph (a)(7)(i)
would apply to securities other than security-based swaps and largely would mirror the current
text of paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 17a-3.134 Paragraph (a)(7)(ii) would apply to security-based
swaps.135 This paragraph would require broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and
broker-dealer MSBSPs, to make and keep current a memorandum documenting each securitybased swap transaction for the account of the broker-dealer. The memorandum would need to
include certain information regarding the purchase or sale of a security-based swap for the
account of the broker-dealer that is similar to the information currently required under paragraph
(a)(7) of Rule 17a-3.136 In addition, to account for the attributes of security-based swaps, the
memorandum would need to include: (1) the type of security-based swap; (2) the reference
security, index, or obligor; (3) the date and time of execution; (4) the effective date; (5) the

termination or maturity date; (6) the notional amount; (7) the unique transaction identifier; and
(8) the unique counterparty identifier.137
Paragraph (a)(5) of proposed Rule 18a-5 would require stand-alone SBSDs and standalone MSBSPs to make memoranda of proprietary transactions but only with respect to securitybased swaps.138 This is because a stand-alone SBSD or a stand-alone MSBSP would need to be
registered as a broker-dealer (and therefore would be subject to Rule 17a-3) (or, in certain
circumstances, a bank) to deal in securities other than security-based swaps. Paragraph (b)(5) of
proposed Rule 18a-5 would require bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs to make memoranda of
proprietary transactions but also only with respect to security-based swaps.139
Confirmations
Paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 17a-3 requires broker-dealers to make and keep current copies
of confirmations of purchases and sales of securities.140 The Commission is proposing to amend
paragraph (a)(8) to require that confirmations of security-based swaps be documented, and to
include analogous confirmation requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed Rule 18a-5
that are modeled on paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended.141 Paragraph
(a)(8) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended, would contain separate provisions: one for
securities other than security-based swaps and one for security-based swaps.142 Specifically,

security-based swap transactions and largely mirror the current text of paragraph (a)(8) of Rule
17a-3.143 Proposed paragraph (a)(8)(ii) would apply to confirmations of security-based swap
transactions.144 As discussed above, section 15F(i)(2) of the Exchange Act provides that the
Commission shall adopt rules governing documentation standards for SBSDs and MSBSPs.145
Pursuant to section 15F(i)(2), the Commission proposed Rule 15Fi-1 under the Exchange Act
(“Rule 15Fi-1”) to prescribe standards related to timely and accurate confirmation and
documentation of security-based swaps.146 Under this proposed rule, SBSDs and MSBSPs
would be required to acknowledge and, thereafter, verify security-based swap transactions.147
Consequently, paragraph (a)(8)(ii) of Rule 17a-3 would require broker-dealers, including brokerdealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs, to make and keep current copies of the security-based
swap trade acknowledgments and verifications made pursuant to proposed Rule 15Fi-1.148
Paragraph (a)(6) of proposed Rule 18a-5 would require stand-alone SBSDs and standalone MSBSPs to make and keep current copies of confirmations of all purchases or sales of
securities, which would include securities other than security-based swaps.149 Paragraph (a)(6)
also would specify that, for security-based swap transactions, stand-alone SBSDs and standalone MSBSPs would need to make and keep current copies of the security-based swap trade
acknowledgments and verifications made pursuant to proposed Rule 15Fi-1.150 Paragraph (b)(6)
would require bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs to make and keep current copies of all

confirmations of purchases and sales of securities but only if related to their business as an SBSD
or MSBSP.151 This would require a bank SBSD or bank MSBSP to make and keep current
copies of confirmations relating to transactions in securities, other than security-based swaps, if
the transaction was related to their business as an SBSD or MSBSP. For example, this
requirement would apply if the bank SBSD or bank MSBSP entered into a transaction in the
security underlying a security-based swap to hedge the risk of the security-based swap.
Paragraph (b)(6) also would specify that, for security-based swap transactions, bank SBSDs and
bank MSBSPs would need to make and keep current copies of the security-based swap trade
acknowledgments and verifications made pursuant to proposed Rule 15Fi-1.152
Accountholder Information
Paragraph (a)(9) of Rule 17a-3 requires broker-dealers to make and keep current certain
information with respect to each securities accountholder.153 The Commission is proposing to
amend paragraph (a)(9) to require certain information with respect to security-based swap
accountholders, and to include similar requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed Rule
18a-5.154 The amendments to Rule 17a-3 would add a new paragraph (a)(9)(iv).155 This
paragraph would require broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer
MSBSPs, to make and keep current, in the case of a security-based swap account: (1) a record of
the unique counterparty identifier of the accountholder; (2) the name and address of
accountholder; and (3) the signature of each person authorized to transact business in the

corporation, partnership, or trust), signatures would be required from persons authorized by the
entity to transact business in the account.
Paragraphs (a)(7) and (b)(7) of proposed Rule 18a-5 mirror paragraph (a)(9)(iv) of Rule
17a-3, as proposed to be amended.157 Consequently, stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs,
bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs would be required to make and keep current the same types of
records with respect to security-based swap accountholders.
Options Positions
Paragraph (a)(10) of Rule 17a-3 requires broker-dealers to make and keep current a
record of all options positions.158 The Commission is not proposing to amend paragraph (a)(10)
of Rule 17a-3 to account for security-based swaps.159 In addition, because the records required
under this paragraph are not specific to security-based swaps, the Commission is not proposing
to include an analogous provision in paragraph (b) applicable to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs.
However, in order to facilitate the monitoring of the financial condition of stand-alone SBSDs
and stand-alone MSBSPs, the Commission is proposing to include a parallel provision in
paragraph (a)(8) of proposed Rule 18a-5 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone
MSBSPs.160 Consequently, under the proposed rule, these registrants would be required to make

Release No. 40594 (Oct. 23, 1998), 63 FR 59362 (Nov. 3, 1998). Consequently, it is not included in

spreads, straddles, and other options in which the stand-alone SBSD or stand-alone MSBSP has
any direct or indirect interest or which the stand-alone SBSD or stand-alone MSBSP has granted
or guaranteed, containing, at a minimum, an identification of the security and the number of units
involved.161
Trial Balances and Computation of Net Capital
Paragraph (a)(11) of Rule 17a-3 requires broker-dealers to make and keep current a
record of the proof of money balances of all ledger accounts in the form of trial balances and
certain records relating to the computation of aggregate indebtedness and net capital under Rule
15c3-1.162 The Commission is not proposing to amend paragraph (a)(11) to account for securitybased swaps because the impact of security-based swaps on those computations is reflected in
the amendments to the capital rules that have been proposed by the Commission to apply to
broker-dealer SBSDs and stand-alone SBSDs.163 In addition, because the records required under
the rule are not specific to security-based swaps and because bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs
will be subject to capital requirements administered by the prudential regulators, the Commission
is not proposing to include a parallel provision in paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-5
applicable to these types of registrants.
The Commission, however, is proposing to include a parallel requirement in paragraph
(a)(9) of proposed Rule 18a-5 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs

and stand-alone MSBSPs. As noted above, the Commission will administer the capital rules
applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs.164 Under Paragraph (a)(9) of
proposed Rule 18a-5, stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs would be required to make
and keep current similar records to those required under paragraph (a)(11) of Rule 17a-3 but in
relation to the proposed capital rules for these entities: (1) proposed Rule 18a-1 in the case of
stand-alone SBSDs; and (2) proposed Rule 18a-2 in the case of stand-alone MSBSPs.165
Specifically, paragraph (a)(9) would require stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs to
make and keep current a record of the proof of money balances of all ledger accounts in the form
of trial balances, and a record as of the trial balance date of the computation of net capital
pursuant to proposed Rule 18a-1 or the computation of tangible net worth pursuant to proposed
Rule 18a-2. The trial balances and computations would need to be prepared at least once a
month in relation to the financial reporting on Form SBS that the Commission is proposing for
these registrants under proposed Rule 18a-7.166
Associated Persons
Paragraph (a)(12) of Rule 17a-3 requires broker-dealers to make and keep current records
of information about associated persons of the broker-dealer.167 This requirement will apply to
broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs and, therefore, the Commission is not

MSBSPs would be required to make and keep current a questionnaire or application for
employment for each associated person, which must include the associated person’s identifying
information, business affiliations for the past ten years, relevant disciplinary history, relevant
criminal record, and place of business, among other things.170
Further, the Commission is proposing to amend the definition of associated person in
Rule 17a-3 to include in the definition a person associated with an SBSD or MSBSP as defined
under section 3(a)(70) of the Exchange Act.171 Section 761 of the Dodd-Frank Act added section
3(a)(70) to the Exchange Act to define the terms person associated with a security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant and associated person of a security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant.172 Paragraph (c)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-5
similarly would provide that the term associated person means for the purposes of proposed Rule
18a-5 a person associated with an SBSD or MSBSP as defined under section 3(a)(70) of the
Exchange Act.173 Paragraph (c)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-5 would limit the definition of the term

Liquidity Stress Test
Funding liquidity risk has been defined as the risk that a firm will not be able to
efficiently meet both expected and unexpected current and future cash flow and collateral needs
without adversely impacting either the daily operations or the financial condition of the firm.175
The financial crisis of 2008 demonstrated that the funding liquidity risk management practices of
certain individual financial institutions were not sufficient to handle a liquidity stress event of
that magnitude.176 In particular, it has been observed that the stress tests utilized at the time by
financial institutions had weaknesses177 and the amount of contingent liquidity they maintained
to replace external sources of funding was insufficient to cover the institutions’ liquidity
needs.178

The Commission has proposed that certain broker-dealers, including broker-dealer
SBSDs, and certain stand-alone SBSDs be subject to liquidity stress test requirements.179 In
particular, the Commission has proposed amendments to Rule 15c3-1 that would establish
liquidity stress test requirements for broker-dealers that have been approved to use internal
models to calculate market and credit risk charges when computing net capital (“ANC brokerdealers”), which would include broker-dealer SBSDs approved to use internal models for this
purpose (“ANC broker-dealer SBSDS”).180 The Commission has proposed identical liquidity
stress test requirements for stand-alone SBSDs that are approved to use internal models to
calculate market and credit risk charges when computing net capital under proposed Rule 18a-1
(“stand-alone ANC SBSDs”).181 Under the proposed liquidity stress test requirements, ANC
unsecured funding for one year. Many institutions found that this metric did not capture important
elements of stress that the organizations faced, such as the loss of secured funding and demands for
collateral to support clearing and settlement activity and to mitigate the risks of accepting novations.”)

179	

See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major SecurityBased Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70252–70254 (proposing
funding liquidity stress test requirements).

180	

Id. Rule 15c3-1 requires that a broker-dealer perform two calculations: (1) a computation of the minimum
amount of net capital the firm must maintain; and (2) a computation of the amount of net capital the firm is
maintaining. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1. In computing net capital, a broker-dealer must, among other things,
make certain adjustments to net worth such as deducting illiquid assets and taking other capital charges and
adding qualifying subordinated loans. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(i) through (xiii). The amount
remaining after these deductions is defined as tentative net capital. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(15). The
final step in computing net capital is to take prescribed percentage deductions (“standardized haircuts”)
from the mark-to-market value of the proprietary positions (e.g., securities, money market instruments, and
commodities) that are included in tentative net capital. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi). The
standardized haircuts are designed to account for the market risk inherent in these positions and to create a
buffer of liquidity to protect against other risks associated with the securities business. ANC broker-dealers
and OTC derivatives dealers are permitted, with Commission approval, to calculate net capital using
internal models as the basis for taking market risk and credit risk charges in lieu of the standardized
haircuts for classes of positions for which they have been approved to use models. See 17 CFR
240.15c3-1(a)(5) and (a)(7); 17 CFR 240.15c3-1e; 17 CFR 240.15c3-1f. Broker-dealer SBSDs that seek to
use internal models to calculate market and credit risk charges when computing net capital would need to
be approved to operate as ANC broker-dealers. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for
Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for
Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70217–70256. Theoretically, a broker-dealer MSBSP could be authorized to
operate as an ANC broker-dealer, in which case it would be subject to the liquidity stress test requirement.

broker-dealers and stand-alone ANC SBSDs would be required, among other things, to conduct a
liquidity stress test at least monthly that takes into account certain assumed conditions lasting for
thirty consecutive days and to establish a written contingency funding plan.
To promote compliance with these proposed requirements and the risk management
practices of ANC broker-dealers, the Commission is proposing to amend Rule 17a-3 to add a
requirement that ANC broker-dealers, including ANC broker-dealer SBSDs, make and keep
current a report of the results of the monthly liquidity stress test, a record of the assumptions
underlying the liquidity stress test, and the liquidity funding plan required under the proposed
amendments to Rule 15c3-1.182 The Commission is not proposing to include a similar provision
in paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-5 applicable to bank SBSDs because these registrants
would not be subject to the Commission’s capital requirements, including the funding liquidity
stress test requirement. However, the Commission is proposing to include a parallel provision
applicable to stand-alone SBSDs in paragraph (a) of proposed Rule 18a-5 that is modeled on the
requirement that would be added to Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended.183 Consequently,
stand-alone ANC SBSDs would be required to make and keep current a report of the results of
the monthly liquidity stress test, a record of the assumptions underlying the liquidity stress test,
and the liquidity funding plan.184

MSBSPs.185 Proposed Rule 18a-3 would require nonbank SBSDs, among other things, to
perform two daily calculations for each security-based swap account: the amount of equity in the
account and a margin amount for the account.186 Nonbank MSBSPs would be required to
calculate only the equity in the account.187 The Commission is proposing to require that nonbank
SBSDs and nonbank MSBSPs make and keep current a record of the daily calculations that
would be required under Rule 18a-3 by amending Rule 17a-3 and including a parallel provision
in paragraph (a) of proposed Rule 18a-5.188 The objective of these requirements is to promote
compliance with proposed Rule 18a-3, to require records to assist nonbank SBSDs and nonbank
MSBSPs in managing their credit risk to security-based swap counterparties, and to assist
Commission examiners in reviewing compliance with those rule requirements.189
Possession or Control Requirements under Proposed Rule 18a-4
Rule 15c3-3 under the Exchange Act (“Rule 15c3-3”) requires a broker-dealer that carries
customer securities or cash (a “carrying broker-dealer”) to maintain physical possession or
control over customers’ fully paid and excess margin securities.190 Physical possession or

As discussed above in section I. of this release, section 15F(e)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act provides that the
prudential regulators shall prescribe capital and margin requirements for bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs.
See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(e)(1)(A).

190	

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(d). The term fully paid securities includes all securities carried for the account of
a customer in a special cash account as defined in Regulation T promulgated by the Federal Reserve, as
well as margin equity securities within the meaning of Regulation T which are carried for the account of a
customer in a general account or any special account under Regulation T during any period when section 8
of Regulation T (12 CFR 220.8) specifies that margin equity securities shall have no loan value in a general
account or special convertible debt security account, and all such margin equity securities in such account if
they are fully paid: provided, however, that the term fully paid securities shall not apply to any securities

control means the carrying broker-dealer must hold these securities in one of several locations
specified in Rule 15c3-3 and free of liens or any other interest that could be exercised by a third
party to secure an obligation of the broker-dealer.191 Permissible locations include a bank, as
defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Exchange Act, and a clearing agency.192 The Commission has
proposed Rule 18a-4 to establish security-based swap customer protection requirements that are
modeled on the requirements in Rule 15c3-3.193 Paragraph (b)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-4 would
require an SBSD to promptly obtain and thereafter maintain physical possession or control of all
excess securities collateral carried for the accounts of security-based swap customers.194 The

which are purchased in transactions for which the customer has not made full payment. See 17 CFR
240.15c3-3(a)(3). The term margin securities means those securities carried for the account of a customer
in a general account as defined in Regulation T, as well as securities carried in any special account other
than the securities referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 15c3-3. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(4). The term
excess margin securities means those securities referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of Rule 15c3-3 carried for
the account of a customer having a market value in excess of 140% of the total of the debit balances in the
customer’s account or accounts encompassed by paragraph (a)(4) of Rule 15c3-3 which the broker-dealer
identifies as not constituting margin securities. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(5).
191	

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(c). Customer securities held by the carrying broker-dealer are not assets of the
firm. Rather, the carrying broker-dealer holds them in a custodial capacity and the possession or control
requirement is designed to ensure that the carrying broker-dealer treats them in a manner that allows for
their prompt return.

See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major SecurityBased Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70274–70288. As brokerdealers, broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs would be subject to Rule 15c3-3 with respect to
customers that are not security-based swap customers and, in the case of a broker-dealer SBSD, Rule 18a-4
with respect to security-based swap customers. Id. at 70277 (“A broker-dealer SBSD would need to treat
security-based swap accounts separately from other securities accounts and, consequently, would need to
perform separate possession or control and reserve account computations for security-based swap accounts
and other securities accounts. The former would be subject to the possession or control and reserve
account requirements in proposed new Rule 18a-4 and the latter would continue to be subject to the
analogous requirements in Rule 15c3-3. This would keep separate the segregated customer property related
to security-based swaps from customer property related to other securities, including property of retail
securities customers.”).

194	

Under proposed Rule 18a-4, the term excess securities collateral would be defined to mean securities and
money market instruments carried for the account of a security-based swap customer that have a market
value in excess of the current exposure of the SBSD to the customer, excluding, under certain specified
conditions, securities or money market instruments used to meet a margin requirement of a registered
security-based swap clearing agency or of another SBSD. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation
Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital
Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70279. As noted above, the term security-based swap customer
would be defined to mean any person from whom or on whose behalf the SBSD has received or acquired or

47 


physical possession or control requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-4 would
prohibit SBSDs from lending or hypothecating excess securities collateral of security-based
swap customers, and would require SBSDs to either physically hold excess securities collateral
or to custody the collateral in a satisfactory control location.195 Paragraph (b)(2) of proposed
new Rule 18a-4 would identify five satisfactory control locations for excess securities
collateral.196 Paragraph (b)(3) of Rule 18a-4 would require that each business day the SBSD
must determine from its books and records the quantity of excess securities collateral that the
firm had in its possession or control as of the close of the previous business day and the quantity
of excess securities collateral the firm did not have in its possession or control on that day.197
The paragraph would provide further that the SBSD must take steps to retrieve excess securities
collateral from certain specifically identified non-control locations if securities and money
market instruments of the same issue and class are at these locations.198
The Commission is proposing to require that all SBSDs make and keep current a record
of compliance with the possession or control requirement under proposed Rule 18a-4 by
amending Rule 17a-3 to add this new requirement and including parallel requirements in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed Rule 18a-5.199 Consequently, this new recordkeeping

holds funds or other property for the account of the person with respect to a cleared or non-cleared securitybased swap transaction. Id. at 70278. The definition would exclude a person to the extent that person has
a claim for funds or other property which by contract, agreement or understanding, or by operation of law,
is part of the capital of the SBSD or is subordinated to all claims of security-based swap customers of the
SBSD. Id.

requirement would apply to broker-dealer SBSDs, stand-alone SBSDs, and bank SBSDs.200 The
records required under this proposal would need to document that each business day the firm
took the steps required under paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-3 described above. The
objective of this new recordkeeping requirement would be to promote compliance with the
possession or control requirements of proposed Rule 18a-4 and to assist Commission examiners
in reviewing compliance.
Customer Reserve Requirements under Proposed Rule 18a-4
Rule 15c3-3 requires a carrying broker-dealer to maintain a reserve of funds or qualified
securities in an account at a bank that is at least equal in value to the net cash owed to
customers.201 The amount of net cash owed to customers is computed pursuant to a formula set
forth in Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3.202 The Commission has proposed a parallel requirement in
proposed Rule 18a-4.203 Proposed Rule 18a-4 would require an SBSD, among other things, to
maintain a security-based swap customer reserve account at an unaffiliated bank separate from
any other bank account of the SBSD.204 Further, it would provide that the SBSD must at all
times maintain in the security-based swap customer reserve account cash and/or qualified
securities in amounts computed daily in accordance with Exhibit A to proposed Rule 18a-4.205

200	

See id.

201	

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(e). The term qualified security is defined in Rule 15c3-3 to mean a security issued
by the U.S. or a security in respect of which the principal and interest are guaranteed by the U.S. See 17
CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(6).

above, broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs would be subject to Rule 15c3-3 with respect to
customers that are not security-based swap customers and, in the case of a broker-dealer SBSD, Rule 18a-4
with respect to security-based swap customers.

The Commission is proposing to require that all types of SBSDs make and keep current a
record of their reserve computations under proposed Rule 18a-4 by amending Rule 17a-3 to add
the requirement and to include parallel requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed Rule
18a-5.206 The objective of this requirement would be to promote SBSD compliance with the
customer reserve computation requirement and to assist Commission examiners in reviewing
compliance.
Unverified Transactions
Prudent practice requires counterparties to promptly confirm the terms of executed OTC
derivatives transactions.207 Consequently, the Commission proposed Rule 15Fi-1 to promote the
efficient operation of the security-based swap market and to facilitate market participants’
management of the risk of trading in security-based swaps.208 Among other things, proposed
Rule 15Fi-1 would require broker-dealers, SBSDs, and MSBSPs to provide trade
acknowledgments containing the details of a security-based swap transaction within prescribed
timeframes and to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are
reasonably designed to obtain prompt verification of the terms of the trade acknowledgments.209
To promote compliance with proposed Rule 15Fi-1 and the risk management practices of
broker-dealers, SBSDs, and MSBSPs, the Commission is proposing to amend Rule 17a-3 to add
a requirement to make a record of each security-based swap trade acknowledgment that is not
verified within five business days of execution and to include parallel provisions in paragraphs

206

See paragraph (a)(27) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended; paragraphs (a)(14) and (b)(10) of
proposed Rule 18a-5.

(a) and (b) of proposed Rule 18a-5.210 Consequently, all types of SBSDs and MSBSPs would be
required to make and keep current these records. While the Commission did not prescribe a
timeframe in proposed Rule 15Fi-1 within which security-based swap trade acknowledgements
would need to be verified, the proposed rule does require procedures reasonably designed to
obtain “prompt verification.”211 The proposed requirement to make a record of security-based
swap trade acknowledgments that are not verified within five business days is not intended to
establish a maximum timeframe within which verification should be obtained under proposed
Rule 15Fi-1. The five business day threshold is designed to require SBSDs and MSBSPs to
make a record of transactions that have gone unverified for a significant length of time.212 This
could indicate a deficiency in the controls established to verify transactions or the existence of a
disagreement with the counterparty as to the terms of the transaction.
Records Relating to Business Conduct Standards
The Commission has proposed Rules 15Fh-1 through 15Fh-6 and Rule 15Fk-1 to establish
external business conduct requirements for SBSDs and MSBSPs.213 As currently proposed, the
requirements in these rules, would address (among other things):


Verification of the status of the counterparty; 




Certain disclosures related to the daily mark and its calculation; 




Disclosures regarding material incentives, conflicts of interest, material risks, and 

characteristics of the security-based swap, and certain clearing rights;

210	

See paragraph (a)(28) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended; paragraphs (a)(15) and (b)(11) of
proposed Rule 18a-5.

211	

See Trade Acknowledgment and Verification of Security-Based Swap Transactions, 76 FR at 3866.

212	

Proposed Rule 15Fi-1 requires registered entities to verify the terms of security-based swap transactions
with the counterparty. However, a party that is not a registered entity is not required to verify a securitybased swap transaction. Registered entities must have procedures to verify security-based swap
transactions with unregistered entities. Id. at 3866-3867.

213	

See Business Conduct Standards for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap
Participants, Exchange Act Release No. 64766 (June 29, 2011), 76 FR 42396 (July 18, 2011).



Certain “know your counterparty” and suitability obligations for SBSDs;




Supervisory requirements including written policies and procedures; 




Certain requirements regarding interactions with special entities; 




Provisions intended to prevent SBSDs and independent representatives of special entities 

from engaging in certain “pay to play” activities; and



Certain minimum requirements relating to chief compliance officers.
To promote compliance with these external business conduct standards, the Commission

is proposing amendments to Rule 17a-3 and to include parallel provisions in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of proposed Rule 18a-5.214 First, the Commission is proposing that all types of SBSDs be
required to make and keep current a record that demonstrates their compliance with proposed
Rule 15Fh-6 (regarding political contributions by certain security-based swap
dealers).215 Second, the Commission is proposing that all types of SBSDs and MSBSPs be
required to make and keep current a record that demonstrates their compliance with proposed
Rules 15Fh-1 through 15Fh-5 and Rule 15Fk-1, as applicable.216 These paragraphs would
require covered firms to keep supporting documents evidencing their compliance with the
business conduct standards; a mere attestation of compliance would not be sufficient. To the

See paragraph (a)(30) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended; paragraphs (a)(17) and (b)(13) of
proposed Rule 18a-5. Paragraph (b)(2) of proposed Rule 15Fk-1 would require chief compliance officers
of SBSDs and MSBSPs to establish, maintain and review written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to achieve compliance with section 15F of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, by the
SBSDs and MSBSPs.

extent that the rules require providing or receiving written disclosures or written representations,
the SBSD or MSBSP would be required to retain a copy of such disclosure or representation.217
Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment on the proposals to require broker-dealers,
SBSDs, and MSBSPs to make and keep current certain types of records. In addition, the
Commission requests comment, including empirical data in support of comments, in response to
the following questions:
1.	 Are the provisions in Rule 17a-3 that would be included as parallel provisions in
paragraph (a) of proposed Rule 18a-5 appropriate for stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone
MSBSPs? If not, explain why not. Are there alternative provisions the Commission
should consider? If so, describe them. Are there provisions in Rule 17a-3 that are not
being included as parallel provisions in paragraph (a) of proposed Rule 18a-5 that would
be appropriate for stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs? If so, explain why.
2.	 Are the provisions in Rule 17a-3 that would be included as parallel provisions in
paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-5 appropriate for bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs? If
not, explain why not. Are there alternative provisions the Commission should consider?
If so, describe them. Are there provisions in Rule 17a-3 that are not being included as
parallel provisions in paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-5 that would be appropriate for
bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs? If so, explain why.
3.	 Are the recordkeeping provisions that would be added to paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-3
appropriate for broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer

217

See paragraph (a)(14) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended; paragraphs (b)(1)(xii) and (b)(2)(vii) of
proposed Rule 18a-6.

53 


MSBSPs? If not, explain why not. Are there alternative provisions the Commission
should consider? If so, describe them.
4.	 Paragraph (a)(23) of Rule 17a-3, as recently amended, requires certain broker-dealers to
make and keep current a record documenting the broker-dealer’s credit, market, and
liquidity risk management controls.218 Should an analogous requirement be added to
Rule 18a-5? Explain why or why not.
5.	 Is the five business day time frame for triggering the unverified transaction record
requirement an appropriate length of time? Should the time frame be shorter (e.g., three
days)? Should the time frame be longer (e.g., seven or ten days)?
6.	 How do the types of records that would need to be made under Rule 17a-3, as proposed
to be amended, and proposed Rule 18a-5 align with the types of records that an FCM or a
swap dealer would be required to make? Commenters are asked to identify and explain
requirements that they believe would result in a dually registered entity (e.g., a brokerdealer/FCM or an SBSD/swap dealer) needing to make two sets of records that address
the same matter or information as opposed to a single record that includes information
that would satisfy requirements of both recordkeeping programs.
7.	 As noted above, certain data elements that would need to be documented under the
proposed amendments to Rule 17a-3 or proposed Rule 18a-5 are substantively the same
as certain data elements that would need to be reported under proposed Rule 901. Should
any additional data elements required to be reported under proposed Rule 901 be required
to be recorded in the daily trading records under the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-3
or proposed Rule 18a-5? Are any of the data elements that would be required to be

218

See Financial Responsibility Rules for Broker-Dealers, 78 FR at 51907.

54 


recorded in the daily trading records not appropriate for such records? If so, identify
them and explain why. Are there any data elements that should be required to be
recorded even though they are not required by proposed Rule 901? If so, identify them
and explain why.
8.	 Can the data elements with respect to security-based swaps that would be required to be
recorded in the daily trading records under the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-3 and
proposed Rule 18a-5 be stored in, and retrieved from, a single database in order to
generate the various types of records that would need to be made (e.g., ledger accounts,
securities record, memoranda of brokerage orders, and memoranda of proprietary trades)?
If not, explain why not. If so, describe any system changes that would need to be made
and identify, estimate, and quantify the burden(s) associated with such system changes.
9.	 Paragraph (a)(29) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended, and paragraphs (a)(16) and
(b)(12) of proposed Rule 18a-5 require broker-dealer SBSDs, stand-alone SBSDs, and
bank SBSDs, respectively, to make and keep a record that demonstrates they complied
with the business conduct standards required under proposed Rule 15Fh-6. Should these
paragraphs also require these entities to make and keep specified records pertaining to
proposed Rule 15Fh-6 to help in evaluating compliance? Explain why or why not. For
example, based on the provisions of proposed Rule 15Fh-6, should the following rule text
be used in paragraphs (a)(29) and (a)(30) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended (and
in paragraphs (a)(16) and (a)(17), and paragraphs (b)(12) and (b)(13) of proposed Rule
18a-5):
“(29) A record with respect to § 240.15Fh-6 [as proposed at 76 FR 42396, July
18, 2011] containing the following information:

55 


(i) The names, titles, and business and residence addresses of all covered
associates of the broker or dealer;
(ii) All municipal entities to which a broker or dealer has provided services in
connection with the solicitation or entry into security-based swaps or trading strategies
involving security-based swaps in the past five years, but not before six months prior to
the effective date of § 240.15Fh-6 [as proposed at 76 FR 42396, July 18, 2011]; and
(iii) In chronological order, all direct or indirect contributions made by the broker
or dealer or any of its covered associates (including contributions made up to six months
prior to becoming a covered associate) to an official of a municipal entity, or direct or
indirect payments to a political party of a state or political subdivision thereof, or to a
political action committee, including:
(A) The name and title of each contributor;
(B) The name and title, including the city, county, state, or other political
subdivision, of each recipient of a contribution or payment;
(C) Whether the contributor was entitled to vote for the recipient at the time of
the contribution;
(D) The amount and date of each contribution and payment; and
(E) Whether any such contribution was the subject of the exception for certain
returned contributions pursuant to § 240.15Fh-6(d) or (e) [as proposed at 76 FR 42396,
July 18, 2011]; and
(iv) The name and business address of each municipal advisor to whom the
broker or dealer provides or agrees to provide, directly or indirectly, payment to solicit a
municipal entity for services on its behalf; and, for purposes of this paragraph, the terms

56 


contribution, covered associates, municipal entity, official of municipal entity, payment
and solicit will have the same meaning as set forth in § 240.15Fh-6(a) [as proposed at 76
FR 42396, July 18, 2011].
(30) A record that demonstrates the broker or dealer has complied with the
business conduct standards as required under § 240.15Fh-1 through § 240.15Fh-6 and
§ 240.15Fk-1 [as proposed at 76 FR 42396, July 18, 2011].”?
If this rule text should be used, explain why. If this rule text should not be used, explain
why not. Is there alternative rule text that should be used? If so, explain why alternative
rule text should be used?
b.

Additional Proposed Amendments to Rule 17a-3

The Commission is proposing several amendments to Rule 17a-3 to eliminate obsolete
text, improve readability, and modernize terminology. Reference is made throughout Rule 17a-3
to “members” of a national securities exchange as a distinct class of registrant in addition to
“brokers” and “dealers”. The Commission is proposing to remove these references to
“members” given that the rule applies to brokers-dealers, which would include members of a
national securities exchange that are brokers-dealers.219 The Commission is proposing a second
global change that would replace the word “shall” in the rule with the word “must” or “will”
where appropriate.220 Similarly, when defining terms, the Commission is proposing to replace

219	

The proposed amendments would delete the word “member” from the title and from the following
paragraphs of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended: (a), (a)(3), (a)(5)(i), (a)(6)(i), (a)(7)(i), (a)(8)(i),
(a)(9), (a)(10), (a)(11), (a)(12), (a)(17)(i), (a)(18), (a)(19), (a)(20), (a)(22), (b), (e), (f)(2), and (f)(4). See
Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended.

220	

The proposed amendments would replace the word “shall” with the word “must” or “will” in the following
paragraphs of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended: (a), (a)(6)(i)(A), (a)(7)(i), (a)(10), (a)(11), (a)(12)(i),
(a)(16)(ii), (a)(17)(i), (a)(18)(i), (a)(19)(i), (b), (d), (e), and (f)(4). See Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be
amended.

57 


the phrase “shall mean” with the word “means”.221 The Commission also proposes to make
certain stylistic, corrective, and punctuation amendments to improve the rule’s readability.222
The Commission is proposing to simplify the text in paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-3 to state
that Rule 17a-3 applies to “every broker or dealer”, since the undesignated introductory
paragraph already provides sufficient detail as to the types of registrants to which the rule
applies.223
In recognition of the fact that broker-dealers may execute orders for non-customers, the
Commission is proposing to amend paragraph (a)(6) of Rule 17a-3 to specify that a broker-dealer
must maintain a copy of the customer’s or non-customer’s subscription agreement.
The Commission is proposing to restructure paragraph (a)(11) of Rule 17a-3 to eliminate
paragraphs (a)(11)(i)-(ii).224 Under these amendments, the text of paragraph (a)(11)(i) of Rule
17a-3 would be set forth in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(11) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed
to be amended, and the text of paragraph (a)(11)(ii) would be deleted from the rule.225

221	

The proposed amendments would replace the phrase “shall mean” with the word “means” in the following
paragraphs of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended: (a)(6)(i)(A), (a)(16)(ii)(A), and (a)(16)(ii)(B). See
Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended.

222	

The Commission proposes the following stylistic and corrective changes to Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be
amended: (1) adding to paragraph (a)(1) the phrase “such securities were”; (2) adding to paragraph
(a)(4)(vi) the word “and” after the semicolon; (3) replacing the word “of” with the word “or” in paragraph
(a)(5), resulting in the phrase “for its account or for the account of its customers or partners”; (4) replacing
the phrase “purchase or sale of securities” with the phrase “purchase or sale of a security” in the first
sentence of paragraph (a)(6)(i); (5) replacing the word “and” with the word “or” in paragraph (a)(7),
resulting in the phrase “A memorandum of each purchase or sale”; (6) replacing the phrase “in respect of”
to with the phrase “with respect to” in paragraph (a)(9); (7) adding the phrase “, as applicable:” after the
word “indicating” in paragraph (a)(9); (8) including the word “and” between the second-to-last and last
subparagraphs of paragraph (a)(9) (instead of after every subparagraph); (9) replacing cross-reference in
paragraph (a)(12) to “paragraph (h)(4)” with a cross-reference to “paragraph (f)(4)” due to the proposed
deletion of two paragraphs; (10) amending paragraph (a)(12)(i)(G) to refer to a “broker or dealer” instead
of a “broker-dealer”; and (11) replacing the superfluous “or” with a comma in the phrase “wrongful taking
of property or bribery” in paragraph (a)(12)(i)(G).

The Commission is proposing to amend the “Provided, however” paragraph in paragraph
(a)(12) of Rule 17a-3 that follows paragraph (a)(12)(i)(H) by replacing the list of SROs and
exchanges with the term “a self-regulatory organization.”226 Thus, rather than naming specific
SROs, the paragraph would use the generic term “a self-regulatory organization.”
The Commission also is proposing amendments to paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-3.
Paragraph (b)(1) is designed to avoid duplication and prevent an introducing broker-dealer from
having to make and keep current the same records that would customarily be made by the firm’s
clearing broker-dealer. However, the language in paragraph (b)(1) beginning with the phrase
“Provided, That” is outdated insofar is it references a capital standard that has been superseded.
In revising paragraph (b)(1), the intent of the provision – to avoid the duplicative creation of
records related to transactions introduced by one broker or dealer and cleared by a different
broker or dealer – remains the same. However, the Commission is proposing to clarify the
provision and eliminate the outdated capital standard reference.227 The Commission also is
proposing to delete paragraph (b)(2) as it would be redundant of paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-3, as
proposed to be amended.
The Commission is proposing to remove paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 17a-3. Paragraph
(c) is outdated and references instruments such as U.S. Defense Savings Stamps and U.S.
Defense Savings Bonds that are no longer widely circulated and thus a specific carve-out for

226	

See paragraph (a)(12) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended.

227	

Paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended, would read as follows: “A broker or dealer
registered pursuant to section 15 of the Act, that introduces accounts on a fully-disclosed basis, is not
required to make or keep such records of transactions cleared for such broker or dealer as are made and
kept by a clearing broker or dealer pursuant to the requirements of § 240.17a-3 and § 240.17a-4. Nothing
herein will be deemed to relieve such broker or dealer from the responsibility that such books and records
be accurately maintained and preserved as specified in § 240.17a-3 and § 240.17a-4.”

59 


these instruments from the general rule set forth in paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-3 is antiquated.228
Paragraph (d) provides a de minimis exception from paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-3 for any cash
transaction of $100 or less involving only subscription rights or warrants which by their terms
expire within 90 days after the issuance thereof. This exemption was adopted in 1953 to reduce
the burden and expense of making accounting entries for these rights transactions. The
Commission preliminarily believes that the burden associated with these accounting entries is no
longer significant in light of the technological advances in recordkeeping systems since 1953.229
In addition, the Commission preliminarily believes the removal of this exemption would affect a
small number of transactions.
As a consequence of the proposed removal of current paragraphs (c) and (d) from Rule
17a-3, current paragraphs (e), (f), (g), and (h) would be redesignated as paragraphs (c), (d), (e),
and (f), respectively.
Current paragraph (e) references Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”)
Rule G-8 and states that compliance with such rule will be deemed to be compliance with this
section. The proposed amendments would add the phrase “or any successor rule” to the
reference to Rule G-8 so that the cross-reference does not become superseded over time.

228	

The Defense Savings Bond initiated by the U.S. Treasury and the U.S. Defense Savings Stamps introduced
by the U.S. Postal Service were measures to finance the U.S. effort in World Wars I and II. The bonds
matured in 10 years from the date of issuance. The Defense Savings Bonds were replaced by Series E
savings bonds, which ceased to be issued as of June 1980. Today, these instruments are not widely held
and are valued more as collectibles than for their face value. See information available at
www.Treasurydirect.gov.

See Preservation of Records and Reports of Certain Stabilizing Activities, 18 FR 2879 (May 19, 1953) (“It
has been pointed out to the Commission that the accounting entries appropriate in the case of the usual
securities transaction are unnecessarily burdensome and expensive as to these rights transactions because of
the small sums involved and because in many cases there is no continuing relationship between the
customer and the firm”).

Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment on these additional proposed amendments
to Rule 17a-3, including comment on whether any of the proposed amendments would result in
substantive changes to the requirements applicable to broker-dealers. In addition, the
Commission requests comment, including empirical data in support of comments, in response to
the following questions:
1.	 Paragraphs (a)(12)(i)(E) through (G) of Rule 17a-3 currently require broker-dealers to
retain certain records with regard to certain actions taken against their associated persons
when they were associated with a broker-dealer. Should these requirements be expanded
to include actions taken when they were associated with other types of entities (e.g.,
SBSDs, MSBSPs, FCMs, investment advisers)? If so, which entities should be covered?
Please explain. Also identify, estimate, and quantify any associated burdens with
expanding these requirements to include actions taken when broker-dealers are associated
with these other types of entities.
2.	 Do broker-dealers still rely on the exemptions provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (c), and/or
(d) of Rule 17a-3? If so, quantify the extent to which these exemptions are relied on, and
the burden associated with the Commission’s proposal to eliminate these exemptions. In
addition, would any system changes be needed if the exemptions provided in paragraphs
(b)(2), (c), and/or (d) of Rule 17a-3 were eliminated? If so, identify, estimate, and
quantify the burden(s) associated with such system changes.
3.

Record Maintenance and Preservation Requirements

As discussed above, Rule 17a-4 requires a broker-dealer to preserve certain types of
records if it makes or receives them. The rule also prescribes the period of time these records
and the records required to be made and kept current under Rule 17a-3 must be preserved and the
61 


manner in which they must be preserved. The Commission is proposing amendments to Rule
17a-4 that are designed to account for the security-based swap activities of broker-dealers,
including broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs.230 The Commission also is
proposing additional largely technical amendments to Rule 17a-4. With respect to stand-alone
SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs, the Commission is proposing
new Rule 18a-6 – which is modeled on Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended – to establish
record maintenance and preservation requirements for these types of registrants.
For the reasons discussed above in sections I. and II.A.1. of this release, proposed Rule
18a-6 does not include a parallel requirement for every requirement in Rule 17a-4.231 In
addition, for the reasons described in section I. of this release, the recordkeeping requirements in
proposed Rule 18a-6 applicable to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs are more limited in scope
than the requirements in the rule applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs.
The proposed amendments to Rule 17a-4 and proposed Rule 18a-6 are discussed in more
detail below.
a. 	

Amendments to Rule 17a-4 and Proposed Rule 18a-6

Undesignated Introductory Paragraph
Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended, would contain an undesignated introductory
paragraph explaining that the rule applies to a broker-dealer, including a broker-dealer dually

230	

Broker-Dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs would be subject to all the record maintenance and
preservation requirements applicable to broker-dealers under Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended, plus
the additional requirements specifically applicable only to SBSDs and MSBSPs.

231	

The Commission is not proposing to include in proposed Rule 18a-6 requirements that would parallel the
requirements in paragraphs (b)(11), (g), (h), (k), and (l) of Rule 17a-4. These requirements relate to
activities that the Commission preliminarily believes would not be relevant to stand-alone SBSDs or standalone MSBSPs. Other requirements in Rule 17a-4 that would not be included as parallel requirements in
proposed Rule 18a-6 are discussed below.

62 


registered with the Commission as an SBSD or MSBSP.232 The note further explains that an
SBSD or MSBSP that is not dually registered as a broker-dealer (i.e., a stand-alone SBSD, standalone MSBSP, bank SBSD, or bank MSBSP) is subject to the record maintenance and
preservation requirements under proposed Rule 18a-6.233
Similarly, proposed Rule 18a-6 would contain an undesignated introductory paragraph
explaining that the rule applies to an SBSD or MSBSP that is not registered as a broker-dealer.234
The note further explains that a broker-dealer that is dually registered as an SBSD or MSBSP is
subject to the record maintenance and preservation requirements under Rule 17a-4.235
Six Year Preservation Requirement for Certain Rule 17a-3 and Rule 18a-5 Records
Paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-4 provides that brokers-dealers subject to Rule 17a-3 must
preserve for a period of not less than six years, the first two years in an easily accessible place,
certain categories of records required to be made and kept current under Rule 17a-3 (the “six
year preservation requirement”).236 Specifically, the six year preservation requirement applies to
records required under the following paragraphs of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended:
paragraph (a)(1) (trade blotters); paragraph (a)(2) (general ledgers); paragraph (a)(3) (ledgers of
customer and non-customer accounts); paragraph (a)(5) (stock record); paragraph (a)(21)
(person who can explain records at each office); paragraph (a)(22) (principal responsible for
establishing compliance procedures); and paragraph (d) (security future product records).237
Consequently, broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs would be required to preserve

63 


for six years the same categories of records as broker-dealers not registered as SBSDs or
MSBSPs.238
As discussed above in section II.A.2.a. of this release, paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed
Rule 18a-5 would contain certain recordkeeping requirements that are parallel to existing
requirements in Rule 17a-3. Under these parallel requirements, stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone
MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs would need to make and keep current certain
categories of records that broker-dealers must maintain under the six year preservation
requirement in Rule 17a-4. Consequently, paragraph (a) of proposed Rule 18a-6 similarly would
require that these categories of records must be preserved for a period of not less than six years,
the first two years in an easily accessible place.239 Further, similar to paragraphs (a) and (b) of
proposed Rule 18a-5, paragraph (a) of proposed Rule 18a-6 contains one set of six year
preservation requirements applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs and a
separate set applicable to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs.240
In particular, paragraph (a)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would apply to stand-alone SBSDs
and stand-alone MSBSPs.241 These registrants would be required to preserve for at least six
years, the first two years in an easily accessible place, the records required to be made and kept
current under the following paragraphs of proposed Rule 18a-5: paragraph (a)(1) (trade blotters);
paragraph (a)(2) (general ledgers); paragraph (a)(3) (ledgers of customer and non-customer
accounts); and paragraph (a)(4) (stock record).242 Paragraph (a)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-6

required under the following paragraphs of proposed Rule 18a-5: paragraph (b)(1) (trade
blotters); paragraph (b)(2) (ledgers of security-based swap customers and non-customers); and
paragraph (b)(3) (stock record).244
Three Year Preservation Requirement for Certain Rule 17a-3 and Rule 18a-5 Records
Paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-4 provides that broker-dealers subject to Rule 17a-3 must
preserve for at least three years, the first two years in an easily accessible place, certain records
required to be made and kept current under Rule 17a-3 (the “three year preservation
requirement”).245 Specifically, paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17a-4 imposes the three year
preservation requirement on the records required to be made and kept current under the
following paragraphs of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended: paragraph (a)(4) (certain
ledgers); paragraph (a)(6) (memoranda of brokerage orders); paragraph (a)(7) (memoranda of
proprietary orders); paragraph (a)(8) (confirmations); paragraph (a)(9) (accountholder
information); paragraph (a)(10) (options positions); paragraph (a)(16) (internal broker-dealer
system); paragraph (a)(18) (associated person complaints); paragraph (a)(19) (associated person
compensation); paragraph (a)(20) (advertisement and sales literature compliance); and paragraph
(e) (records of each broker-dealer office).246

Id. Currently, Rule 17a-4 does not cross-reference paragraph (a)(11) of Rule 17a-3 (trial balances and
computation of net capital). See 17 CFR 240.17a-3(a)(11); 17 CFR 240.17a-4. The Commission is
proposing to correct this omission by adding a cross reference to paragraph (a)(11) of Rule 17a-3 in
paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended. This would require broker-dealers to preserve
these records for three years, the first two year in an easily accessible place. Based on staff experience, the

65 


The Commission is not proposing to amend or change any of the existing crossreferences to Rule 17a-3 in paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17a-4.247 The Commission is, however,
proposing to add cross-references to certain new paragraphs that would be added to Rule 17a-3
to address security-based swap activities of broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and
broker-dealer MSBSPs. Specifically, paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be
amended, would apply the three year preservation requirement to the records required under the
following paragraphs of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended: paragraph (a)(24) (liquidity
stress test); paragraph (a)(25) (proposed Rule 18a-3 calculations); paragraph (a)(26) (compliance
with proposed Rule 18a-4 possession or control requirements); paragraph (a)(27) (proposed Rule
18a-4 reserve account computations); paragraph (a)(28) (unverified transactions); paragraph
(a)(29) (political contributions); and paragraph (a)(30) (compliance with external business
conduct requirements).248
As discussed above in section II.A.2.a. of this release, paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed
Rule 18a-5 would require stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank
MSBSPs to make and keep current certain categories of records that broker-dealers are required
to make and keep current under Rule 17a-3 and certain categories of records the Commission is
proposing broker-dealers be required to make and keep current under amendments to Rule 17a-3.
Under these parallel requirements, stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and
bank MSBSPs would need to make and keep current certain categories of records that currently
are subject to the three year preservation requirement in Rule 17a-4 or, with respect to the new
categories of records, are proposed to be subject to the three year preservation requirement.
Commission believes that broker-dealers have been preserving these records in a manner consistent with
this proposed requirement.

See paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended.

66 


Consequently, paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would similarly require that these
categories of records be preserved for a period of not less than three years, the first two years in
an easily accessible place.249 Further, similar to paragraph (a) of proposed Rule 18a-6, paragraph
(b) would contain two sets of provisions.250
Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would apply to stand-alone SBSDs and standalone MSBSPs.251 These registrants would be required to preserve for a period of not less than
three years, the first two years in an easily accessible place, the records required to be made and
kept current under the following paragraphs of proposed Rule 18a-5, as applicable: paragraph
(a)(5) (memoranda of proprietary orders); paragraph (a)(6) (confirmations); paragraph (a)(7)
(accountholder information); paragraph (a)(8) (options positions); paragraph (a)(9) (trial
balances and computation of net capital or tangible net worth); paragraph (a)(11) (liquidity stress
test); paragraph (a)(12) (proposed Rule 18a-3 calculations); paragraph (a)(13) (compliance with
proposed Rule 18a-4 possession or control requirements); paragraph (a)(14) (proposed Rule 18a4 reserve account computations); paragraph (a)(15) (unverified transactions); paragraph (a)(16)
(political contributions); and paragraph (a)(17) (compliance with external business conduct
requirements).252
Paragraph (b)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would apply to bank SBSDs and bank
MSBSPs.253 These registrants would be required to preserve for a period of not less than three
years, the first two years in an easily accessible place, the records required to be made and kept

paragraph (b)(6) (confirmations); paragraph (b)(7) (accountholder information); paragraph (b)(9)
(compliance with proposed Rule 18a-4 possession or control requirements); paragraph (b)(10)
(proposed Rule 18a-4 reserve account computations); paragraph (b)(11) (unverified
transactions); paragraph (b)(12) (political contributions); and paragraph (b)(13) (compliance with
external business conduct requirements).254
Three Year Preservation Requirement for Certain Other Records
Paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-4 also provides that a broker-dealer subject to Rule 17a-3 must
preserve for a period of not less than three years, the first two years in an easily accessible place,
other categories of records if the broker-dealer makes or receives the record.255 These are not
categories of records a broker-dealer is required to make and keep current under Rule 17a-3 but
rather types of records that a broker-dealer may make or receive in the ordinary course of
business.256
As discussed in detail below, the Commission is proposing amendments to these
provisions in paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-4 to account for security-based swaps, and is proposing
amendments requiring that broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer
MSBSPs, preserve certain additional records related to security-based swap activities. Further,
the Commission is proposing in paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-6 that stand-alone SBSDs,
stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs be required to preserve similar records.

In addition, paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(7) of Rule 17a-4 require the
preservation of certain types of records if they relate to the broker-dealer’s business as such (i.e.,
as a broker-dealer).257 Security-based swap activities of a broker-dealer that is not registered as
an SBSD or MSBSP would be part of the broker-dealer’s business as such for the purposes of
Rule 17a-4 just like activities relating to other types of securities. In the case of a broker-dealer
SBSD or broker-dealer MSBSP, the Commission is proposing to amend paragraph (m) of Rule
17a-4 to make clear that the business as such of a broker-dealer dually registered as an SBSD or
MSBSP would include the firm’s business as an SBSD or MSBSP.258
The following is a discussion of the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-4 with respect to
certain other records that would be subject to the three year preservation requirement and parallel
provisions that would be included in proposed Rule 18a-6.
Bank Records. Paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17a-4 requires broker-dealers to preserve all
check books, bank statements, cancelled checks, and cash reconciliations.259 The Commission is
not proposing to amend paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17a-4 to specifically account for security-based
swaps. However, the Commission is proposing to include a parallel requirement in paragraph
(b)(1) of Rule 18a-6 that would mirror paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17a-4.260 In particular,
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) would require stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs to preserve
these types of bank records.261
Bills. Paragraph (b)(3) of Rule 17a-4 requires broker-dealers, which would include
broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs, to preserve all bills receivable or payable, paid

or unpaid, relating to the business of the member, broker, or dealer.262 The Commission is
proposing to include a parallel requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-6 that
would mirror paragraph (b)(3) of Rule 17a-4. 263 In particular, paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of proposed
Rule 18a-6 would require stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs to preserve these types
of bills.264
Communications. Paragraph (b)(4) of Rule 17a-4 requires broker-dealers to preserve
originals of all communications received and copies of all communications sent (and any
approvals thereof) by the broker-dealer (including inter-office memoranda and communications)
relating to its business as such, including all communications which are subject to rules of an
SRO of which the broker-dealer is a member regarding communications with the public.265 The
Commission is proposing amendments to paragraph (b)(4) to account for security-based swap
activities and to include parallel requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of proposed Rule
18a-6 that are modeled on paragraph (b)(4) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended.266
The proposed amendments to paragraph (b)(4) of Rule 17a-4 also would implement
section 15F(g)(1) of the Exchange Act. 267 Section 15F(g)(1) provides that each registered SBSD
and MSBSP shall maintain daily trading records of the security-based swaps of the registered
SBSD and MSBSP and all related records (including related cash or forward transactions) and
recorded communications, including electronic mail, instant messages, and recordings of

telephone calls, for such period as may be required by the Commission by rule or regulation.268
The term communications, as used in paragraph (b)(4) of Rule 17a-4, includes all electronic
communications (e.g., emails and instant messages).269 Moreover, communications related to
daily trading of security-based swaps would be communications relating to the business as such
of a broker-dealer, including a broker-dealer SBSD and broker-dealer MSBSP. Consequently,
the Commission need not amend paragraph (b)(4) of Rule 17a-4 to establish a retention period
applicable to broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs, with
respect to electronic mail and instant messages relating to their trading in security-based swaps.
However, the Commission has not previously interpreted the term communications to
include telephonic communications. Therefore, to implement section 15F(g)(1) of the Exchange
Act, the Commission is proposing to amend the preservation requirement in paragraph (b)(4) of
Rule 17a-4 to include “recordings of telephone calls required to be maintained pursuant to
section 15F(g)(1) of the Exchange Act.”270 Under this proposed requirement, a broker-dealer
SBSD or a broker-dealer MSBSP would be required to preserve for three years telephone calls

The Commission is proposing to include parallel communication preservation
requirements for stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs
modeled on paragraph (b)(4) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended.272 The provision
applicable to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs would limit the requirement to communications
that relate to the business of an SBSD or MSBSP.273
Trial balances. Paragraph (b)(5) of Rule 17a-4 requires broker-dealers, which would
include broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs, to preserve all trial balances,
computations of aggregate indebtedness and net capital (and working papers in connection
therewith), financial statements, branch office reconciliations, and internal audit working papers,
relating to the firm’s business as a broker-dealer.274 The Commission is proposing to include a
parallel requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-6 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs
and stand-alone MSBSPs that is modeled on paragraph (b)(5) of Rule 17a-4.275 In particular,
paragraph (b)(1)(v) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would require stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone
MSBSPs to preserve similar types of records.276 In contrast to paragraph (b)(5) of Rule 17a-4,
the provision would not refer to computations of “aggregate indebtedness” because this type of
computation would not be part of the capital rule for stand-alone SBSDs or stand-alone

MSBSPs.277 Further, to account for the proposed capital standard for stand-alone MSBSPs, the
paragraph would refer to tangible net worth.278
Account Documents. Paragraph (b)(6) of Rule 17a-4 requires broker-dealers, which
would include broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs, to preserve all guarantees of
accounts and all powers of attorney and other evidence of the granting of any discretionary
authority given in respect of any account, and copies of resolutions empowering an agent to act
on behalf of a corporation.279 The Commission is proposing to include parallel requirements in
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-6 modeled on paragraph (b)(6) of Rule 17a4.280 In particular, paragraphs (b)(1)(vi) and (b)(2)(iii) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would require
stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs, respectively, to
preserve similar types of records, but only with respect to security-based swap accounts.281 For
example, under the proposal, bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs would not be required to maintain
these records with respect to accounts involving exclusively banking related services.
Written Agreements. Paragraph (b)(7) of Rule 17a-4 requires a broker-dealer to preserve
all written agreements (or copies thereof) entered into by such broker-dealer relating to its
business as such, including agreements with respect to any account.282 The Commission is
proposing amendments to paragraph (b)(7) of Rule 17a-4 to account for security-based swaps

and to include parallel requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-6
modeled on paragraph (b)(7) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended. 283 The amendments to
paragraph (b)(7) of Rule 17a-4 would establish a preservation requirement that written
agreements with respect to a security-based swap customer or non-customer, including
governing documents or any document establishing the terms and conditions of such person’s
securities-based swaps, must be maintained with such person’s account records. 284 This
provision is designed to facilitate the examination of the broker-dealer by requiring it to maintain
these records together.
The parallel requirements in proposed Rule 18a-6 would require stand-alone SBSDs,
stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs to preserve similar types of records and
include the same preservation requirement.285 The provision applicable to bank SBSDs and bank
MSBSPs would limit the preservation requirement to written agreements relating to the
registrant’s business as an SBSD or MSBSP.286
Information Supporting Financial Reports. Paragraph (b)(8) of Rule 17a-4 requires a
broker-dealer to preserve records containing various types of information that support amounts
included in the broker-dealer’s FOCUS Report prepared as of the broker-dealer’s audit date and
amounts in the annual audited financial statements the broker-dealer is required to file under
Rule 17a-5 or Rule 17a-12, as applicable.287 The paragraph specifically identifies the types of
supporting information that needs to be preserved, including money balances, securities

applicable to broker-dealers. Compare 17 CFR 240.17a-12, with 17 CFR 240.17a-5.

positions, futures positions, commodity positions, and options positions, among other things.288
The Commission is proposing amendments to paragraph (b)(8) of Rule 17a-4 to account for
swap and security-based swap activities of broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and
broker-dealer MSBSPs, and to include parallel requirements applicable to stand-alone SBSDs
and stand-alone MSBSPs in paragraph (b)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-6 modeled on paragraph
(b)(8) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended.289
The amendments to paragraph (b)(8) of Rule 17a-4 would add a reference to proposed
Form SBS in the introductory text after references to certain parts of the FOCUS Report.290
Thus, broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs – which would file proposed Form SBS
rather than the FOCUS Report – would need to preserve information in support of proposed
Form SBS. Further, the amendments to paragraph (b)(8) of Rule 17a-4 would add the phrase “or
swaps” after the phrase “commodity contracts” and the phrase “and swap” after the term
“commodity” wherever they appear in the paragraph.291 This would require broker-dealers,
including broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs, to preserve the same type of
supporting information with respect to swap positions as is required with respect to commodity
positions.
Paragraph (b)(8)(xiii) of Rule 17a-4 requires broker-dealers to preserve records
containing detail relating to information for possession or control requirements under Rule
15c3-3 and reported on a schedule to certain parts of the FOCUS Report.292 As noted above in

section II.A.2.a. of this release, Rule 15c3-3 requires a carrying broker-dealer to maintain
physical possession or control over customers’ fully paid and excess margin securities.293 The
Commission has proposed a parallel requirement in proposed Rule 18a-4 that would apply to
SBSDs with respect to their security-based swap customers.294 Moreover, as discussed below in
section II.B.2.b. of this release, the Commission is proposing that SBSDs report information
relating to possession or control requirements in proposed Form SBS. Consequently, the
Commission is proposing to amend paragraph (b)(8) of Rule 17a-4 by adding a new paragraph
that is modeled on paragraph (b)(8)(xiii) of Rule 17a-4 but that relates to the possession or
control requirements in proposed Rule 18a-4 instead of the possession or control requirements in
Rule 15c3-3.295 Thus, broker-dealer SBSDs would be required to preserve records that contain
detail relating to information for possession or control requirements under Rule 18a-4 and
reported on proposed Form SBS.
Finally, the Commission’s proposed capital requirements for nonbank SBSDs would
require these registrants to maintain minimum net capital of not less than the greater of a fixeddollar amount or a ratio amount.296 The ratio amount for a broker-dealer SBSD would be the
sum of the current ratio amount prescribed in Rule 15c3-1 and an amount equal to 8% of the

would be an amount equal to the 8% margin factor.298 The term risk margin amount would be
defined as the sum of: (1) the greater of the total margin required to be delivered by the nonbank
SBSD with respect to security-based swap transactions cleared for security-based swap
customers at a clearing agency or the amount of the deductions that would apply to the cleared
security-based swap positions of the security-based swap customers pursuant to paragraph
(c)(1)(vi) of Rule 18a-1; and (2) the total margin amount calculated by the stand-alone SBSD
with respect to non-cleared security-based swaps pursuant to proposed new Rule 18a-3.299
Accordingly, to determine its minimum net capital requirement, a nonbank SBSD would need to
calculate the amount equal to the 8% margin factor.300 The Commission is proposing to amend
paragraph (b)(8) of Rule 17a-4 by adding a new paragraph that would require a broker-dealer

297	

Id. Rule 15c3-1 prescribes two financial ratio requirements. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(1). The first
financial ratio requirement provides that a broker-dealer must not permit its aggregate indebtedness to all
other persons to exceed 1500% of its net capital (i.e., a 15-to-1 aggregate indebtedness to net capital
requirement). See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(1)(i). Stated another way, the broker-dealer must maintain, at a
minimum, an amount of net capital equal to 1/15th (or 6.67%) of its aggregate indebtedness. This financial
ratio generally is used by smaller broker-dealers that do not hold customer securities and cash and is the
default financial ratio requirement that all broker-dealers must apply unless they affirmatively elect to be
subject to the second financial ratio requirement by notifying their designated examining authority
(“DEA”) of the election. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(1)(i) and (ii). The second financial ratio requirement
provides that a broker-dealer must not permit its net capital to be less than 2% of aggregate debit items (i.e.,
customer-related obligations to the broker-dealer). See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(1)(ii). Customer debit items
– computed pursuant to Rule 15c3-3 – consist of, among other things, margin loans to customers and
securities borrowed by the broker-dealer to effectuate deliveries of securities sold short by customers. See
17 CFR 240.15c3-3; 17 CFR 240.15c3-3a. This ratio generally is used by larger broker-dealers that hold
customer securities and funds.

on paragraph (b)(8)(i) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended, except the former would refer to securitybased swap customers rather than customers and not contain a reference to cash accounts; (2) paragraph

proposed to be amended, except the former would refer to security-based swap non-customers instead of
non-customers and to security-based swap accounts instead of securities accounts, and not contain a
reference to cash accounts; (3) paragraph (b)(1)(viii)(C) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would mirror paragraph
(b)(8)(iii) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended; (4) paragraph (b)(1)(viii)(D) of proposed Rule 18a-6

of proposed Rule 18a-6 would mirror paragraph (b)(8)(x) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended; (10)

paragraph (b)(8)(xii) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended, except the former would refer to proposed
Rule 18a-1 (the proposed capital rule for stand-alone SBSDs) rather than Rule 15c3-1 (the broker-dealer
capital rule); (12) paragraph (b)(1)(viii)(L) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would mirror paragraph (b)(8)(xiv) of
Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended; (13) paragraph (b)(1)(viii)(M) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would be

to proposed Rule 18a-1 and proposed Rule 18a-2 (the proposed tangible net worth rule for nonbank
MSBSPs) rather than Rule 15c3-1; (14) paragraph (b)(1)(viii)(N) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would be
modeled on paragraph (b)(8)(xvi) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended, except the former would refer

Rule 18a-6 provisions that would be analogous to paragraphs (b)(8)(iv) and (b)(8)(xiii) of Rule 17a-4, as
proposed to be amended. Paragraph (b)(8)(iv) relates to a provision in Rule 15c3-1 for which there is not a

The Commission is proposing a preservation requirement for bank SBSDs that would
require these registrants to preserve the same types of records related to Rule 18a-4 that brokerdealer SBSDs would need to preserve under paragraph (b)(8)(xiv) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to
be amended, and that stand-alone SBSDs would be required to preserve under paragraph
(b)(1)(viii)(L) of proposed Rule 18a-6.304 Specifically, bank SBSDs would be required to
preserve records containing detail relating to information for possession or control requirements

Paragraph (b)(10) of Rule 17a-4 requires broker-dealers subject to Rule 15c3-4 (i.e., OTC
derivatives dealers and ANC broker-dealers) to preserve the records required to be made under
the rule and the results of the periodic reviews required to be conducted under the rule.309 The
Commission has proposed that nonbank SBSDs and nonbank MSBSPs be required to comply
with Rule 15c3-4.310 Consequently, nonbank SBSDs and nonbank MSBSPs should be required
to preserve the same types of records relating to Rule 15c3-4 as ANC broker-dealers and OTC
derivatives dealers.311
Paragraph (b)(10) of Rule 17a-4 applies the preservation requirements for records
relating to Rule 15c3-4 to broker-dealers, which includes broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer
MSBSPs.312 The Commission is proposing to include a parallel requirement in paragraph (b)(1)
of proposed Rule 18a-6 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs that would
mirror paragraph (b)(10) of Rule 17a-4. 313 In particular, paragraph (b)(1)(ix) of proposed Rule
18a-6 would require stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs to preserve the records

Credit Risk Determinations. Under Appendix E to Rule 15c3-1, ANC broker-dealers are
permitted to add back to net worth uncollateralized receivables from counterparties arising from
OTC derivatives transactions when computing net capital.316 Instead of the 100% deduction that
applies to most unsecured receivables under Rule 15c3-1, ANC broker-dealers are permitted to
take a credit risk charge based on the uncollateralized credit exposure to the counterparty.317 In
most cases, the credit risk charge is significantly less than a 100% deduction, since it is a
percentage of the amount of the receivable that otherwise would be deducted in full. The
Commission has proposed that this treatment be narrowed under proposed amendments to the
capital requirements for ANC broker-dealers so that it would apply only to uncollateralized
receivables from commercial end users arising from security-based swaps (i.e., uncollateralized
receivables from other types of counterparties would be subject to the 100% deduction from net
worth).318 In addition, the proposed capital requirements for nonbank SBSDs permitted to use
internal models to calculate market and credit risk charges when computing net capital (i.e.,
ANC broker-dealer SBSDs and stand-alone ANC SBSDs) similarly would allow these
registrants to take credit risk charges with respect to uncollateralized receivables but only from
commercial end users arising from security-based swaps.319

The method for computing the credit risk charge is set forth in Appendix E of Rule

creditworthiness of the counterparty.321 Paragraphs (c)(4)(vi)(D) and (E) of Appendix E of Rule
15c3-1 require ANC broker-dealers to make and keep current records relating to the bases of
their internal credit assessments of counterparties for purposes of the credit risk charge.322 The
Commission has proposed a parallel requirement for stand-alone ANC SBSDs.323 Paragraph
(b)(12) of Rule 17a-4 requires ANC broker-dealers – and would require ANC broker-dealer
SBSDs – to preserve the records required under paragraphs (c)(4)(vi)(D) and (E) of Appendix E
of Rule 15c3-1 in accordance with Rule 17a-4.324 The Commission is proposing to include a
parallel requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-6 applicable to stand-alone ANC
SBSDs that is modeled on paragraph (b)(12) of Rule 17a-4.325 Consequently, stand-alone ANC

Regulation SBSR. Section 13A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act provides that all securitybased swaps that are not accepted for clearing shall be subject to regulatory reporting.326 Section
13(m)(1)(G) of the Exchange Act327 provides that each security-based swap (whether cleared or
uncleared) shall be reported to a registered swap data repository, and section 13(m)(1)(C) of the
Exchange Act328 generally provides that transaction, volume, and pricing data of all securitybased swaps shall be publicly disseminated in real time, except in the case of block trades.329 On
November 19, 2010, the Commission proposed Regulation SBSR to implement these
requirements.330 On May 1, 2013, the Commission re-proposed Regulation SBSR as part of its
release on cross-border security-based swap activities.331
Re-proposed Regulation SBSR would assign to one side of a security-based swap
transaction the duty to report the transaction to a registered swap data repository.332 Although
any type of counterparty could in theory become a reporting side, re-proposed Regulation SBSR
includes a reporting hierarchy that would assign the duty primarily to SBSDs and MSBSPs. In
addition, re-proposed Regulation SBSR would require SBSDs and MSBSPs to establish,

swap transaction (block trade) for particular markets and contracts and specify the appropriate time delay
for reporting large notional security-based swap transactions (block trades) to the public. 15 U.S.C.

maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that
such entities comply with any security-based swap transaction reporting obligations.333
The Commission is proposing to amend paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-4 to add a requirement
that broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs, preserve the
information they are required to submit to a registered swap data repository under Regulation
SBSR.334 In addition, the Commission is proposing to include parallel requirements in
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-6.335 Consequently, stand-alone SBSDs,
stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs would be required to preserve the same
types of records.336
Records Relating to Business Conduct Standards. As discussed above in section II.A.2.a.
of this release, the Commission has proposed Rules 15Fh-1 through 15Fh-6 and Rule 15Fk-1.337
These rules, among other things, would require SBSDs and MSBSPs to make certain disclosures,
provide certain notices, and make other records.338 The Commission is proposing to amend
paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-4 to add a requirement that broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer
MSBSPs preserve copies of documents, communications, and notices related to business conduct
standards as required under Rules 15Fh-1 through 15Fh-6 and Rule 15Fk-1.339 In addition, the
Commission is proposing to include parallel requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of

proposed Rule 18a-6.340 Consequently, stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs,
and bank MSBSPs would be required to preserve the same types of records.341
Section 15F(h)(4)(C) of the Exchange Act imposes duties on SBSDs that act as advisors
to special entities.342 Proposed Rule 15Fh-2(a) would provide an exclusion to the definition of
acting as an advisor to a special entity. 343 To fall within the exclusion, the SBSD would be
required to obtain a written representation from the special entity that it will not rely on
recommendations provided by the SBSD, and that the special entity will rely on advice from a
qualified independent representative (as defined in proposed Rule 15F-5(a)).344 The SBSD also
would be required to have a reasonable basis to believe that the special entity is advised by a
qualified independent representative (as defined in proposed Rule 15F-5(a)), and the SBSD
would be required to disclose to the special entity that it is not undertaking to act in the best
interest of the special entity as otherwise required by section 15F(h)(4) of the Exchange Act.345
If an SBSD is acting as an advisor to a special entity, section 15F(h)(4)(C) and proposed
Rule 15Fh-4(b) would require the SBSD to make reasonable efforts to obtain such information as
it considers necessary to make a reasonable determination that a security-based swap or trading
strategy involving a security-based swap is in the best interests of the special entity. 346 The
information that would be required to be collected to make this determination includes, but is not

security-based swap transactions generally and of the type and complexity being recommended;
whether the special entity has the financial capability to withstand changes in market conditions
during the term of the security-based swap; and other relevant information.347
Section 15F(h)(5)(A) and proposed Rule 15Fh-5 would require an SBSD or MSBSP that
is acting as a counterparty to a special entity to have a reasonable basis to believe that the special
entity has an independent representative that is independent of the SBSD or MSBSP and that
meets certain specified qualifications, including that the independent representative:


has sufficient knowledge to evaluate the transaction and related risks; 




is not subject to a statutory disqualification; 




undertakes a duty to act in the best interests of the special entity; 




makes appropriate and timely disclosures to the special entity of material information 

concerning the security-based swap;



will provide written representations to the special entity regarding fair pricing and
appropriateness of the security-based swap;



in the case of employee benefit plans subject to the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), is a fiduciary as defined in section 3(21) of ERISA; and



in the case of a State, State agency, city, county, municipality, other political subdivision
of a State, or governmental plan, is subject to restrictions on certain political

The Commission is proposing to amend paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-4 to add a requirement

that broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs preserve records relating to the

(b)(1) and (b)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-6.350 Consequently, stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone
MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs would be required to preserve the same types of
records.351
Corporate Documents
Paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-4 requires broker-dealers to preserve during the life of the
enterprise corporate documents such as articles of incorporation, minute books, and stock
certificate books.352 It also requires broker-dealers to preserve during the life of the enterprise
registration and licensing information such as all Forms BD, Forms BDW, and licenses or other
documentation showing registration with a securities regulatory authority.353 The Commission is
proposing to amend paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-4 to add references to proposed Form SBSE-BD
and proposed Form SBSE-W.354 Forms SBSE and SBSE-W are the registration and withdrawal
of registration forms, respectively, the Commission has proposed for broker-dealer SBSDs and
broker-dealer MSBSPs.355
The Commission is proposing to include a parallel requirement in paragraph (c) of
proposed Rule 18a-6 that is modeled on paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be

bank MSBSPs to preserve the same types of records during the life of the enterprise.357
Paragraph (c) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would reference proposed Form SBSE and proposed Form
SBSE-A rather than proposed Form SBSE-BD because these are the registration forms that the
Commission has proposed for SBSDs and MSBSPs that are not dually registered as brokerdealers.358
Associated Persons
As discussed above in section II.A.2.a. of this release, paragraph (a)(12) of Rule 17a-3
requires broker-dealers, which would include broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs,
to make and keep current records of information about associated persons of the broker-dealer.359
The Commission is proposing to include parallel requirements in Rule 18a-5 to require standalone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs to make and keep current
the same types of records.360 Paragraph (e)(1) of Rule 17a-4 requires broker-dealers to maintain
and preserve these records in an easily accessible place until at least three years after the
associated person's employment and any other connection with the broker-dealer has
terminated.361 The Commission is proposing to include a parallel record maintenance and
preservation requirement in proposed Rule 18a-6 that would apply to the associated person

Regulatory Authority Reports
Paragraph (e)(6) of Rule 17a-4 requires broker-dealers, which would include brokerdealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs, to maintain and preserve in an easily accessible place
each report that a securities regulatory authority has requested or required the firm to make and
furnish to it pursuant to an order of settlement, and each regulatory exam report until three years
after the date of the report.363 The Commission is proposing to include parallel record
maintenance and preservation requirements in proposed Rule 18a-6.364 Specifically, paragraph
(d)(2)(i) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would require stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs to
maintain and preserve in an easily accessible place each report which a regulatory authority has
requested or required the firm to make and furnish to it pursuant to an order or settlement, and
each regulatory authority examination report until three years after the date of the report.365

defined in paragraph (c) of proposed Rule 18a-5.

(h)(3) of Rule 17a-3 defines the term securities regulatory authority to mean the Commission, any selfregulatory organization, or any securities commission (or any agency or office performing like functions)
of the States. See 17 CFR 240.17a-3(h)(3). The Commission is proposing to amend this definition to
include the CFTC and a prudential regulator to the extent the prudential regulator oversees security-based
swap activities. See paragraph (f)(3) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended. Paragraph (h)(1) of
proposed Rule 18a-6 would define the term securities regulatory authority in the same way as that term
would be defined in paragraph (f)(3) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended. Compare paragraph (f)(3)
of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended, with paragraph (h)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-6. As discussed

maintain and preserve the same types of records for the same period of time, but only if the
records relate to security-based swap activities.366
Compliance, Supervisory, and Procedures Manuals
Paragraph (e)(7) of Rule 17a-4 requires broker-dealers, which would include brokerdealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs, to maintain and preserve in an easily accessible place
each compliance, supervisory, and procedures manual, including any updates, modifications, and
revisions to the manual, describing the policies and practices of the broker-dealer with respect to
compliance with applicable laws and rules, and supervision of the activities of each natural
person associated with the broker-dealer until three years after the termination of the use of the
manual.367 The Commission is proposing to include parallel record maintenance and
preservation requirements in proposed Rule 18a-6.368 Specifically, paragraph (d)(3)(i) of
proposed Rule 18a-6 would require stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs to maintain
and preserve in an easily accessible place each compliance, supervisory, and procedures manual,
including any updates, modifications, and revisions to the manual, describing the policies and
practices of the firm with respect to compliance with applicable laws and rules, and supervision
of the activities of each natural person associated with the firm until three years after the
termination of the use of the manual.369 Paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would

supervisory, and procedures manuals for the same period of time, but only if the manuals involve

Electronic Storage
Paragraph (f) of Rule 17a-4 provides that the records a broker-dealer, which would
include a broker-dealer SBSD or a broker-dealer MSBSP, is required to maintain and preserve
under Rule 17a-3 and Rule 17a-4 may be immediately produced or reproduced on micrographic
media or by means of electronic storage media.371 The rule defines the term micrographic media
to mean microfilm or microfiche, or any similar medium.372 The term electronic storage media
is defined to mean any digital storage medium or system that meets the requirements set forth in
paragraph (f) of Rule 17a-4.373 Paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-4 prescribes requirements that are
specific to the use of electronic storage media and paragraph (f)(3) prescribes requirements that
apply to micrographic media and electronic storage media.374 These requirements are designed
to ensure ready access to, and the reliability and permanence of, records a broker-dealer
maintains and preserves using micrographic or electronic storage media.375 Thus, the
requirements, among other things, include safeguards against data erasure, provisions for
immediate verification of stored material, and requirements for back-up facilities.376

The Commission is proposing to include a parallel record maintenance and preservation
requirement in proposed Rule 18a-6, but only with respect to electronic storage media.377 The
Commission preliminarily believes that SBSDs and MSBSPs that are not dually registered as
broker-dealers would not use micrographic media to maintain and preserve records because
electronic storage media is more technologically advanced and offers greater flexibility in
managing records.378 However, the Commission is seeking comment below on whether
proposed Rule 18a-6 should permit micrographic media as an option.
Paragraph (e) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would permit stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone
MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs to use electronic storage media to maintain and
preserve the records required to be maintained and preserved under the rule.379 The paragraph
would prescribe requirements for using electronic storage media that parallel the requirements in
paragraph (f) of Rule 17a-4, which, as discussed above, are designed to ensure ready access to,
and the reliability and permanence of, the records.380
Prompt Production of Records
Rule 17a-4 contains provisions designed to ensure that the records a broker-dealer,
including a broker-dealer SBSD or broker-dealer MSBSP, is required to maintain and preserve
under the rule will be promptly produced to the Commission and other security-regulators. In
this regard, paragraph (i) of Rule 17a-4 contains provisions that apply when a broker-dealer uses
a third party to prepare or maintain the records required to be maintained and preserved pursuant

377

Compare 17 CFR 240.17a-4(f), with paragraph (e) of proposed Rule 18a-6.

micrographic media for the same reasons.

to Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4.381 In particular, the paragraph requires the third-party to file with the
Commission a written undertaking in a form acceptable to the Commission, signed by a duly
authorized person, to the effect that such records are the property of the broker-dealer and will be
surrendered promptly on request of the broker-dealer and including the following representation:
With respect to any books and records maintained or preserved on
behalf of [broker-dealer], the undersigned hereby undertakes to
permit examination of such books and records at any time or from
time to time during business hours by representatives or designees
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and to promptly
furnish to said Commission or its designee true, correct, complete
and current hard copy of any or all or any part of such books and
records.382
The Commission is proposing to include a parallel requirement in proposed Rule 18a-6
that would apply when a stand-alone SBSD, stand-alone MSBSP, bank SBSD, or bank MSBSP
uses a third party to prepare or maintain records required pursuant to Rules 18a-5 and 18a-6.383
Consequently, the third party would be required to file with the Commission an undertaking in
which it agrees, among other things, to furnish to the Commission or its designee true, correct,
complete, and current hard copy of any or all or any part of such books and records.384
Paragraph (j) of Rule 17a-4 requires a broker-dealer, which would include a brokerdealer SBSD or broker-dealer MSBSP, to furnish promptly to a representative of the
Commission legible, true, complete, and current copies of those records of the broker-dealer that
are required to be preserved under Rule 17a-4, or any other records of the broker-dealer subject
to examination under section 17(b) of the Exchange Act that are requested by the representative

SBSDs and MSBSPs to furnish promptly to a representative of the Commission legible, true,
complete, and current copies of those records of the SBSD or MSBSP that are required to be to
be preserved under the rule, or any other records of the SBSD or MSBSP subject to examination
or required to be made or maintained pursuant to section 15F of the Exchange Act, which are
requested by a representative of the Commission.387
Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment on the proposals to require broker-dealers,
SBSDs, and MSBSPs to maintain and preserve certain records. In addition, the Commission
requests comment, including empirical data in support of comments, in response to the following
questions:
1. Are the Commission’s proposals regarding the records SBSDs and MSBSPs must
maintain and preserve under Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended, and proposed Rule
385	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-4(j). Section 17(b) of the Exchange Act provides, among other things, that all records
of a broker-dealer are subject at any time, or from time to time, to such reasonable, periodic, special, or
other examinations by representatives of the Commission and the appropriate regulatory agency of the
broker-dealer as the Commission or the appropriate regulatory agency deems necessary or appropriate in
the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the
Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78q(b). As discussed below in section II.A.3.b. of this release, the
Commission is proposing technical amendments to this paragraph.

386	

Compare 17 CFR 240.17a-4(j), with paragraph (g) of proposed Rule 18a-6. Section 15F(f)(1)(C) of the
Exchange Act provides that SBSDs and MSBSPs shall keep books and records described in sections
15F(f)(1)(B)(i) and (ii) open to inspection and examination by any representative of the Commission. See
15 U.S.C. 78o-10(f)(1)(C). In addition, section 15F(j) of the Exchange Act imposes duties on SBSDs and
MSBSPs with respect to monitoring of trading, risk management procedures, disclosing information to the
Commission and the prudential regulators, obtaining information, conflicts of interest, and antitrust
considerations. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(j). With respect to disclosing information, section 15F(j)(3)
provides that an SBSD and MSBSP shall disclose to the Commission and to the prudential regulator for the
SBSD or MSBSP, as applicable, information concerning: (1) terms and conditions of its security-based
swaps; (2) security-based swap trading operations, mechanisms, and practices; (3) financial integrity
protections relating to security-based swaps; and (4) other information relevant to its trading in securitybased swaps. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(j)(3).

and MSBSPs, including records that must be made and/or maintained pursuant to
provisions in section 15F of the Exchange Act that are not otherwise covered by Rule
17a-4, as proposed to be amended, and proposed Rule 18a-6? Conversely, are these
proposals too broad? Explain why or why not. For example, should the Commission
establish a catch-all record maintenance and preservation requirement in Rule 17a-4 and
proposed Rule 18a-6 that applies to any record relating to the registrant’s activities as an
SBSD or MSBSP or required to be made and/or maintained pursuant to section 15F of
the Exchange Act? Explain why or why not.
2.	 Are the provisions in Rule 17a-4 that would be included as parallel provisions in
proposed Rule 18a-6 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs
appropriate for these types of registrants? If not, explain why not. Are there alternative
provisions the Commission should consider? If so, describe them. Are there provisions
in Rule 17a-4 that are not being included as parallel provisions in proposed Rule 18a-6
applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs that would be appropriate for
these types of registrants? If so, explain why.
3.	 Are the provisions in Rule 17a-4 that would be included as parallel provisions in
proposed Rule 18a-6 applicable to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs appropriate for these
types of registrants? If not, explain why not. Are there alternative provisions the
Commission should consider? If so, describe them. Are there provisions in Rule 17a-4
that are not being included as parallel provisions in proposed Rule 18a-6 applicable to
bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs that would be appropriate for these types of registrants?
If so, explain why.

95 


4.	 Are the recordkeeping provisions that would be added to Rule 17a-4 appropriate for
broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs? If not,
explain why not. Are there alternative provisions the Commission should consider? If
so, describe them.
5.	 Should proposed Rule 18a-6 include a record storage provision that permits the use of
micrographic media? If so, explain why.
6.	 The Commission proposes to establish a retention period for recordings of telephone calls
related to security-based swaps that must be maintained in accordance with section
15F(g) of the Exchange Act. Should the Commission require broker-dealers, SBSDs,
and/or MSBSPs to make recordings of telephone calls relating to security-based swaps?
Should the Commission require broker-dealers, SBSDs, and/or MSBSPs to retain
recordings of telephone calls relating to any topic? Explain why or why not.
7.	 Should the retention period for recorded telephone calls be different than the proposed
three year period? For example, should it be a longer or shorter time frame? If the
retention period should be different than three years, explain how long such recordings
should be kept and why that different retention period would be more appropriate.
8.	 Are there recordkeeping requirements currently not included in these proposed rules that
should be applied to ANC broker-dealer SBSDs? If so, please describe them.
9.	 Are there additional requirements that should be included in these proposed rules to
promote compliance with the external business conduct standards for SBSDs and
MSBSPs? If so, please describe them.

96 


10. Are there additional requirements to promote the disaggregation by the reporting entities
of composite security-based swap transactions into segments based on risk as opposed to
limiting the data collected to the transaction documents? If so, please describe them.
b.

Additional Proposed Amendments to Rule 17a-4

The Commission is proposing several amendments to Rule 17a-4 to eliminate obsolete
text, improve readability, and modernize terminology. Reference is made throughout Rule 17a-4
to “members” of a national securities exchange as a distinct class of registrant in addition to
brokers-dealers. The Commission is proposing to remove these references to “members” given
that the rule applies to brokers-dealers, which would include members of a national securities
exchange that are brokers-dealers.388 The Commission is proposing a second global change that
would replace the phrase “Every broker and dealer” with “Every broker or dealer”.389
The Commission is proposing a global change that would replace the use of the word
“shall” in the rule with the word “must” or “will” where appropriate.390 In paragraph (m) of Rule
17a-4 the Commission would replace the words “shall have” with the word “has”.391 The

388	

The proposed amendments would delete the word “member” from the title and from the following
paragraphs of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended: (a), (b) , (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5), (b)(7), (c), (d), (e),
(e)(1), (e)(6), (e)(7), (e)(8), (f)(2), (f)(3), (i), (j), (k)(1), (k)(2), and (l). See Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be
amended.

389	

The proposed amendments would replace the phrase “Every broker and dealer” with the phrase “Every
broker or dealer” in the following paragraphs of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended: (a), (b), (c), (d),
(e), and (j). See Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended.

390	

The proposed amendments would replace the word “shall” with the word “must” or “will” in the following
paragraphs of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended: (a), (b), (b)(11), (c), (d), (e), (e)(8), (f)(2), (f)(3), (g),
(i), (j), (k)(1), and (l). See Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended.

391	

The proposed amendments would replace the phrase “shall have” with the word “has” in the following
paragraphs of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended: (m)(1), (m)(2), (m)(3), and (m)(4). See Rule 17a-4,
as proposed to be amended.

97 


Commission also proposes to make certain stylistic, corrective, and punctuation amendments to
improve the readability of Rule 17a-4.392
Further, as discussed above in section II.A.2.b. of this release, the Commission is
proposing to eliminate the requirements in current paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 17a-3 and, as a
consequence current paragraphs (e), (f), (g), and (h) would be redesignated as paragraphs (c), (d),
(e), and (f), respectively. The Commission proposes to amend Rule 17a-4 to make
corresponding changes to cross-references to these paragraphs of Rule 17a-3.
Proposed amendments to paragraph (a)(8) would replace the phrase “annual audited
financial statements” with the phrase “the annual financial statements” to reflect the broader
range of documents required by Rule 17a-5. Due to the insertion of paragraphs (a)(8)(xiv) and
(a)(8)(xvi) to Rule 17a-4, as discussed above, the Commission proposes to redesignate
paragraphs (a)(8)(xiv) and (a)(8)(xv) as paragraphs (a)(8)(xv) and (a)(8)(xvii), respectively.
Proposed amendments to paragraph (h) would add after the phrase “Rule G-9 of the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board” the phrase “or any successor rule” to address the
possibility of a future change in how the MSRB’s rules are designated.

392

The Commission proposes the following stylistic and corrective changes to Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be
amended: (1) in paragraph (a), replacing the phrases “paragraphs §” and “paragraph §” with the symbols
“§§” and “§”, respectively; (2) adding the word “and” between phrase “money balance” and the word
“position” in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of Rule 17a-4 for consistency with paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of Rule 17a-4;
(3) replacing the phrase “out of the money options” with the phrase “out-of-the-money options” in
paragraph (b)(8)(ix) of Rule 17a-4; (4) replacing the phrase “paragraph (a)(12) of § 240.17a-3” with the
phrase “§ 240.17a-3(a)(12)” in paragraph (e)(1); (5) replacing the phrase “paragraph (a)(13) of § 240.17a3” with the phrase “§ 240.17a-3(a)(13)” in paragraph (e)(2); (6) replacing the phrase “paragraph (a)(15) of
§ 240.17a-3” with the phrase “§ 240.17a-3(a)(15)” in paragraph (e)(3); (7) replacing the phrase “for the
life” with the phrase “during the life” in paragraph (e)(3) of Rule 17a-4; (8) replacing the phrase “paragraph
(a)(14) of § 240.17a-13” with “§ 240.17a-13(a)(14)” in paragraph (e)(4); (9) replacing the phrase “this
paragraph” with the phrase “this section” in paragraph (f); (10) replacing the phrase “each index” with the
phrase “the index” in paragraph (f)(3)(iv)(B); (11) replacing the phrase “the self-regulatory organizations”
with the phrase “any self-regulatory organization” in paragraph (f)(3)(vi); (12) in paragraph (f)(3)(vii),
adding quotation marks around the phrase “the undersigned” to clarify that the phrase is a defined term;
(13) replacing the phrase “Rule 17a-4” with the phrase “§ 240.17a-4” in paragraph (f)(3)(vii); and (14) in
paragraph (g), replacing the phrase “section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (48
Stat. 895, 49 Stat. 1377; 15 U.S.C. 78o)” with the phrase “section 15 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o”.

Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment on these additional proposed amendments
to Rule 17a-4, including comment on whether any of the proposed amendments would result in
substantive changes to the requirements applicable to broker-dealers.
B.

Reporting
1.

Introduction

As discussed above, section 764 of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 15F to the
Exchange Act.393 Section 15F(f)(2) provides that the Commission shall adopt rules governing
reporting for SBSDs and MSBSPs.394 Further, section 15F(f)(1)(A) provides that SBSDs and
MSBSPs shall make such reports as are required by the Commission, by rule or regulation,
regarding the transactions and positions and financial condition of the SBSD or MSBSP.395 In
addition, the Commission has concurrent authority under section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act to
prescribe reporting requirements for broker-dealers.396
After considering the anticipated business activities of SBSDs and MSBSPs, the
Commission is proposing to establish a reporting program for these registrants under sections
15F and 17(a) of the Exchange Act that is modeled on the reporting program for broker-dealers
codified in Rule 17a-5.397 Rule 17a-5 – which was recently amended398 – has two main
elements: (1) a requirement that broker-dealers file periodic unaudited reports containing

The recent amendments to Rule 17a-5 are discussed below. See Broker-Dealer Reports, Exchange Act 

Release No. 70073 (July 30, 2013), 78 FR 51910 (Aug. 21, 2013). These amendments will not be fully
effective until June 1, 2014. This release refers to these amendments as the recently adopted amendments
or recently adopted requirements of Rule 17a-5.

information about their financial and operational condition on a FOCUS Report; and (2) a
requirement that broker-dealers annually file financial statements and certain reports and a report
covering the financial statements and reports prepared by an independent public accountant
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) in accordance
with PCAOB standards.399
The reporting program established under Rule 17a-5 is designed, among other things, to
promote compliance with Rules 15c3-1 and 15c3-3 and to assist the Commission, SROs, and
state securities regulators in conducting effective examinations of broker-dealers. As the
Commission has stated, the reporting requirements, “together with the Commission’s inspection
powers, [are] an integral element in the arsenal for protection of customers against the risks
involved in leaving securities with their broker-dealer.”400 The broker-dealer reporting
requirements promote transparency of the financial and operational condition of the brokerdealer to the Commission, the firm’s DEA, and, in the case of a portion of the annual reports, to
the public.401 In the release adopting Rule 17a-5, the Commission stated its intention to
periodically review the reporting requirements “in order to continue modifying and updating the
financial and operational reporting systems to keep pace with the changing securities
industry.”402
Under the proposed reporting program for SBSDs and MSBSPs, broker-dealer SBSDs

401	

As discussed below in section II.B.3.a. of this release, paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5 requires broker-dealers
to file certain audited annual reports with the Commission. A portion of these reports is made public.

and broker-dealer MSBSPs – as broker-dealers – would be subject to Rule 17a-5.403 The
Commission is proposing amendments to this rule to account for broker-dealers that are dually
registered as an SBSD or MSBSP.404 Stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs,
and bank MSBSPs would be subject to proposed Rule 18a-7, which is modeled on Rule 17a-5, as
proposed to be amended. Proposed Rule 18a-7 would not include a parallel requirement for
every requirement in Rule 17a-5 because some of the requirements in Rule 17a-5 relate to
activities that are not expected or permitted of SBSDs and MSBSPs. Similarly, while all types of
SBSDs and MSBSPs would use proposed Form SBS, broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer
MSBSPs would be required to provide more information than stand-alone SBSDs and standalone MSBSPs.
Further, the reporting requirements in proposed Rule 18a-7 and proposed Form SBS
applicable to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs are more limited in scope because, as discussed
above in section I. of this release, bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs are subject to reporting
requirements applicable to banks. Further, the prudential regulators – rather than the
Commission – are responsible for capital, margin, and other prudential requirements applicable
to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs. For these reasons, the proposed reporting requirements for
bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs generally are designed to be tailored specifically to their
activities as an SBSD or an MSBSP (as opposed to their activities as banks). However, as
discussed below, the Commission is proposing that bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs report
certain general financial information that banks are required to report pursuant to requirements of
403

Except for the requirement to file one of the parts of the FOCUS Report, broker-dealer SBSDs and brokerdealer MSBSPs would be subject to all the reporting requirements applicable to broker-dealers under Rule
17a-5, as proposed to be amended, plus the additional requirements specifically applicable to an SBSD or
MSBSP. As discussed below in section II.B.2. of this release, a broker-dealer SBSD or broker-dealer
MSBSP would file proposed Form SBS rather than one of the parts of the FOCUS Report.

404	

As discussed below in section II.B.3.b. of this release, the Commission also is proposing technical
amendments to Rule 17a-5.

101 


the prudential regulators. Bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs would be able to use the same
information reported under the requirements of the prudential regulators to comply with the
proposed reporting requirements applicable to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs. The objective is
to provide the Commission with a means to monitor the financial condition of bank SBSDs and
bank MSBSPs without requiring these entities to report information not already reported to their
prudential regulators.

Periodic Filing of Proposed Form SBS
a.

Amendments to Rule 17a-5 and Proposed Rule 18a-7

Undesignated Introductory Paragraph
Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended, would contain an undesignated introductory
paragraph explaining that the rule applies to a broker-dealer, including a broker-dealer dually
registered with the Commission as an SBSD or MSBSP. 405 The note further explains that an
SBSD or MSBSP that is not dually registered as a broker-dealer (i.e., a stand-alone SBSD, standalone MSBSP, bank SBSD, or bank MSBSP) is subject to the reporting requirements under
proposed Rule 18a-7.406 Further, the Commission is proposing to remove paragraph (a)(1) of
Rule 17a-5, which provides that paragraph (a) shall apply to every broker-dealer registered
pursuant to section 15 of the Exchange Act.407 This text would be redundant of the undesignated
introductory paragraph of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended.408
Similarly, proposed Rule 18a-7 would contain an undesignated introductory paragraph
explaining that the rule applies to an SBSD or MSBSP that is not dually registered as a broker-

dealer.409 The note further explains that a broker-dealer dually registered as an SBSD or MSBSP
is subject to the reporting requirements under Rule 17a-5.410
Requirement to File Proposed Form SBS
Broker-dealers periodically report information about their financial and operational
condition on the FOCUS Report Part II, Part IIA, Part IIB, or Part II CSE. Each version of the
report is designed for a particular type of broker-dealer and the information to be reported is
tailored to the type of broker-dealer. Specifically: (1) the FOCUS Report Part IIA is designed to
be used by a broker-dealer that does not hold customer funds or securities;411 (2) the FOCUS
Report Part II is designed to be used by a broker-dealer that holds customer funds or
securities;412 (3) the FOCUS Report Part IIB is designed to be used by an OTC derivatives
dealer;413 and (4) the FOCUS Report Part II CSE is designed to be used by an ANC brokerdealer.414 The FOCUS Report Part II CSE elicits the most detailed information of the four parts,
including the most detail about a firm’s derivatives activities.
Paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-5 requires a broker-dealer, other than an OTC derivatives
dealer, to file the FOCUS Report Part II or Part IIA.415 The Commission is proposing to amend

The FOCUS Report Part II CSE was developed by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (“NYSE”). See
Exhibit 3 to Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Notice of Filing of Proposed
Rule Change To Require Members That Use Appendix E To Calculate Net Capital To File Supplemental
and Alternative Reports, Exchange Act Release No. 51980 (July 6, 2005), 70 FR 40767 (July 14, 2005).

415	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(a). The requirement that an OTC derivatives dealer file the FOCUS Report Part IIB
is set forth in paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-12. See 17 CFR 240.17a-12(a). While an ANC broker-dealer is
required under paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-5 to file the FOCUS Report Part IIA, FINRA Rule 4521(b)

103 


this paragraph so that it would require a broker-dealer that is dually registered as an SBSD or
MSBSP to file proposed Form SBS rather than the FOCUS Report Part II or Part IIA and to add
a parallel requirement in proposed Rule 18a-7 to require stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone
MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs to periodically file proposed Form SBS.416
Currently, paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17a-5 provides that a broker-dealer must file the
FOCUS Report Part II if it clears transactions or carries customer accounts or the FOCUS Report
Part IIA if it does not clear transactions or carry customer accounts.417 The paragraph further
provides that these reports must be filed within seventeen business days after the end of the
quarter and within seventeen business days after the end of the fiscal year of the broker-dealer if
the date of the fiscal year end is not the end of a calendar quarter.418 Paragraph (a)(3) provides
that reports required to be filed with the Commission under paragraph (a) (which includes the
reports required under paragraph (a)(2)) shall be considered filed when received at the
Commission's principal office in Washington, DC, and the regional office of the Commission for
the region in which the broker-dealer has its principal place of business.419 Paragraph (a)(3)

provides that ANC broker-dealers must file supplemental and alternative reports as may be prescribed by
FINRA. Under this rule, FINRA requires ANC broker-dealers to file the FOCUS Report Part II CSE in
lieu of the FOCUS Report Part IIA. See also Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange,
Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change to Require Members That Use Appendix E to Calculate Net
Capital to File Supplemental and Alternative Reports, 70 FR 49349 (Commission approval of amendments
to NYSE Rule 418 requiring ANC broker-dealers to file Part II CSE).
416	

Compare paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended, with paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of
proposed Rule 18a-7. As a consequence of the proposed removal of paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 17a-5,
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (a)(2(ii), and (a)(2)(iii) would be redesignated paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), and
(a)(1)(iii), respectively. Further, as discussed below, the Commission is proposing to add a new paragraph
(a)(1)(iv) to Rule 17a-5. As a consequence of the removal of paragraph (a)(1) and the addition of
paragraph (a)(1)(iv), paragraph (a)(2)(iv) would be redesignated paragraph (a)(1)(v). Further, as a
consequence of the removal of paragraph (a)(1), paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7) of Rule
17a-5 would be redesignated paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6), respectively.

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(a)(2)(ii) and (iii).

further provides that all reports filed pursuant to paragraph (a) shall be deemed to be
confidential.420
Notwithstanding these requirements, substantially all broker-dealers file the FOCUS
Report directly with their SROs pursuant to plans established by the SROs under paragraph
(a)(4) of Rule 17a-5 (rather than filing them directly with the Commission).421 Generally, the
reporting requirements under the SRO’s plans are consistent with, or more rigorous than, the
requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17a-5 in terms of the part of the FOCUS Report a
broker-dealer must file and the frequency of filing.422 Thus, while most broker-dealers do not
file the FOCUS Report pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of Rule 17a-5, these provisions
establish a baseline for SROs in designing their plans, which must be declared effective by the
Commission.
The Commission is proposing to amend paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17a-5 to account for the
fact that some broker-dealers likely will be registered as an SBSD or potentially as an MSBSP
420	

See id.

421	

Specifically, paragraph (a)(4) of Rule 17a-5 contains an exception from the requirement to file the FOCUS
Report directly with the Commission applicable to brokers-dealers that are members of a national securities
exchange or a registered national securities association if the exchange or association maintains records
containing the information required by the FOCUS Report and transmits such information to the
Commission pursuant to a plan that has been submitted to, and declared effective by, the Commission
(“FOCUS filing plan” or “Plan”). See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(a)(4). FINRA and other SROs have had FOCUS
filing plans in effect since the 1970s under this exception. See, e.g., Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice
of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change by the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. Relating to the Association’s FOCUS Filing Plan, Exchange Act Release No.
36780, (Jan. 26, 1996), 61 FR 3743 (Feb. 1, 1996).

422	

Currently, FINRA’s plan (which applies to most broker-dealers) requires monthly filing of the FOCUS
Report Part II for members that are subject to the requirements of paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3, or that
conduct a business in accordance with paragraph (k)(2)(i) of Rule 15c3-3, or that are subject to paragraphs
(a)(2)(i) through (iii) of Rule 15c3-1. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(2)(i) through (iii); 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(e)
and (k)(2)(i). FINRA’s plan requires quarterly filing of the FOCUS Report Part IIA for members that
conduct a business in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (k)(1)(i) through (iii), (k)(2)(ii), and
(k)(3) of Rule 15c3-3 and are not subject to paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of Rule 15c3-1, and for
members that conduct a business in accordance with paragraphs (a)(6) through (8) of Rule 15c3-1. See 17
CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(2)(i) through (iii) and (a)(6) through (8); 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(k)(1)(i) through (iii),
(k)(2)(ii), and (k)(3). These firms generally are non-carrying broker-dealers and firms that do not meet the
definition of dealer under Rule 15c3-1. Further, as noted above, ANC broker-dealers file the FOCUS
Report Part II CSE pursuant to FINRA Rule 4521(b) rather than the FOCUS Report Part II.

105 


and, therefore, these categories of registrants would be subject to the reporting requirements
under Rule 17a-5.423 The proposed amendments would require broker-dealer SBSDs and brokerdealer MSBSPs to file proposed Form SBS rather than the FOCUS Report Part II or Part IIA.
Specifically, the amendments would specify that the requirement to file the FOCUS Report Part
II or Part IIA directly with the Commission in paragraph (a) applies only to broker-dealers that
are not dually registered as an SBSD or MSBSP.424 In addition, the Commission proposes to add
a new paragraph (a)(1)(iv) to Rule 17a-5.425 This paragraph would provide that a broker-dealer
dually registered as an SBSD or MSBSP must file proposed Form SBS with the Commission
within seventeen business days of the end of the month.426 Thus, the paragraph would require
broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs to file proposed Form SBS on a monthly basis.
This would be consistent with the plans of the SROs, which generally require carrying brokerdealers and broker-dealers that act as dealers to file the FOCUS Report Part II on a monthly
(rather than quarterly) basis.427
The Commission is proposing to include a parallel requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of
proposed Rule 18a-7 that is modeled on paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be
amended, that would apply to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs.428 Under this

423	

As noted above, the Commission is proposing to redesignate paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17a-5 as paragraph
(a)(1).

424	

See paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended.

425	

See paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended.

426	

See id.

427	

Because this would be a monthly filing requirement, the Commission is not proposing to require brokerdealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs to also file proposed Form SBS within 17 business days after the
end of the fiscal year of the firm where that date is not the end of a calendar quarter as is required under
paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (iii) of Rule 17a-5 (which require quarterly filing of the FOCUS Report Part II and
Part IIA, respectively). Compare 17 CFR 240.17a-5(a)(2)(ii) and (iii), with paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of Rule
17a-5, as proposed to be amended.

paragraph, these registrants would be required to file proposed Form SBS with the Commission
or its designee within seventeen business days after the end of each month.429 The reference to a
Commission designee is intended to provide the Commission with the option of requiring that
these registrants file proposed Form SBS with a third party.430
Paragraph (a)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would apply to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs
and require these registrants to file proposed Form SBS with the Commission or its designee
within seventeen business days after the end of each calendar quarter (instead of each month).431
The Commission would require quarterly financial reporting for bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs,
instead of monthly reporting, because the prudential regulators currently require banks to file
reports of financial and operational condition known as call reports on a quarterly basis.432 As
discussed below in section II.B.3.a. of this release, the information that would be reported by
bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs on proposed Form SBS largely would be information that banks
are required to provide in the call reports.
Paragraph (a)(3) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would apply to SBSDs authorized by the
Commission to compute net capital using internal models pursuant to paragraph (d) of proposed
Rule 18a-1. The Commission would require these registrants to file most of the required
documents within 17 business days after the end of each month.433 However, to correspond with

429

See paragraph (a)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-7.

As discussed above, generally all broker-dealers file the FOCUS Report with their SROs rather than 

directly with the Commission.

the timing requirement in paragraph (d)(9)(i)(C)(1)-(2) of proposed Rule 18a-1,434 these
registrants would be required to file the following reports within seventeen business days after
the end of each calendar quarter (instead of each month): a report identifying the number of
business days for which actual daily net trading loss exceeded the corresponding daily value at
risk (“VaR”); and the results of backtesting of all internal models used to compute allowable
capital, indicating the number of backtesting exceptions.435
The Commission also is proposing amendments to paragraphs (a)(1)(ii), (a)(1)(iii),
(a)(1)(iv), and (a)(1)(v) of Rule 17a-5 that would make explicit the requirement that the FOCUS
Report or Form SBS filed by a broker-dealer must be “executed.”436 Additionally, paragraphs
(a)(1) and (a)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would contain parallel language requiring that a Form
SBS filed by a stand-alone SBSD, stand-alone MSBSP, bank SBSD, or bank MSBSP must be
executed.
Finally, as noted above, paragraph (a)(4) of Rule 17a-5 contains an exception from the
requirement to file a FOCUS Report directly with the Commission applicable to broker-dealers
that are members of a national securities exchange or a registered national securities association
if that exchange or association maintains records containing the information required by the
FOCUS Report and transmits such information to the Commission pursuant to a plan that has
been submitted to, and declared effective by, the Commission.437 The Commission proposes to
add a reference to proposed Form SBS to this provision so that SROs could include the filing of

108 


Form SBS in their plans.438 If incorporated into the plans, broker-dealer SBSDs and brokerdealer MSBSPs would file proposed Form SBS with their SRO (rather than directly with the
Commission). The Commission preliminarily expects that the reporting requirements under an
SRO’s plan with respect to proposed Form SBS would need to be at least as rigorous as the
requirements in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended, to be declared
effective by the Commission.
b. 	

Information Elicited in Form SBS

As discussed above, all categories of SBSDs and MSBSPs would be required to file
proposed Form SBS. This form is modeled on the FOCUS Report, particularly the FOCUS
Report Part II CSE.439 The FOCUS Report Part II CSE served as the template for designing
proposed Form SBS because it is designed to account for the use of internal models by ANC
broker-dealers and elicits more detailed information about derivatives positions and exposures
than the FOCUS Report Part II and Part IIA.440 Based on staff experience, including experience

438	

See paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended. Further, paragraph (a)(5) of Rule 17a-5
requires broker-dealers to file Form Custody (17 CFR 249.1900) with their DEAs within 17 business days
after the end of each calendar quarter and within 17 business days after the end of the fiscal year of the
broker-dealer where that date is not the end of a calendar quarter. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(a)(5). The DEA
must maintain the information obtained through the filing of Form Custody and must promptly transmit
that information to the Commission at such time as it transmits the applicable part of the FOCUS Report
pursuant to a plan. See id. The Commission is proposing to amend this provision to include a reference to
proposed Form SBS to account for the fact that broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs would file
proposed Form SBS with their DEAs along with Form Custody (rather than the FOCUS Report) if the
SROs incorporate the filing of Form SBS in their plans. See paragraph (a)(4) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to
be amended.

439	

Compare proposed Form SBS, with the FOCUS Report Part II CSE.

440	

The FOCUS Report Part IIB elicits similar information about derivatives positions and exposures but
otherwise is more limited than the FOCUS Report Part II CSE because OTC derivatives dealers are
permitted to engage in only a narrow range of activities. See 17 CFR 240.3b-12; 17 CFR 240.15a-1.
Specifically, Rule 3b-12, defining the term OTC derivatives dealer, provides, among other things, that an
OTC derivatives dealer’s securities activities must be limited to engaging in dealer activities in eligible
OTC derivative instruments (as defined in the rule) that are securities; issuing and reacquiring securities
that are issued by the dealer, including warrants on securities, hybrid securities, and structured notes;
engaging in cash management securities activities (as defined in Rule 3b-14 (17 CFR 240.3b-14); engaging
in ancillary portfolio management securities activities (as defined in the rule); and engaging in such other
securities activities that the Commission designates by order. See 17 CFR 240.3b-12. Rule 15a-1,

109 


monitoring ANC broker-dealers, the Commission anticipates that most SBSDs will use internal
models to compute their net capital.441
The FOCUS Report elicits financial and operational information about a broker-dealer
through sections consisting of uniquely numbered line items. The information (e.g., a number or
dollar amount) is entered into the line items.442 Generally, a line item that is common to Part II,
Part IIA, Part IIB, and Part II CSE of the FOCUS Report shares the same unique number, which
facilitates aggregating information and comparing reported information across broker-dealers.443
Proposed Form SBS similarly would elicit information about the financial and operational
condition of an SBSD or MSBSP through sections consisting of uniquely numbered line items.
Line items on proposed Form SBS that correspond to line items on the FOCUS Report would
share the same unique number and require the entry of the same type of information.444
Proposed Form SBS would not include a parallel line item for each line item on the FOCUS
Report because not all of the information required on the FOCUS Report is relevant for SBSDs
and MSBSPs.445 Further, proposed Form SBS would have lines and corresponding line items

governing the securities activities of OTC derivatives dealers, provides that an OTC derivatives dealer must
effect transactions in OTC derivatives with most types of counterparties through an affiliated Commissionregistered broker-dealer that is not an OTC derivatives dealer. See 17 CFR 240.15a-1.
441	

See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major SecurityBased Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70293.

442	

As used in this release, the term line refers to the lines in the left column on the FOCUS Report and
proposed Form SBS that describe the type of entries to be made on that line. The term line item refers to
the fields into which information is entered. For example, Line 1 of the statement of financial condition
section on Form SBS is cash and Line Item 200 is the field to enter the dollar amount of cash and Line Item
750 is the field to enter the total dollar amount of cash.

443	

For example, Line Item 200 is the field to enter the dollar amount of cash and Line Item 750 is the field to
enter the total dollar amount of cash in the statement of financial condition section for each part of the
FOCUS Report. The FOCUS Report Part IIB and Part II CSE share certain common sections that have
common entries but the line items for the entries are assigned different numbers. Proposed Form SBS
would use the numbers assigned to the line items in Part II CSE.

444	

For example, Line Item 200 is the field to enter the dollar amount of cash and Line Item 750 is the field to
enter the total dollar amount of cash in the statement of financial condition section on proposed Form SBS.

110 


that are not on the FOCUS Report. The additional lines and line items would elicit more detail
about the security-based swap and swap activities of the SBSD and MSBSP filers.446
As discussed below, broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs would be required
to report the most information on proposed Form SBS because it would elicit information about
their activities as a broker-dealer and as an SBSD or MSBSP. Stand-alone SBSDs and standalone MSBSPs would be required to report information similar to that required of broker-dealer
SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs. The information elicited from bank SBSDs and bank
MSBSPs would: (1) derive largely from the information they report on the call reports; and (2)
focus on their business as an SBSD or MSBSP.447
Proposed Form SBS is divided into five parts. Part 1 would apply to nonbank SBSDs
and nonbank MSBSPs (i.e., broker-dealer SBSDs, broker-dealer MSBSPs, stand-alone SBSDs,
and stand-alone MSBSPs) and is similar to the FOCUS Report Part II CSE, but includes
additional sections and line items to elicit more detail about security-based swap and swap
activities. Part 2 would apply to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs and elicit certain financial
information that these classes of registrants – as banks – would need to report in the call reports
plus certain additional information about security-based swap and swap activities. Part 3 would
445	

The FOCUS Report Part II CSE has the most line items of the four parts of the FOCUS Report and,
consequently, generally will serve as the means of comparing proposed Form SBS with the FOCUS Report
for purposes of the discussion in this release. Proposed Form SBS would not include line items from Part
II CSE that are obsolete, inapplicable, or redundant of the additional line items on proposed Form SBS.
Specifically, proposed Form SBS would not include Line Item 18 (box checked if FOCUS Part II CSE is
filed pursuant to Rule 17a-11 under the Exchange Act); Line Item 98 (SEC File No.); Line Item 99 (As of
date the for statement of financial condition); Line Item 291 (Derivatives Receivable – Allowable); Line
Item 801 (Derivatives Payable – Total); Line Item 3635 (Total Market Risk Exposure); Line Item 3679
(Total Credit Risk Exposure); Line Item 3931 (Number of months included in this statement); Line Item
3932 (For the period from); Line Item 3933 (For the period to); Line Item 4070 (Interest Expense, Includes
interest on accounts subject to subordination agreements); and Line Items 5000–5350 (Financial and
operational data).

446	

Line items that are unique to proposed Form SBS are identified on the Form by the number 99, 999, 9999,
or 99999 for the purposes of this proposing release.

447	

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(f)(1)(B)(i).

111 


apply to an SBSD or MSBSP that is dually registered as an FCM and elicit information about the
firm’s net capital computation and segregation of customer assets under CFTC rules. Part 4
would apply to nonbank SBSDs and nonbank MSBSPs and elicit detailed information about a
firm’s security-based swap and swap positions, counterparties, and exposures. Part 5 would
apply to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs and also elicit detailed information about a firm’s
security-based swap and swap positions, but on a more limited basis than Part 4.
Proposed Form SBS would have a cover page that largely is in the same format as the
cover page of the FOCUS Report, but includes line items to indicate the type of registrant filing
Form SBS: (1) a stand-alone SBSD; (2) a stand-alone MSBSP; (3) a broker-dealer SBSD; (4) a
broker-dealer MSBSP; (5) a bank MSBSP; or (6) a bank MSBSP. The heading at the top of each
remaining page of proposed Form SBS would identify the type of registrant that must enter the
information to be reported on the page.
A general description of each Part of proposed Form SBS appears below, including a
more detailed description of the components of Form SBS for which there are not parallel
components in the FOCUS Report. In addition to proposed Form SBS, the Commission is
proposing instructions for Form SBS to provide further guidance on the information to be
entered into certain line items.448 The instructions are modeled on the instructions to the FOCUS
Report Part II, but with more instructions to cover the additional line items and sections that are
not on the FOCUS Report Part II.449

Part 1 of proposed Form SBS would apply to nonbank SBSDs and nonbank MSBSPs.

Compare instructions to proposed Form SBS, with instructions to the FOCUS Report Part II. The
instructions to the FOCUS Report Part IIA are available at http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/formx-17a5_2a.pdf.

112 


This part of Form SBS is modeled on the FOCUS Report, particularly the FOCUS Report Part II
CSE, but includes additional sections and line items to report more detail about security-based
swap and swap activities.450 Like the FOCUS Report Part II CSE, Part 1 of proposed Form SBS
would require the filer to enter information into the following sections, as applicable: (1) a
statement of financial condition;451 (2) a computation of net capital;452 (3) a computation of
minimum net capital required;453 (4) a statement of income (loss);454 (5) a statement of capital
withdrawals, a statement of changes in ownership equity, and a statement of changes in liabilities

450	

Compare Part 1 proposed Form SBS, with the FOCUS Report Part II CSE. As discussed below, the
FOCUS Report has a number of sections that are common to all the parts thereof. Generally, a section on
the FOCUS Report Part II CSE elicits information that is as detailed, if not more detailed, than the parallel
section on the FOCUS Report Part II, Part IIA, or Part IIB.

451	

Each part of the FOCUS Report has a section to provide a statement of financial condition that elicits detail
about the assets, liabilities and ownership equity of the broker-dealer. Part 1 of proposed Form SBS
similarly has a section to provide a statement of financial condition. See Part 1 of proposed Form SBS,
Statement of Financial Condition. This section would need to be completed by nonbank SBSDs and
nonbank MSBSPs. As discussed below, the statement of financial condition section on proposed Form
SBS has additional line items that are not on the FOCUS Report.

452	

Each part of the FOCUS Report has a section to provide a computation of net capital under Rule 15c3-1.
Part 1 of proposed Form SBS similarly has sections to provide a computation of net capital that would need
to be completed by nonbank SBSDs (i.e., broker-dealer SBSDs and stand-alone SBSDs) and broker-dealer
MSBSPs (all of which would be subject to a net capital rule). See Part 1 of proposed Form SBS,
Computation of Net Capital (Filer Authorized to use Models) and Computation of Net Capital (Filer Not
Authorized to use Models). As discussed below, proposed Form SBS has two net capital computation
sections: one for firms that are authorized to use models and one for firms that are not authorized to use
models. Further, these sections have additional line items that are not on the FOCUS Report.

453	

Each part of the FOCUS Report has a section to provide a computation of minimum required net capital
under Rule 15c3-1. Part 1 of proposed Form SBS similarly has sections to provide a required minimum net
capital computation that would need to be completed by nonbank SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs. See
Part 1 of proposed Form SBS, Computation of Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements (Broker-Dealer)
and Computation of Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements (Non-Broker-Dealer). As discussed
below, proposed Form SBS has two minimum net capital computation sections: one for broker-dealer filers
(i.e., broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs) and one for stand-alone SBSDs. Further, these
sections have additional line items that are not on the FOCUS Report.

454	

Each part of the FOCUS Report has a section to provide a statement of income (loss) that elicits detail
about the revenue and expenses of the broker-dealer during the reporting period. Part 1 of proposed Form
SBS similarly has a statement of income (loss) section that would need to be completed by nonbank SBSDs
and nonbank MSBSPs. See Part 1 of proposed Form SBS, Statement of Income (Loss). As discussed
below, the statement of income (loss) section on proposed Form SBS is modeled on a supplemental
statement of income form promulgated by FINRA. The proposed Form SBS section has additional line
items that are not on FINRA’s form.

113 


subordinated to claims of creditors;455 (6) certain financial and operational data;456 (7) a customer
reserve account computation under Rule 15c3-3;457 (8) information for possession or control
455	

The FOCUS Report Part II, Part IIB, and Part II CSE have sections to provide a statement of capital
withdrawals, a statement of changes in ownership equity, and a statement of changes in liabilities
subordinated to claims of general creditors. The FOCUS Report Part IIA has sections to provide a
statement of changes in ownership equity and a statement of changes in liabilities subordinated to claims of
general creditors. In the statement of capital withdrawals section, a broker-dealer must report information
about the firm’s ownership equity and subordinated liabilities maturing or proposed to be withdrawn within
the next six months and accruals that have not been deducted in the computation of net capital. In the
statements of changes in ownership equity and liabilities subordinated to claims of general creditors
sections, a broker-dealer must report the amount of such equity and liability balances, respectively, as of
the beginning of the reporting period and as of the end of the reporting period and provide detail with
respect to changes in the balances. The information reported in all these statements is designed to assist
securities regulators in monitoring the financial condition of the broker-dealer and the firm’s compliance
with the net capital rule. For example, under Rule 15c3-1, broker-dealers are subject to debt-to-equity ratio
requirements, limitations governing the withdrawal of equity capital, and requirements with respect to
subordinated loans that qualify to be added back to net worth when computing net capital. See 17 CFR
240.15c3-1d ; 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(d) and (e). Nonbank SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs would be
subject to similar requirements and limitations. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for
Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for
Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70254–70256. Consequently, Part 1 of proposed Form SBS has sections to
provide a statement of capital withdrawals, a statement of changes in ownership equity, and a statement of
changes in liabilities subordinated to claims of creditors that would need to be completed by nonbank
SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs. See Part 1 of proposed Form SBS, Capital Withdrawals and Capital
Withdrawals Recap. These sections on proposed Form SBS have the same line items as the parallel
sections on the FOCUS Report Part II CSE and there are no additional line items.

456	

Each part of the FOCUS Report has a section to report certain financial and operational data. The FOCUS
Report Part II CSE has additional sections to report operational charges deducted from net capital under
Rule 15c3-1 and potential operational charges. Broker-dealers must report information on these sections
about, among other things, the number of income and non-income producing personnel, fails, security
concentrations, lease and rentals payables, money suspense and balancing differences, and securities
differences. Certain of these items – including securities differences – result in charges when computing
net capital. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(v). Securities regulators use this information to monitor, among
other things, whether the broker-dealer is processing securities transactions in a timely manner and properly
accounting for the securities it holds. Part 1 of proposed Form SBS similarly has sections to report this
type of financial and operational data that would need to be completed by nonbank SBSDs and brokerdealer MSBSPs. See Part 1 of proposed Form SBS, Financial and Operational Data. The sections of the
form have the same line items as the parallel sections in the FOCUS Report Part II CSE and there are no
additional line items.

457	

The FOCUS Report Part II and Part II CSE have a section to provide a computation of the customer reserve
requirement under Rule 15c3-3. As discussed above in section II.A.2.a. of this release, Rule 15c3-3
requires a carrying broker-dealer to maintain a reserve of funds or qualified securities in an account at a
bank that is at least equal in value to the net cash owed to customers. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(e). The
amount of net cash owed to customers is computed pursuant to a formula set forth in Exhibit A to Rule
15c3-3. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3a. Part 1 of proposed Form SBS similarly has a section to provide a
computation of the customer reserve requirement under Rule 15c3-3 that would need to be completed by
broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs that hold funds and securities for customers that are not
security-based swap customers. See Part 1 of proposed Form SBS, Computation for Determination of
Reserve Requirements. This section has the same line items as the parallel section on the FOCUS Report
Part II CSE and there are no additional line items. Further, as discussed below, proposed Form SBS has a
section to provide a separate computation for the security-based swap customer reserve account

114 


requirements under Rule 15c3-3;458 and (9) a computation for the determination of reserve
requirements for proprietary accounts of broker-dealers (“PAB”).459 Part 1 of proposed Form
SBS includes additional line items in certain of these sections to elicit more detail about security-

requirement under proposed Rule 18a-4. In addition, the FOCUS Report Part IIA has a section to claim an
exemption under Rule 15c3-3. In this section, a broker-dealer claiming an exemption under Rule 15c3-3
must identify whether it is relying on paragraph (k)(1), (k)(2)(A), (k)(2)(B), or (k)(3) of Rule 15c3-3. Part
1 of proposed Form SBS similarly has a section in which a broker-dealer SBSD or broker-dealer MSBSP
could claim an exemption from Rule 15c3-3. See Part 1 of proposed Form SBS, Exemptive Provision
under Rule 15c3-3.
458	

The FOCUS Report Part II and Part II CSE have a section to report information relating to the possession
or control requirement under Rule 15c3-3. As discussed above in section II.A.2.a. of this release, Rule
15c3-3 requires a carrying broker-dealer to maintain physical possession or control over customers’ fully
paid and excess margin securities. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(d). Physical possession or control means the
carrying broker-dealer must hold these securities in one of several locations specified in Rule 15c3-3 and
free of liens or any other interest that could be exercised by a third party to secure an obligation of the
broker-dealer. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(c). Part 1 of proposed Form SBS similarly has a section to report
the same information about the possession or control requirement under Rule 15c3-3 as is required in the
FOCUS Report Part II and Part II CSE. See Part 1 of proposed Form SBS, Computation for Determination
of Reserve Requirements. This section would need to be completed by broker-dealer SBSDs and brokerdealer MSBSPs that hold funds and securities for customers that are not security-based swap customers.
This section has the same line items as the parallel section on the FOCUS Report Part II CSE and there are
no additional line items. Further, as discussed below, proposed Form SBS has a section to report the same
type of information about the possession or control requirement relating to security-based swap customers
under proposed Rule 18a-4.

459	

The FOCUS Report Part II CSE has a section to provide the computation of the reserve requirement for
proprietary accounts of broker-dealers. This computation is a result of a broker-dealer not being a customer
as that term is defined in Rule 15c3-3. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(1). Accordingly, a carrying brokerdealer that holds the account of another broker-dealer is not required to maintain possession or control of
the fully paid and excess margin securities of the other the broker-dealer or include credit and debit items
associated with the account of the other broker-dealer in its customer reserve computation. The absence of
a requirement to protect the other broker-dealer’s cash under Rule 15c3-3 raised a question of whether the
other broker-dealer could treat cash held by the carrying broker-dealer as an allowable asset under Rule
15c3-1. In response, the Commission staff issued a no-action letter stating that the staff would not
recommend enforcement action to the Commission if a broker-dealer treated cash held by another brokerdealer as an allowable asset under Rule 15c3-1, provided the other broker-dealer agreed to: (1) perform a
reserve computation for broker-dealer accounts; (2) establish a separate special reserve bank account, and;
(3) maintain cash or qualified securities in the reserve account equal to the computed reserve requirement.
See Letter from Michael A. Macchiaroli, Associate Director, Division of Market Regulation, Commission,
to Raymond J. Hennessy, Vice President, NYSE, and Thomas Cassella, Vice President, NASD regulation,
Inc. (Nov. 10, 1998). The Commission recently codified this letter through amendments to Rule 15c3-3.
See Financial Responsibility Rules for Broker-Dealers, Exchange Act Release No. 70072 (July 30, 2013);
78 FR 51824 (Aug. 21, 2013). Part 1 of proposed Form SBS similarly has a section to provide a
computation of PAB reserve requirements. See Part 1 of proposed Form SBS, Computation for
Determination of PAB Requirements. This section would need to be completed by broker-dealer SBSDs
and broker-dealer MSBSPs. The section has the same line items as the parallel section on the FOCUS
Report Part II CSE and there are no additional line items.

based swap and swap activities.460 Further, Part 1 has the following additional sections: (1) a
computation of tangible net worth under proposed Rule 18a-2;461 (2) a reserve account
computation under proposed Rule 18a-4;462 and (3) information for possession or control
requirements under proposed Rule 18a-4.463 The additional line items and sections are discussed
below.
Statement of Financial Condition
The line items in the statement of financial condition section on proposed Form SBS are
largely the same line items in the statement of financial condition section on the FOCUS Report
Part II CSE.464 However, as discussed below, the proposed Form SBS section has additional line
items that are not in the Part II CSE section.
First, a broker-dealer must enter detail in the FOCUS Report Part II CSE section about
the dollar amount of receivables from other broker-dealers and clearing organizations.465 The
460	

As noted above, additional line items are identified on proposed Form SBS by the number 99, 999, 9999, or
99999 for the purposes of this proposing release.

461	

Proposed Rule 18a-2 would require stand-alone MSBSPs to maintain positive tangible net worth. See
Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major SecurityBased Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR 70256–70257. Under
proposed Rule 18a-2, tangible net worth would be defined to mean the MSBSP’s net worth as determined
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., excluding goodwill and other
intangible assets.

462	

As discussed above in section II.A.2.a. of this release, proposed Rule 18a-4 would require an SBSD, among
other things, to maintain a security-based swap customer reserve account at a bank separate from any other
bank account of the SBSD. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap
Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR
at 70282–70287. Further, it would provide that the SBSD must at all times maintain in the security-based
swap customer reserve account cash and/or qualified securities in amounts computed daily in accordance
with Exhibit A to proposed Rule 18a-4. See id.

As discussed above in section II.A.2.a. of this release, proposed Rule 18a-4 would require an SBSD to
promptly obtain and thereafter maintain physical possession or control of all excess securities collateral
carried for the accounts of security-based swap customers. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation

Additionally, it requires detail about the dollar amount of the receivables includible in the
reserve computation under proposed Rule 18a-4.468
Second, a broker-dealer must enter detail in the FOCUS Report Part II CSE section about
the dollar amount of payables to other broker-dealers and clearing organizations.469 The detail

Third, a broker-dealer must enter detail in the FOCUS Report Part II CSE section about
the dollar amount of payables to securities and commodities customers.473 The broker-dealer
also must provide the dollar amount of the payable to securities customers representing free
credit balances.474 The proposed Form SBS section requires the same detail about payables to
securities and commodities customers.475 Additionally, it requires detail about the dollar amount

Fourth, a broker-dealer must enter into the FOCUS Report Part II CSE section the dollar
amount of payables to securities and commodities non-customers.477 The proposed Form SBS
section requires the entry of the same information.478 Additionally, it requires the entry of the
dollar amount of the payables to security-based swap and swap non-customers.479
Computation of Net Capital
Nonbank SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs would need to complete a computation of
net capital section on proposed Form SBS.480 Unlike the FOCUS Report Part II CSE, there are
two sections on proposed Form SBS: one applicable to filers that are authorized to use internal
models; and one applicable to filers that are not authorized to use internal models.481
Computation for Filers Authorized to use Models. The line items in the net capital
computation section on proposed Form SBS applicable to filers authorized to use models are

Broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs – as broker-dealers – would be subject to Rule 15c3-1
and, therefore, would be required to compute net capital as that term is defined in the rule. See 17 CFR
240.15c3-1(c)(2). Stand-alone MSBSPs would be subject to a tangible net worth capital standard pursuant
to proposed Rule 18a-2, and therefore, would not compute net capital. See Capital, Margin, and
Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants
and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70256–70257. The Commission has proposed that
stand-alone SBSDs be subject to a net capital requirement in proposed Rule 18a-1 that is modeled on Rule
15c3-1. See id. at 70217–70257. Under proposed Rule 18a-1, stand-alone SBSDs would be required to
compute net capital as defined in proposed Rule 18a-1. See id. The definition in proposed Rule 18a-1 is
modeled on the definition in Rule 15c3-1 and, consequently, proposed Form SBS does not have separate
net capital computation sections for broker-dealer filers and stand-alone SBSD filers.

481	

All broker-dealers that file the FOCUS Report Part II CSE have been approved to use models.
Accordingly, it does not need to have a computation for broker-dealers not approved to use models.

CSE.482 However, as discussed below, the proposed Form SBS section has additional line items
that are not on the FOCUS Report Part II CSE section.
First, a broker-dealer must enter detail in the Part II CSE section about deductions and
other charges that the firm must subtract from net worth, including the total dollar amount of
non-allowable assets from the Statement of Financial Condition.483 The detail includes charges
for under-margined securities accounts of customers and non-customers,484 and under-margined
accounts of commodities customers and non-customers.485 The proposed Form SBS section
would require the same detail about these deductions.486 In addition, the section would require
detail about the amount of deductions for under-margined accounts of security-based swap
customers and non-customers,487 and under-margined accounts of swap customers and non-

application of calls for margin, marks to the market or other required deposits which are outstanding five
business days or less. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(xii). Broker-dealers are subject to maintenance
margin requirements in rules promulgated by their DEAs. See, e.g., FINRA Rules 4210 through 4240.

See Part 1 of proposed Form SBS, Computation of Net Capital (Filer Authorized to Use Models), Line
6A3. The Commission has proposed that nonbank SBSDs be required to deduct the amount of cash
required in the account of each security-based swap customer to meet the margin requirements of a clearing
agency, DEA, or the Commission, after application of calls for margin, marks to the market, or other
required deposits which are outstanding one business day or less and to take certain capital charger in lieu
of collecting margin from certain types of entities or with respect to certain types of accounts. See Capital,
Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap
Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70245–70248. In addition, as
discussed above in section II.A.2.a. of this release, the Commission has proposed margin requirements for
nonbank SBSDs and nonbank MSBSPs with respect to non-cleared security-based swaps. See id. at
70257–70274. Security-based swap clearing agencies require their clearing members to post margin for
proprietary and customer positions of the member cleared by the clearing agency. See Process for
Submissions for Review of Security-Based Swaps for Mandatory Clearing and Notice Filing Requirements
for Clearing Agencies; Technical Amendments to Rule 19b-4 and Form 19b-4 Applicable to All Self-

customers.488
Second, an ANC broker-dealer must provide detail on a schedule to the FOCUS Report
Part II CSE about the credit risk charges it takes as part of its capital computation.489
Specifically, the FOCUS Report Part II CSE schedule requires the ANC broker-dealer to provide
detail with respect to the three components of the credit risk charge, namely: (1) the aggregate
counterparty exposure charge; (2) the aggregate counterparty concentration charge; and (3) the
portfolio concentration charge.490 Proposed Form SBS would require the same detail about these
components of the credit risk charge but require that it be reported in the net capital computation
section rather than on a separate schedule.491 The proposed Form also would require additional
Regulatory Organizations, Exchange Act Release No. 67286 (June 28, 2012), 77 FR 41602, 41603 (July
13, 2012). They also may require their clearing members to collect margin from their security-based swap
customers. See id.

See FOCUS Report Part II CSE, Schedule 1 – FINRA Supplementary Capital Information, Lines 6A–6C.
As discussed above in section II.B.3.a. of this release, ANC broker-dealers are permitted to add back to net
worth uncollateralized receivables from counterparties arising from OTC derivatives transactions when
computing net capital. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1e(c). Instead of the 100% deduction that applies to most
unsecured receivables under Rule 15c3-1, ANC broker-dealers are permitted to take the credit risk charge.
See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(7); 17 CFR 240.15c3-1e(c).

491	

See Part 1 of proposed Form SBS, Computation of Net Capital (Filer Authorized to Use Models), Lines
15A–15C. As discussed above in section II.B.3.a. of this release, the Commission has proposed that ANC
broker-dealers be permitted to add back to net worth uncollateralized receivables and take the
corresponding credit risk charge but only with respect to receivables from counterparties that are
commercial end users as that term would be defined in proposed amendments to Rule 15c3-1 and only with
respect to security-based swaps. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based
Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers,
77 FR 70240–70245. In addition, the proposed capital requirements for ANC broker-dealer SBSDs and
stand-alone ANC SBSDs similarly would allow these registrants to take credit risk charges with respect to
uncollateralized receivables but only from commercial end users arising from security-based swaps. See
id. Under these proposals, the firms would take a credit risk charge that consists of the three components
identified above: (1) a counterparty exposure charge; (2) a concentration charge if the current exposure to a
single counterparty exceeds certain thresholds; and (3) a portfolio concentration charge if aggregate current
exposure to all counterparties exceeds certain thresholds. See id.

120 


detail about the first component of the credit risk charge: the counterparty exposure charge.492
Under the proposed capital requirements for nonbank SBSDs, a firm authorized to use models
would need to calculate a counterparty exposure charge for a commercial end user in the same
manner as an ANC broker-dealer.493 Specifically, the exposure charge for a commercial end user
that is insolvent, in a bankruptcy proceeding, or in default of an obligation on its senior debt
would be the net replacement value of the security-based swaps with the end user.494 The
counterparty exposure charge for all other commercial end users would be the credit equivalent
amount of the firm’s exposure to the end user multiplied by an applicable credit risk weight
factor and then multiplied by 8%.495 Proposed Form SBS would have line items to enter the
aggregate counterparty exposure charge for these two categories of commercial end users (i.e.,
(1) end users that are insolvent, in a bankruptcy proceeding, or in default of an obligation on
their senior debt; and (2) all other end users and to enter the sum of the two categories).496
Computation for filers not authorized to use models. The line items in the net capital
computation section on proposed Form SBS applicable to filers not authorized to use models are
largely the same line items in the computation of net capital section on the FOCUS Report Part

See id.

495	

See id. The credit equivalent amount is the sum of the firm’s: (1) maximum potential exposure (“MPE”) to
the commercial end user multiplied by a backtesting determined factor; and (2) current exposure to the
commercial end user. The MPE amount would be a charge to address potential future exposure and would
be calculated using the firm’s VaR model as applied to the commercial end user’s positions after giving
effect to a netting agreement with the end user, taking into account collateral received from the end user,
and taking into account the current replacement value of the end user’s positions. See id. The current
exposure amount would be the current replacement value of the commercial end user’s positions after
giving effect to a netting agreement with the counterparty and taking into account collateral received from
the counterparty. See id.

II.497 However, as discussed below, the proposed Form SBS section has additional line items
that are not in the Part II section.
First, as discussed above, the computation section applicable to filers authorized to use
models includes line items to enter charges with respect to under-margined security-based swap
and swap accounts. The computation section applicable to filers not authorized to use models
similarly would require detail about the amount of charges relating to under-margined accounts
of security-based swap customers and non-customers,498 and under-margined accounts of swap
customers and non-customers.499
Second, a broker-dealer that is not authorized to use models is required to enter in the
FOCUS Report Part II net capital computation section detail about the dollar amount of the
standardized haircuts it takes on various categories of proprietary securities positions.500 The
proposed Form SBS section requires the same detail about standardized haircuts.501 The section
also requires additional entries for the amount of the standardized haircuts applied to securitybased swap502 and swap positions.503

Compare Part 1 of proposed Form SBS, Computation of Net Capital (Filer Not Authorized to Use Models),

Computation of Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements
Proposed Form SBS has two sections for computing minimum required net capital: one
for broker-dealer filers (i.e., broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs) and one for standalone SBSDs.504 As discussed above in section II.A.3.a. of this release, Rule 15c3-1, as
proposed to be amended, and proposed Rule 18a-1 would prescribe minimum net capital
requirements applicable to nonbank SBSDs as the greater of a fixed-dollar amount and a ratio
amount.505 The ratio amount applicable to a broker-dealer SBSD would be the sum of the
current ratio amount prescribed in Rule 15c3-1 (the 15-to-1 aggregate indebtedness to net capital
ratio or the 2% of aggregate debit items ratio) and an amount equal to the 8% margin factor.506
The ratio amount applicable to a stand-alone SBSD would be an amount equal solely to the 8%
margin factor.507 Because the minimum net capital requirement computation that would be
applicable to a broker-dealer filer differs from the computation that would be applicable to a
stand-alone SBSD, proposed Form SBS would contain a separate section for each type of filer.
The line items in the minimum net capital requirement section on proposed Form SBS applicable
to broker-dealer filers are largely the same line items in the minimum net capital requirement

Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major SecurityBased Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70248–70250.
504	

See Part 1 of proposed Form SBS, Broker-Dealer Computation of Minimum Regulatory Capital
Requirements and Non-Broker-Dealer Computation of Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements. As
noted above, broker-dealer MSBSPS – as broker-dealers – would be subject to Rule 15c3-1, and therefore
would be subject to a minimum net capital requirement. See 17 CFR 140.15c3-1(a). Stand-alone MSBSPs
would be subject to a tangible net worth standard pursuant to proposed Rule 18a-2, and therefore would not
be subject to a minimum net capital requirement. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for
Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for
Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70256–70257.

section on the FOCUS Report Part II.508 The computation section applicable to stand-alone
SBSDs is a substantially scaled down version of the parallel FOCUS Report Part II section. As
discussed below, both sections on proposed Form SBS have additional line items that are not on
the Part II section.
First, both sections require the entry of detail about the amount of excess tentative net
capital held by the firm.509 The proposed capital requirements for nonbank SBSDs prescribe
minimum tentative net capital requirements for ANC broker-dealer SBSDs and stand-alone ANC
SBSDs.510 These filers would need to indicate in proposed Form SBS: (1) the amount of
tentative net capital they maintain; (2) their minimum tentative net capital requirement;511 (3)
their excess tentative net capital;512 and (4) the amount of tentative net capital in excess of 120%
of their minimum tentative net capital requirement.513

See Part 1 of proposed Form SBS, Computation of Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements (BrokerDealer), Lines 1–4; Part 1 of proposed Form SBS, Computation of Minimum Regulatory Capital

510	

See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major SecurityBased Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR 70226–70227. Tentative net
capital would be the amount of net capital maintained by the firm before applying standardized haircuts or
using internal models to determine deductions on the mark-to-market value of proprietary positions to
arrive at the broker-dealer’s amount of net capital. See id. The minimum tentative net capital requirement
is designed to account for the fact that VaR models, while more risk sensitive than standardized haircuts,
tend to substantially reduce the amount of the deductions to tentative net capital in comparison to the
standardized haircuts because the models recognize more offsets between related positions (i.e., positions
that show historical correlations) than the standardized haircuts. See id.

511	

Under the proposed capital requirements, an ANC broker-dealer SBSD would be required to maintain
minimum tentative net capital of $5 billion and a stand-alone ANC SBSD would be required to maintain
minimum tentative net capital of $100 million. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for
Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for
Broker-Dealers, 77 FR 70226–70227.

512	

The amount of excess tentative net capital would be the amount that the tentative net capital exceeds the
amount of required tentative net capital.

513	

As discussed below in section II.C.2. of the release, Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended, and proposed
Rule 18a-8 would require an ANC broker-dealer SBSD and a stand-alone ANC SBSD to file a regulatory
notice if the firm’s tentative net capital falls below 120% of its required minimum tentative net capital.

124 


Second, both sections would have line items to enter the amount of the 8% margin factor.
As discussed above, the minimum net capital requirement for a nonbank SBSD would be the
greater of a fixed-dollar amount and a ratio amount. The ratio amount for a broker-dealer SBSD
would be the sum of the existing ratio requirement and the 8% margin factor. Consequently, the
computation section for broker-dealer filers has line items to enter amounts for (as applicable):
(1) the 15-to-1 aggregate indebtedness to net capital ratio; (2) the 2% of aggregate debit items
ratio; and (3) the 8% margin factor.514 The section for stand-alone SBSDs has a line item to
enter the 8% margin factor.515
Third, a broker-dealer must provide detail in the FOCUS Report Part II CSE section
about the dollar amount of net capital in excess of the greater of: (1) 5% of combined aggregate
debit items; and (2) 120% of the firm’s minimum net capital requirement.516 The proposed Form
SBS sections would require a broker-dealer SBSD, broker-dealer MSBSP, and stand-alone
SBSD to enter the amount of net capital in excess of 120% of the minimum net capital
requirement.517

516	

See FOCUS Report Part II CSE, Computation of Net Capital Requirement, Line 15. As discussed below in
section II.C.2. of the release, Rule 17a-11 requires a broker to give notification when its net capital falls
below 5% of aggregate debit items and when its net capital falls below 120% of the minimum net capital
requirement. See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(c)(2)-(3).

517	

See Part 1 of proposed Form SBS, Computation of Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements (BrokerDealer), Line 9A. See also Part 1 of proposed Form SBS, Computation of Minimum Regulatory Capital
Requirements (Non-Broker-Dealer), Line 9A. As noted above, Rule 17a-11 requires a broker dealer to
give notification when its net capital computation performed pursuant to Rule 15c3-1 shows that its total
net capital is less than 120% of the broker-dealer’s required minimum net capital. See 17 CFR 240.17a11(c)(3). As discussed below in section II.C.2. of the release, proposed Rule 18a-8 would require a standalone SBSD to notify the Commission when its net capital computation shows that its total net capital is
less than 120% of the SBSD’s required minimum net capital.

Statement of Income (Loss)
FINRA has adopted Form SSOI with the Commission’s approval “to magnify the data
from the Statement of Income (Loss) page of the FOCUS Report.”518 The statement of income
(loss) section on proposed Form SBS is modeled on Form SSOI and uses the same line items to
report information about categories of revenues and expenses.519 However, as discussed below,
the proposed Form SBS section has additional line items that are not on Form SSOI.
First, a broker-dealer is required to enter into Form SSOI detail about the amount of
revenue attributable to fees or commissions with respect to various categories of securities.520
The statement of income (loss) section on proposed Form SBS would require a nonbank SBSD
or nonbank MSBSP to enter the same information.521 In addition, the section would elicit
information about commissions and fees attributable to security-based swaps, mixed swaps, and
swaps.522

revenue attributable to gains or losses on principal trades with respect to various categories of
financial instruments, including security-based swaps and swaps.523 The statement of income

(loss) section on proposed Form SBS would require an SBSD or MSBSP to enter the same
information, except that it would require additional detail about gains or losses with respect to
security-based swaps and swaps.524 Specifically, the section would require entries for gains and
losses with respect to the following categories of security-based swaps: (1) debt security-based
swaps (other than credit default swaps); (2) equity security-based swaps, (3) credit default swaps;
and (4) other security-based swaps.525 It further would require entries for gains and losses with
respect to mixed swaps526 and the following categories of swaps: (1) interest rate swaps; (2)

investment accounts.528 Specifically, the section requires: (1) the dollar amount of the realized
gains or losses; (2) the dollar amount of the unrealized gains or losses; and (3) the total dollar
amount of the gains or losses.529 Form SSOI requires the total dollar amount of gains or losses
on firm investments but not the detail on the realized and unrealized gains or losses that must be
reported on the FOCUS Report Part II.530 The statement of income (loss) section on proposed
Form SBS would require an SBSD or MSBSP to report the same detail about capital gains and
losses on investment accounts as the FOCUS Report Part II.531

Computation of Tangible Net Worth
Proposed Rule 18a-2 would require stand-alone MSBSPs to maintain positive tangible
net worth.532 Under proposed Rule 18a-2, tangible net worth would be defined to mean the
MSBSP’s net worth, as determined in accordance with GAAP in the U.S., excluding goodwill
and other intangible assets.533 Part 1 of proposed Form SBS has a computation of tangible net
worth section that would need to be completed by an MSBSP.534 In separate lines, the MSBSP
would enter: (1) total ownership equity; and (2) goodwill and other intangible assets.535 The
difference between those two line items would be entered in a third line to indicate the MSBSP’s
tangible net worth.536
Reserve Account Computation under Proposed Rule 18a-4
Proposed Rule 18a-4 would require an SBSD, among other things, to maintain a securitybased swap customer reserve account at a bank separate from any other bank account of the
SBSD.537 Further, proposed Rule 18a-4 would provide that the SBSD must at all times maintain
in the security-based swap customer reserve bank account cash and/or qualified securities in
amounts computed daily in accordance with a formula set forth in Exhibit A to proposed Rule

customers that are not security-based swap customers and, in the case of a broker-dealer SBSD, Rule 18a-4
with respect to security-based swap customers. Proposed Rule 18a-4 would provide that the SBSD must at
all times maintain in the security-based swap customer reserve account cash and/or qualified securities in
amounts computed daily in accordance with Exhibit A to proposed Rule 18a-4.

18a-4.538 The formula in Exhibit A to proposed Rule 18a-4 is modeled closely on the formula in
Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3.539 Consequently, the steps necessary to compute the reserve account
deposit requirement under proposed Rule 18a-4 are, for the most part, the same steps necessary
to compute the reserve account deposit requirement under Rule 15c3-3.
Part 1 of proposed Form SBS has a section on which a broker-dealer SBSD or standalone SBSD would provide a computation of the deposit requirement for the security-based swap
customer reserve account.540 The section is modeled on the sections in the FOCUS Report Part
II and Part II CSE on which broker-dealers provide a computation of the reserve account deposit
requirement under Rule 15c3-3.541 The computation section on proposed Form SBS has two line
items that are not on the FOCUS Report Part II CSE or Part II section to account for two
additional debit items that are part of the formula in Appendix A to proposed Rule 18a-4.542
Information for Possession or Control Requirements under Proposed Rule 18a-4

physical possession or control of all excess securities collateral carried for the accounts of

Report Part II and Part II CSE on which broker-dealers report information related to the
possession or control requirements of Rule 15c3-3.545

Part 2 of Proposed Form SBS

As discussed above, the proposed reporting requirements for bank SBSDs and bank
MSBSPs generally are designed to be tailored specifically to their activities as an SBSD or an
MSBSP. However, in order to be able to monitor the financial condition of bank SBSDs and
bank MSBSPs, the Commission is proposing a limited program of reporting certain general
financial information by these registrants, which is based on the reporting requirements of the
prudential regulators. Specifically, banks are required to file quarterly reports on FFIEC Form
031.546 Like the FOCUS Report, FFIEC Form 031 elicits financial and operational information
543	

Under proposed Rule 18a-4, the term excess securities collateral would be defined to mean securities and
money market instruments carried for the account of a security-based swap customer that have a market
value in excess of the current exposure of the SBSD to the customer, excluding, under certain specified
conditions, securities or money market instruments used to meet a margin requirement of a registered
security-based swap clearing agency or of another SBSD. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation
Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital
Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70279. The term security-based swap customer would be
defined to mean any person from whom or on whose behalf the SBSD has received or acquired or holds
funds or other property for the account of the person with respect to a cleared or non-cleared security-based
swap transaction. See id. at 70278. The definition would exclude a person to the extent that person has a
claim for funds or other property which by contract, agreement or understanding, or by operation of law, is
part of the capital of the SBSD or is subordinated to all claims of security-based swap customers of the
SBSD. See id.

See Part 1 of proposed Form SBS, Information for Possession or Control Requirements under Rule 18a-4.
Part 2 of proposed Form SBS has an identical section that a bank SBSD would complete.

about a bank, which is entered into uniquely numbered line items. Part 2 of proposed Form SBS
would require a bank SBSD or a bank MSBSP to report certain of the information reported on
FFIEC Form 031.547 Specifically, Part 2 has: (1) a balance sheet section that largely mirrors
Schedule RC to FFIEC Form 031; (2) a statement of regulatory capital section that is a scaled
down version of Schedule RC-R to FFIEC Form 031; and (3) an income statement section that is
a scaled down version of Schedule RI to FFIEC Form 031. Line items on proposed Form SBS
that correspond to line items on FFIEC Form 031 would require the entry of the same type of
information.548
Part 2 of proposed Form SBS also has sections for: (1) a reserve account computation
under proposed Rule 18a-4; and (2) information for possession or control requirements under
proposed Rule 18a-4. The sections of Part 2 are discussed below.
Balance Sheet
A bank must report detail about its assets, liabilities, and equity capital on Schedule RC
to FFIEC Form 031.549 Schedule RC also has a “Memoranda” section that elicits information
about the bank’s external auditors and fiscal year end date.550 Bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs
would be required to report detail about their assets, liabilities, and equity capital on a balance

547	

Obtaining a bank’s FFIEC Form 031 information through Form SBS will allow Commission staff to easily
and efficiently retrieve and transfer the information into a database where values can be compared over
time and with other firms. For example, broker-dealers submit FOCUS Reports electronically to FINRA
through a user-interactive portal known as “eFOCUS.” This allows FINRA and Commission staff to easily
and efficiently retrieve firm-specific data as well as aggregate data across firms.

548	

The identifying number of each Line Item on proposed Form SBS shares the same first four characters as
the corresponding Line Item on FFIEC Form 031. However, the Form SBS line items end with an
additional “b” character. For example, Line Item 0081 on FFIEC Form 031 is Line Item 0081b on
proposed Form SBS. The additional “b” accounts for the fact that some of the line items on FFIEC Form
031 have the same unique numbers as line items on the FOCUS Report.

sheet section on Part 2 of proposed Form SBS.551 The balance sheet section would have the
same line items as Schedule RC to FFIEC Form 031, except it would not include line items from
the “Memoranda” section.552 Consequently, bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs would be required
to report in proposed Form SBS the same information about assets, liabilities, and equity capital
that they report in Schedule RC (excluding the Memoranda information).
Regulatory Capital
A bank must report detail about its regulatory capital on Schedule RC-R to FFIEC Form
031.553 Schedule RC-R also has a “Memoranda” section that elicits detail about derivatives.554
The information elicited on Schedule RC-R is designed to facilitate an analysis of the bank’s
regulatory capital. As discussed above in section II.A.1. of this release, the prudential regulators
are responsible for administering capital requirements for bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs.555
The prudential regulators have proposed capital rules that would require a bank SBSD or bank
MSBSP to comply with the capital rules applicable to banks.556
Bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs would be required to report detail about their regulatory
capital on a section on Part 2 of proposed Form SBS.557 The regulatory capital section would
include certain – but not all – of the line items on Schedule RC-R.558 The included line items

require a bank to enter total amounts of the components of bank regulatory capital (e.g., total
Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3 capital) and other summary measures. The objective is to require high
level reporting of key elements of the regulatory capital of a bank SBSD or bank MSBSP to
obtain a profile of the firm’s regulatory capital position. Thus, the information elicited in Part 2
of proposed Form SBS would not involve the level of detail required by the prudential regulators
on Schedule RC-R.
Income Statement
A bank must report detail about its income (loss) and expenses on Schedule RI to FFIEC
Form 031.559 Schedule RI also has a “Memoranda” section that elicits further detail about
income (loss).560 Bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs would be required to report detail about their
income (loss) and expenses on an income section on Part 2 of proposed Form SBS.561 However,
the level of detail would be significantly less than is required in Schedule RI. Specifically, to
focus the reporting on summary information and information relevant to securities and
derivatives activities, the income section only includes line items from Schedule RI that require
the entry of: (1) total amounts for categories of income, expense, and loss;562 (2) detail about
gains and losses on securities positions;563 (3) detail about trading revenues;564 and (4) detail
about gains and losses on derivatives.565

iii.

Part 3 of Proposed Form SBS

FCMs are required to periodically file with the CFTC and their designated SRO Form
1-FR-FCM.572 Like the FOCUS Report and FFIEC Form 031, Form 1-FR-FCM elicits financial
and operational information about an FCM, which is entered into uniquely numbered line items.
To account for ANC broker-dealers that are dually registered as FCMs, the FOCUS Report Part
II CSE incorporates, substantially in the same format, the following from Form 1-FR FCM:573
(1) a section to show a statement of segregation requirements and funds in segregation for
customers trading on U.S. commodity exchanges;574 (2) a section to show a statement of
segregation requirements and funds in segregation for customers’ dealer options account;575 (3) a
section to show a summary statement of secured amounts and funds held in separate accounts for
foreign futures and foreign options customers pursuant to CFTC Regulation 30.7;576 (4) a section

572	

See 17 CFR 1.10. See also Form 1-FR-FCM, available at http://www.nfa.futures.org/NFAregistration/templates-and-forms/form1FR-fcm.HTML.

573	

The FOCUS Report Part II CSE assigns different numbers to the line items.

574	

See FOCUS Report Part II CSE, Statement of Segregation Requirements and Funds in Segregation for
Customers Trading on U.S. Commodity Exchanges, Lines 1–14. Section 4d of the CEA requires each
FCM to segregate from its own assets all money, securities and other property deposited by futures
customers to margin, secure, or guarantee futures contracts and options on futures contracts traded on
designated contract markets. It further requires an FCM to treat and deal with futures customer funds as
belonging to the futures customer, and prohibits an FCM from using the funds deposited by the futures
customer to margin or extend credit to any person other than the futures customer that deposited the funds.
7 U.S.C. 6d. The CFTC has adopted Rules 1.20 through 1.30 to implement section 4d. See 17 CFR 1.20
through 1.30. The Statement of Segregation Requirements and Funds in Segregation for Customers
Trading on U.S. Commodity Exchanges generally indicates the total amount of funds held by the FCM in
segregated accounts, the total amount of funds that the FCM must hold in segregated accounts to meet its
regulatory obligations to futures customers, and whether the firm holds excess segregated funds in the
segregated accounts as of the reporting date.

575	

See FOCUS Report Part II CSE, Statement of Segregation Requirements and Funds in Segregation for
Customers’ Dealer Options Accounts, Lines 1–3. Rule 1.32 requires an FCM to prepare a daily
computation which shows: (1) the amount of funds that an FCM is required to segregate for customers who
are trading on U.S. commodity exchanges pursuant to the CEA and CFTC rules; (2) the amount of funds
the FCM actually has in segregated accounts; and (3) the amount, if any, of the FCM's residual interest in
the customer funds segregated. See 17 CFR 1.32.

576	

See FOCUS Report Part II CSE, Statement of Secured Amounts and Funds Held in Separate Accounts for
Foreign Futures and Foreign Options Customers Pursuant to Commission Regulation 30.7, Foreign Futures
and Foreign Options Secured Amount: Summary, Lines I–II, 1–3. Section 4(b) of the CEA provides that
the CFTC may adopt rules and regulations proscribing fraud and requiring minimum financial standards,

135 


to show a statement of secured amounts and funds held in separate accounts for foreign futures
and foreign options customers pursuant to CFTC Regulation 30.7;577 and (5) a section to show a
computation of the firm’s minimum capital requirement.578 An ANC broker-dealer dually
registered as an FCM can file the FOCUS Report Part II CSE rather than Form 1-FR-FCM.579
The CFTC recently adopted amendments to Form 1-FR-FCM that change the format of
the sections identified in items (1), (3), and (4) above to enhance customer protections, risk
management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards,
customer disclosures, and auditing and examination programs for FCMs.580 The format of these

the disclosure of risk, the filing of reports, the keeping of books and records, the safeguarding of the funds
deposited by persons for trading on foreign markets, and registration with the CFTC by any person located
in the U.S. who engages in the offer or sale of any contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery that
is made subject to the rules of a board of trade located outside of the U.S. See 7 U.S.C. 6. Pursuant to
section 4(b), the CFTC adopted Part 30 of its regulations to address foreign futures and foreign option
transactions. See 17 CFR 30.1 through 30.13. Rule 30.7 provides that an FCM may deposit the funds
belonging to foreign futures or foreign options customer in an account or accounts maintained at a bank or
trust company located in the U.S., a bank or trust company located outside the U.S. that has in excess of $1
billion of regulatory capital, an FCM registered with the CFTC, a derivatives clearing organization, a
member of a foreign board of trade, a foreign clearing organization, or a depository selected by the member
of a foreign board of trade or foreign clearing organization. See 17 CFR 30.7.
577	

See FOCUS Report Part II CSE, Statement of Secured Amounts and Funds Held in Separate Accounts for
Foreign Futures and Foreign Options Customers Pursuant to Commission Regulation 30.7, Funds
Deposited In Separate 17 C.F.R. § 30.7 Accounts, Lines 1–8. This statement generally indicates the total
amount of funds held by the FCM in secured accounts, the total amount of funds that the FCM must hold in
secured accounts to meet its regulatory obligations to foreign futures or foreign options customers, and
whether the firm holds excess secured funds in the secured accounts as of the reporting date.

578	

See FOCUS Report Part II CSE, Computation of CFTC Minimum Net Capital Requirement, Lines A–C. A
broker-dealer dually registered as an FCM is required to maintain net capital in an amount at least equal to
the greater of: (1) the minimum amount required of a broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1; and (2) the
minimum amount required of an FCM under CFTC Rule 1.17. See 17 CFR 1.17; 17 CFR 240.15c3-1.

See 17 CFR 1.10(h) (allowing broker-dealers to file the FOCUS Report instead of Form 1-FR-FCM so long
as all information required to be furnished on and submitted with Form 1-FR-FCM is provided with the

sections in proposed Form SBS are substantively the same as the format of these recently
amended sections of Form 1-FR-FCM.581
In addition, the CFTC adopted a new section for Form 1-FR-FCM that requires an FCM
to provide detail about segregation requirements and funds in cleared swap customer accounts.582
This new section is comparable to the section on which an FCM provides a Statement of
Segregation Requirements and Funds in Segregation for Customers Trading on U.S. Commodity
Exchanges.583 The purpose of the new section is to provide an FCM that carries accounts for
customers that maintain cleared swap positions with a means to document and to demonstrate its
compliance with its obligation to treat, and deal with all money, securities, and property of any
swap customer received to margin, guarantee, or secure a swap cleared by or through a
derivatives clearing organization (including money, securities, or property accruing to swap
customers as the result of such a swap) as belonging to the FCM’s swap customers as required
by section 4d of the CEA.584
Consistent with the CFTC’s recent amendment, proposed Form SBS would include a
section requiring an FCM filer to report detail about segregation requirements and funds in

581	

One of the objectives of including the Form 1-FR-FCM sections in proposed Form SBS is to permit a filer
that is dually registered as an FCM to be able to use proposed Form SBS to comply with reporting
requirements of the CFTC, subject to approval by the CFTC. This objective could be defeated if the format
of the sections on proposed Form SBS is substantively different than the format of the sections on Form
1-FR-FCM. See 17 CFR 1.10(h) (allowing broker-dealers to file the FOCUS Report instead of Form
1-FR-FCM so long as all information required to be furnished on and submitted with Form 1-FR-FCM is

Part 4 of Proposed Form SBS

Part 4 of proposed Form SBS would apply to nonbank SBSDs and nonbank MSBSPs.
Part 4 consists of four schedules that elicit detailed information about a firm’s security-based
swap and swap positions, counterparties, and exposures. As discussed below, certain of the
schedules are modeled on schedules to the FOCUS Report.
The schedules in Part 4 of proposed Form SBS would require filers to report information
relating to their exposures resulting from over-the-counter derivatives exposures (including
exposures relating to security-based swaps and swaps). The instructions to proposed Form SBS
would define terms that are used to indicate the type of information to be entered about the
exposures. Specifically, the terms are: (1) gross replacement value also referred to as gross

See Part 3 of proposed Form SBS, Statement of Cleared Swaps Customer Segregation Requirements and
Funds in Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts under Section 4D(F) of the Commodity Exchange Act, Lines 1–
16.

586	

The instructions to proposed Form SBS would define the terms gross replacement value and gross
replacement value – receivable as the amount that would need to be paid to enter into identical contracts
with respect to derivatives positions that have a positive mark-to-market value to the firm (i.e., are
receivable positions of the firm), without applying any netting or collateral. See the Definitions section of
the instructions to proposed Form SBS. Applicable netting and collateral rules would include Appendix E
to Rule 15c3-1 that prescribes, and proposed Rule 18a-1 that would prescribe, requirements for when
netting agreements and collateral can be taken into account for purposes of calculating credit risk charges
as part of computing net capital. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1e(c)(4)(iv) and (v); Capital, Margin, and
Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants
and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR 70240–70245. In addition, proposed Rule 18a-3
would prescribe when netting agreements and collateral can be taken into account for purposes calculating
margin requirements for non-cleared security-based swaps. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation
Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital
Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR 70260–70265. The CFTC also has requirements for netting
agreements and collateral for the purposes of the proposed capital requirements for swap dealers and major
swap participants. See Enhancing Protections Afforded Customers and Customer Funds Held by Futures
Commission Merchants and Derivatives Clearing Organizations, 78 FR 68506. Similarly, the prudential
regulators have proposed requirements for netting agreements and collateral for the purposes of their
proposed capital and margin requirements for bank SBSDs, bank MSBSPs, bank swap dealers, and bank
major swap participants. See Margin and Capital Requirements for Covered Swap Entities, 76 FR 27564.

Schedule 1
ANC broker-dealers are required to complete a schedule on the FOCUS Report Part II
CSE to report the dollar amount of the aggregate long and short positions in various categories of
financial instruments held by the firm.592 The categories include, for example, U.S. treasury
securities, foreign debt securities, foreign equity securities, and corporate obligations. The
schedule has a single line for derivatives.593 Schedule 1 to Part 4 of proposed Form SBS has a
subsection that elicits the dollar amount of the aggregate long and short positions in the same
categories of non-derivative financial instruments as the FOCUS Report Part II CSE section.594
587	

The instructions to proposed Form SBS would define the term gross replacement value – payable as the
amount that would need to be paid to enter into identical contracts with respect to derivatives positions that
have a negative mark-to-market value to the firm (i.e., are payable positions of the firm), without applying
any netting or collateral. See the Definitions section of the instructions to proposed Form SBS.

588	

The instructions to proposed Form SBS would define the term net replacement value as the amount of the
“gross replacement value – receivable” minus the amount of the “gross replacement value – payable” that
may be netted for each counterparty in accordance with applicable rules. See the Definitions section of the
instructions to proposed Form SBS.

589	

The instructions to proposed Form SBS would define the term current net exposure as the net replacement
value minus the fair market value of collateral collected that may be applied under applicable rules (e.g.,
taking into account haircuts to the fair market value of the collateral required under applicable rules). See
the Definitions section of the instructions to proposed Form SBS.

590	

The instructions to proposed Form SBS would define the term total exposure as the sum of the following
(as applicable): (1) the current net exposure; (2) the amount of initial margin for cleared security-based
swaps and swaps required by a clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization (regardless of whether
the margin has been collected); (3) the margin amount for uncleared security-based swaps calculated under
paragraph (c) of proposed Rule 18a-3; (4) the initial margin for non-cleared swaps calculated under the
CFTC’s rules (regardless of whether the margin has been collected); and (5) maximum potential exposure
as defined in 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.15c3-1 or 18a-1, as applicable, for any over-the-counter derivatives not
included above. See the Definitions section of the instructions to proposed Form SBS.

591	

The instructions to proposed Form SBS would define the term margin collected as the amount of initial
margin collateral collected that can be applied against the firm’s total exposure under applicable rules. See
the Definitions section of the instructions to proposed Form SBS.

Schedule 1 elicits more detail about security-based swap, mixed swap, and swap
positions than the parallel FOCUS Report Part II CSE section.595 Specifically, it would require
the filer to enter the aggregate long and short positions for cleared and non-cleared: (1) debt
security-based swaps (other than credit default swaps); (2) equity security-based swaps,
(3) credit default security-based swaps; and (4) other security-based swaps.596 It further would
require the same information with respect to mixed swaps597 and the following categories of
swaps: (1) interest rate swaps; (2) foreign exchange swaps; (3) commodity swaps; (4) debt index
swaps (other than credit default swaps); (5) equity index swaps; (6) credit default swaps; and
(7) other swaps.598 The instructions to proposed Form SBS would direct firms to report the
month-end gross replacement value for cleared and non-cleared receivables in the long column,
and report the month-end gross replacement value for cleared and non-cleared receivables in the
short column.599

595	

In addition to the differences discussed below, for increased clarity, Line 2 of the proposed Form SBS
schedule would read “U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprises” instead of
“U.S. government agency and government-sponsored entities”. Compare FOCUS Report Part II CSE,
Aggregate Securities and OTC Derivatives Positions, Line 2 with Part 4 of proposed Form SBS, Schedule
1, Aggregate Securities, Commodities, and Swaps Positions, Line 2. Moreover, the proposed Form SBS
schedule would elicit detail with respect to two categories of U.S. government agency securities and U.S.
government sponsored enterprise securities: debt securities and mortgage-backed securities. Finally, for
increased clarity, Line 17 would read “Securities with no ready market” instead of “Investments with no
ready market”. Compare FOCUS Report Part II CSE, Aggregate Securities and OTC Derivatives
Positions, Line 13 with Part 4 of proposed Form SBS, Schedule 1, Aggregate Securities, Commodities, and
Swaps Positions, Line 17. See also Letter from Howard Spindel, Senior Managing Director, and Cassondra

Schedule 2
ANC broker-dealers are required to provide detail on Schedule III to the FOCUS Report
Part II CSE about the fifteen counterparties to which they have the largest credit exposures in
derivatives.600 The FOCUS Report Part II CSE specifies that an ANC broker-dealer must
provide for each of the fifteen counterparties: (1) a counterparty identifier; (2) the counterparty’s
country; (3) the counterparty’s industry segment; (4) the counterparty’s credit rating; (5) the
gross replacement value of the receivables from and payables to the counterparty; (6) the net
replacement value of the transactions with the counterparty; (7) the current net exposure to the
counterparty; (8) the total credit exposure to the counterparty; and (9) the aggregate maximum
potential exposure to the counterparty.601 It also requires total amounts for items (5) through (9)
above (i.e., the sum of the amounts for the fifteen counterparties).602
Schedule 2 to Part 4 of proposed Form SBS has two tables that are modeled on Schedule
III to the FOCUS Report Part II CSE.603 The first table would require a nonbank SBSD or a
nonbank MSBSP to identify in the first column the fifteen counterparties to which the firm has
the largest current net exposure in the order from the largest to the smallest current net
exposure.604 The second table would require the filer to identify in the first column the fifteen
counterparties to which the firm as the largest total exposure in the order from the largest to the

following information: (1) the counterparty’s unique identifier; (2) the counterparty’s internal
credit rating assigned by the SBSD or MSBSP; (3) the amount of the gross replacement value –
receivables from the counterparty (gross gain); (4) the amount of the gross replacement value –
payables to the counterparty (gross gain); (5) the amount of the net replacement value of the
derivatives positions with the counterparty; (6) the current net exposure to the counterparty; (7)
the total exposure to the counterparty; and (8) the margin collected from the counterparty.606 For
items (3) through (8) above, the filer also would be required to provide the aggregate amounts
for all counterparties other than the fifteen specifically reported counterparties.
Schedule 3
ANC broker-dealers are required to provide detail on a table on Schedule IV to the
FOCUS Report Part II CSE about their aggregate credit exposures to counterparties grouped by
the internal credit rating assigned by the ANC broker-dealer to the counterparty.607 Specifically,
for each notch in the ANC broker-dealer’s rating scale, the firm must provide the following
information aggregated across all counterparties rated at that notch: (1) the current net exposure
to the counterparties; (2) the net replacement value of the transactions with the counterparties;
(3) the gross replacement value of the receivables from and payables to the counterparties; and
(4) the aggregate maximum potential exposure to the counterparties.608 It also requires total

amounts for these items.609
Schedule 3 to Part 4 of proposed Form SBS has a table that is modeled on Schedule IV to
the FOCUS Report Part II CSE.610 This table would require the filer to set forth its internal
credit rating scale in the left hand column.611 For each notch in the rating scale, the filer would
need to provide: (1) the amount of the gross replacement value – receivables from the
counterparties rated at that notch; (2) the amount of the gross replacement value – payables to the
counterparties rated at that notch; (3) the amount of the net replacement value of the derivatives
positions with the counterparties rated at that notch; (4) the current net exposure to the
counterparties rated at that notch; (5) the total exposure to the counterparties rated at that notch;
and (6) the margin collected from the counterparties rated at that notch.612
Schedule 4
ANC broker-dealers are required to provide detail on a table on Schedule II to the
FOCUS Report Part II CSE about their OTC derivatives exposures grouped by country.613
Specifically, for each country, the firm must provide the following information aggregated across
all counterparties located in that country and grouped by credit rating category: (1) the current
net exposure to the counterparties; (2) the net replacement value of the transactions with the

611	

The instructions to proposed Form SBS would provide that each category and notches within a category
would constitute a “notch” in the rating scale. For example, the following symbols would each represent a
notch in the rating scale in descending order: AAA, AA+, AA, AA-, A+, A, A-, BBB+, BBB, BBB-, BB+,
BB, BB-, CCC+, CCC, CCC-, CC, C, and D.

612	

See Part 4 of proposed Form SBS, Schedule 3, Portfolio Summary of OTC Derivatives Exposures by

counterparties is collateralized thereby mitigating the risk to the firm of a counterparty’s default.

counterparties; and (3) the gross replacement value of the receivables from and payables to the
counterparties.614 It also requires total amounts for these items.615
Schedule 4 to Part 4 of proposed Form SBS has two tables that are modeled on Schedule
II to the FOCUS Report Part II CSE.616 The first table would require the filer to identify in the
left column the ten largest countries in terms of the filer’s aggregate current net exposure to
counterparties located in the country in the order from the largest to the smallest current net
exposure amounts.617 The second table would require the filer to identify in the left column the
ten largest countries in terms of the filer’s aggregate total exposure to counterparties located in
the country in the order from the largest to the smallest total exposure amounts.618 For each
country, the filer would need to enter into the tables the following information: (1) the amount of
the gross replacement value – receivables from the counterparties located in the country; (2) the
amount of the gross replacement value – payables to counterparties located in the country; (3)
the amount of the net replacement value of the derivatives positions with the counterparties
located in the country; (4) the current net exposure to counterparties located in the country; (5)
the total exposure to counterparties located in the country; and (6) the amount of margin
collected from counterparties located in the country.619

Part 5 of Proposed Form SBS

Part 5 of proposed Form SBS would apply to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs. Part 5
consists of one schedule that is a truncated version of Schedule 1 to Part 4 of proposed Form
SBS.620 Specifically, Schedule 1 to Part 5 only would elicit detail about the filer’s security-based
swap, mixed-swap, and swap positions. In particular, Schedule 1 to Part 5 would require the filer
to report the aggregate long and short positions for the following categories of cleared and noncleared security-based swaps: (1) debt security-based swaps (other than credit default swaps); (2)
equity security-based swaps, (3) credit default security-based swaps; and (4) other security-based
swaps.621 It further would require the same information with respect to mixed swaps622 and the
following categories of swaps: (1) interest rate swaps; (2) foreign exchange swaps; (3)
commodity swaps; (4) debt index swaps (other than credit default swaps); (5) equity index
swaps; (6) credit default swaps; and (7) other swaps.623
Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment on proposed Form SBS. In addition, the
Commission requests comment, including empirical data in support of comments, in response to
the following questions:
1. As proposed, a broker-dealer that is not dually registered as an SBSD or MSBSP would
continue to file Part IIA, Part IIB, or Part II CSE of the FOCUS Report, as applicable,

counterparties is intended to provide a means to monitor how much of the exposure to the counterparties is
collateralized thereby mitigating the risk to the firm of a counterparty’s default.

whereas SBSDs and MSBSPs (including broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer
MSBSPs) would file Form SBS. As an alternative, all broker-dealers, SBSDs, and
MSBSPs could be required to file the same consolidated form – Form SBS, which could
be re-titled the “FOCUS Report Part II” or some similar name. Under this alternative,
broker-dealers not dually registered as an SBSD or MSBSP (“stand-alone brokerdealers”) would complete Parts 1 and 4 of Form SBS (and would also complete Part 3 if
they are dually registered as an FCM). Should all broker-dealers, SBSDs, and MSBSPs
file the same consolidated form? Explain why or why not, and quantify any estimated
burdens associated with this alternative.
2.	 Does proposed Form SBS elicit the appropriate information for the various types of
registrants that would be required to complete and file the form (e.g., stand-alone SBSDs,
stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, bank MSBSPs, broker-dealer SBSDs, and brokerdealer MSPSPs)? If not, how should proposed Form SBS be modified to address the
information elicited from particular registrant(s)?
3.	 If stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs are required to file Form SBS with the
Commission (instead of with the Commission’s designee), should the Commission
require these firms to file Form SBS electronically? Explain why or why not. If Form
SBS should be filed electronically, should it be filed using the Commission’s EDGAR
system, as an Excel spreadsheet, as a delimiter separated value (DSV) file, and/or using
some other electronic format?
4.	 Are there any line items in proposed Form SBS that require further clarification or
instruction? If so, identify the applicable line items and explain the needed clarification
or instruction.

146 


5.	 Proposed Form SBS consists of five parts. An SBSD or MSBSP would need to
complete: (1) Parts 1 and 4 of Form SBS if it is a stand-alone SBSD, broker-dealer
SBSD, stand-alone MSBSP, or broker-dealer MSBSP; or (2) Parts 2 and 5 of Form SBS
if it is a bank SBSD or bank MSBSP. Should Parts 1 and 4 be consolidated into a single
part? Should Parts 2 and 5 be consolidated into a single part? Explain why or why not.
6.	 Proposed Form SBS would include line items that are not on the FOCUS Report or
CFTC Form 1-FR-FCM. Is it inappropriate to include any of these new line items on
Form SBS? If so, identify the line item and explain why it would not be appropriate to
include it. Should any new line items that are not currently included in proposed Form
SBS be added? If so, describe the new line item and where it should be included on the
form, provide accompanying instructions, and explain why it should be included.
7.	 Are there any line items that should not be included on proposed Form SBS because they
are no longer relevant to broker-dealer activities or would not be relevant to SBSD or
MSBSP activities? For example, are Line Items 150, 160, and 190 relevant to brokerdealer activities? Similarly, is Note B to the Financial and Operational Data section
widely used? Explain why or why not. If a line item is not relevant to broker-dealer
activities, should the Commission remove it from the FOCUS Report? Explain why or
why not.
8.	 Should the Commission rely on the public call reports completed by bank SBSDs and
bank MSBSPs to gather the information necessary to monitor the transactions, positions
and financial condition of the bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs, instead of requiring such
firms to complete and file with the Commission Parts 2 and 5 of Form SBS? If so,
explain why.

147 


9.	 The instructions for proposed Form SBS define “total exposure” as the sum of several
amounts, including “[t]he amount of initial margin for cleared security-based swaps and
swaps required by a clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization (regardless of
whether the margin has been collected).” Should the definition of “total exposure”
instead include the capital charge that would apply to the positions under Rule 15c3-1 or
proposed Rule 18a-1, as applicable? Explain why or why not.
10. According to the proposed instructions for proposed Form SBS, firms should report on
Line Item 120 the market value of encumbered securities that the firm transferred to a
creditor and that the creditor has the right to sell or re-pledge. Should this instruction
instead direct firms to report any encumbered security, whether or not the creditor has the
right to sell or re-pledge the collateral? If this instruction should be changed, should the
instructions for the FOCUS Report relating to the corresponding line item also be
changed? Explain why or why not.
11. With respect to Line Items 190, 650, 660, and 900 of proposed Form SBS, do brokerdealers continue to own exchange memberships as assets? If so, are their values, relative
to the rest of a broker-dealer’s assets, significant enough to continue collecting this
information as a separate line item? Explain why or why not.
12. Should broker-dealer MSBSPs be required to complete the section entitled “Computation
of Tangible Net Worth” in addition to the sections relating to the computation of net
capital and minimum net capital requirement? Explain why or why not.
13. Schedule 1 of Part 4 and Schedule 1 of Part 5 of proposed Form SBS request information
about four categories of security-based swaps: (1) debt security-based swaps, (2) equity
security-based swaps, (3) credit default security-based swaps, and (4) other security-

148 


based swaps. These schedules also request information about seven categories of swaps:
(1) interest rate swaps, (2) foreign exchange swaps, (3) commodity swaps, (4) debt index
swaps, (5) equity index swaps, (6) credit default swaps, and (7) other swaps. Should
different categories of security-based swaps and swaps be specified for purposes of the
Form? Explain why or why not. If different categories should be specified, identify and
define the alternative categories, and explain why these alternative categories should be
specified.
14. Are there terms used in proposed Form SBS and/or its instructions that are not defined
that should be defined? If so, identify the term and describe how it should be defined.
For example, should the following terms in Schedule 1 of Part 4 and Schedule 1 of Part 5
of proposed Form SBS be defined: (1) debt security-based swap; (2) equity securitybased swap; (3) credit default security-based swap; (4) interest rate swap; (5) foreign
exchange swap; (6) commodity swap; (7) debt index swap; (8) equity index swap; and/or
(9) credit default swap? If so, how should these terms be defined?
15. Are there reporting requirements currently not included in these proposed rules that
should be applied to ANC broker-dealer SBSDs? If so, please describe them.
16. Are there additional requirements to promote the reporting of composite security-based
swap transactions into disaggregated data based on risk? If so, please describe them.
3.

Filing of Annual Audited Financial Reports and Other Reports

Rule 17a-5 generally requires a broker-dealer to, among other things, annually file reports
audited by a PCAOB-registered independent public accountant, disclose certain financial
information to customers, and notify the Commission of a change of accountant.624 The rule also

624

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5.

149 


requires the independent public accountant to notify the broker-dealer if the accountant discovers
an instance of non-compliance with certain broker-dealer rules or an instance of material
weakness. As discussed above, the Commission is proposing to amend Rule 17a-5 to account
for broker-dealers that are dually registered as SBSDs or MSBSPs. The Commission also is
proposing certain largely technical amendments to Rule 17a-5. With respect to stand-alone
SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs, the Commission is proposing to include in new Rule 18a-7
many requirements that would parallel requirements in Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended.
However, proposed Rule 18a-7 does not include a parallel requirement for every requirement in
Rule 17a-5.625 Further, the requirements in proposed Rule 18a-7, other than the requirement
discussed above in section II.B.2. of this release to periodically file proposed Form SBS, would
not apply to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs.
a. 	

Amendments to Rule 17a-5 and Proposed Rule 18a-7

Additional ANC Broker-Dealer Reports
Paragraph (a)(6) of Rule 17a-5 requires ANC broker-dealers to periodically file certain
reports with the Commission.626 The reports contain information related to the ANC brokerdealer’s use of internal models to calculate market and credit risk charges when computing net

625	

The Commission is not proposing to include in proposed Rule 18a-7 a requirement that is parallel to the
Exemption Report requirement in paragraph (d)(4) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended, because all
SBSDs would be subject to the segregation requirements in proposed Rule 18a-4. Proposed Rule 18a-7
also would not include requirements that parallel the requirements in paragraphs (d)(6) and (e)(4) of Rule
17a-5, as proposed to be amended, requiring broker-dealers to file certain reports with the Securities
Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”) because stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs would not
be members of SIPC. In addition, proposed Rule 18a-7 would not include a requirement that parallels the
requirement for a broker-dealer to file Form Custody with the firm’s DEA. Additional differences between
proposed Rule 18-7 and Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended, are discussed below.

capital.627 Specifically, ANC broker-dealers must file on either a monthly or quarterly basis the
following reports:
	 For each product for which the broker-dealer calculates a deduction for market risk other
than in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(3) of Appendix E of Rule 15c3-1, the
product category and the amount of the deduction for market risk (monthly report);
	 A graph reflecting, for each business line, the daily intra-month VaR (monthly report);
	 The aggregate VaR for the broker-dealer (monthly report);
	 For each product for which the broker-dealer uses scenario analysis, the product category
and the deduction for market risk (monthly report);
	 Credit risk information on derivatives exposures, including: (1) overall current exposure;
(2) current exposure (including commitments) listed by counterparty for the 15 largest
exposures; (3) the 10 largest commitments listed by counterparty; (4) the broker-dealer's
maximum potential exposure listed by counterparty for the fifteen largest exposures; (5)
the broker-dealer's aggregate maximum potential exposure; (6) a summary report
reflecting the broker-dealer's current and maximum potential exposures by credit rating
category; and (7) a summary report reflecting the broker-dealer's current exposure for
each of the top ten countries to which the broker-dealer is exposed (by residence of the
main operating group of the counterparty) (monthly report);
	 Regular risk reports supplied to the broker-dealer's senior management in the format
described in the application (monthly report);
	 A report identifying the number of business days for which the actual daily net trading
loss exceeded the corresponding daily VaR (quarterly report); and
	 The results of backtesting of all internal models used to compute allowable capital,
including VaR and credit risk models, indicating the number of backtesting exceptions
(quarterly report).628
The Commission uses these reports to monitor the financial condition, internal risk management
control system, and activities of an ANC broker-dealer.629

Alternative Net Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers That Are Part of Consolidated Supervised
Entities, 69 FR at 34449.

151 


As discussed above in section II.A.2.a. of this release, the Commission has proposed
amendments to Rule 15c3-1 that would establish liquidity stress test requirements for ANC
broker-dealers, which would include ANC broker-dealer SBSDs.630 Further, the Commission
has proposed identical liquidity stress test requirements for stand-alone ANC SBSDs as part of
the capital requirements for SBSDs.631 Under the proposed liquidity stress test requirements,
ANC broker-dealers and stand-alone ANC SBSDs would be required, among other things, to
conduct a liquidity stress test at least monthly that takes into account certain assumed conditions
lasting for 30 consecutive days.632 The Commission is proposing to amend Rule 17a-5 to add a
requirement that an ANC broker-dealer must file a monthly report with the Commission
containing the results of the liquidity stress test.633
The Commission also proposes to include a parallel reporting requirement in proposed
Rule 18a-7 applicable to stand-alone ANC SBSDs that is modeled on the reporting requirement
in Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended, applicable to ANC broker-dealers.634 Consequently,
stand-alone ANC SBSDs would be required to file the same types of reports relating to their use
of internal models and liquidity stress tests as ANC broker-dealers, including ANC broker-dealer
SBSDs.
Termination of Membership in an SRO
Paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-5 requires a broker-dealer to file with the Commission the
FOCUS Report Part II or Part IIA, as applicable, within two business days after terminating its

membership with a national securities exchange or national securities association.635 The
Commission is proposing to amend paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-5 to provide that in either of these
events the broker-dealer must file Part II, Part IIA or proposed Form SBS.636 This change is
designed to account for broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs, which, as discussed
above, would use proposed Form SBS instead of the FOCUS Report Part II or Part IIA.
Customer Statements
Paragraph (c) of Rule 17a-5 requires, among other things, that certain broker-dealers
annually send their customers audited statements that must include, among other things: (1) a
statement of financial condition with appropriate notes; (2) a footnote containing a statement of
the amount of the firm’s net capital and required net capital and other information, if applicable,
related to the firm’s net capital;637 and (3) if, in connection with the most recent annual audit of
the broker-dealer, the independent public accountant identified one or more material weaknesses,
a statement by the broker-dealer that one or more material weaknesses have been identified and
that a copy of the report of the independent public accountant is currently available for the
customer’s inspection.638 In addition, paragraph (c) requires these broker-dealers to send their
customers unaudited statements dated six months from the date of the audited statements that
635	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(b).

636	

See paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended (emphasis added to highlight the
modification). The Commission is not proposing to include a parallel requirement in proposed Rule 18a-7
applicable to stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, or bank MSBSPs because such
SBSDs and MSBSPs would not be eligible for membership in a national securities exchange or national
securities association.

637	

The statement in the footnote must include summary financial statements of the broker-dealer’s subsidiaries
consolidated pursuant to Appendix C of Rule 15c3-1, where material, and the effect thereof on the net
capital and required net capital of the broker-dealer. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(c)(2)(ii). Appendix C to Rule
15c3-1 requires a broker-dealer in computing its net capital and aggregate indebtedness to consolidate in a
single computation assets and liabilities of any subsidiary or affiliate for which it guarantees, endorses or
assumes directly or indirectly obligations or liabilities. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1c. The assets and liabilities
of a subsidiary or affiliate whose liabilities and obligations have not been guaranteed, endorsed, or assumed
directly or indirectly by the broker-dealer may also be consolidated. See id.

638	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(c)(1) and (2). A material weakness is discussed below in more detail.

153 


contain: (1) a statement of financial condition with appropriate notes; and (2) a footnote about
the firm’s net capital as described above.639 Under paragraph (c)(5) of Rule 17a-5, a brokerdealer is exempt from sending the statement of financial condition to customers if the brokerdealer, among other things: (1) sends its customers semi-annually the statements described above
relating to the firm’s net capital and, if applicable, the identification of a material weakness; and
(2) makes the statement of financial condition described above available on the broker-dealer’s
website home page and maintains a toll-free number that customers can call to request a copy of
the statement, which the broker-dealer must send promptly to the customer at no charge.640
The Commission has stated that the information sent to a customer about the brokerdealer is “essential for a customer to have in order to judge” whether the broker-dealer is
financially sound and able to efficiently and safely handle securities transactions, monies and
securities.641 The Commission preliminarily believes that it is not necessary to amend paragraph
(c) of Rule 17a-5 to account for broker-dealers that are dually registered as an SBSD or MSBSP.
These registrants will be required to send or disclose to their customers, including security-based
swap customers, the information currently required to be sent or disclosed under paragraph
(c).642
However, the Commission is proposing to include a parallel customer statement
requirement in proposed Rule 18a-7 that is modeled on paragraph (c) of Rule 17a-5.643 Proposed

154 


Rule 18a-7, however, would require (rather than make optional) website disclosure of the
mandated information.644 Specifically, stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs would be
required to disclose on their Internet websites an audited statement of financial condition with
appropriate notes within ten business days after the date the firm is required to file its audited
annual reports with the Commission.645 Website disclosure generally provides customers with
readily accessible information that can be easily viewed at any time. Further, this form of
disclosure generally is less expensive and burdensome than other forms of disclosure.
Consequently, the Commission preliminarily anticipates that firms would opt for website
disclosure if given the choice.
In addition to the audited statement of financial condition with appropriate notes, a standalone SBSD would be required to disclose on its Internet website at the same time: (1) a
statement of the amount of the firm’s net capital and required net capital and other information,
if applicable, related to the firm’s net capital;646 and (2) if, in connection with the firm’s most
recent annual reports, the report of the independent public accountant identifies one or more
material weaknesses, a copy of the report.647 Further, stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone
644	

See paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-7.

645	

See paragraph (b)(1)(i) of proposed Rule 18a-7. As discussed in more detail below, the Commission is
proposing to require nonbank SBSDs and nonbank MSBSPs to annually file audited financial reports with
the Commission that would need to include, among other items, a statement of financial condition. Under
paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 17a-5, a broker-dealer’s audited statements must be sent to customers within 105
calendar days of the date of the broker-dealer’s audited annual reports. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(c)(2).
Further, the broker-dealer’s audited annual reports must be filed with the Commission within 60 calendar
days after the end of the broker-dealer’s fiscal year. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d)(5). Consequently, the
broker-dealer has 45 calendar days after filing the audited annual reports with the Commission to send the
audited financial statements to customers. The Commission is proposing a shorter timeframe (10 business
days) in proposed Rule 18a-7 to make the web-based disclosures after filing the audited annual reports with
the Commission because posting this information to the internet should take substantially less time than
preparing mailings to be sent to all customers.

646	

The statement would need to include summary financial statements of the broker-dealer’s subsidiaries
consolidated pursuant to Appendix C of Rule 15c3-1, where material, and the effect thereof on the net
capital and required net capital of the SBSD. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of proposed Rule 18a-7.

647	

See paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of proposed Rule 18a-7.

155 


MSBSPs also would be required to disclose on their websites an unaudited statement of financial
condition as of a date that is six months after the date of the most recent audited annual reports
and the other information discussed above.648 This disclosure would need to be made within 30
calendar days of the date of the unaudited statement of financial condition.649 Finally, standalone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs would be required to make the information required to be
disclosed to customers on their websites under paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-7 available in
writing upon request of the customer and maintain a toll-free number to receive such requests.650
Annual Reports
Under the recent amendments to Rule 17a-5, paragraph (d) of the rule requires brokerdealers, among other things, to file with the Commission each year annual reports consisting of a
financial report and either a compliance report or an exemption report, as well as reports that are
prepared by an independent public accountant registered with the PCAOB covering the financial
report and the compliance report or the exemption report in accordance with standards of the
PCAOB.651 The financial report must contain financial statements, including, among others, a
statement of financial condition, a statement of income, and a statement of cash flows.652 The
financial report also must contain, as applicable, supporting schedules consisting of a

648	

See paragraph (b)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-7.

649	

The Commission is proposing a shorter time period (30 calendar days after the date of the unaudited
financial statement as opposed to 65 calendar days) for the web-based disclosure of the unaudited financial
statements and other statements, because, as discussed above, posting this information on a website should
take less time than mailing documents. Compare paragraph (b)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-7, with 17 CFR
240.17a-5(c)(3).

650	

See paragraph (b)(3) of proposed Rule 18a-7. While bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs would not be subject
to paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-7, bank call reports are available at:
http://www2.fdic.gov/Call_TFR_Rpts/. See 12 CFR 261.10(d)(3) and (4); 12 CFR 304.2; 12 CFR Pt. 3,

computation of net capital under Rule 15c3-1, a computation of the reserve requirements under
Rule 15c3-3, and information relating to the possession or control requirements under Rule 15c33.653
A broker-dealer that does not claim it was exempt from Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most
recent fiscal year must file the compliance report, and a broker-dealer that does claim it was
exempt from Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent fiscal year must file the exemption
report.654 The compliance report must contain statements as to whether: (1) the broker-dealer
has established and maintained Internal Control Over Compliance (a defined term); (2) the
Internal Control Over Compliance of the broker-dealer was effective during the most recent
fiscal year; (3) the Internal Control Over Compliance of the broker-dealer was effective as of the
end of the most recent fiscal year; (4) the broker-dealer was in compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and
paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 as of the end of the most recent fiscal year; and (5) the information
the broker-dealer used to state whether it was in compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and paragraph (e)
of Rule 15c3-3 was derived from the books and records of the broker-dealer.655 Further, if
applicable, the compliance report must contain a description of: (1) each identified material
weakness (a defined term) in the Internal Control Over Compliance during the most recent fiscal
year; and (2) each instance of non-compliance with Rule 15c3-1 or paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3
as of the end of the most recent fiscal year.656 The exemption report must contain the following
653	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d)(2)(ii).

654	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d)(1)(i)(B)(1) and (2).

655	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d)(3)(i)(A). The term Internal Control Over Compliance means internal controls
that have the objective of providing the broker-dealer with reasonable assurance that non-compliance with
Rule 15c3-1, Rule 15c3-3, Rule 17a-13, or any rule of the DEA of the broker-dealer that requires account
statements to be sent to the customers of the broker-dealer (an “Account Statement Rule”) will be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d)(3)(i).

656	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d)(3)(i)(B) and (C). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of
deficiencies, in Internal Control Over Compliance such that there is a reasonable possibility that noncompliance with Rule 15c3-1 or paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 will not be prevented or detected on a timely

157 


statements made to the best knowledge and belief of the broker-dealer: (1) a statement that
identifies the provisions in paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3 under which the broker-dealer claimed
an exemption from Rule 15c3-3; (2) a statement that the broker-dealer met the identified
exemption provisions without exception or that it met the identified exemption provisions
throughout the most recent fiscal year except as described in the exemption report; and (3) if
applicable, a statement that identifies each exception during the most recent fiscal year in
meeting the exemption provisions and that briefly describes the nature of each exception and the
approximate date(s) on which the exception existed.657
The Commission is proposing amendments to the requirements in paragraph (d) of Rule
17a-5 that require broker-dealers to file annual reports with the Commission and is proposing to
include a parallel requirement in proposed Rule 18a-7 to require stand-alone SBSDs and standalone MSBSPs to file annual reports with the Commission.658 The amendments to paragraph (d)
of Rule 17a-5 are designed to account for broker-dealers that are dually registered as an SBSD or
MSBSP.
First, under the proposals, all broker-dealer SBSDs would be required to file the
compliance report. It is likely that a broker-dealer SBSD would carry funds and securities of
customers and, therefore, would not be exempt from Rule 15c3-3. In this case, under the
recently adopted requirements of Rule 17a-5, the broker-dealer SBSD would be required to file
the compliance report. The Commission believes that a broker-dealer SBSD that has only
basis or that non-compliance to a material extent with Rule 15c3-3, except for paragraph (e), Rule 17a-13,
or any Account Statement Rule will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A deficiency in
Internal Control Over Compliance exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow the
management or employees of the broker-dealer, in the normal course of performing their assigned
functions, to prevent or detect on a timely basis non-compliance with Rule 15c3-1, Rule 15c3-3, Rule 17a13, or any Account Statement Rule.
657	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d)(4).

658	

Compare paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended, with paragraph (c) of proposed Rule
18a-7.

158 


security-based swap customers also should be required to file the compliance report because this
report and the related report of the independent public accountant covering the compliance report
would serve the same customer protection objectives in terms of promoting compliance with
proposed Rule 18a-4 as these reports will serve in terms of promoting compliance with Rule
15c3-3.659 For this reason, the Commission is proposing to amend paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B)(1) of
Rule 17a-5 to provide that a broker-dealer must file the compliance report if it did not claim it
was exempt from Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent fiscal year or it is subject to proposed
Rule 18a-4.660 Further, paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B)(2) of Rule 17a-5 would be amended to provide
that a broker-dealer must file the exemption report if the broker-dealer did claim it was exempt
from Rule 15c3-3 throughout the most recent fiscal year and it is not subject to proposed Rule
18a-4.661
Second, paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5 provides that the financial statements in the financial
report must be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and must be in a format that is consistent
with, and the supporting schedules must include information from, the FOCUS Report Part II or
Part IIA.662 Further, the supporting schedules must contain a reconciliation if the computation of
net capital under Rule 15c3-1 or the customer reserve requirement under Rule 15c3-3 in the
supporting schedule is materially different than computation in the broker-dealer’s most recent
FOCUS Report Part II or Part IIA.663 The amendments to the reporting requirements in
paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5 would add a reference to proposed Rule 18a-4 to be included with
the existing references to Rules 15c3-1 and 15c3-3, and to proposed Form SBS to be included

with each reference to the FOCUS Report Part II and Part IIA to account for broker-dealer
SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs that would use proposed Form SBS rather than the FOCUS
Report Part II or Part IIA.664
Third, as discussed above, the supporting schedules require a computation of the reserve
requirements under Rule 15c3-3 and information relating to the possession or control
requirements under Rule 15c3-3.665 Further, the statements required in the compliance report
and the definitions of Internal Control Over Compliance and material weakness for the purposes
of the compliance report make reference to Rule 15c3-3 or paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3.666 The
proposed amendments would add references to proposed Rule 18a-4 generally or to specific
parallel requirements in proposed Rule 18a-4 so that the supporting schedule and compliance
report requirements would incorporate information relating to proposed Rule 18a-4 in addition to
information relating to Rule 15c3-3.667
As indicated above, the Commission is proposing to include parallel annual reporting
requirements in proposed Rule 18a-7 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs
that are modeled on paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended.668 Under these
proposed parallel requirements, stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs would be required
to annually file with the Commission a financial report.669 In addition, stand-alone SBSDs
would be required to file a compliance report stating that the SBSD has established and
maintains internal controls that have the objective of providing reasonable assurance that non664

compliance with Rules 18a-1, 18a-4, and 18a-9 will be prevented or detected on a timely
basis.670
Further, stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs would be required to file a report
of an independent public accountant covering the financial report and the compliance report, as
applicable.671 The Commission is not proposing to include a requirement in proposed Rule
18a-7 that would parallel the exemption report requirement in Rule 17a-5 because there are no
exemption provisions in proposed Rule 18a-4 that parallel the exemption provisions in Rule
15c3-3.672
The financial report under Rule 18a-7 would need to contain the same types of financial
statements as are required for the financial report under Rule 17a-5.673 Further, it also would
need to contain the same types of supporting schedules and reconciliations as the financial report
under Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended, except that the Rule 18a-7 financial report would
require information relating to Rules 18a-1 and 18a-2, as applicable, rather than Rule 15c3-1.674
The financial report under Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended, and proposed Rule 18a-7
would require information relating to proposed Rule 18a-4.
Similar to the financial report, the compliance report under Rule 18a-7 would need to
contain the same type of statements and information as the compliance report under Rule 17a-5,
as proposed to be amended, except the Rule 18a-7 compliance report would require information
relating to Rules 18a-1 and 18a-9 rather than Rules 15c3-1, Rule 15c3-3, Rule 17a-13, and the

Timing and Location of Filing
Paragraph (d)(5) of Rule 17a-5 provides that a broker-dealer must file the annual reports
with the Commission not more than sixty calendar days after the end of the fiscal year of the
broker-dealer.676 The Commission is proposing to include a parallel requirement in proposed
Rule 18a-7 that would mirror paragraph (d)(5) of Rule 17a-5.677 Consequently, stand-alone
SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs would be required to file the annual reports required under
proposed Rule 18a-7 within 60 calendar days after the end of their fiscal years.678
Paragraph (d)(6) of Rule 17a-5 provides that a broker-dealer must file the annual reports:
(1) at the office of the Commission for the region where the broker-dealer has its principal place
of business; (2) at the Commission’s principal office in Washington, DC; (3) at the principal
office of the broker-dealer’s DEA; and (4) with SIPC.679 The Commission is proposing to
include a parallel requirement in proposed Rule 18a-7 that is modeled on paragraph (d)(5) of
Rule 17a-5.680 In particular, paragraph (c)(5) of proposed Rule 18a-5 would require stand-alone
SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs to file the annual reports at the regional office of the

requirement. See id.

Nature and Form of the Reports
Paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-5 among other things: (1) provides certain exceptions from the
requirement that a broker-dealer engage an independent public accountant to audit the annual
reports, (2) requires the broker-dealer to attach an oath or affirmation to the financial reports; (3)
provides that the annual reports are not confidential except that the broker-dealer can request
confidentiality for all of the annual reports other than the statement of financial condition; and
(4) requires a broker-dealer to file certain additional reports with SIPC.682
Paragraph (e)(2) of Rule 17a-5 requires a broker-dealer to attach an oath or affirmation to
its financial report indicating that the report is true and correct and that the broker-dealer does
not have any proprietary interest in one of its customer accounts.683 Paragraph (e)(2) also
requires that the oath or affirmation must be made before a person duly authorized to administer
such oaths or affirmations and prescribes who must make the oath or affirmation on behalf of the
broker-dealer.684 The Commission adopted the FOCUS Report Part III as the means for the
broker-dealer to provide the oath or affirmation required under paragraph (e)(2).685 The FOCUS

681	

See paragraph (c)(5) of proposed Rule 18a-7. There would be no requirement to file the reports with SIPC
or a DEA because stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs would not be members of SIPC and would
not have a DEA.

These amendments would: (1) add a reference to Rule 17a-12 and proposed Rule 18a-7 to the subtitle;
(2) remove the phrase “Name of Broker-Dealer” and in its place add the phrase “Name of Firm” in section
A; (3) add check boxes to section A for the filer to indicate whether it is registered as an OTC derivatives
dealer, broker-dealer, SBSD, and/or MSBSP; (4) add to the check list at the end of the Form boxes to
indicate whether the annual reports attached to the Form include: (i) a computation of net capital pursuant
to proposed Rule 18a-1; (ii) a computation of tangible net worth under Rule 18a-2; (iii) a computation for
determination of reserve requirements pursuant to proposed Rule 18a-4; (iv) information relating to

Further, the Commission is proposing a number of technical changes to the FOCUS Report Part
III.691
The Commission is proposing to add a reference to proposed Form SBS to the references
to the FOCUS Report Part II and Part IIA in paragraph (e)(3) of Rule 17a-5 to account for
broker-dealers that are dually registered as an SBSD or MSBSP and, therefore, would use
proposed Form SBS instead of the FOCUS Report Part II or Part IIA.692
The Commission is proposing to include parallel provisions in proposed Rule 18a-7 to
the provisions in paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended. Under these
provisions, stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs would be required to attach a

report based on an examination of the compliance report under proposed Rule 18a-7; and (5) replace the
check box entitled “A Reconciliation, including appropriate explanation of the Computation of Net Capital
Under Rule 15c3-1 and the Computation for Determination of the Reserve Requirements Under Exhibit A
of Rule 15c3-3” with two check boxes entitled: (i) “A reconciliation, including appropriate explanation of
the computation of net capital under 17 C.F.R. § 240.15c3-1”; and (ii) A reconciliation, including
appropriate explanation of the computation of net capital under 17 C.F.R. § 240.15c3-3. See Part III of the
FOCUS Report, as proposed to be amended. The proposals also would amend the instructions at the end of
the Form with respect to seeking confidential treatment for portions of the annual reports by adding a
reference to the provisions of proposed Rule 18a-7 governing how to request confidential treatment and
replacing the phrase “For conditions of” with the phrase “To request.” Id.

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 78 FR 51910. These amendments would: (1) add the phrase “PCAOBRegistered” before the phrase “Independent Public Accountant” in section B; (2) remove check boxes in
section B to indicate whether the independent public accountant is certified, a public accountant, or an
accountant not registered in the U.S.; (3) add to the check list at the end of the Form boxes to indicate
whether the annual reports attached to the Form include: (i) the exemption report under Rule 17a-5; (ii) the
compliance report under Rule 17a-5; (iii) the independent public accountant’s report based on an
examination of the financial report under Rule 17a-5; (iv) the independent public accountant’s report based
on the examination of the compliance report, as required by Rule 17a-5; or (v) the independent public
accountant’s report based on the review of the exemption report under Rule 17a-5. See Part III of the
FOCUS Report, as proposed to be amended. The amendments also would remove from the checklist an
item to indicate whether any material inadequacies under Rule 17a-5 were found to exist or found to have
existed since the date of the previous audit. See id.

691	

The proposed technical amendments are as follows: (1) removing the phrase “See Section 240.17a-5(e)(2)”
in the instruction for broker-dealers that claim an exemption from the requirement that the annual report be
covered by an opinion of an independent public accountant and in its place adding the phrase “See 17 CFR

from the checklist and in its place adding the phrase “Statement of cash flows”.

completed and executed FOCUS Report Part III to the confidential and non-confidential portions
of the annual report.693 In addition, paragraph (d)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would provide that
the annual reports are not confidential except that if the statement of financial condition is bound
separately from the balance of the annual reports and each page of the balance of the annual
reports is stamped “confidential”, then the balance of the annual reports will be deemed
confidential to the extent permitted by law.694 Paragraph (d)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would
mirror the confidential treatment of broker-dealer annual reports under Rule 17a-5.695
Qualification of the Independent Public Accountant
As discussed above, a broker-dealer is required to file with the Commission a report of a
PCAOB-registered independent public accountant covering the annual reports.696 Paragraph (f)
of Rule 17a-5: (1) prescribes certain minimum qualifications for the independent public
accountant; (2) requires the broker-dealer to file with the Commission a statement concerning the
accountant; and (3) requires the broker-dealer to file a notice when replacing the independent
public accountant.697
More specifically, paragraph (f)(1) of Rule 17a-5 provides that the independent public
accountant must be qualified and independent in accordance with the independence requirements
of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X and registered with the PCAOB if required by the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002.698

166 


Paragraph (f)(2) requires a broker-dealer to annually file with the Commission no later
than December 10 a statement regarding the independent public accountant engaged to audit its
annual reports.699 The statement must contain, among other things: (1) the name, address,
telephone number, and registration number of the broker-dealer; (2) the name, address, and
telephone number of the independent public accountant; (3) the date of the fiscal year of the
annual reports of the broker-dealer covered by the engagement; (4) whether the engagement is
for a single year or is of a continuing nature; and (5) a representation that the independent public

Oxley Act established the PCAOB and amended section 17(e)(1)(A) to provide that the annual financial
statements must be “certified by a registered [with the PCAOB] public accounting firm.” See SarbanesOxley Act, Pub. L. 107–204, 101, 116 Stat. 745 (2002); 15 U.S.C 78q(e)(1)(A). Title I of the SarbanesOxley Act prescribed specific PCAOB registration, standards-setting, inspection, investigation,
disciplinary, foreign application, oversight, and funding programs in connection with audits of issuers. See
Pub. L. 107–204 generally and, in particular, § 2(a)(7) (defining the term issuer as an issuer as defined in
section 3 of the Exchange Act, the securities of which are registered under section 12 of the Exchange Act,
or that files or has filed a registration statement that has not yet become effective under the Securities Act
of 1933 and that it has not withdrawn). However, as originally enacted, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act did not
expressly prescribe similar programs in connection with audits of broker-dealers that are not issuers. The
Dodd-Frank Act amended the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to provide the PCAOB with explicit authority to, among
other things, establish (subject to Commission approval) auditing and related attestation, quality control,
ethics, and independence standards for registered public accounting firms with respect to their preparation
of audit reports to be included in broker-dealer filings with the Commission, and the authority to conduct
and require an inspection program of registered public accounting firms that audit broker-dealers. See Pub.
L. 111–203, 982. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 17(e) of the Exchange Act to provide,
among other things, that a broker-dealer must annually file with the Commission a balance sheet and
income statement certified by an independent public accounting firm, or by a registered (with the PCAOB)
public accounting firm if the firm is required to be registered (with the PCAOB) under the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002. See Pub. L. 111–203, 982(e)(1); 15 U.S.C 78q(e)(1). Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act
added section 104(a)(2)(D) to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which provides that a public accounting firm is not
required to register with the PCAOB if the public accounting firm is exempt from an inspection program
established by the PCAOB. See id. To date, the PCAOB has not exempted the audits by independent
public accountants of any class of broker-dealer from the PCAOB’s permanent inspection program. See
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; Order Approving Proposed Temporary Rule for an Interim
Program of Inspection Related to Audits of Brokers and Dealers, Exchange Act Release No. 65163 (Aug.
18, 2011), 76 FR 52996 (Aug. 24, 2011). At this time, there is no reason to expect that any types of brokerdealer audits will be exempt from the PCAOB permanent inspection program, and any PCAOB
determination to exempt broker-dealer audits from the PCAOB’s permanent inspection program must be
approved by the Commission.
699

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(f)(2). Paragraph (f)(2) further provides that if the engagement of an independent
public accountant is of a continuing nature, providing for successive engagements, no further filing is
required after the original filing. See id. On the other hand, if the engagement is for a single year, or if the
most recent engagement has been terminated or amended, a new statement must be filed by the required
date. See id.

accountant has undertaken to prepare reports covering the annual reports as required by
paragraph (g) of Rule 17a-5.700
Paragraph (f)(3) of Rule 17a-5 requires a broker-dealer to file a notice with the
Commission if it replaces the independent public accountant engaged to prepare reports covering
the annual reports.701 The notice must contain, among other things: (1) the date of the
notification of termination or the engagement of the new independent public accountant; (2) the
details of any issues arising during the twenty-four months (or the period of the engagement, if
less than twenty-four months) preceding the termination or new engagement relating to any
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, auditing scope or
procedure, or compliance with applicable rules of the Commission; and (3) whether the
accountant's report covering the annual reports for any of the past two fiscal years contained an
adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion or was qualified as to uncertainties, audit scope, or
accounting principles, and must describe the nature of each such adverse opinion, disclaimer of
opinion, or qualification.702
Broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs will be required to engage independent
public accountants that meet the qualifications in Rule 17a-5 and file the statements and notices
700	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(f)(2). Under the recent amendments to Rule 17a-5, broker-dealers that clear
transactions or carry customer accounts must include certain representations in the statement as well. See
Broker-Dealer Reports, 78 FR 51992-51993.

701	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(f)(3). The notice must be received at the Commission’s principal office in
Washington, DC and at the applicable regional office of the Commission not more than fifteen days after:
(1) the broker-dealer has notified the independent public accountant that provided the reports covering the
annual reports for the most recent fiscal year that the independent public accountant’s services will not be
used in future engagements; (2) the broker-dealer has notified an independent public accountant that was
engaged to provide the reports covering the annual reports that the engagement has been terminated; (3) an
independent public accountant has notified the broker-dealer that the independent public accountant would
not continue under an engagement to provide the reports covering the annual reports; or (4) a new
independent public accountant has been engaged to provide the reports covering the annual reports without
any notice of termination having been given to or by the previously engaged independent public
accountant. See id.

independent public accountant qualification, statement, and notice requirements applicable to
stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs that are modeled on the requirements in paragraph
(f) of Rule 17a-5.703
Paragraph (e)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-7 is modeled on paragraph (f)(1) of Rule 17a-5.704
Paragraph (e)(1) would provide that an independent public accountant engaged by a stand-alone
SBSD or stand-alone MSBSP must be qualified and independent in accordance with Rule 2-01
of Regulation S-X and registered with the PCAOB.705 While the PCAOB’s authority with
respect to audits of stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs would be more limited than its
authority with respect to audits of issuers and broker-dealers, the Commission preliminarily
believes that it would be appropriate to require stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs to

705	

See paragraph (e)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-7. With respect to qualifications, paragraph (a) of Rule 2-01
provides that the Commission will not recognize any person as a certified public accountant who is not duly
registered and in good standing as such under the laws of the place of the accountant’s residence or
principal office. See 17 CFR 210.2-01(a). Paragraph (a) further provides that the Commission will not
recognize any person as a public accountant who is not in good standing and entitled to practice as such
under the laws of the place of the accountant’s residence or principal office. See id. With respect to
independence, paragraph (b) of Rule 2-01 provides that the Commission will not recognize an accountant
as independent, with respect to an audit client, if the accountant is not, or a reasonable investor with
knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that the accountant is not, capable of
exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the accountant's engagement.
See 17 CFR 210.2-01(b). Paragraph (b) further provides that in determining whether an accountant is
independent, the Commission will consider all relevant circumstances, including all relationships between
the accountant and the audit client, and not just those relating to reports filed with the Commission. See id.
Paragraph (c) of Rule 2-01 sets forth a non-exclusive specification of circumstances inconsistent with
independence as required under paragraph (b). See 17 CFR 210.2-01(c). For example, an accountant is
prohibited from providing the following non-audit services, among others, to an audit client:
(1) bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of the audit
client; (2) financial information systems design and implementation; and (3) management functions or
human resources. See id. Not all of the independence requirements in Rule 2-01 that are applicable to
audits of issuers would be applicable to engagements under proposed Rule 18a-7. For example, the
independent public accountants of stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs that are not issuers would
not be subject to the partner rotation requirements or the compensation requirements of Rule 2-01 because
the statute mandating those requirements is limited to issuers. See 15 U.S.C. 78j-1(j); 17 CFR 210.201(c)(6). Additionally, the independent public accountants would not be subject to the cooling-off period
requirements for employment or the audit committee pre-approval requirements because those
requirements only reference issuers within the independence rules. See 17 CFR 210.2-01(c)(2) and (c)(7).

Commission has greater confidence in the quality of audits conducted by an independent public
accountant registered with the PCAOB.707
Paragraph (e)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-7 is modeled on paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a-5.708
Under paragraph (e)(2), a stand-alone SBSD or stand-alone MSBSP would be required to
annually file with the Commission no later than December 10 a statement regarding the
independent public accountant engaged to audit its annual reports.709 The statement would need
to contain similar information as is required in the statement under paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 17a5.710
Paragraph (e)(3) of proposed Rule 18a-7 is modeled on paragraph (f)(3) of Rule 17a-5.711
Under paragraph (e)(3), a stand-alone SBSD or stand-alone MSBSP would be required to file a
notice with the Commission if the firm replaces the independent public accountant engaged to
prepare the reports covering the annual reports.712 The notice would need to contain the same
information as is required in the notice under paragraph (f)(3) of Rule 17a-5.713

Engagement of the independent public accountant
Under the recent amendments to Rule 17a-5, paragraph (g) of the rule provides that the
independent public accountant engaged by the broker-dealer to provide the reports covering the
annual reports must, as part of the engagement, undertake to prepare the following reports, as
applicable, in accordance with PCAOB standards: (1) a report based on an examination of the
financial report; and (2) either a report based on an examination of certain statements in the
compliance report or a report based on a review of the exemption report.714 As broker-dealers,
dually registered broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs will be required to engage
their independent public accountants to undertake an examination of their financial report and
compliance report.

accountant’s services will not be used in future engagements; (2) the stand-alone SBSD or stand-alone
MSBSP has notified an independent public accountant that was engaged to provide the reports covering the
annual reports that the engagement has been terminated; (3) an independent public accountant has notified
the stand-alone SBSD or stand-alone MSBSP that the independent public accountant would not continue
under an engagement to provide the reports covering the annual reports; or (4) a new independent public
accountant has been engaged to provide the reports covering the annual reports without any notice of
termination having been given to or by the previously engaged independent public accountant. See id.

The Commission is proposing to include parallel engagement of accountant requirements
in proposed Rule 18a-7 that would be applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs
that are modeled on the requirements in paragraph (g) of Rule 17a-5.715 Specifically, paragraph
(f) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would provide that the independent public accountant engaged by a
stand-alone SBSD or stand-alone MSBSP must, as part of the engagement, undertake to prepare
a report based on an examination of the financial report and, in the case of the SBSD, a report
based on an examination of certain statements in the compliance report.716 There would not be a
provision relating to an exemption report because, as explained above, broker-dealer SBSDs and
stand-alone SBSDs would be required to file the compliance report (and would not be permitted
to file the exemption report in lieu of the compliance report).
Notification of non-compliance or material weakness
Under the recent amendments to Rule 17a-5, paragraph (h) of the rule provides that the
independent public accountant engaged to prepare reports covering the annual reports must
immediately notify the broker-dealer if the accountant determines during the course of preparing
the reports that the broker-dealer is not in compliance with Rule 15c3-1, Rule 15c3-3, Rule 17a13, or an Account Statement Rule or if the accountant determines that any material weakness
exists in the broker-dealer’s Internal Control Over Compliance.717 If the notice from the
accountant concerns an instance of non-compliance that would require a broker-dealer to provide
a notification under Rule 15c3-1, Rule 15c3-3, or Rule 17a-11, or if the notice concerns a
material weakness, the broker-dealer must provide a notification in accordance with Rule 15c3-1,
Rule 15c3-3, or Rule 17a-11, as applicable, and provide a copy of the notification to the

716

See paragraph (f) of proposed Rule 18a-7. 


717

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(h). The term material weakness is defined with regard to the compliance report 

and, therefore, applies only to a broker-dealer that files a compliance report

172 


independent public accountant.718 If the independent public accountant does not receive the
notification within one business day, or if the independent public accountant does not agree with
the statements in the notification, then the independent public accountant must notify the
Commission and the DEA within one business day.719 The report from the independent public
accountant must, if the broker-dealer failed to file a notification, describe any instances of noncompliance that required a notification under Rule 15c3-1, Rule 15c3-3, or Rule 17a-11, or any
material weaknesses.720 If the broker-dealer filed a notification, the report from the accountant
must detail the aspects of the notification of the broker-dealer with which the accountant does
not agree.721
The Commission is proposing to amend paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5 to add references to
proposed Rule 18a-4 to the references to Rule 15c3-1, Rule 15c3-3, and Rule 17a-13.722 Thus,
the independent public accountant would need to notify the broker-dealer if the accountant
determines the broker-dealer is not in compliance with proposed Rule 18a-4.723 Depending on
the nature of the noncompliance, the broker-dealer may need to provide notification to the
Commission in accordance with Rule 17a-11.724

See id. As discussed below in section II.C.2. of this release, the Commission is proposing to amend Rule
17a-11 to require notification to the Commission if a broker-dealer SBSD fails to make a required deposit
into its reserve account under paragraph (c) of proposed Rule 18a-4.

173 


The Commission is proposing to include parallel notification requirements in proposed
Rule 18a-7 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs that are modeled on
paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended.725 Because stand-alone SBSDs and
stand-alone MSBSPs would be subject to different rules, paragraph (g) of proposed Rule 18a-7
would contain separate provisions for each type of registrant.726
Paragraph (g)(1) would apply to stand-alone SBSDs.727 Under this paragraph, the
independent public accountant of a stand-alone SBSD would be required to notify the SBSD if
the accountant determines that the SBSD is not in compliance with proposed Rules 18a-1, 18a-4,
or 18a-9 or that any material weaknesses exist.728 Consequently, the independent public
accountant would need to provide notice to a stand-alone SBSD regarding noncompliance with
requirements that parallel the requirements for which an independent public accountant must
provide notice to a broker-dealer under paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-5.729 Further, the independent
public accountant would need to provide notice of a material weakness just as a broker-dealer’s
independent public accountant must provide notice of a material weakness.730 Like Rule 17a-5,
the receipt by a stand-alone SBSD of a notice would trigger the requirement for the SBSD to

Compare 17 CFR 240.17a-5(h), with paragraph (g)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-7. As discussed above,

and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap
Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR 70217–70257, 70274–70288. As
discussed below in section II.C.2. of this release, proposed Rule 18a-8 is modeled on Rule 17a-11 (the
broker-dealer notification rule). Stand-alone SBSDs would not be subject to an Account Statement Rule.

730	

Compare 17 CFR 240.17a-5(h), with paragraph (g)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-7. As discussed above, the
definition of the term material weakness in proposed Rule 18a-7 is modeled on the definition of the term
material weakness in Rule 17a-5. Compare 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d)(3)(iii), with paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of
proposed Rule 18a-7.

notify the Commission if the noncompliance requires notification under Rule 18a-8 or if the
notice concerns a material weakness and to provide a copy of the notice to the accountant.731
Further, the accountant would be required to notify the Commission if the accountant does not
receive a copy of the notice or if the accountant disagrees with the notice.732
Paragraph (g)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would apply to stand-alone MSBSPs.733
Because the Commission is not proposing that MSBSPs be subject to proposed Rule 18a-4,
proposed Rule 18a-9, or the requirement to file a compliance report, the notification triggers in
paragraph (g)(2) would be limited to noncompliance with the proposed Rule 18a-2 (the proposed
tentative net worth standard for stand-alone MSBSPs).734 Like Rule 17a-5 and paragraph (g)(1)
of proposed Rule 18a-7, the receipt by a stand-alone MSBSP of a notice of noncompliance with
proposed Rule 18a-2 would trigger the requirement for the MSBSP to notify the Commission
under Rule 18a-8 and to provide a copy of the notice to the independent public accountant.735
Further, the accountant would be required to notify the Commission if the accountant does not
receive a copy of the notice or if the accountant disagrees with the notice.736
Reports of the Independent Public Accountant
Under the recent amendments to Rule 17a-5, Paragraph (i) of the rule prescribes
requirements for the reports of the independent public accountant covering the broker-dealer’s

compliance report and the report of the independent public accountant covering the compliance report.

735

See paragraph (g)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-7. As discussed below in section II.C.2. of this release,
proposed Rule 18a-8 would require a stand-alone MSBSP to provide notice to the Commission if the firm
receives notice of noncompliance with proposed Rule 18a-2 or determines that it is not in compliance with
proposed Rule 18a-2.

annual reports, including: (1) technical requirements;737 (2) required representations;738 (3) the
opinions or conclusions to be expressed in the accountant’s reports;739 and (4) requirements
related to matters to which the accountant takes exception.740
As broker-dealers dually registered as SBSDs or MSBSPs, the independent public
accountants of these registrants will need to prepare reports covering the registrant’s financial
report and compliance report pursuant to the requirements prescribed in paragraph (i) of Rule
17a-5.
The Commission is proposing to include parallel independent public accountant report
requirements in proposed Rule 18a-7 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs
that are modeled on paragraph (i) of Rule 17a-5.741 Specifically, paragraph (h) of proposed Rule
18a-7 prescribes parallel requirements for the reports of the independent public accountant
covering the stand-alone SBSD’s or stand-alone MSBSP’s annual reports, namely: (1) technical
737	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(i)(1). Paragraph (i)(1) of Rule 17a-5 provides that the report of the independent
public accountant must: (1) be dated; (2) be signed manually; (3) indicate the city and state where issued;
and (iv) identify without detailed enumeration the items covered by the report. See id.

738	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(i)(2). Paragraph (i)(2) provides that the report of the independent public accountant
must: (1) state whether the examinations or review, as applicable, were made in accordance with standards
of the PCAOB; and (2) identify any examination and, if applicable, review procedures deemed necessary
by the independent public accountant under the circumstances of the particular case that have been omitted
and the reason for their omission. See id. The paragraph further provides that nothing in Rule 17a-5 may
be construed to imply authority for the omission of any procedure that independent public accountants
would ordinarily employ in the course of an examination or review made for the purpose of expressing the
opinions or conclusions required under Rule 17a-5. See id.

739	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(i)(3). Paragraph (i)(3) provides that the report of the independent public accountant
must state clearly: (1) the opinion of the independent public accountant with respect to the financial report
and the accounting principles and practices reflected in that report; (2) the opinion of the independent
public accountant with respect to the financial report as to the consistency of the application of the
accounting principles, or as to any changes in those principles, that have a material effect on the financial
statements; and (3)(i) the opinion of the independent public accountant with respect to certain statements
in the compliance report; or (ii) the conclusion of the independent public accountant with respect to certain
statements in the exemption report. See id.

740	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(i)(4). Paragraph (i)(4) provides that any matters to which the independent public
accountant takes exception must be clearly identified, the exceptions must be specifically and clearly
stated, and, to the extent practicable, the effect of each such exception on any related items contained in the
annual reports must be given.

741	

Compare 17 CFR 240.17a-5(i), with paragraph (h) of proposed Rule 18a-7.

176 


requirements;742 (2) required representations;743 (3) the opinions or conclusions to be expressed
in the accountant’s reports;744 and (4) requirements related to matters to which the accountant
takes exception.745 The requirements in paragraph (h) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would not include
the requirements relating to the review engagement with respect to the exemption report because,
as discussed above, stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs would not file exemption
reports as part of their annual reports.746
Extensions and Exemptions
Paragraph (m) of Rule 17a-5 governs the granting of extensions of time to comply with
the requirements of Rule 17a-5 and the granting of exemptions from complying with the
requirements of the rule, and also provides two self-executing exemptions from complying with
Rule 17a-5 for certain types of broker-dealers.747 As broker-dealers, dually registered SBSDs or
MSBSPs will be able to seek extensions and exemptions under the provisions of paragraph (m).
The Commission is proposing to include a parallel extension and exemption provision in
proposed Rule 18a-7 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and
bank MSBSPs that is modeled on paragraph (m) of Rule 17a-5, but that only provides that the

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(m). Paragraph (m)(1) of Rule 17a-5 provides that a broker-dealer’s DEA may
extend the period for filing the annual reports and requires the DEA to maintain a record of each granted
extension. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(m)(1). Paragraph (m)(2) exempts from the requirements of Rule 17a-5
entities that are: (1) banks or insurance companies as those terms defined in the Exchange Act; (2) are
registered as broker-dealers to sell variable contracts; and (3) are exempt from Rule 15c3-1. See 17 CFR
240.17a-5(m)(2). Paragraph (m)(3) of Rule 17a-5 provides that the Commission may grant an extension of
time or an exemption, upon written request of a national securities exchange, registered national securities
association or the broker-dealer, from any of the requirements of Rule 17a-5 either unconditionally or on
specified terms and conditions. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(m)(3). Paragraph (m)(4) of Rule 17a-5 exempts
from the requirements of Rule 17a-5 entities registered as broker-dealers under section 15(b)(11)(A) of the
Exchange Act the purpose of effecting transactions in security futures products. See 17 CFR 240.17a5(m)(4).

177 


Commission may grant extensions or exemptions.748 Specifically, paragraph (i) of proposed
Rule 18a-7 would provide that upon written application by a stand-alone SBSD or stand-alone
MSBSP to the Commission or on its own motion, the Commission may grant an extension of
time or an exemption from any of the requirements of proposed Rule 18a-7 either
unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions.749
Notification of change of fiscal year
Paragraph (n)(1) of Rule 17a-5 requires a broker-dealer to notify the Commission and its
DEA of a change of its fiscal year.750 Paragraph (n)(2) requires that the notice contain a detailed
explanation for the reasons for the change and requires that changes in the filing period for the
annual reports must be approved in writing by the broker-dealer’s DEA.751 As broker-dealers,
dually registered broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs will be required to file the
notices of changes in fiscal years and obtain approvals from their DEAs as prescribed in
paragraph (n).
The Commission is proposing to include a parallel change in fiscal year requirement in
proposed Rule 18a-7 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs that is modeled
on paragraph (n) of Rule 17a-5, but that only provides that the Commission may approve a

748	

Compare 17 CFR 240.17a-5(m), with paragraph (i) of proposed Rule 18a-7. As discussed above in section
II.B.2. of this release, bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs would be required to file proposed Form SBS on a
quarterly basis. These types of registrants would be able to use the provisions of paragraph (i) of proposed
Rule 18a-7 to seek extensions and exemptions from the provisions of the rule relating to the filing of
proposed Form SBS.

749	

See paragraph (i) of proposed Rule 18a-7. Paragraph (i) of proposed Rule 18a-7 does not include the selfexecuting exemption in paragraph (m)(2) of Rule 17a-5 (applicable to banks and insurance companies
registered as broker-dealers to sell variable contracts) and in paragraph (m)(4) of Rule 17a-5 (applicable to
broker-dealers only effecting transactions in security futures products). Stand-alone SBSDs and standalone MSBSPs would not qualify for these exemptions because, among other things, they would engage in
a broader range of activities than those permitted of entities that may use the exemptions.

change in the filing period for the annual reports.752 Specifically, paragraph (j)(1) of proposed
Rule 18a-7 would provide that, in the event any stand-alone SBSD or stand-alone MSBSP finds
it necessary to change its fiscal year, it must file, with the Commission’s principal office in
Washington, DC and the regional office of the Commission for the region in which the SBSD or
MSBSP has its principal place of business, a notice of such change.753 Paragraph (j)(2) would
provide that the notice must contain a detailed explanation of the reasons for the change and that
any change in the filing period for the annual reports must be approved in writing by the
Commission.754
Filing Requirements
Paragraph (o) of Rule 17a-5 provides that a filing pursuant to the rule is deemed to be
accomplished when it is received by the Commission’s principal office with duplicates filed
simultaneously at the locations prescribed in other parts of Rule 17a-5.755 As broker-dealers,
dually registered broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs will be required to comply
with the filing requirements prescribed in paragraph (o).
The Commission is proposing to include a parallel filing requirement in proposed Rule
18a-7 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs
that mirrors paragraph (o) of Rule 17a-5.756 Specifically, paragraph (k) of proposed Rule 18a-7
would provide that for purposes of the filing requirements in the rule, filing will be deemed to
have been accomplished upon receipt at the Commission's principal office in Washington, DC,

paragraph of the rule which is applicable.757
Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment on the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-5
and proposed Rule 18a-7. In addition, the Commission requests comment, including empirical
data in support of comments, in response to the following questions:
1.	 Will the majority of stand-alone SBSDs apply to use internal models to calculate net
capital? If not, what portion of stand-alone SBSDs will apply to use internal models?
2.	 Paragraph (j)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would require the Commission to approve a
change in the fiscal year of a stand-alone SBSD or stand-alone MSBSP. Should the rule
instead provide that a stand-alone SBSD or stand-alone MSBSP may provide notice to
the Commission of a change in fiscal year and that the notice will be deemed approved by
the Commission unless the Commission rejects the change within a prescribed period of
time such as 30, 60, or 90 days? Are there any other alternative approval mechanisms the
Commission should consider?
3.	 Under the recently adopted amendments to Rule 17a-5, paragraphs (f)(2)(ii)(F) and (G)
require each clearing broker-dealer to include a representation in its statement regarding
its independent public accountant that the broker-dealer agrees to allow Commission and
DEA examination staff to review the audit documentation associated with its annual audit
reports required under Rule 17a-5 and to allow its independent public accountant to
discuss findings relating to the audit reports with Commission and DEA examination

757

See paragraph (k) of proposed Rule 18a-7.

180 


staff if requested for the purposes of an examination of the broker-dealer. Should this
requirement apply to stand-alone SBSDs? Explain why or why not.
4.	 Will entities already registered with the Commission as investment advisers, but not as
broker-dealers, also register with the Commission as SBSDs? If so, would the
compliance report and the independent public accountant’s report based on an
examination of the compliance report be sufficient to satisfy the requirement that certain
investment advisers obtain an internal control report pursuant to Rule 206(4)-2 under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940?
5.	 Could there be broker-dealer SBSDs that claim an exemption from Rule 15c3-3, but that
would be subject to Rule 18a-4? Please provide data to support the answer. If there
would be a broker-dealer SBSD that claims an exemption from Rule 15c3-3 but would be
subject to Rule 18a-4, should the firm submit an exemption report under paragraph
(d)(1)(i)(B)(2) relating to its exemption from Rule 15c3-3 and also submit a compliance
report under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B)(1) of Rule 17a-5 relating to its compliance with Rule
18a-4? Please explain why or why not.
6.	 Paragraph (b)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would require each nonbank stand-alone SBSD
and nonbank stand-alone MSBSP to make certain documents publicly available on its
website within ten business days after the date the firm is required to file its annual
reports with the Commission. Should firms be given more or less time than ten business
days to post the requisite documents on their websites? Explain why or why not.
7.	 Paragraph (b)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would require each nonbank stand-alone SBSD
and nonbank stand-alone MSBSP to make publicly available on its website unaudited
statements as of the date that is six months after the date of the most recent audited

181 


statements filed with the Commission. These reports would need to be made publicly
available within thirty calendar days of the date of the statements. Should firms be given
more or less time than thirty calendar days to post their unaudited financial statements on
their websites? Explain why or why not.
b.

Additional Proposed Amendments to Rule 17a-5

The Commission is proposing several amendments to Rule 17a-5 to eliminate obsolete
text, improve readability, and modernize terminology. The Commission is proposing a global
change that would replace the use of the word “shall” in the rule with the word “must” or “will”
where appropriate.758 The Commission also proposes to make certain stylistic, corrective, and
punctuation amendments to improve Rule 17a-5’s readability.759
As a consequence of the proposed deletion of current paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 17a-5,
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), and (a)(2)(iii) would be redesignated paragraphs (a)(1)(i),
(a)(1)(ii), and (a)(1)(iii), respectively (and the cross-references to these paragraphs would also be
758	

The proposed amendments would replace the word “shall” with the word “must” or “will” in the following
paragraphs of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended: (a)(1)(v), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(6), (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4),
(b)(5), (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii), (c)(3), (c)(4)(iii), (e)(3), note to paragraph (h), (k), (l), (m)(1),
(m)(2), (m)(4), (n)(2), and (o). See Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended.

759	

The Commission proposes the following stylistic and corrective changes to Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be
amended: (1) clarifying in paragraph (a)(5) that ANC broker-dealers must file additional reports “with the
Commission”; (2) replacing “monthly” with “on a monthly basis” in paragraph (a)(1)(v); (3) replacing “10
largest commitments” with “ten largest commitments” in paragraph (a)(5)(v)(C); (4) replacing “broker or
dealer’s” with “broker’s or dealer’s” in paragraphs (a)(5)(v)(D)-(G); (5) cross-referencing “paragraphs
(c)(1) and (c)(2)” and “paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii)” instead of “paragraphs (c)(1) and (2)” and
“paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii)” in paragraph (c)(3); (6) cross-referencing “paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) and
(c)(2)(iv)” instead of “paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) and (iv)” in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(C); (9) eliminating the
quotation marks around the defined term “customer” in paragraph (c)(4), and instead italicizing the defined
term if it is not already italicized; (7) replacing the phrase “Home page” with the phrase “home page” in
paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(C); (8) referring to a broker-dealer’s annual report in the singular instead of the plural
in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) by replacing the phrase “annual reports”, and the words “are”, and “reports” with the
phrase “an annual report”, the word “is”, and the phrase “a report”, respectively; (9) adding the word “the”
before the phrase “independent public accountant does not agree” in paragraph (f)(3)(v)(B); (10) removing
the phrase “by telegram” in the last sentence of the Note to paragraph (h); (11) adding the word “Reserved”
in brackets in paragraph (j); (12) replacing the phrase “Division of Market Regulation” with the phrase
“Division of Trading and Markets” in paragraph (k); (13) replacing the phrase “Securities Exchange Act of
1934” with the word “Act” in paragraph (l); (14) removing the U.S.C. citations from paragraphs (m)(2) and
(m)(4), since the rule already cites to the applicable section of the Exchange Act; and (15) replacing the
phrase “§ 240.17a-5” with the phrase “this section” in paragraph (o).

182 


updated accordingly). Further, as discussed above, the Commission is proposing to add a new
paragraph (a)(1)(iv) to Rule 17a-5. As a consequence of the proposed deletion of paragraph
(a)(1) and addition of paragraph (a)(1)(iv), paragraph (a)(2)(iv) would be redesignated paragraph
(a)(1)(v). Further, as a consequence of the deletion of paragraph (a)(1), paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4),
(a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7) of Rule 17a-5 would be redesignated paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4),
(a)(5), and (a)(6), respectively (and the cross-references to these paragraphs would also be
updated accordingly).
The Commission is proposing to amend paragraph (a)(4) of Rule 17a-5 to specify that a
DEA “must promptly transmit that information” obtained through the filing of Form Custody,
instead of merely requiring that the DEA “transmit the information” obtained through the Form
Custody filing. Pursuant to this amendment, the DEA must provide this information promptly to
the Commission after it is obtained from the broker-dealers, which would facilitate the
Commission’s monitoring of broker-dealer custody practices.
Instead of grouping the ANC reports required by paragraph (a)(5) by the applicable
timeframe, the Commission is proposing to specify the applicable timeframe in each paragraph
requiring an ANC report to be filed. As a result, the numbering within paragraph (a)(5) of Rule
17a-5, as proposed to be amended, would be largely restructured due to the consolidation of
paragraph (a)(5)(i)(A) into paragraph (a)(5)(i), and due to the elimination of certain sublevels to
improve the paragraph’s organization.
As discussed above, the Commission is proposing to add to paragraph (e)(2) of Rule
17a-5 a reference to Part III of Form X-17A-5, which contains the required oath or affirmation.
Thus, the Commission does not believe it is necessary to identify the content of the oath or
affirmation, and proposes to remove the required text of the oath or affirmation in the rule text.

183 


The Commission also proposes to add clarity by specifying that the oath or affirmation is “made
in Part III of Form X-17A-5”.
Since the recently adopted amendments to Rule 17a-5 require a more diverse range of
annual filings, the Commission is proposing to amend paragraph (e)(2) of Rule 17a-5 to
reference “the annual reports” instead of “the financial report”.
Reference is made in paragraph (e)(3) to a “member” of a national securities exchange as
a distinct class of registrant in addition to a “broker” and “dealer”. The Commission is
proposing to remove this reference to a “member” given that the rule applies to brokers-dealers,
which would include a member of a national securities exchange that is a broker-dealer.
Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment on these additional proposed amendments
to Rule 17a-5, including comment on whether any of the proposed amendments would result in
substantive changes to the requirements applicable to broker-dealers.

Introduction

As discussed above, section 764 of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 15F to the
Exchange Act.760 Section 15F(f)(2) provides that the Commission shall adopt rules governing
reporting for SBSDs and MSBSPs.761 Further, section 15F(f)(1)(A) provides that SBSDs and
MSBSPs shall make such reports as are required by the Commission, by rule or regulation,
regarding the transactions and positions and financial condition of the SBSD or MSBSP.762 In

760

See Pub. L. 111–203, 764; 15 U.S.C. 78o-10.

762

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(f)(1)(A).

184 


addition, the Commission also has concurrent authority under section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange
Act to prescribe reporting requirements for broker-dealers.763
After considering the anticipated business activities of SBSDs and MSBSPs, the
Commission is proposing to establish a notification program for these registrants under sections
15F(f) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act that is modeled on the notification program for brokerdealers codified in Rule 17a-11.764 Rule 17a-11 specifies the circumstances under which a
broker-dealer must notify the Commission and other regulators about its financial or operational
condition, as well as the form that the notice must take.765
Rule 17a-11 was promulgated in the aftermath of the securities industry “paper work
crisis” of 1967-1970.766 This crisis prompted the Commission to undertake a study of unsafe and
unsound practices of brokers and dealers.767 The study found, among other things, that early
warning signals required of broker-dealers at the time were inadequate to foretell financial and
operational difficulties in a reliable and timely manner.768 This diminished the Commission’s
ability to take effective proactive steps to respond when a broker-dealer was experiencing or was
likely to experience financial difficulty.769 In response, the Commission adopted Rule 17a-11.770

763

See 15 U.S.C. 78q(a)(1).

764

See 17 CFR 240.17a-11. As discussed below, the Commission also is proposing a parallel notification
requirement applicable to stand-alone SBSDs that is modeled on a broker-dealer notification requirement in
paragraph (i) of Rule 15c3-3. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(i).

(Apr. 28, 1971) (proposing Rule 17a-11) (“Experience during the past 3 years has demonstrated that neither
the Commission nor any self-regulatory body is receiving an adequate and timely flow of information on

This rule requires a broker-dealer to notify the Commission when, among other things, its net
capital falls below 120% of the minimum required amount or below the minimum required
amount, or when the firm fails to make and keep current the books and records required by
Commission rules.771
The Commission is proposing to establish notification requirements applicable to SBSDs
and MSBSPs in order to require the timely notification to the Commission of information about
potential problems at these registrants. The Commission would use the notifications to respond,
when necessary, to financial or operational problems at a particular SBSD or MSBSP by, for
example, heightening its supervision of the firm.
Under the proposed notification program for SBSDs and MSBSPs, broker-dealer SBSDs
and broker-dealer MSBSPs – as broker-dealers – would be subject to Rule 17a-11.772 The
Commission is proposing amendments to this rule to account for a broker-dealer that is dually
registered as an SBSD or MSBSP. Stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and
bank MSBSPs would be subject to proposed Rule 18a-8, which is modeled on Rule 17a-11, as
proposed to be amended. Proposed Rule 18a-8 would not include a parallel requirement for
every requirement in Rule 17a-11.773
the financial and operational condition of broker-dealers. Accordingly, there is a need for a Commission
rule which would impose upon firms (and, secondarily, upon the self-regulatory bodies themselves) a duty
to report net capital and operational problems.”).
771	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-11.

772	

See id.

773	

The Commission is not proposing to include in proposed Rule 18a-8 notice requirements that would
parallel the notice requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of Rule 17a-11 because these requirements
relate to ratios in Rule 15c3-1 (the capital rule for broker-dealers) that are not incorporated into proposed
Rule 18a-1 (the proposed capital standard for stand-alone SBSDs) or proposed Rule 18a-2 (the proposed
capital standard for stand-alone MSBSPs). The Commission is not proposing to include in proposed Rule
18a-8 a notice requirement that would parallel the notice requirement in paragraph (f) of Rule 17a-11
because this requirement generally arises in the context of an Exchange’s supervision of a broker-dealer as
an SRO of the firm. The Commission is not proposing to include in proposed Rule 18a-8 a provision that
would parallel the provision in paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-11 because this provision cross-references notice
requirements in other Commission rules that would not apply to a stand-alone SBSD or stand-alone

186 


For the reasons discussed above in section I. of this release, the proposed notification
requirements for bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs are substantially narrower in scope than the
notification requirements for broker-dealer SBSDs, broker-dealer MSBSPs, stand-alone SBSDs,
and stand-alone MSBSPs. Moreover, the proposed notification requirements applicable to bank
SBSDs and bank MSBSPs, in one case, parallel a notification requirement the prudential
regulators have established for banks.774 Thus, bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs would be able to
use the same information reported to the prudential regulators to comply with the proposed
requirement.

Amendments to Rule 17a-11 and Proposed Rule 18a-8

Undesignated Introductory Paragraph
Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended, would contain an undesignated introductory
paragraph explaining that the rule applies to a broker-dealer, including a broker-dealer dually
registered with the Commission as an SBSD or MSBSP.775 The note further explains that an
SBSD or MSBSP that is not dually registered as a broker-dealer (i.e., a stand-alone SBSD, standalone MSBSP, bank SBSD, or bank MSBSP) is subject to the notification requirements under
proposed Rule 18a-8.776 Further, the Commission is proposing to delete paragraph (a) of Rule
17a-11, which provides that the rule shall apply to every broker-dealer registered pursuant to

MSBSP. Finally, the Commission is not proposing to include in proposed Rule 18a-8 a provision that
would parallel the provision in paragraph (i) of Rule 17a-11 because this provision establishes an
exemption for a special class of broker-dealer.

See paragraph (c) of proposed Rule 18a-8.

187 


section 15 of the Exchange Act.777 This text would be redundant, given the proposed
undesignated introductory paragraph of Rule 17a-5.778
Similarly, proposed Rule 18a-8 would contain an undesignated introductory paragraph
explaining that the rule applies to an SBSD or an MSBSP that is not registered as a brokerdealer.779 The note further explains that a broker-dealer that is dually registered as an SBSD or
MSBSP is subject to the notification requirements under Rule 17a-11.780
Failure to Meet Minimum Capital Requirements
Paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-11 requires a broker-dealer to notify the Commission if the
firm’s net capital or, if applicable, tentative net capital declines below the minimum amount
required under Rule 15c3-1.781 Specifically, paragraph (b)(1) requires notification to the
Commission when a broker-dealer’s net capital falls below the required level the same day it
discovers or is notified by the Commission or its DEA of the net capital deficiency.782 If the
broker-dealer disagrees with the Commission or the DEA that a net capital deficiency exists, the
firm can indicate in the notice the reasons for disagreeing. Paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17a-11
777	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(a). As a consequence of this deletion, paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of Rule 17a11 would be redesignated paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d), respectively. Further, as discussed below, the
Commission is proposing to add two new notification provisions to Rule 17a-11 that would be codified in
paragraphs (e) and (f) of the rule, as proposed to be amended. As a consequence of the deletion of
paragraph (a) and addition of the two new provisions, paragraphs (f), (g), (h), and (i) would be redesignated
paragraphs (g), (h), (i), and (j), respectively.

781	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(b).

782	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(b)(1) . Rule 15c3-1 requires broker-dealers to maintain a minimum level of net
capital (meaning highly liquid capital) at all times. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1. The rule requires that a
broker-dealer perform two calculations: (1) a computation of the minimum amount of net capital the
broker-dealer must maintain; and (2) a computation of the amount of net capital the broker-dealer is
maintaining. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a) and (c)(2). As discussed above in sections II.A. and II.B.2.b. of
this release, the minimum net capital requirement is the greater of a fixed-dollar amount specified in the
rule and an amount determined by applying one of two financial ratios: the 15-to-1 aggregate indebtedness
to net capital ratio or the 2% of aggregate debit items ratio. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a).

188 


requires an OTC derivatives dealer or an ANC broker-dealer to also notify the Commission when
its tentative net capital falls below the minimum required for these types of broker-dealers.783 In
either case, the notice must specify the broker-dealer’s net capital or tentative net capital
requirement and its current amount of net capital or tentative net capital.784 As broker-dealers,
dually registered SBSDs and MSBSPs will be required to comply with the existing notification
requirements.
The Commission is proposing to include parallel capital deficiency notification
requirements in proposed Rule 18a-8 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs
that are modeled on the requirements in paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-5.785 Specifically, paragraph
(a)(1)(i) of proposed Rule 18a-8 would require a stand-alone SBSD to give notice to the
Commission on the same day if the firm’s net capital declines below the minimum amount
required pursuant to proposed Rule 18a-1 or if the Commission informs the stand-alone SBSD
that it is or has been in violation of proposed Rule 18a-1.786 The notice would need to specify
the stand-alone SBSD’s net capital requirement and its current amount of net capital.787 Further,
if the notice is triggered by the Commission informing the stand-alone SBSD that it is or has

783	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(b)(2).

784	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(b)(1) and (2). As discussed above, paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-11 would be
redesignated paragraph (a). Further, as discussed below in section II.C.3. of this release, the Commission is
proposing certain technical amendments to the text in paragraph (b), which would be contained in
paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended.

785	

Compare 17 CFR 240.17a-11(b), with paragraph (a) of proposed Rule 18a-8.

786	

See paragraph (a)(1)(i) of proposed Rule 18a-8. Proposed Rule 18a-1 – which is modeled on Rule 15c3-1 –
would specify minimum net capital requirements for stand-alone SBSDs. See Capital, Margin, and
Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants
and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR 70221–70230.

been in violation of proposed Rule 18a-1 and the SBSD disagrees, the SBSD could specify the
reasons for the disagreement in the notice.788
Paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of proposed Rule 18a-8 would require a stand-alone ANC SBSD to
give notice to the Commission on the same day if its tentative net capital declines below the
minimum amount required pursuant to proposed Rule 18a-1 or if the Commission informs the
stand-alone ANC SBSD that is or has been in violation of proposed Rule 18a-1.789 The notice
would need to specify the stand-alone ANC SBSD’s tentative net capital requirement and its
current amount of tentative net capital.790 Further, if the notice is triggered by the Commission
informing the stand-alone ANC SBSD that it is or has been in violation of proposed Rule 18a-1
and the SBSD disagrees, the SBSD could specify the reasons for the disagreement in the
notice.791
Paragraph (a)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-8 would require a stand-alone MSBSP to give
notice to the Commission on the same day if it fails to maintain a positive tangible net worth
pursuant to proposed Rule 18a-2 or if the Commission informs the stand-alone MSBSP that it is
or has been in violation of proposed Rule 18a-2.792 The notice would need to specify the extent
to which the firm has failed to maintain positive tangible net worth. Further, if the notice is

See paragraph (a)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-8. Proposed Rule 18a-2 would require stand-alone MSBSPs to
maintain positive tangible net worth. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for SecurityBased Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for BrokerDealers, 77 FR 70256–70257. Under proposed Rule 18a-2, tangible net worth would be defined to mean
the stand-alone MSBSP’s net worth as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the U.S., excluding goodwill and other intangible assets. See id.

190 


triggered by the Commission informing the stand-alone MSBSP that it is or has been in violation
of proposed Rule 18a-2 and the MSBSP disagrees, the MSBSP could specify the reasons for the
disagreement in the notice.
Early Warning of Potential Capital or Model Problem
Paragraph (c) of Rule 17a-11 specifies four events that, if they occur, trigger a
requirement that a broker-dealer send notice promptly (but within twenty-four hours) to the
Commission.793 These notices are designed to provide the Commission with “early warning”
that the broker-dealer may experience financial difficulty. The events triggering the early
warning notification requirements are:
	 The computation of a broker-dealer subject to the aggregate indebtedness standard of
Rule 15c3-1 shows that its aggregate indebtedness is in excess of 1,200% of its net
capital;794
	 The computation of a broker-dealer which has elected to use the alternative standard of
calculating net capital under Rule 15c3-1 shows that the firm’s net capital is less than 5%
of aggregate debit items computed in accordance with Appendix A of Rule 15c3-3;795
	 A broker-dealer’s net capital computation shows that its total net capital is less than
120% of its required minimum level of net capital or of its required minimum level of
tentative net capital, in the case of an OTC derivatives dealer;796
	 With respect to an OTC derivatives dealer, the occurrence of the fourth and each
subsequent backtesting exception under Appendix F of Rule 15c3-1 during any 250
business day measurement period.797
793	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(c).

794	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(c)(1). As discussed above, the minimum net capital requirement for certain types
of broker-dealers is the greater of a fixed-dollar amount specified in the rule and an amount determined by
applying a 15-to-1 aggregate indebtedness to net capital ratio. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(1)(i).
Consequently, requiring notification when a broker-dealer has a 12-to-1 aggregate indebtedness to net
capital ratio provides notice before the firm reaches the minimum 15-to-1 requirement.

795	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(c)(2). As discussed above, the minimum net capital requirement for certain types
of broker-dealers is the greater of a fixed-dollar amount specified in the rule and an amount determined by
applying a 2% of aggregate debit items ratio. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(1)(ii). Consequently, requiring
notification when a broker-dealer has net capital equal to 5% of aggregate debit items provides notice
before the firm reaches the 2% minimum requirement.

796	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(c)(3).

191 


As broker-dealers, dually registered SBSDs and MSBSPs will be required to comply with
the existing notification requirements.798 The Commission is proposing to add a new notification
requirement in paragraph (c) applicable to broker-dealer MSBSPs. Specifically, paragraph (c)(5)
of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended, would require a broker-dealer MSBSP to notify the
Commission when its level of tangible net worth falls below $20 million.799
The Commission also is proposing to include parallel early warning notification
requirements in proposed Rule 18a-8 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs
that are modeled on the requirements in paragraph (c) of Rule 17a-5.800 Specifically, paragraph
797	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(c)(4). OTC derivatives dealers (and ANC broker-dealers) take market risk charges
when computing net capital that are determined using the VaR models instead of applying standardized
haircuts. The amount of the VaR measure computed by the model must be multiplied by a factor of at least
three but potentially a greater factor based on the number of exceptions to the measure resulting from
quarterly backtesting exercises. A backtesting exception occurs when the ANC broker-dealer’s actual oneday loss exceeds the amount estimated by its VaR model. Multiple backtesting exceptions can indicate a
problem with the VaR model. See, e.g., Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Supervisory framework
for the use of “backtesting” in conjunction with the internal models approach to market risk capital
requirements (Jan. 1996), available at http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs22.pdf (“The essence of all backtesting
efforts is the comparison of actual trading results with model-generated risk measures. If this comparison
is close enough, the backtest raises no issues regarding the quality of the risk measurement model. In some
cases, however, the comparison uncovers sufficient differences that problems almost certainly must exist,
either with the model or with the assumptions of the backtest. In between these two cases is a grey area
where the test results are, on their own, inconclusive.”).

798	

As discussed above, paragraph (c) of Rule 17a-11 would be redesignated paragraph (b). Further, as
discussed below in section II.C.3. of this release, the Commission is proposing certain largely technical
amendments to the text in paragraph (c), which would be contained in paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-5, as
proposed to be amended.

799	

See paragraph (b)(6) of Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended. As discussed above, proposed Rule
18a-2 would require nonbank MSBSP to maintain a positive tangible net equity. See Capital, Margin, and
Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants
and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70256–70257. The Commission, however, did not
propose that a nonbank MSBSP be required to a minimum amount of positive net equity. See id. The
CFTC proposed a $20 million fixed-dollar “tangible net equity” minimum requirement for swap dealers
and major swap participants that are not FCMs and are not affiliated with a U.S. bank holding company.
See Capital Requirements of Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants, 78 FR at 27827. Further, OTC
derivatives dealers are required to maintain minimum net capital of $20 million. See 17 CFR
240.15c3-1(a)(5). In addition, the Commission has proposed a $20 million fixed-dollar minimum net
capital requirement for stand-alone SBSDs. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for
Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for
Broker-Dealers, 77 FR 70221–70227. The proposed $20 million early warning threshold for broker-dealer
MSBSPs is based on these proposals and requirements.

(b)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-8 would require a stand-alone SBSD to notify the Commission
promptly (but within twenty-four hours) when the SBSD’s net capital falls below 120% of the
SBSD’s required minimum tentative net capital.801 Paragraph (b)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-8
would require a stand-alone ANC SBSD to notify the Commission when the SBSD’s tentative
net capital falls below 120% of the SBSD’s required minimum net capital.802 Paragraph (b)(3) of
proposed Rule 18a-8 would require a stand-alone MSBSP to notify the Commission when its
level of tangible net worth falls below $20 million.803 Finally, paragraph (b)(4) of proposed Rule
18a-8 would require a stand-alone ANC SBSD to report the occurrence of the fourth and any
subsequent backtesting exception performed pursuant to paragraph (d) of Rule 18a-1 during any
250 business day measurement period.804
Notice of Adjustment of Reported Capital Category
Prudential regulators have established five capital categories that are used to describe a
bank's capital strength: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly
undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.805 The definition of each capital category is
based on capital measures under the bank capital standard and other factors.806 A bank is
required to notify its appropriate prudential regulator of adjustments to the bank’s capital
category that may have occurred that would put the bank into a lower capital category from the
category previously assigned to it. Following the notice, the prudential regulator determines

whether the bank needs to adjust its capital category.807 Because these notices may indicate that
a bank is in or approaching financial difficulty, the Commission is proposing to include a
notification requirement in proposed Rule 18a-8 that would require a bank SBSD or a bank
MSBSP to give notice to the Commission when it files an adjustment of reported capital
category with its prudential regulator by transmitting a copy of the notice to the Commission.808
Failure to Make and Keep Current Books and Records
Paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-11 requires a broker-dealer that fails to make and keep current
the books and records required under Rule 17a-3 to notify the Commission of this fact on the
same day that the failure arises.809 The notice must specify the books and records which have
not been made or which are not current.810 In addition, a broker-dealer is required to report to
the Commission within forty-eight hours of the original notice a report stating what the broker or
dealer has done or is doing to correct the situation.811 As broker-dealers, dually registered
SBSDs and MSBSPs will be required to comply with the existing notification requirements in
paragraph (d).812
The Commission is proposing to include a parallel books and records notification
requirement in proposed Rule 18a-7 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs,
bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs that is modeled on the requirement in paragraph (d) of Rule

807

See 12 CFR 6.3(c); 12 CFR 208.42(c); 12 CFR 325.102(c).

As discussed above, paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-11 would be redesignated paragraph (c). Further, as

discussed below in section II.C.3. of this release, the Commission is proposing certain technical
amendments to the text in paragraph (d), which would be contained in paragraph (c) of Rule 17a-5, as
proposed to be amended.

194 


17a-5.813 Specifically, paragraph (d) of proposed Rule 18a-8 would require a stand-alone SBSD,
stand-alone MSBSP, bank SBSD, or bank MSBSP that fails to make and keep current the books
and records required under proposed Rule 18a-5 to give notice of this fact that same day and
specify in the notice the books and records which have not been made or which are not
current.814 Further, these registrants would be required to transmit a report within 48 hours of the
notice stating what the registrant has done or is doing to correct the situation.815
Material Weakness
The recently adopted amendments to paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11 require a brokerdealer to provide notification about a material weakness as that term is defined in Rule 17a-5.816
Specifically, paragraph (e) provides that, whenever a broker-dealer discovers or is notified by an
independent public accountant of a material weakness as defined in Rule 17a-5, the broker-dealer
must: (1) give notice to the Commission within twenty-four hours of the discovery or notification
of the material weakness; and (2) transmit a report within forty-eight hours of the notice stating

813	

Compare 17 CFR 240.17a-11(d), with paragraph (d) of proposed Rule 18a-8.

814	

See paragraph (d) of proposed Rule 18a-8. As discussed above in section II.A.2.a. of this release, proposed
Rule 18a-5 – which is modeled on Rule 17a-3 – would require stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs,
bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs to make and keep current certain records.

815	

See paragraph (d) of proposed Rule 18a-8.

816	

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 78 FR at 51993. As discussed above in section II.B.3.a. of this release, under
the recently adopted amendments to Rule 17a-5, the concept of material weakness is used for the purposes
of the compliance report and the report of the independent public accountant covering the compliance
report. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d)(3). A material weakness is defined in Rule 17a-5 to mean a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in Internal Control Over Compliance (as that term is defined in the rule)
such that there is a reasonable possibility that non-compliance with Rule 15c3-1 or paragraph (e) of Rule
15c3-3 will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis or that non-compliance to a material extent with
Rule 15c3-3, except for paragraph (e), Rule 17a-13, or any Account Statement Rule will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d)(3)(iii). The recently amended rule further
provides that a deficiency in Internal Control Over Compliance exists when the design or operation of a
control does not allow the management or employees of the broker or dealer, in the normal course of
performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect on a timely basis non-compliance with Rule 15c31, Rule 15c3-3, Rule.17a-13, or any Account Statement Rule. See id. The term Internal Control Over
Compliance means internal controls that have the objective of providing the broker-dealer with reasonable
assurance that non-compliance with Rule 15c3-1, Rule 15c3-3, Rule 17a-13, or any Account Statement
Rule will be prevented or detected on a timely basis. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d)(3)(ii).

what the broker-dealer has done or is doing to correct the situation.817 As broker-dealers, dually
registered broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs will be required to comply with the
existing notification requirements in paragraph (e).818
The Commission is proposing to include a parallel material weakness notification
requirement in proposed Rule 18a-7 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs that is modeled on
paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11. 819 Specifically, paragraph (e) of Rule 18a-8 would provide that,
whenever a stand-alone SBSD discovers or is notified by an independent public accountant of a
material weakness as defined in Rule 18a-7, the SBSD must: (1) give notice to the Commission
within twenty-four hours of the discovery or notification of the material weakness; and (2)
transmit a report within forty-eight hours of the notice indicating what the SBSD has done or is
doing to correct the situation.820

817	

See Broker-Dealer Reports, 78 FR at 51993. Paragraph (i) of Rule 17a-12 requires an OTC derivatives
dealer to take the same steps when it discovers or is notified of a material inadequacy as defined in Rule
17a-12. Rule 17a-12 – the reporting rule for OTC derivatives dealers – is similar to Rule 17a-5. See 17
CFR 240.17a-12. However, rather than using the concept of material weakness, Rule 17a-12 uses the
concept of material inadequacy. See id. The Commission replaced the use of material inadequacy with
material weakness in Rule 17a-5 through the recent amendments to the rule, which were designed, among
other things, to (1) increase the focus of carrying broker-dealers and their independent public accountants
on compliance, and internal control over compliance, with certain financial and custodial requirements; and
(2) strengthen and clarify broker-dealer audit and reporting requirements in order to facilitate consistent
compliance with these requirements. See Broker-Dealer Reports, 78 FR at 51911. As discussed above in
section II.B.3.a. of this release, the Commission is proposing to use the concept of material weakness in
proposed Rule 18a-7.

818	

As discussed above, paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11 would be redesignated paragraph (d). Further, as
discussed below in section II.C.3. of this release, the Commission is proposing certain largely technical
amendments to the text in paragraph (e), which would be contained in paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5, as
proposed to be amended.

819	

Compare 17 CFR 240.17a-11(e), with paragraph (e) of proposed Rule 18a-8. As discussed above in section
II.B.3.a. of this release, stand-alone MSBSPs would not be required to file with the Commission a
compliance report or a report of the independent public accountant covering the compliance report.
Consequently, as the concept of material weakness is used in the context of these reports, the material
weakness notification requirement would not apply or be relevant to stand-alone MSBSPs. Further, as
discussed above in section II.B.3.a. of this release, bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs would not be subject to
the requirements in proposed Rule 18a-7 to file annual reports with the Commission. Consequently, the
material weakness notification requirement would not apply or be relevant to these registrants.

820	

See paragraph (e) of proposed Rule 18a-8.

Insufficient Liquidity Reserves
As discussed above in section II.A. of this release, the Commission has proposed
amendments to Rule 15c3-1 that would establish liquidity stress test requirements for ANC
broker-dealers, which would include ANC broker-dealer SBSDs.821 Further, the Commission
has proposed identical liquidity stress test requirements for stand-alone ANC SBSDs as part of
the capital requirements for SBSDs.822 Under the proposed liquidity stress test requirements,
ANC broker-dealers, including ANC broker-dealer SBSDs, and stand-alone ANC SBSDs would
be required, among other things, to: (1) perform a liquidity stress test at least monthly that takes
into account certain assumed conditions lasting for thirty consecutive days; and (2) maintain at
all times liquidity reserves based on the results of the liquidity stress test comprised of
unencumbered cash or U.S. government securities.823
Given the importance to the health of a financial institution of maintaining adequate
liquidity, the Commission is proposing a new notification requirement that would apply to ANC
broker-dealers, including ANC broker-dealer SBSDs.824 Specifically, paragraph (e) of Rule
17a-5, as proposed to be amended, would require an ANC broker-dealer to give immediate
notice in writing if the liquidity stress test conducted pursuant to Rule 15c3-1, as proposed to be
amended, indicates that the amount of the firm’s liquidity reserve is insufficient.825 The

broker-dealer has failed to send notice or transmit a report as required by paragraphs (b), (c), (d), or (e) of
Rule 17a-11, even after being advised by the securities exchange or the national securities association to
send notice or transmit a report, shall immediately give notice of such failure in accordance with paragraph
(g) of Rule 17a-11. See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(f). As discussed above, the Commission is proposing to

Commission is proposing to include a parallel liquidity notification requirement in proposed
Rule 18a-8 applicable to stand-alone ANC SBSDs.826 The proposed liquidity notification
requirements are designed to provide the Commission with notice of a liquidity shortfall at an
ANC broker-dealer or stand-alone ANC SBSD that could impair the ability of the firm to
withstand a liquidity crisis.
Failure to Make a Required Reserve Deposit
As discussed above in section II.A. of this release, Rule 15c3-3 requires a carrying
broker-dealer to maintain a reserve of funds or qualified securities in an account at a bank that is
at least equal in value to the net cash owed to customers, and proposed Rule 18a-4 would include
a parallel requirement with respect to security-based swap customers applicable to SBSDs,
including broker-dealer SBSDs.827 Under paragraph (i) of Rule 15c3-3, a broker-dealer is
required to notify the Commission and its DEA if it fails to make a required deposit into its
customer reserve account under Rule 15c3-3.828 Since a broker-dealer SBSD would be required
to maintain a separate reserve account for its security-based swap customers under Rule 18a-4,
the Commission is proposing a new notification requirement in Rule 17a-11 that would be
triggered if a broker-dealer fails to make a required deposit into its security-based swap customer
reserve account.829 In addition, the Commission is proposing to include a parallel reserve
redesignate current paragraph (f) as paragraph (g). Further, the Commission is proposing to replace the
specific reference to “paragraphs (b), (c), (d), or (e)” of Rule 17a-11 in current paragraph (f) with a
reference to “this section”. This would incorporate all the notices required under Rule 17a-11, including
notices that would be required under the new liquidity notification requirement. See paragraph (g) of Rule
17a-11, as proposed to be amended.

account notification requirement in proposed Rule 18a-8 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and

Manner of Notification
Paragraph (g) of Rule 17a-11 provides that every notice or report required to be given or
transmitted by the rule shall be given or transmitted to the principal office of the Commission in
Washington, DC, the regional office of the Commission for the region in which the broker-dealer
has its principal place of business, the DEA of which such broker-dealer is a member, and the
CFTC if the broker-dealer is registered as an FCM.831
Paragraph (g) further provides that for the purposes of Rule 17a-11, notice shall be given
or transmitted by telegraphic notice or facsimile transmission and that a report about how the
broker-dealer is addressing a failure to make and keep current books and records or a material
weakness may be transmitted by overnight delivery.832 The Commission is proposing to amend
this paragraph to no longer permit notice by telegraphic transmission, and instead to only allow
notice by facsimile transmission.833 This proposal recognizes that telegrams are no longer
widely used in the U.S.,834 and that Commission staff no longer receive Rule 17a-11 notices by
telegram. As broker-dealers, dually registered broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs
will be required to give notice or transmit the notices and reports, including the proposed new
notices, pursuant to the requirements specified in paragraph (g).835

The Commission is proposing to include a parallel manner of notification requirement in
proposed Rule 18a-8 that is modeled on paragraph (g) of Rule 17a-11. 836 Specifically,
paragraph (i) of proposed Rule 18a-8 would provide that a stand-alone SBSD, stand-alone
MSBSP, bank SBSD, or bank MSBSP required to give notice or transmit a report under the rule
would need to do so in the same manner as a broker-dealer under paragraph (g) of Rule 17a-11,
except there would be no requirement to give notice or provide a report to a DEA as these
registrants would not have DEAs.837
Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment on the proposed amendments to Rule
17a-11 and proposed Rule 18a-9. In addition, the Commission requests comment, including
empirical data in support of comments, in response to the following question:
1.	 Should paragraph (f) of Rule 17a-11 be amended to require a broker-dealer’s DEA (in
addition to a broker-dealer’s national securities exchange or national securities
association) to transmit notice to the Commission upon learning that a broker-dealer
failed to send notice in accordance with Rule 17a-11? If so, explain why. If not, explain
why not. For example, given the responsibilities of a DEA, is a DEA more likely to learn
if a broker-dealer for which it serves as DEA has failed to send notice in accordance with
Rule 17a-11 than a national securities exchange or national securities association of
which the broker-dealer is a member? Commenters are asked to provide information and
data about the costs and benefits of requiring the DEA to provide notice.

2.	 Rule 17a-11 is proposed to be amended to include new notification requirements
applicable to broker-dealers (e.g., requiring notice if the broker-dealer’s liquidity stress
test indicates that the amount of its liquidity reserve is insufficient). Consequently, this
would expand the types of instances in which a national securities exchange or national
securities association would be required to give notice under paragraph (g) of Rule 17a11, as proposed to be amended, if the exchange or association learns that a broker-dealer
has failed to do so under Rule 17a-11. Would this expansion materially increase the
number of notices that would need to be sent by national securities exchanges and
national securities associations under Rule 17a-11? If so, please explain why and
quantify the increased burden resulting from the increased number of notices that would
need to be sent.
3.

Additional Proposed Amendments to Rule 17a-11

The Commission is proposing several amendments to Rule 17a-11 to eliminate obsolete
text, improve readability, and modernize terminology. The Commission is proposing a global
change to Rule 17a-11 that would replace the use of the word “shall” in the rule with the word
“must” or “will” where appropriate.838 The Commission also proposes to make certain stylistic,
corrective, and punctuation amendments to improve Rule 17a-11’s readability.839

838	

The proposed amendments would replace the word “shall” with the word “must” or “will” in the following
paragraphs of Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended: (a)(1), (a)(2), (b), (c), (g), (h), and (j). See Rule
17a-11, as proposed to be amended.

839	

The Commission proposes the following stylistic and corrective changes to Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be
amended: (1) replacing the phrase “this § 240.17a-11” with the phrase “this section” in paragraph (a)(1);
(2) replacing the phrase “Every broker or dealer who” with the phrase “Every broker or dealer that” in
paragraph (c); (3) replacing the phrase “such discovery or notification of the material inadequacy or the
material weakness” with the phrase “the discovery or notification of the material inadequacy or material
weakness” in paragraph (d)(1); and (4) removing the U.S.C. citations from paragraph (j) since the rule
already cites to the applicable section of the Exchange Act.

201 


As a consequence of the proposed deletion of paragraph (a), paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and
(e) of Rule 17a-11 would be redesignated paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d), respectively. Further,
as discussed above, the Commission is proposing to add two new notification provisions to Rule
17a-11 that would be codified in paragraphs (e) and (f) of the rule, as proposed to be amended.
As a consequence of the deletion of paragraph (a) and the addition of the two new provisions,
paragraphs (f), (g), (h), and (i) would be redesignated paragraphs (g), (h), (i), and (j),
respectively. Similarly, due to the proposed addition and deletion of paragraphs, the
Commission is proposing a global change that would replace the cross-references to “paragraph
(g)” of Rule 17a-11 with “paragraph (h)” of Rule 17a-11.840
Reference is made in paragraph (g) to a “member” of a national securities exchange as a
distinct class of registrant in addition to a “broker” and “dealer”. The Commission is proposing
to remove this reference to a “member” given that the rule applies to brokers-dealers, which
would include a member of a national securities exchange that is a broker-dealer.
The Commission is also proposing to replace a specific reference to the notices required
under “paragraphs (b), (c), (d), or (e)” of Rule 17a-11 in current paragraph (f) with a reference to
“this section”. This would incorporate all the notices required under Rule 17a-11, including
notices that would be required under the new security-based swap customer reserve account
notification requirement.
Finally, the Commission proposes to amend paragraph (i) to reference “§ 240.15c3-1,
§ 240.15c3-1d, § 240.15c3-3, § 240.17a-5, and § 240.17a-12” instead of
“§ 240.15c3-1(a)(6)(iv)(B), § 240.15c3-1(a)(6)(v), § 240.15c3-1(a)(7)(ii),

840

The proposed amendments would replace the phrase “paragraph (g)” with the phrase “paragraph (h)” in the
following paragraphs of Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended: (a)(1), (b), (c), (d)(1), (d)(2), and (g).
See Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended.

202 


§ 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(x)(B)(1), § 240.15c3-1(e), § 240.15c3-1d(c)(2), § 240.15c3-3(i),
§ 240.17a-5(h)(2), and § 240.17a-12(f)(2)”. This proposed amendment corrects certain crossreferences that are outdated due to the recently adopted amendments to some of these rules.841 It
also eliminates cross-references to specific paragraphs in the event of future amendments to
these cross-referenced rules.
Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment on these additional proposed amendments
to Rule 17a-11, including comment on whether any of the proposed amendments would result in
substantive changes to the requirements applicable to broker-dealers.

	Introduction

As discussed above, section 764 of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 15F to the
Exchange Act.842 Section 15F(f)(2) provides that the Commission shall adopt rules governing
reporting and recordkeeping for SBSDs and MSBSPs.843 Further, section 15F(f)(1)(A) provides
that SBSDs and MSBSPs shall make such reports as are required by the Commission, by rule or
regulation, regarding the transactions and positions and financial condition of the SBSD or
MSBSP.844 In addition, section 15F(f)(1)(B)(ii) provides that nonbank SBSDs and nonbank
MSBSPs shall keep books and records in such form and manner and for such period as may be
prescribed by the Commission by rule or regulation.845

203 


After considering the anticipated business activities of nonbank SBSDs, the Commission
is proposing to establish a securities count program for these registrants under sections 15F that
is modeled on the securities count program for broker-dealers codified in Rule 17a-13.846 Rule
17a-13 requires certain broker-dealers (generally, broker-dealers that hold funds and securities)
to examine and count the securities they physically hold, account for the securities that are
subject to their control or direction but are not in their physical possession, verify the locations of
securities under certain circumstances, and compare the results of the count and verification with
their records.847
Like Rule 17a-11, Rule 17a-13 was adopted in the aftermath of the securities industry
“paper work” crisis of 1967-1970.848 At that time, the Commission identified several factors
contributing to the crisis, including, that securities were not checked and counted frequently
enough nor controlled tightly enough.849 The Commission also identified corrective measures to
counter these conditions in the future,850 including requiring broker-dealers to conduct quarterly
security counts as part of the effort to eliminate the “deficiencies in broker-dealers’ internal
controls and procedures for safeguarding securities reflected by material amounts of unresolved

846	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-13.

847	

See id. As noted in section I. of this release, the Dodd-Frank Act amended the definition of security in
section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act to include a security-based swap. See Pub. L. 111–203, 761(a)(2); 15
U.S.C. 78c(a)(10). Therefore, each reference in Rule 17a-13 to a security in the Exchange Act includes a
security-based swap. The Commission, however, has issued temporary exemptive relief excluding
security-based swaps from the definition of security to the extent Commission rules did not otherwise apply
specifically to security-based swaps prior to the amendment. See Order Granting Temporary Exemptions
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Connection with the Pending Revision of the Definition of
“Security” to Encompass Security-Based Swaps, and Request for Comment, 76 FR 39927.

security differences, suspense balances and unverified transfer items.”851 As the Commission
stated when proposing Rule 17a-13,
One of a broker-dealer's major functions is that of moving funds
from buyer to seller in exchange for securities. The movement of
these funds and securities is monitored and directed by the books
and records of the broker-dealers involved in the various
transactions. To the extent that a firm's records do not accurately
reflect the movement and location of funds and securities, the
ability of that firm to operate efficiently and even its continued
viability come into question. The insolvency of many brokerdealers in the past few years is attributable to a large extent to their
loss of operational control. Once a firm's operations reach a
certain level of errors, it is a Herculean task, requiring
extraordinary sums of capital, to reverse the process and to resolve
past errors so that the firm's present records accurately reflect its
position. That part of the broker-dealer's operations dealing with
the movement and location of securities has, in the past, been
subject only to the once-a-year check of the X-17A-5 audit. The
accounting record for the location and movement of securities is
the stock record. The annual audit may disclose differences
between positions reflected in the stock record and the results of a
physical count of securities and verification of securities positions
outside the firm. Many accountants have advised and urged their
clients to make regular periodic box counts, but this advice has not
always been followed. Furthermore, some firms have failed to
research and resolve promptly stock record differences.852
Rule 17a-13 continues to play an important role today, given the volume of securities
transactions and the resulting movement of securities between control locations and brokerdealers.
Under the proposed securities count program for SBSDs, broker-dealer SBSDs and
broker-dealer MSBSPs – as broker-dealers – would be subject to Rule 17a-13. Consequently,
they will be required to comply with the existing securities count requirements in the rule.

Stand-alone SBSDs would be subject to proposed Rule 18a-9, which is modeled on Rule
17a-13. Proposed Rule 18a-9 would not include a parallel requirement for every requirement in
Rules 17a-13.853 In addition, proposed Rule 18a-9 would not apply to stand-alone MSBSPs
because the customer protection rationale for Rule 17a-13 and proposed Rule 18a-9 is not as
pertinent to stand-alone MSBSPs. For example, the Commission preliminarily does not
anticipate that stand-alone MSBSPs will engage in securities operations involving the movement
of funds and securities from buyer to seller that are as complex as the operations of dealers in
securities such as broker-dealers and SBSDs. Finally, for the reasons discussed above in section
I. of this release, proposed Rule 18a-9 would not apply to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs.
2. 	

Proposed Rule 18a-9

Undesignated Introductory Paragraph
Proposed Rule 18a-9 contains an undesignated introductory paragraph explaining that the
rule applies only to an SBSD that is not dually registered as a broker-dealer (i.e., a stand-alone
SBSD), provided, however, that the rule does not apply to an SBSD with a prudential regulator
(i.e., a bank SBSD).854 The note further explains that a broker-dealer, including a broker-dealer
that is dually registered as an SBSD, is subject to the securities count requirements under Rule
17a-13.855

853	

The Commission is not proposing to include in proposed Rule 18a-9 provisions that would parallel the
provisions in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (e) of Rule 17a-13. These paragraphs of Rule 17a-13
provide exemptions from complying with Rule 17a-13 for certain types of broker-dealers. See 17 CFR
240.17a-13(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (e). The Commission preliminarily believes that SBSDs will not limit
their activities to the types of activities in which the exempt broker-dealers engage. However, the
Commission is requesting comment below on this question.

Requirement to Perform a Securities Count
Paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-13 prescribes the requirement to perform a quarterly securities
count and specifies the steps a broker-dealer must take in performing a count. Specifically, it
requires a broker-dealer to at least once in each calendar quarter:
	 Physically examine and count all securities held including securities that are the subjects
of repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements;856
	 Account for all securities in transfer, in transit, pledged, loaned, borrowed, deposited,
failed to receive, failed to deliver, subject to repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements
or otherwise subject to the broker-dealer’s control or direction but not in the brokerdealer’s physical possession by examination and comparison of the supporting detail
records with the appropriate ledger control accounts;857
	 Verify all securities in transfer, in transit, pledge, loaned, borrowed, deposited, failed to
receive, failed to deliver, subject to repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements or
otherwise subject to the broker-dealer’s control or direction but not in the broker-dealer’s
physical possession, where such securities have been in said status for longer than thirty
days;858
	 Compare the results of the count and verification with the broker-dealer’s records;859 and
	 Record on the books and records of the broker-dealer all unresolved differences setting
forth the security involved and date of comparison in a security count difference account
no later than seven business days after the date of each required quarterly security
examination, count, and verification in accordance with the requirements provided in
paragraph (c) of the Rule.860
In general terms, the rule requires a broker-dealer to physically examine, count and verify
all securities positions (e.g., equities, corporate bonds, and government securities, and, after the
Commission’s exemptive relief expires, security-based swaps), and to compare the results of the

856	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-13(b)(1).

See 17 CFR 240.17a-13(b)(2).

858	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-13(b)(3).

859	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-13(b)(4).

860	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-13(b)(5). This paragraph further provides that no examination, count, verification,
and comparison for the purpose of the rule shall be within two months of or more than four months
following a prior examination, count, verification, and comparison made hereunder. See id.

207 


count and verification with the firm’s records at least once each calendar quarter. A securities
count difference results when the count reflects positions different than those reflected in the
firm’s books and records. As discussed above in section II.A.2.a. of this release, a brokerdealer’s securities record consists of a “long” side and a “short” side. The “long” side of the
record accounts for the broker-dealer’s responsibility as a custodian of securities and shows, for
example, the securities the firm has received from customers and securities owned by the brokerdealer. The “short” side of the record shows where the securities are located such as at a
securities depository. A short securities difference occurs when the amount of securities on the
“long” side of the securities record are greater than the amount of securities on the “short” side
of the securities. A long securities difference occurs when the opposite is true. The rule requires
the firm to record on its books and records any unresolved differences within seven business
days after the date of each required count. The seven business days should be measured from the
date of the commencement of the count. A broker-dealer must take a capital charge for short
securities differences outstanding seven business days or more and for long securities differences
where the securities have been sold before they are adequately resolved.861
The Commission is proposing to include parallel securities count requirements in
proposed Rule 18a-9 that would mirror the requirements in paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-13.862
Consequently, a stand-alone SBSD would be required to perform a securities count each quarter
following steps specified in paragraph (a) of Rule 18a-9 that are identical to the steps specified in

861

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(v). 


862

Compare 17 CFR 240.17a-13(b), with paragraph (a) of proposed Rule 18a-9. 


208 


paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-13.863 Moreover, a securities count would need to be performed no
sooner than two months after the last count and no later than four months after the last count.864
Date of the Count
Paragraph (c) of Rule 17a-13 provides that: (1) the examination, count, verification, and
comparison may be made either as of a date certain or on a cyclical basis covering the entire list
of securities; (2) in either case the recordation shall be effected within seven business days
subsequent to the examination, count, verification, and comparison of a particular security; (3) in
the event that an examination, count, verification, and comparison is made on a cyclical basis, it
shall not extend over more than one calendar quarter-year; and (4) no security shall be examined,
counted, verified, or compared for the purpose of the rule less than two months or more than four
months after a prior examination, count, verification, and comparison.865 This permits a brokerdealer to perform the securities count on a rolling basis throughout the quarter as opposed to all
in one day. For example, on day one the broker-dealer could perform the count with respect to
securities of ABC Corporation, on day two the broker-dealer could perform the count with
respect to securities of DEF Corporation, and on day three the broker-dealer could perform the
count with respect to securities of GHI Corporation.
The Commission is proposing to include a parallel securities count requirement in
proposed Rule 18a-9 that would mirror the requirement in paragraph (c) of Rule 17a-13.866
Consequently, a stand-alone SBSD could perform the securities count as of a date certain or on a

cyclical basis subject conditions that are identical to the conditions in paragraph (c) of Rule 17a13.867
Separation of Duties
Paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-13 provides that the examination, count, verification, and
comparison shall be made or supervised by persons whose regular duties do not require them to
have direct responsibility for the proper care and protection of the securities or the making or
preservation of the subject records.868 Thus, the rule requires a separation of duties as a control
to promote the integrity of the securities count process.869
The Commission is proposing to include a parallel separation of duties requirement in
proposed Rule 18a-9 that would mirror the requirement in paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-13.870
Consequently, a stand-alone SBSD would need to assign responsibility for making or
supervising the count to individuals whose regular duties do not require them to have direct
responsibility for the proper care and protection of the securities or the making or preservation of
the subject records.871
Exemptions
Paragraph (f) of Rule 17a-13 provides that the Commission may, upon written request,
exempt from the provisions of the rule, either unconditionally or on specified terms and
conditions, any broker-dealer that satisfies the Commission it is not necessary in the public
interest and for the protection of investors to subject the firm to certain or all of the provisions of
the rule, because of the special nature of the firm’s business, the safeguards the firm has

established for the protection of customers' funds and securities, or such other reason as the
Commission deems appropriate.872
The Commission is proposing to include a parallel exemption provision in proposed Rule
18a-9 that would mirror the provision in paragraph (f) of Rule 17a-13.873 Consequently, a standalone SBSD could seek an exemption from proposed Rule 18a-9 or from a specific requirement
in the rule.874 The standard for granting such requests would be the same standard as is used for
granting exemptions from Rule 17a-13.
Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment on proposed Rule 18a-9. In addition, the
Commission requests comment, including empirical data in support of comments, in response to
the following questions:
1.	 Are there any categories of stand-alone SBSDs to which proposed Rule 18a-9 should not
apply? If so, explain why.
2.	 Should proposed Rule 18a-9 apply to stand-alone MSBSPs? If so, explain why. Should
proposed Rule 18a-9 apply to bank SBSDs? If so, explain why. Should proposed Rule
18a-9 apply to bank MSBSPs? If so, explain why.
3.	 How should security-based swaps be treated with respect to the requirements in Rule
17a-13 and proposed Rule 18a-9 to examine and count the securities they physically hold,
account for the securities that are subject to their control or direction but are not in their
physical possession, verify the locations of securities under certain circumstances, and
compare the results of the count and verification with their records?

C
	 apital Charge

As discussed above, Rule 15c3-1 requires a broker-dealer to take a capital charge for
short securities differences that are unresolved for seven days or longer and for long securities
differences where the securities have been sold before they are adequately resolved.875 The
Commission’s proposed capital rule for stand-alone SBSDs is modeled closely on Rule 15c3-1
but the proposal did not include these types of capital charges.876 The failure to include these
capital charges in proposed Rule 18a-1 was inadvertent and, consequently, the Commission is
proposing to include them in the rule.
Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment on this proposed capital charge. In
addition, the Commission requests comment, including empirical data in support of comments,
in response to the following questions:
1. Is the proposed capital appropriate for stand-alone SBSDs? If not, explain why.
III.	

GENERAL REQUEST FOR COMMENT
The Commission invites comment, including relevant data and analysis, regarding all

aspects of the proposed rules. The Commission also requests comment on appropriate effective
dates for the proposals, including whether it would be appropriate to stagger or delay the
effective dates for the requirements based on the nature or characteristics of the activities or
entities to which they would apply.

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
Certain provisions of the rule amendments and new rules proposed in this release would

contain a new “collection of information” within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of
1995 (“PRA”).877 The Commission is submitting the proposed rule amendments and proposed
new rules to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review and approval in
accordance with the PRA. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required
to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control
number. The titles for the collections of information are:
(1)	

Rule 17a-3 – Records to be made by certain brokers and dealers (OMB control
number 3235-0033);

(2)	

Rule 17a-4 – Records to be preserved by certain brokers and dealers (OMB
control number 3235-0279);

(3)	

Rule 17a-5 – Reports to be made by certain brokers and dealers (OMB control
number 3235-0123);

(4)	

Rule 17a-11 – Notification provisions for brokers and dealers (OMB control
number 3235-0085);

(5)	

Rule 18a-5 – Records to be made by certain security-based swap dealers and
major security-based swap participants (a proposed new collection of
information);

(6)	

Rule 18a-6 – Records to be preserved by certain security-based swap dealers and
major security-based swap participants (a proposed new collection of
information);

877

See 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.; 5 CFR 1320.11.

213 


(7)	

Rule 18a-7 – Reports to be made by certain security-based swap dealers and
major security-based swap participants (a proposed new collection of
information);

(8)	

Rule 18a-8 – Notification provisions for security-based swap dealers and major
security-based swap participants (a proposed new collection of information);

(9)	

Rule 18a-9 – Quarterly security counts to be made by certain security-based swap
dealers (a proposed new collection of information); and

(10)

Form SBS (a proposed new collection of information).

The burden estimates contained in this section do not include any other possible costs or
economic effects beyond the burdens required to be calculated for PRA purposes.

Summary of Collections of Information Under The Proposed Rules And
Proposed Rule Amendments
1.

Proposed Amendments to Rule 17a-3 and Proposed Rule 18a-5

Section 764 of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 15F(f)(2) to the Exchange Act, which
provides that the Commission shall adopt rules governing reporting and recordkeeping for
SBSDs and MSBSPs.878 Rule 17a-3 requires a broker-dealer to make and keep current certain
records.879 The Commission is proposing to amend this rule to account for the security-based
swap and swap activities of broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer
MSBSPs. With respect to stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank
MSBSPs, the Commission is proposing new Rule 18a-5 – which is modeled on Rule 17a-3, as
proposed to be amended – to require these registrants to make and keep current certain

879

See 17 CFR 240.17a-3.

214 


records.880 Proposed Rule 18a-5 would not include a parallel requirement for every requirement
in Rule 17a-3 because some of the requirements in Rule 17a-3 relate to activities that are not
expected or permitted of SBSDs and MSBSPs. Further, the proposed recordkeeping
requirements for bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs are tailored specifically to their activities as an
SBSD or an MSBSP because: (1) the Commission’s authority under section 15F(f) of the
Exchange Act is tied to activities related to the SBSD or MSBSP business; (2) bank SBSDs and
bank MSBSPs are subject to recordkeeping requirements applicable to banks; and (3) the
prudential regulators – rather than the Commission – establish and monitor capital, margin, and
other prudential requirements applicable to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs.
The proposed amendments to Rule 17a-3 and proposed Rule 18a-5 would establish a
number of new collections of information, as summarized in the table below.

Proposed Amendments to Rule 17a-4 and Proposed Rule 18a-6

Section 764 of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 15F(f)(2) to the Exchange Act, which
provides that the Commission shall adopt rules governing reporting and recordkeeping for
SBSDs and MSBSPs.881 Rule 17a-4 requires a broker-dealer to preserve certain records if it
makes or receives them.882 The Commission is proposing to amend this rule to account for the
security-based swap and swap activities of broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and
broker-dealer MSBSPs. With respect to stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs,
and bank MSBSPs, the Commission is proposing new Rule 18a-6 – which is modeled on Rule
17a-4, as proposed to be amended – to require these registrants to preserve certain records if they
make or receive them.883 Proposed Rule 18a-6 would not include a parallel requirement for

every requirement in Rule 17a-4 because some of the requirements in Rule 17a-4 relate to
activities that are not expected or permitted of SBSDs and MSBSPs. In addition, the
recordkeeping requirements for bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs are tailored specifically to bank
SBSD and bank MSBSP activities relating to operating as an SBSD or an MSBSP.

Broker-dealers are currently required to comply with these paragraphs of Rule 17a-4, but the Commission proposes to
amend these paragraphs as required by the Dodd-Frank Act or to tailor to the types of records that should be preserved
with respect to security-based swaps, and to make certain technical changes.

3. 	

Proposed Amendments to Rule 17a-5 and Proposed Rule 18a-7

Section 764 of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 15F(f)(2) to the Exchange Act, which
provides that the Commission shall adopt rules governing reporting for SBSDs and MSBSPs.884
Further, section 15F(f)(1)(A) provides that SBSDs and MSBSPs shall make such reports as are
required by the Commission, by rule or regulation, regarding the transactions and positions and
financial condition of the SBSD or MSBSP.885 The Commission has concurrent authority under
section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act to prescribe reporting requirements for broker-dealers.886
Rule 17a-5 requires a broker-dealer to annually file reports audited by a PCAOBregistered independent public accountant, disclose certain financial information to customers, file
with the Commission a statement about its engagement of an independent public accountant,
notify the Commission of a change of accountant, and to notify the Commission of the change in
fiscal year.887 The rule also requires the independent public accountant to notify the broker-

dealer if the accountant discovers an instance of non-compliance with certain broker-dealer rules
or an instance of material weakness.888 Rule 17a-5 requires broker-dealers to file a financial
report, compliance report, and/or exemption report with the Commission on an annual basis.889
ANC broker-dealers are required to file with the Commission additional information relating to
market risk, credit risk, and the monthly liquidity stress test on a periodic basis.890
The Commission is proposing amendments to Rule 17a-5 to account for the securitybased swap activities of broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs.891 Proposed Rule
18a-7 – which is modeled on Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended – would establish reporting
requirements for stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs.892
Under Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended, and proposed Rule 18a-7, SBSDs and MSBSPs
would be required to periodically file proposed Form SBS.893 Broker-dealer SBSDs and brokerdealer MSBSPs would file Form SBS instead of the applicable part of Form X-17A-5.894 Form
SBS would include additional entries as compared to Part II CSE of Form X-17A-5 to account
for the firm’s security-based swap activities.

893	

See paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended; paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of proposed
Rule 18a-7. Nonbank SBSDs and nonbank MSBSPs would be required to file Form SBS on a monthly
basis, whereas bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs would be required to file Form SBS on a quarterly basis.
Compare paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended, with paragraph (a)(1) of
proposed Rule 18a-7, and paragraph (a)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-7.

894	

As described above, a broker-dealer is required to file with the Commission or the broker-dealer’s DEA a
different part of Form X-17A-5 (Part II, Part IIA, Part IIB, or Part II CSE), depending on the nature of its
business.

220 


Proposed Rule 18a-7 does not include a parallel requirement for every requirement in
Rule 17a-5.895 Moreover, instead of requiring stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs to
make available to customers an audited statement of financial condition with appropriate notes
and certain reports of the independent public accountant, the Commission proposes that standalone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs make such information available on their public
website.896 Further, for the reasons discussed above, the reporting requirements in proposed
Rule 18a-7, other than the requirement to periodically file proposed Form SBS, would not apply
to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs.
4.

Proposed Amendments to Rule 17a-11 and Proposed Rule 18a-8

Section 764 of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 15F(f)(2) to the Exchange Act, which
provides that the Commission shall adopt rules governing reporting for SBSDs and MSBSPs.897
Section 15F(f)(1)(A) provides that SBSDs and MSBSPs shall make such reports as are required
by the Commission, by rule or regulation, regarding the transactions and positions and financial
condition of the SBSD or MSBSP.898 In addition, the Commission has concurrent authority
under section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act to prescribe reporting requirements for brokerdealers.899
Rule 17a-11 specifies the circumstances under which a broker-dealer must notify the
Commission and other securities regulators about its financial or operational condition, as well as

895

For example, as described in further detail above, the Commission is not proposing a requirement in Rule
18a-7 that is parallel to the exemption report requirement in Rule 17a-5 or the requirement to file certain
reports with SIPC. See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d)(4) and (e)(4).

896

Compare 17 CFR 240.17a-5(c), with paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-7.

the form that the notice must take.900 The Commission is proposing amendments to Rule 17a-11
to account for the security-based swap activities of broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer
MSBSPs.901 Proposed Rule 18a-8 – which is modeled on Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be
amended – would establish notification requirements for stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone
MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs.902
Proposed Rule 18a-8 would not include a parallel requirement for every requirement in
Rule 17a-11 because some of the Rule 17a-11 notices relate to calculations that would not be
relevant to stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs.903
Further, the notification requirements for bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs are designed to be
tailored specifically to their activities as an SBSD or an MSBSP.
The proposed amendments to Rule 17a-11 and proposed Rule 18a-8 would establish a
number of new collections of information, as summarized in the table below.

Proposed Rule 18a-9

Section 764 of the Dodd-Frank Act added section 15F(f)(2) to the Exchange Act, which
provides that the Commission shall adopt rules governing reporting for SBSDs.904 In addition,
section 15F(f)(2)(B)(ii) provides that nonbank SBSDs shall keep books and records in such form
and manner and for such period as may be prescribed by the Commission by rule or
regulation.905
Proposed Rule 18a-9, which is modeled on Rule 17a-13, would require stand-alone
SBSDs to examine and count the securities they physically hold, account for the securities that
are subject to their control or direction but are not in their physical possession, verify the
locations of securities under certain circumstances, and compare the results of the count and
verification with their records.906
B.

Proposed Use of Information

Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended, and proposed Rule 18a-5 would require brokerdealers, SBSDs, and MSBSPs to make and keep current certain books and records. Rule 17a-4,
as proposed to be amended, and proposed Rule 18a-6 would require broker-dealers, SBSDs, and

MSBSPs to preserve certain records if the firm makes or receives the type of record. These rules
are designed, among other things, to promote the prudent operation of broker-dealers, SBSDs,
and MSBSPs and to assist the Commission, SROs, and state securities regulators in conducting
effective examinations.907 Thus, the collections of information under the proposed amendments
to Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4, and proposed Rules 18a-5 and 18a-6, would facilitate the examinations
of broker-dealers, SBSDs, and MSBSPs.
Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended, and proposed Rule 18a-7 would establish
reporting requirements for broker-dealers, SBSDs, and MSBSPs. Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be
amended, and proposed Rule 18a-8 would require broker-dealers, SBSDs, and MSBSPs to notify
the Commission of certain events related to their financial condition. The rules are designed to
promote compliance with the proposed financial responsibility requirements for SBSDs and
MSBSPs, facilitate regulators’ oversight and examinations of such firms, and promote
transparency of SBSDs’ and MSBSPs’ financial condition and operation.
Proposed Rule 18a-9 would require a stand-alone SBSD to physically examine, count and
verify all securities positions (e.g., equities, corporate bonds, and government securities), and to
compare the results of the count and verification with the firm’s records at least once each
calendar quarter. This proposed rule is designed to promote an SBSD’s custody of securities and
accurate accounting for securities.

See, e.g., Books and Records Requirements for Brokers and Dealers Under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, 66 FR at 55818 (“The Commission has required that broker-dealers create and maintain certain
records so that, among other things, the Commission, [SROs], and State Securities Regulators . . . may
conduct effective examinations of broker-dealers” (footnote omitted)).

Consistent with prior releases, the Commission estimates that fifty or fewer entities
ultimately may be required to register with the Commission as SBSDs.908
In addition, consistent with prior releases, based on available data regarding the singlename credit default swap market – which the Commission believes will comprise the majority of
security-based swaps – the Commission estimates that the number of MSBSPs likely will be five
or fewer and, in actuality, may be zero.909 Therefore, to capture the likely number of MSBSPs
that may be subject to the collections of information for purposes of this PRA, the Commission
estimates for purposes of this PRA that five entities will register with the Commission as
MSBSPs. Accordingly, for purposes of calculating PRA reporting burdens, the Commission
estimates there will be fifty SBSDs and five MSBSPs.

Of the five MSBSPs, the Commission estimates that one firm also would be registered as
a broker-dealer and an FCM.910 By definition, an MSBSP’s primary business is not engaging in
security-based swap activity, so it would be rare for an MSBSP to qualify as a broker-dealer
and/or FCM but not an SBSD. Such an MSBSP would be engaged in the business of effecting

securities transactions,911 but not in the business of effecting security-based swap transactions912
or commodities, securities futures products, or swaps913 and yet involved in enough securitybased swap transactions to be required to register as an MSBSP.914 However, the Commission
estimates there will be one broker-dealer FCM MSBSP for the purposes of calculating PRA
burdens, in recognition that broker-dealer MSBSPs and stand-alone MSBSPs are subject to
different burdens under the proposed and amended rules in certain instances.915
The Commission previously estimated that sixteen broker-dealers would likely seek to
register as SBSDs.916 The Commission is retaining this estimate for purposes of this release.
The Commission believes that all sixteen broker-dealer SBSDs also will be registered as FCMs,
since SBSDs may find it beneficial to hedge security-based swap positions with futures
contracts, options on futures, or swaps.917 Accordingly, for purposes of calculating PRA
reporting burdens, the Commission estimates there will be sixteen broker-dealer FCM SBSDs.

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4) (generally defining broker as any person engaged in the business of effecting

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(71) (generally defining security-based swap dealer as any person who holds himself
out as a dealer in security-based swaps, makes a market in security-based swaps, regularly enters into
security-based swaps with counterparties as an ordinary course of business for its own account, or engages
in any other activity causing it to be commonly known in the trade as a dealer or market maker in securitybased swaps).

See 7 U.S.C. 1a(28) (generally defining futures commission merchant as a person engaged in soliciting or

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(67) (generally defining major security-based swap participant as any person who is
not an SBSD but maintains a substantial position in security-based swaps for any of the major securitybased swap categories, whose outstanding security-based swaps could have serious adverse effects on the
financial stability of the U.S. banking system or financial markets, or is highly leveraged and maintains a
substantial position in security-based swaps for any of the major security-based swap categories).

915	

The Commission believes that the broker-dealer MSBSP would register as an FCM, since the broker-dealer
may find it beneficial to hedge security and security-based swap positions with futures contracts, options on
futures, or swaps. See Registration of Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap
Participants, 76 FR at 65814.

For purposes of calculating PRA reporting burdens, the Commission estimates there
would be twenty-five bank SBSDs and nine stand-alone SBSDs.918 Because the Commission
estimates that sixteen broker-dealers would likely register as SBSDs, there would be an
estimated maximum of thirty-four non-broker-dealer SBSDs consisting of bank SBSDs and
stand-alone SBSDs.919 For business planning purposes, risk management purposes, potential
regulatory requirements, and other reasons, some of these entities likely would register with the
Commission as stand-alone SBSDs. Because many of the dealers that currently engage in OTC
derivatives activities are banks, the Commission estimates that approximately 75% of the thirtyfour non-broker-dealer SBSDs would register as bank SBSDs (i.e., twenty-five firms),920 and the
remaining 25% would register as stand-alone SBSDs (i.e., nine firms).921
The Commission believes that none of the bank SBSDS would register as FCMs, because
of the burden associated with complying with three different supervisors’ regulatory
requirements.922 However, the Commission believes that all of the stand-alone SBSDs would
register as FCMs, since SBSDs may find it beneficial to hedge security-based swap positions
with futures contracts, options on futures, or swaps.923
Of the nine stand-alone FCM SBSDs, the Commission estimates that, based on its
experience with ANC broker-dealers and OTC derivatives dealers, the majority of stand-alone

918

The Commission does not anticipate that any firms will be dually registered as a broker-dealer and a bank. 


919

50 SBSDs – 16 broker-dealer SBSDs = 34 maximum non-broker-dealer SBSDs.


920

34 maximum estimated non-broker-dealer SBSDs x 75% = 25.5, rounded to 25 bank SBSDs.


921

34 maximum estimated non-broker-dealer SBSDs x 25% = 8.5, rounded to 9 stand-alone FCM SBSDs.


922

In addition, the Commission understands that banks do not register as FCMs; rather, bank affiliates register 

as FCMs.

923

See Registration of Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants, 76 FR at

SBSDs would apply to use internal models.924 Consequently, the Commission is estimating that
six of the nine stand-alone SBSDs would apply to operate as ANC stand-alone SBSDs, which
would use internal models to compute net capital under proposed Rule 18a-1. Because the
Commission estimates that there would be six ANC stand-alone SBSDs, the Commission
estimates that three stand-alone SBSDs would not use internal models to compute net capital.925

Of the sixteen broker-dealer FCM SBSDs, the Commission estimates that ten firms
would operate as ANC broker-dealer SBSDs, which use internal models to compute net capital
under Rule 15c3-1.926 Because the Commission estimates that ten broker-dealer SBSDs would
be ANC broker-dealer SBSDs, it is estimated that six broker-dealer SBSDs would not use
internal models to compute net capital.927
As of April 1, 2013, there were 4,545 broker-dealers registered with the Commission.
The Commission estimates that twenty-five registered broker-dealers will be engaged in
924	

VaR models, while more risk-sensitive than standardized haircuts, tend to substantially reduce the amount
of the deductions to tentative net capital in comparison to the standardized haircuts because the models
recognize more offsets between related positions than the standardized haircuts. Therefore, the
Commission expects that stand-alone SBSDs that have the capability to use internal models to calculate net
capital would choose to do so.

925	

9 stand-alone FCM SBSDs – 6 ANC stand-alone FCM SBSDs = 3 non-model stand-alone FCM SBSDs.

926	

Currently, 6 broker-dealers are registered as ANC broker-dealers and 1 broker-dealer’s application to
register as an ANC broker-dealer is pending. The Commission has previously estimated that all current and
future ANC broker-dealers will also register as SBSDs. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation
Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital
Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70293.

SBSDs.

security-based swap activities but would not be required to register as an SBSD or MSBSP.
Other than OTC derivatives dealers, which are subject to significant limitations on their
activities, broker-dealers historically have not participated in a significant way in security-based
swap trading for at least two reasons.928 First, because the Exchange Act has not previously
defined security-based swaps as “securities,” security-based swaps have not been required to be
traded through registered broker-dealers.929 Second, a broker-dealer engaging in security-based
swap activities is currently subject to existing regulatory requirements with respect to those
activities, including capital, margin, segregation, and recordkeeping requirements. Specifically,
the existing broker-dealer capital requirements make it relatively costly to conduct these
activities in broker-dealers. As a result, security-based swap activities are mostly concentrated in
affiliates of broker-dealers, not broker-dealers themselves.930

number of respondents. Commenters should provide specific data and analysis to support any
comments they submit with respect to the number of respondents, including identifying any

Proposed Amendments to Rule 17a-3 and Proposed Rule 18a-5

The proposed amendments to Rule 17a-3 and proposed Rule 18a-5 would impose
collection of information requirements that result in initial and annual time burdens for brokerdealers, SBSDs, and MSBSPs. Current Rule 17a-3 imposes an estimated annual burden of 539
hours per firm and $8,256 in costs and a total industry burden of 2,449,755 hours and
$37,523,520 in costs.931 The Commission estimates that the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-3
would impose the following initial and annual burdens:

Estimated Ongoing Hours and Costs of Current Rule 17a-3
In the Supporting Statement accompanying the most recent extension of Rule 17a-3’s
collection, the estimated ongoing burden for a registered broker-dealer to make and keep current
the books and records required by Rule 17a-3 averages out to 539 hours per year and $8,256 per
year (after adjusting for increases in postage prices), although actual recordkeeping requirements
vary depending on the broker-dealer’s size and complexity.941 Given that 4,545 broker-dealers
were registered with the Commission as of April 1, 2013, current Rule 17a-3 creates an
estimated industry-wide ongoing annual burden of 2,449,755 hours942 and $37,523,520.943
Estimated Hours and Costs of Proposed Amendments to Rule 17a-3
Many of the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-3 are not expected to impose an initial
burden. Most of the additional proposed amendments discussed in section II.A.2.b. of this
release are largely clarifying changes that should not impose an hour burden or costs. With
respect to the proposed new records required by the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-3, these

See Supporting Statement for the Paperwork Reduction Act Information Collection Submission for Rule

17a-3 at 9 (2,723,970 hours/year / 5,057 registered broker-dealers = 539 hours/year per registered brokerdealer).

942

539 hours/year x 4,545 registered broker-dealers = 2,449,755 hours/year.

are not expected to impose initial dollar costs because firms should already own or have
established the requisite recordkeeping system software. Firms will likely need to program
software to begin collecting additional records and may need to update their compliance manuals
to reflect that certain paragraphs of Rule 17a-3 have been proposed to be re-numbered. The
Commission expects these services to be performed in-house, and these hourly burdens are
estimated below.
The Commission does not expect there to be a burden associated with its proposal to
modify the definition of securities regulatory authority to include the CFTC and prudential
regulators to the extent they oversee security-based swap activities, because the Commission
does not expect any broker-dealers to dually register as banks and estimates that thirty-four
broker-dealers would be dually registered as FCMs,944 swap dealers, and/or major swap
participants.945 In the three instances that securities regulatory authority is mentioned, the
broker-dealer must provide certain information to its securities regulatory authority if the firm
does not make the required record or memorandum containing the information and the
information is requested by the securities regulatory authority.946 The Commission understands
that it is already industry practice to make the required record and memorandum of the
information in these three instances (especially among more sophisticated entities dually
registered with the Commission and the CFTC), and therefore the Commission does not believe
that this proposed amendment would impose an additional burden.
944

The Commission estimates that 34 broker-dealers are dually registered as FCMs – 17 non-SBSD/MSBSP
broker-dealers, 16 broker-dealer SBSDs, and 1 broker-dealer MSBSP. As of March 31, 2013, 34 brokerdealers reported a positive value on Line Item 7060 of the FOCUS Report (amount required to be
segregated under CFTC rules), which is a line item that is only filled in by FCMs.

945

The Commission estimates that all 17 estimated broker-dealer FCM SBSDs and broker-dealer FCM
MSBSPs would also register as swap dealers or major swap participants. See Registration of SecurityBased Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants, 76 FR at 65814 (estimating that 35
SBSDs or MSBSPs would also be registered with the CFTC as swap dealers or major swap participants).

946

See paragraphs (a)(6)(i), (a)(7)(i), and (a)(19)(i) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended.

232 


The Commission proposes to eliminate three exemptions from Rule 17a-3 which should
not affect the burden of complying with Rule 17a-3. Paragraph (b)(2) exempts transactions
cleared by a bank if the bank keeps the requisite records for the broker-dealer,947 but the
Commission believes that this exemption is not relied on. Paragraph (c) exempts records of
certain U.S. bond sales948 and paragraph (d) exempts records of certain de minimis cash
transactions,949 but the Commission believes these transactions are currently automatically
recorded as a matter of practice because it likely takes more time to identify these transactions as
exempt than to make and keep records of these transactions.
The Commission proposes to amend paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(3), (a)(5), (a)(6), (a)(7), (a)(8),
and (a)(9) of Rule 17a-3 to include a provision requiring broker-dealers to make and keep current
various records for security-based swaps.950 The Commission estimates that the proposed
amendments to paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(3), (a)(5), (a)(6), (a)(7), (a)(8), and (a)(9) of Rule 17a-3
would impose on each broker-dealer that engages in security-based swap activities an initial
burden of thirty hours and an ongoing burden of approximately ten minutes per business day, or
forty-two hours per year.951 The Commission estimates that there are forty-two respondents –
sixteen broker-dealer SBSDs, one broker-dealer MSBSP, and twenty-five non-SBSD/MSBSP

947	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-3(b)(2).

948	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-3(c).

949	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-3(d).

950	

The provision for securities other than security-based swaps would largely mirror the paragraph’s current
text. See paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(3), (a)(5)(i), (a)(6)(i), (a)(7)(i), (a)(8)(i), and (a)(9)(i) through (iii) of Rule
17a-3, as proposed to be amended. The provision for security-based swaps would tailor to security-based
swaps the type of records the broker-dealer must make and keep current. See paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(3),
(a)(5)(ii), (a)(6)(ii), (a)(7)(ii), (a)(8)(ii), and (a)(9)(iv) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended.

951	

(10 minutes/business day / 60 minutes/hour) x 251 business days/year = 42 hours/year. There are 251 nonweekend days in 2013. The Commission does not include U.S. public holidays in estimating the number of
business days per year, given that many broker-dealers trading security-based swaps operate
internationally.

233 


broker-dealers engaged in security-based swap activities.952 Thus, these proposed amendments
would add to the industry an estimated initial burden of 1,260 hours953 and an ongoing burden of
1,764 hours per year.954
The proposed amendments to Rule 17a-3 would require three additional types of records
to be made and kept current by broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs.955 Because the
burden to run the applicable calculation or comply with the applicable standard is accounted for
in the PRA estimates for proposed Rules 18a-3,956 15Fi-1,957 15Fh-1 through 15Fh-5, and
15Fk-1,958 the burden imposed by these new requirements is the requirement to make and keep
current a written record of these tasks. The Commission estimates that paragraphs (a)(25),
(a)(28), and (a)(30) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended, would impose an initial burden of
60 hours per firm and an ongoing annual burden of seventy-five hours per firm. The
Commission estimates that there are seventeen respondents (sixteen broker-dealer SBSDs and

952	

16 broker-dealer SBSDs + 1 broker-dealer MSBSP + 25 non-SBSD/MSBSP broker-dealers engaged in
security-based swap activities = 42 broker-dealers engaged in security-based swap activities.

953	

30 hours/year x 42 broker-dealers engaged in security-based swap activities = 1,260 hours/year. These
internal hours likely would be performed by a compliance manager.

954	

42 hours/year x 42 broker-dealers engaged in security-based swap activities = 1,764 hours/year. These
internal hours likely would be performed by a compliance clerk.

See paragraphs (a)(25), (a)(28), and (a)(30) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended (proposing
recordkeeping requirements for Rule 18a-3 calculations, unverified transactions, and compliance with
external business conduct requirements, respectively).

one broker-dealer MSBSP), adding to the industry an initial burden of 1,020 hours959 and an
ongoing burden of 1,275 hours per year.960
The proposed amendments to Rule 17a-3 would require three additional types of records
to be made and kept current by broker-dealer SBSDs.961 Because the burden to run the
applicable calculation or comply with the applicable standard is accounted for in the PRA
estimates for proposed Rules 18a-4962 and 15Fh-6,963 the burden imposed by these new
requirements is the requirement to make and keep current a written record of these tasks. The
Commission estimates that paragraphs (a)(26), (a)(27), and (a)(29) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to
be amended, would impose an initial burden of sixty hours per firm and an ongoing annual
burden of seventy-five hours per firm. The Commission estimates that there are sixteen brokerdealer SBSDs, adding to the industry an initial burden of 960 hours964 and an ongoing burden of
1,200 hours per year.965
The Commission proposes to add paragraph (a)(24) to Rule 17a-3, which would require
ANC broker-dealers to make and keep current certain records relating to the firm’s monthly

959	

60 hours x 17 broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs = 1,020 hours. These internal hours likely
would be performed by a compliance manager.

75 hours/year x 17 broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs = 1,275 hours/year. These internal
hours likely would be performed by a compliance clerk.

See Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended (paragraph (a)(26) (compliance with proposed Rule 18a-4

liquidity stress test.966 Because the burden of actually performing the liquidity stress test and
creating a liquidity funding plan is already accounted for in the PRA estimate for Rule 15c3-1, as
proposed to be amended,967 the burden imposed by paragraph (a)(24) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed
to be amended, is the requirement to make and keep current a written record of these tasks. The
Commission estimates that paragraph (a)(24) would impose on each ANC broker-dealer an
initial burden of twenty hours and an ongoing burden of twenty-five hours per year. The
Commission estimates that there are ten ANC broker-dealers (all of which are assumed to be
dually registered as SBSDs), adding to the industry an initial burden of 200 hours968 and an
ongoing burden of 250 hours per year.969
Estimated Hours and Costs of Proposed Rule 18a-5
Dollar Costs. The Commission estimates that proposed Rule 18a-5 would cause a
stand-alone SBSD or stand-alone MSBSP to incur an initial dollar cost of approximately $1,000
to purchase recordkeeping system software and an ongoing dollar cost of $4,650 per year for
associated equipment and systems development. The Commission estimates that there are
thirteen respondents (nine stand-alone SBSDs and four stand-alone MSBSPs), resulting in an
estimated industry-wide initial burden of $13,000970 and an industry-wide ongoing burden of
$60,450 per year.971

966

See paragraph (a)(24) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended.

967

See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major SecurityBased Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70294.

968

20 hours x 10 ANC broker-dealers = 200 hours. These internal hours likely would be performed by a
compliance manager.

969

25 hours/year x 10 ANC broker-dealers = 250 hours/year. These internal hours likely would be performed
by a compliance clerk.

970

$1,000 x 13 stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs = $13,000.

971

$4,650/year x 13 stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs = $60,450/year.

236 


Proposed Rule 18a-5 is not expected to increase the initial and ongoing dollar costs that
bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs incur to purchase recordkeeping system software and for
equipment and systems development. Banks are already subject to recordkeeping requirements
by the prudential regulators,972 so they already own or have established the requisite
recordkeeping system software. Although bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs may need to program
the software to begin collecting additional records, the Commission expects these services to be
performed in-house, and these hour burdens are estimated below.
Hour Burden. Proposed Rule 18a-5 would require thirteen types of records to be made
and kept current by stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs.973 Proposed Rule 18a-5
imposes the burden to make and keep current these records, but does not require the firm to
perform the underlying task.974 Therefore, after consideration of the estimated burdens under
Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended, the Commission estimates that paragraphs (a)(1)
through (a)(10), (a)(12), (a)(15), and (a)(17) of proposed Rule 18a-5 would impose on each firm
an initial burden of 260 hours and an ongoing annual burden of 325 hours. The Commission
estimates that there are thirteen respondents (nine stand-alone SBSDs and four stand-alone

972	

See, e.g., 12 CFR 12.3 (Department of Treasury); 12 CFR 219.21 et seq. (Federal Reserve); 12 CFR 344.4
(FDIC).

See proposed Rule 18a-5 (paragraph (a)(1) (trade blotters); paragraph (a)(2) (general ledgers); paragraph
(a)(3) (ledgers of customer and non-customer accounts); paragraph (a)(4) (stock record); paragraph (a)(5)
(memoranda of proprietary orders); paragraph (a)(6) (confirmations); paragraph (a)(7) (accountholder
information); paragraph (a)(8) (options positions); paragraph (a)(9) (trial balances and computation of net
capital); paragraph (a)(10) (associated person’s application); paragraph (a)(12) (proposed Rule 18a-3
calculations); paragraph (a)(15) (unverified transactions); paragraph (a)(17) (compliance with external
business conduct standards)).

974	

In estimating the burden associated with proposed Rules 18a-5 and 18a-6, the Commission recognizes that
entities that would register stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs likely make and keep some
records today as a matter of routine business practice, but the Commission does not have information about
the records that such entities currently keep. Therefore, the Commission is estimating the PRA burden for
these entities based on the assumption that they currently keep no records.

MSBSPs), resulting in an estimated industry-wide initial burden of 3,380 hours975 and an
industry-wide ongoing annual burden of 4,225 hours.976
Proposed Rule 18a-5 would require three types of records to be made and kept current by
stand-alone SBSDs.977 Because the burden to run the applicable calculation or comply with the
applicable standard is accounted for in the PRA estimates for proposed Rules 18a-4978 and
15Fh-6,979 the burden imposed by these new requirements is the requirement to make and keep
current a written record of these tasks. The Commission estimates that paragraphs (a)(13),
(a)(14), and (a)(16) of proposed Rule 18a-5 would impose an initial burden of sixty hours per
firm and an ongoing annual burden of seventy-five hours per firm. The Commission estimates
that there are nine stand-alone SBSDs, resulting in an industry-wide initial burden of 540
hours980 and an industry-wide ongoing burden of 675 hours per year.981
Paragraph (a)(11) of proposed Rule 18a-5 would require ANC stand-alone SBSDs to
make and keep current certain records relating to the monthly liquidity stress test.982 Because the
burden of actually performing the liquidity stress test and creating a liquidity funding plan is

260 hours x 13 stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs = 3,380 hours. These internal hours likely
would be performed by a compliance manager.

already accounted for in the PRA estimate for proposed Rule 18a-1,983 the burden imposed by
paragraph (a)(11) of proposed Rule 18a-5 is the requirement to make and keep current a written
record of these tasks. The Commission estimates that paragraph (a)(11) would impose on each
ANC broker-dealer an initial burden of twenty hours and an ongoing burden of twenty-five hours
per year. The Commission estimates that there are six ANC stand-alone SBSDs, resulting in an
industry-wide initial burden of 120 hours984 and an industry-wide ongoing burden of 150 hours
per year.985
Proposed Rule 18a-5 would require ten types of records to be made and kept current by
bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs, all of which are limited to the firm’s business as an SBSD or
MSBSP.986 Proposed Rule 18a-5 imposes the burden to make and keep current these records,
but does not require the firm to perform the underlying task. Therefore, after consideration of
the estimated burdens under Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended, the Commission estimates
that paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(8), (b)(11), and (b)(13) of proposed Rule 18a-5 would impose
on each firm an initial burden of 200 hours per firm and an ongoing burden of 250 hours per
firm. The Commission estimates that there are twenty-five respondents (twenty-five bank

hours987 and an industry-wide ongoing burden of 6,250 hours per year.988
Proposed Rule 18a-5 would require three types of records to be made and kept current by
bank SBSDs, all of which are limited to the firm’s business as an SBSD.989 Because the burden
to run the applicable calculation or comply with the applicable standard is accounted for in the
PRA estimates for proposed Rules 18a-4990 and 15Fh-6,991 the burden imposed by these new
requirements is the requirement to make and keep current a written record of these tasks. The
Commission estimates that paragraphs (b)(9), (b)(10), and (b)(12) of proposed Rule 18a-5 would
impose an initial burden of sixty hours per firm and an ongoing annual burden of seventy-five
hours per firm. The Commission estimates that there are twenty-five bank SBSDs, resulting in
an industry-wide initial burden of 1,500 hours992 and an industry-wide ongoing burden of 1,875
hours per year.993

Estimated Ongoing Hours and Costs of Current Rule 17a-4
The Supporting Statement accompanying the most recent extension of Rule 17a-4’s
collection estimates that each registered broker-dealer spends 254 hours to ensure it is in
compliance with Rule 17a-4 and produce records promptly when required, and $5,000 each year
on physical space and computer hardware and software to store the requisite documents and
information.1006 Given that 4,545 broker-dealers were registered with the Commission as of
April 1, 2013, current Rule 17a-4 creates an estimated industry-wide ongoing annual cost of
1,154,430 hours1007 and $22,725,000.1008
Estimated Hours and Costs of Proposed Amendments to Rule 17a-4
Many of the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-4 are not expected to change the
estimated burden imposed by Rule 17a-4. Most of the additional proposed amendments
discussed in section II.A.3.b. of this release are largely clarifying changes that do not affect the
Commission’s burden estimate. Similarly, paragraph (m)(5) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be

amended, which adds a definition for business as such,1009 is a clarifying amendment that should
not affect the rule’s burden.
The Commission believes there is no burden associated with its proposal that a brokerdealer retain a record of the proof of money balances of all ledger accounts in the form of trial
balances, and a record of the computation of aggregate indebtedness and net capital.1010 Since
Rule 17a-3 requires broker-dealers to make these records, the Commission understands that it is
already industry practice for broker-dealers to also keep these records. In addition, Rule 17a-4
already requires broker-dealers to keep records containing substantially similar information,1011
so that the same record would likely also include the information required by this proposed
amendment to Rule 17a-4.
The Commission believes there is no burden associated with its proposal that a securitybased swap customer or non-customer’s written agreements be maintained with his or her
account records,1012 because the Commission understands that it is already industry practice to
keep written agreements with the relevant person’s account records.
Certain proposed amendments to Rule 17a-4 would require broker-dealer SBSDs and
broker-dealer MSBSPs to retain certain new records but would no longer require them to retain
other records required to be kept by non-SBSD/MSBSP broker-dealers. Specifically, brokerdealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs must preserve proposed Form SBS instead of Form

X-17A-5,1013 possession or control information for security-based swap customers under
proposed Rule 18a-4 instead of under Rule 15c3-3,1014 and Forms SBSE-BD and SBSE-W
instead of Forms BD and BDW.1015 These proposed amendments are not expected to
significantly change the number of documents that the broker-dealer must preserve, but simply
the type of document that must be preserved – a factor that is not expected to affect Rule 17a-4’s
burden.
The Commission proposes to amend paragraph (b)(4) of Rule 17a-4 to require
broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs to retain telephone calls that have already been
recorded and are related to the broker-dealer SBSD’s and broker-dealer MSBSP’s security-based
swap business.1016 Paragraph (b)(4) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended, only requires the
retention of telephonic recordings the broker-dealer SBSD or broker-dealer MSBSP voluntarily
chooses to record, so the Commission’s burden estimate does not include the cost of recording
phone calls. Therefore, the burdens imposed by the proposed amendment would be to provide
adequate physical space and computer hardware and software for storage. The Commission
estimates that the proposed amendment to paragraph (b)(4) of Rule 17a-4 would impose an
initial burden of 13 hours per firm. The Commission estimates that there are seventeen
respondents (sixteen broker-dealer SBSDs and one broker-dealer MSBSP), resulting in an
estimated industry-wide initial burden of 221 hours.1017

1017

13 hours x 17 broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs = 221 hours. These internal hours likely 

would be performed by a senior database administrator.

244 


The Commission estimates that each firm would incur an annual burden of approximately
six hours to confirm that telephonic communications are being retained in accordance with Rule
17a-4, and approximately $2,000 for server, equipment, and systems development costs. The
Commission estimates that there are seventeen respondents (sixteen broker-dealer SBSDs and
one broker-dealer MSBSP), resulting in an estimated industry-wide ongoing annual cost of 102
hours1018 and $34,000.1019
The proposed amendments to Rule 17a-4 would add three types of records to be
preserved by broker-dealers.1020 Because the burden to create these records is already accounted
for in the PRA estimates for Rule 17a-3,1021 Rule 15c3-1,1022 or in proposed Regulation
SBSR,1023 the burdens imposed by these new requirements are to ensure there is adequate
physical space and computer hardware and software for storage, ensure these records are
preserved for the requisite time period, and produce them when requested. The Commission
estimates that the proposed amendments to paragraphs (b)(8)(v)-(viii) and proposed paragraphs
(b)(8)(xvi) and (b)(14) of Rule 17a-4 would impose an initial burden of thirty-nine hours per
firm and an ongoing annual burden of eighteen hours and $360 per firm. The Commission
estimates that there are forty-two respondents – sixteen broker-dealer SBSDs, one broker-dealer

1018	

6 hours x 17 broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs = 102 hours. These internal hours likely
would be performed by a compliance clerk.

activities.1024 Thus, these proposed amendments would add to the industry an estimated initial
burden of 1,638 hours1025 and an ongoing annual burden of 756 hours1026 and $15,120.1027
The proposed amendments to Rule 17a-4 would add five types of records to be preserved
by broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs.1028 Because the burden to create these
records is accounted for in the PRA estimates for Rule 17a-3,1029 or proposed Rules 15Fh-1
through 15Fh-5 and 15Fk-1,1030 the burdens imposed by these proposed amendments are to
ensure there is adequate physical space and computer hardware and software for storage, ensure
these records are preserved for the requisite time period, and produce them when requested. The
Commission estimates that the proposed amendments to paragraph (b)(1) and proposed new
paragraphs (b)(15) and (b)(16) of Rule 17a-4 would impose an initial burden of sixty-five hours
per firm and an ongoing annual burden of thirty hours and $600 per firm. The Commission
estimates that there are seventeen respondents (sixteen broker-dealer SBSDs and one broker-

an ongoing annual burden of eighteen hours and $360 per firm. The Commission estimates that
there are 16 broker-dealer SBSDs, adding to the industry an initial burden of 624 hours1036 and
an ongoing annual burden of 288 hours1037 and $5,760.1038

Paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended, would require ANC brokerdealers to preserve certain records relating to the firm’s monthly liquidity stress test.1039 Because
the burden to create this record is accounted for in the PRA estimate for Rule 17a-3, as proposed
to be amended,1040 the burdens this new requirement would impose on ANC broker-dealers are
to ensure there is adequate physical space and computer hardware and software for storage,
ensure these records are preserved for the requisite time period, and produce them when
requested. The Commission estimates that the proposed amendment to paragraph (b)(1) of Rule
17a-4 would impose an initial burden of thirteen hours per firm and an ongoing annual burden of
six hours and $120 per firm. The Commission estimates that there are ten ANC broker-dealers
(all of which are assumed to be dually registered as SBSDs), adding to the industry an initial
burden of 130 hours1041 and an ongoing annual burden of sixty hours1042 and $1,200.1043

Proposed Rule 18a-6 would require twenty-seven types of records to be preserved by
stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs.1044 Proposed Rule 18a-6 does not require the firm
to create these records or perform the underlying task, so the burdens imposed by these
requirements would be to provide adequate physical space and computer hardware and software
for storage, preserve these records for the requisite time period, and produce them when
requested.1045 The Commission estimates that the proposed record preservation requirements
applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs would impose an initial burden of

are preserved for the requisite time period, and produce them when requested. The Commission
estimates that the relevant portions of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would impose
an initial burden of forty-four hours per firm,1052 and an ongoing annual burden of thirty hours
and $360 per firm. The Commission estimates that there are nine stand-alone SBSDs, resulting
in an industry-wide initial burden of 396 hours1053 and an industry-wide ongoing annual burden
of 270 hours1054 and $3,240.1055
Proposed Rule 18a-6 would require two types of records to be preserved by ANC standalone SBSDs.1056 Because the burden of actually performing the underlying task and creating
the written record is already accounted for in the PRA estimates for proposed Rules 18a-11057
and 18a-5,1058 the burden is the requirement to preserve these records for at least three years.
The Commission estimates that paragraph (b)(1)(x) and paragraph (b)(1)(i)’s cross-reference to
paragraph (a)(11) of proposed Rule 18a-5 would impose an initial burden of thirty-one hours1059

Proposed Rule 18a-6 would require eighteen types of records to be preserved by bank
SBSDs and bank MSBSPs, all of which are limited to the firm’s business as an SBSD or
MSBSP.1063 Proposed Rule 18a-6 does not require the firm to create these records or perform
the underlying task, so the burdens imposed by these requirements are to ensure there is adequate
physical space and computer hardware and software for storage, ensure these records are
preserved for the requisite time period, and produce them when requested. Therefore, after
consideration of the similar burdens imposed by Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended, the
Commission estimates that proposed Rule 18a-6 would impose on bank SBSDs and bank
MSBSPs an initial burden of 247 hours per firm1064 and an ongoing burden of 190 hours and
$4,520 per firm. The Commission estimates that there are twenty-five respondents (twenty-five

senior database administrator.

1061

performed by a compliance clerk.

6,175 hours1065 and an industry-wide ongoing annual burden of 4,750 hours1066 and $113,000.1067
Proposed Rule 18a-6 would require four types of records to be preserved by bank SBSDs,
all of which are limited to the firm’s business as an SBSD.1068 Because the burden to perform
the underlying task or create these records is accounted for in the PRA estimates for proposed
Rule 18a-41069 and Rule 18a-5, as proposed to be amended,1070 the burdens imposed by these
new requirements are to ensure there is adequate physical space and computer hardware and
software for storage, ensure these records are preserved for the requisite time period, and
produce them when requested. The Commission estimates that paragraphs (b)(9), (b)(10), and
(b)(12) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would impose an initial burden of fifty-seven hours per firm1071
and an ongoing annual burden of forty hours and $480 per firm. The Commission estimates that

247 hours x 25 bank SBSDs = 6,175 hours. These internal hours likely would be performed by a senior

there are twenty-five bank SBSDs, resulting in an industry-wide initial burden of 1,425 hours1072
and an industry-wide ongoing annual burden of 1,000 hours1073 and $12,000.1074
Paragraph (f) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would require third-party custodians for nonbroker-dealer SBSDs and non-broker-dealer MSBSPs to file with the Commission a written
undertaking and surrender the SBSD or MSBSP’s records upon the Commission’s request.1075
The obligation to provide documents upon the Commission’s request does not impose a new
burden, since this requirement merely changes the respondent’s identity rather than adding to the
quantity of burdens. Thus, the burden is the requirement to prepare and file a written
undertaking. The Commission estimates that 50% of the thirty-eight non-broker-dealer SBSDs
and non-broker-dealer MSBSPs would retain a third-party custodian, resulting in nineteen
written undertakings. The Commission estimates paragraph (f) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would
impose an ongoing annual burden of two hours per written undertaking, resulting in an industrywide ongoing burden of thirty-eight hours per year.1076

Proposed Amendments to Rule 17a-5 and Proposed Rule 18a-7

The proposed amendments to Rule 17a-5 and proposed Rule 18a-7 would impose
collection of information requirements that result in annual time burdens for broker-dealers,
SBSDs, and MSBSPs. The Commission estimates that the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-5
would impose the following initial and annual burdens:

1072

57 hours x 25 bank SBSDs = 1,425 hours. These internal hours likely would be performed by a compliance
manager and a senior database administrator.

1073

40 hours/year x 25 bank SBSDs = 1,000 hours/year. These internal hours likely would be performed by a
compliance clerk.

1074

$480/year x 25 bank SBSDs = $12,000/year.

1075

See paragraph (f) of proposed Rule 18a-6.

1076

2 hours/year x 19 written undertakings = 38 hours/year. These internal hours likely would be performed by
an attorney.

Estimated Hours and Costs of Proposed Amendments to Rule 17a-5
No Change in Estimated Burden. Many of the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-5 are
not expected to change the estimated burden imposed by Rule 17a-5. Most of the additional
proposed amendments discussed in section II.B.3.b. of this release are clarifying changes that
should not affect the Commission’s burden estimate.
The Commission is proposing that the financial report prepared by Form SBS filers
include statements and supporting schedules from proposed Form SBS instead of from Form
X-17A-5.1092 This is not so much a new burden as a different burden, since in the absence of this
proposed amendment, these firms would be required to file statements and supporting schedules
from Form X-17A-5 instead. In addition, the burden of preparing these statements and
supporting schedules is already accounted for in the PRA burden for proposed Form SBS
(discussed below).
The Commission does not estimate an additional burden associated with its proposal that
the compliance report include statements as to a broker-dealer SBSD’s compliance with
proposed Rule 18a-4,1093 because the burden to comply with proposed Rule 18a-4 is largely

already accounted for in the PRA estimate for proposed Rule 18a-4.1094 To the extent that the
burden is not already accounted for in the PRA estimate for proposed Rule 18a-4, the
Commission believes that broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs would already have
a system in place for confirming compliance with proposed Rule 18a-4, in accordance with best
practices. In addition, the Commission believes that the sixteen broker-dealers expected to
register as SBSDs should already have procedures in place for confirming compliance since they
are already required to confirm compliance with analogous Rule 15c3-3 (which Rule 18a-4 is
modeled on).
The Commission is proposing to amend Rule 17a-5 to require that broker-dealers attach
Part III of Form X-17A-5 to the annual report.1095 However, the Commission does not expect
this amendment to increase Rule 17a-5’s burden, since broker-dealers currently file Part III with
their audited annual report pursuant to staff guidance and Rule 617.1096
Liquidity Stress Test. The Commission proposes to add paragraph (a)(5)(vii) to Rule
17a-5, which would require ANC broker-dealers to file the results of the firm’s monthly liquidity
stress test with the Commission.1097 Because the burden of actually performing the liquidity
stress test and creating a liquidity funding plan is already accounted for in the PRA estimate for

1096	

See 17 CFR 249.617; Commission, Division of Trading and Markets, Broker-Dealer Notices and Reports,
available at http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/bdnotices.htm. In addition, Part III of Form X-17A-5,
as proposed to be amended, would add a reference to Rule 17a-12, which applies to OTC derivatives
dealers. Rule 17a-12 does not explicitly require OTC derivatives dealers to complete Part III of Form X17A-5, but this proposed amendment to Part III of Form X-17A-5 is not expected to result in a burden
increase since all [four] OTC derivatives dealers already voluntarily file Part III with their audited annual
reports.

256 


the proposed amendments to Rule 15c3-1,1098 the burden imposed by proposed paragraph
(a)(5)(vii) is the requirement to file a copy of the results with the Commission. The Commission
estimates that paragraph (a)(5)(vii) to Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended, would impose an
annual burden of twelve hours per ANC broker-dealer.1099 The Commission estimates that there
are ten ANC broker-dealers (all of which are assumed to be dually registered as SBSDs),
resulting in an industry-wide ongoing burden of 120 hours per year.1100
Proposed Form SBS. Paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended,
would require broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs to file proposed Form SBS
monthly instead of filing the applicable part of Form X-17A-5 quarterly.1101 Part II, Part IIA,
and Part II CSE of Form X-17A-5 each impose a different burden on respondents due to their
varying lengths and calculations, so the burden of filing proposed Form SBS depends on which
part of Form X-17A-5 the firm is currently required to file.
ANC broker-dealer SBSDs would be required to file proposed Form SBS instead of Part
II CSE of Form X-17A-5. Although proposed Form SBS is modeled on Part II CSE, the burden
on ANC broker-dealer SBSDs would increase, because ANC broker-dealer SBSDs would file
monthly instead of quarterly and would complete additional sections and line items eliciting
more detail about their security-based swap and swap activities.1102 In consideration of these
1098	

See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major SecurityBased Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70294.

1099	

1 hour/filing x 12 months/year = 12 hours/year. These internal hours likely would be performed by a
compliance manager.

1100	

12 hours/year x 10 ANC broker-dealers = 120 hours/year. These internal hours likely would be performed
by a compliance manager.

1101	

Compare 17 CFR 240.17a-5(a)(3)(ii) and (iii), with paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be
amended.

1102	

ANC broker-dealer SBSDs would be required to complete the following new sections: (1) Computation for
Determination of the Amount to be Maintained in the Special Account for the Exclusive Benefit of
Security-Based Swap Customers – Rule 18a-4, Appendix A; (2) Information for Possession or Control
Requirements under Rule 18a-4; (3) Schedule 1 – Aggregate Securities, Commodities, and Swaps

257 


additional requirements, the Commission estimates that the requirement for ANC broker-dealer
SBSDs to file proposed Form SBS every month would add an initial burden of twenty-five hours
per firm and an ongoing annual burden of 228 hours per firm. The Commission estimates that
there are ten ANC broker-dealer SBSDs, adding to the industry an initial burden of 250 hours1103
and an ongoing burden of 2,280 hours per year.1104
Non-model broker-dealer SBSDs would be required to file proposed Form SBS instead of
Part II or Part IIA of Form X-17A-5. Given that SBSDs are expected to be larger and relatively
sophisticated firms, the Commission assumes that all non-model broker-dealer SBSDs are
carrying firms that file Part II. Although sections of Part II are also found in proposed Form
SBS, the burden on non-model broker-dealer SBSDs would increase (but not as much as for
ANC broker-dealer SBSDs), because non-model broker-dealer SBSDs would file monthly
instead of quarterly and would complete additional sections and line items eliciting more detail
about their security-based swap and swap activities.1105 In consideration of these additional
Positions; and (4) Schedule 4 – Geographic Distribution of Derivatives Exposures for Ten Largest
Countries.
1103	

25 hours x 10 ANC broker-dealer SBSDs = 250 hours. These internal hours likely would be performed by
a compliance manager.

1104	

228 hours/year x 10 ANC broker-dealer SBSDs = 2,280 hours/year. These internal hours likely would be
performed by a compliance manager.

1105	

Non-model broker-dealer SBSDs would be required to complete the following new sections: (1) Financial
and Operational Data – Operational Deductions from Capital – Note A; (2) Financial and Operational Data
– Potential Operational Charges Not Deducted from Capital – Note B; (3) Computation for Determination
of PAB Requirements; (4) Computation for Determination of the Amount to be Maintained in the Special
Account for the Exclusive Benefit of Security-Based Swap Customers – Rule 18a-4, Appendix A;
(5) Information for Possession or Control Requirements under Rule 18a-4; (6) Schedule 1 – Aggregate
Securities, Commodities, and Swaps Positions; (7) Schedule 2 – Credit Concentration Report for Fifteen
Largest Current Exposures in Derivatives; (8) Schedule 3 – Portfolio Summary of Derivatives Exposures
by Internal Credit Rating; and (9) Schedule 4 – Geographic Distribution of Derivatives Exposures for Ten
Largest Countries. In addition, non-model broker-dealer SBSDs also registered as FCMs would be
required to file the following sections not included on Part II, but which the CFTC already requires or has
proposed to require FCMs to file as part of Form 1-FR-FCM: (1) Computation of CFTC Minimum Capital
Requirement; (2) Statement of Segregation Requirements and Funds in Segregation for Customers Trading
on U.S. Commodity Exchanges; (3) Statement of Cleared Swaps Customer Segregation Requirements and
Funds in Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts under Section 4d(f) of the Commodity Exchange Act;
(4) Statement of Segregation Requirements and Funds in Segregation for Customers’ Dealer Options

258 


requirements, the Commission estimates that the requirement for non-model broker-dealer
SBSDs to file proposed Form SBS every month would add an initial burden of fifty hours per
firm and an ongoing annual burden of 240 hours per firm. The Commission estimates that there
are six non-model broker-dealer SBSDs, adding to the industry an initial burden of 300 hours1106
and an ongoing burden of 1,440 hours per year.1107
Broker-dealer MSBSPs would be required to file proposed Form SBS instead of Part II or
Part IIA of Form X-17A-5. Given that MSBSPs are expected to be larger and relatively
sophisticated firms, the Commission assumes that broker-dealer MSBSPs are carrying firms that
file Part II. Although sections of Part II are also found in proposed Form SBS, the burden on
broker-dealer MSBSPs would increase (but not as much as for broker-dealer SBSDs), because
broker-dealer MSBSPs would file monthly instead of quarterly and would complete additional
sections and line items eliciting more detail about their security-based swap and swap
activities.1108 In consideration of these additional requirements, the Commission estimates that
Accounts; and (5) Statement of Secured Amounts and Funds Held in Separate Accounts for Foreign
Futures and Foreign Options Customers Pursuant to CFTC Regulation 30.7. The Commission does not
estimate a burden for these 5 sections from Form 1-FR-FCM, since the CFTC already requires FCMs to file
these 5 sections on a monthly basis (17 CFR 1.10(b)(i)), and therefore, the hourly burden is already
accounted for in the PRA estimate for the CFTC’s Rule 1.10 (1 CFR 1.10). In addition, the Commission
does not anticipate that FCMs will be required to file both the CFTC’s Form 1-FR-FCM and the
Commission’s proposed Form SBS.
1106	

50 hours x 6 non-model broker-dealer SBSDs = 300 hours. These internal hours likely would be performed
by a compliance manager.

1107	

240 hours/year x 6 non-model broker-dealer SBSDs = 1,440 hours/year. These internal hours likely would
be performed by a compliance manager.

1108	

Broker-dealer MSBSPs would be required to complete the following new sections: (1) Computation of
Tangible Net Worth (which is only 3 lines long); (2) Financial and Operational Data – Operational
Deductions from Capital – Note A; (3) Financial and Operational Data – Potential Operational Charges Not
Deducted from Capital – Note B; (4) Computation for Determination of PAB Requirements; (5) Schedule 1
– Aggregate Securities, Commodities, and Swaps Positions; (6) Schedule 2 – Credit Concentration Report
for Fifteen Largest Exposures in Derivatives; (7) Schedule 3 – Portfolio Summary of Derivatives
Exposures by Internal Credit Rating; and (8) Schedule 4 – Geographic Distribution of Derivatives
Exposures for Ten Largest Countries. In addition, broker-dealer MSBSPs also registered as FCMs would
be required to file the following sections not included on Part II, but which the CFTC already requires or
has proposed to require FCMs to file as part of Form 1-FR-FCM: (1) Computation of CFTC Minimum
Capital Requirement; (2) Statement of Segregation Requirements and Funds in Segregation for Customers

259 


the requirement for broker-dealer MSBSPs to file proposed Form SBS every month would add
an initial burden of forty hours per firm and an ongoing annual burden of 210 hours per firm.
The Commission estimates that there would be one broker-dealer MSBSP, such that the
estimated burden on the industry would be the same as for a single broker-dealer MSBSP.
Estimated Hours and Costs of Proposed Rule 18a-7
Proposed Rule 18a-7, which is modeled on Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended,
would require non-broker-dealer SBSDs and non-broker-dealer MSBSPs to satisfy certain
reporting requirements.1109
Additional ANC reports. Paragraph (a)(3) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would require ANC
stand-alone SBSDs to periodically file certain additional reports relating to their use of internal
models to calculate net capital.1110 After consideration of the Supporting Statement
accompanying the most recent extension of Rule 17a-5, which estimates that the requirement to
file additional ANC reports imposes a burden of 120 hours per respondent,1111 as well as the
proposal to amend Rule 17a-5 to require ANC broker-dealers to file the results of their monthly
liquidity stress tests with the additional ANC reports,1112 the Commission estimates that

Trading on U.S. Commodity Exchanges; (3) Statement of Cleared Swaps Customer Segregation
Requirements and Funds in Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts under Section 4d(f) of the Commodity
Exchange Act; (4) Statement of Segregation Requirements and Funds in Segregation for Customers’ Dealer
Options Accounts; and (5) Statement of Secured Amounts and Funds Held in Separate Accounts for
Foreign Futures and Foreign Options Customers Pursuant to CFTC Regulation 30.7. The Commission
does not estimate a burden for these 5 sections from Form 1-FR-FCM, since the CFTC already requires
FCMs to file these 5 sections on a monthly basis (17 CFR 1.10(b)(i)), and therefore, the hourly burden is
already accounted for in the PRA estimate for the CFTC’s Rule 1.10 (1 CFR 1.10). In addition, the
Commission does not anticipate that FCMs will be required to file both the CFTC’s Form 1-FR-FCM and
the Commission’s proposed Form SBS.

paragraph (a)(3) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would impose an annual burden of 132 hours per ANC
stand-alone SBSD.1113 The Commission estimates that there are six ANC stand-alone SBSDs,
resulting in an industry-wide ongoing burden of 792 hours per year.1114
Customer Statements. Paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would require stand-alone
SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs to disclose certain financial statements on their Internet
websites.1115 After consideration of the Supporting Statement accompanying the most recent
extension of Rule 17a-5, which requires similar disclosures by mail instead of on the firm’s
website,1116 the Commission staff’s experience with burden estimates for similar collections of
information, and the estimated initial web development costs, the Commission estimates that
paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would impose an initial burden of ten hours per firm and
an annual burden of one hour per firm. The Commission estimates that there are thirteen
respondents (nine stand-alone SBSDs and four stand-alone MSBSPs), resulting in an industrywide initial burden of 130 hours1117 and an industry-wide ongoing burden of thirteen hours per
year.1118

1113	

120 hours/year + 1 hour/liquidity stress test filing x 12 months/year = 132 hours/year. These internal hours
likely would be performed by a compliance manager.

1114	

132 hours/year x 6 ANC stand-alone SBSDs = 792 hours/year. These internal hours likely would be
performed by a compliance manager.

1115	

See paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-7. The Commission does not anticipate a dollar cost to establish a
website and a toll-free number under this paragraph, because the Commission believes firms that are large
enough to register as an SBSD or MSBSP already maintain a toll-free number for their customers and
already have an Internet website. See Broker-Dealer Exemption from Sending Certain Financial
Information to Customers, Exchange Act Release No. 48272 (Aug. 1, 2003), 68 FR 46446, 46450 (Aug. 6,

See Supporting Statement for the Paperwork Reduction Act Information Collection Submission for Rule
17a-5. See section II.B.3.a. of this release for a discussion of the similarities between paragraph (c) of Rule
17a-5 and paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-7.

10 hours x 13 stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs = 130 hours. These internal hours likely would
be performed by a compliance manager.

1118	

1 hour/year x 13 stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs = 13 hours/year. These internal hours likely
would be performed by a compliance clerk.

Annual Reports. Paragraph (c) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would require stand-alone SBSDs
and stand-alone MSBSPs to file with the Commission an annual report consisting of certain
financial reports.1119 In addition, paragraph (d) of proposed Rule 18a-7 requires the filing firm to
attach Part III of Form X-17A-5 to the annual report.1120 Part III must include an oath or
affirmation, which implicitly requires a senior officer or a trusted delegate to review the annual
report. Based on the Commission staff’s experience with the burden imposed by current Rule
17a-5’s annual report requirement and related postage costs,1121 the Commission estimates that
paragraphs (c) and (d) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would impose on stand-alone MSBSPs an annual
burden of ten hours and $5.60 per firm. The Commission estimates that there are four standalone MSBSPs, resulting in an industry-wide ongoing burden of forty hours1122 and $22.40 per
year.1123
Unlike stand-alone MSBSPs, stand-alone SBSDs would be required to include a
compliance report with their annual reports.1124 Thus, after consideration of the Commission’s
recent release adopting amendments to Rule 17a-5, which estimates that each compliance report
takes approximately sixty hours to prepare,1125 the Commission estimates that paragraphs (c) and
(d) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would impose an annual burden of seventy hours and $5.60 per

by a senior accountant.

stand-alone SBSD. The Commission estimates that there are nine stand-alone SBSDs, resulting
in an industry-wide ongoing burden of 630 hours1126 and $50.40 per year. 1127
Statement regarding Independent Public Accountant. Paragraph (e) of proposed Rule
18a-7 would require stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs to file a statement regarding
the independent public accountant engaged to audit the firm’s annual reports.1128 In addition to
postage costs, the Commission’s recent release estimates that the parallel requirement in Rule
17a-5 would impose a two-hour burden on each introducing broker-dealer to file an updated
statement, and a more significant ten-hour burden on each carrying broker-dealer, since the
changes would require renegotiating the carrying broker-dealer’s agreement with its independent
public accountant.1129 Consistent with that release, the Commission estimates that paragraph (e)
of proposed Rule 18a-7 would impose an initial burden of ten hours per firm and an annual
burden of two hours and 46 cents per firm.1130 The Commission estimates that there are thirteen
respondents (nine stand-alone SBSDs and four stand-alone MSBSPs), resulting in an industrywide initial burden of 130 hours1131 and an industry-wide ongoing burden of twenty-six hours1132
and $5.98 per year.1133

1126

70 hours/year x 9 stand-alone SBSDs = 630 hours/year. These internal hours likely would be performed by
a senior accountant.

1127

$5.60/year x 9 stand-alone SBSDs = $50.40/year.

1131

10 hours x 13 stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs = 130 hours. These internal hours likely would
be performed by a senior accountant.

1132

2 hours/year x 13 stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs = 26 hours/year. These internal hours
likely would be performed by a compliance clerk.

1133

46₵/year x 13 stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs = $5.98/year.

263 


Engagement of the Independent Public Accountant. Paragraph (f) of proposed Rule
18a-7 would require stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs to engage an independent
public accountant to provide reports covering the firm’s annual reports.1134 The Commission’s
recent release adopting amendments to Rule 17a-5 estimates that it would cost each carrying firm
$300,000 to retain an independent public accountant to audit its financial statements and
$150,000 to examine its compliance report.1135 Given that SBSDs and MSBSPs are expected to
be larger and relatively sophisticated firms, the Commission assumes that they are carrying firms
that would incur the $300,000 cost to audit their financial statements. However, since only
stand-alone SBSDs are required to file a compliance report,1136 only they (and not stand-alone
MSBSPs) would be required to retain an independent public accountant to review their
compliance reports.
Therefore, the Commission estimates that paragraph (f) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would
impose an annual cost of $300,000 on each stand-alone MSBSP. The Commission estimates that
there are four stand-alone MSBSPs, resulting in an industry-wide ongoing burden of $1,200,000
per year.1137 The Commission estimates that paragraph (f) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would impose
on stand-alone SBSDs an annual cost of $450,000 per firm,1138 since both their financial
statements and compliance report would need to be audited. The Commission estimates that
there are nine stand-alone SBSDs, resulting in an industry-wide ongoing burden of $4,050,000
per year.1139

See paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of proposed Rule 18a-7.


1137

$300,000/year x 4 stand-alone MSBSPs = $1,200,000/year. 


1138

$300,000/year (financial statements) + $150,000/year (compliance report) = $450,000/year. 


1139

$450,000/year x 9 stand-alone SBSDs = $4,050,000/year. 


264 


Notice of Change in Fiscal Year. Paragraph (j) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would require
stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs to notify the Commission of a change in fiscal
year.1140 Based on the Commission staff’s experience with the parallel requirement under Rule
17a-5, and the Supporting Statement accompanying the most recent extension of Rule 17a-11,
which estimates that each financial notice takes approximately one hour to prepare and file with
the Commission,1141 the Commission estimates that paragraph (j) of proposed Rule 18a-7 would
impose a burden of one hour and 46 cents on a firm planning to change its fiscal year. The
Commission estimates that each year, one firm will change its fiscal year, such that the estimated
burden on the industry would be one hour and 46 cents per year.
Proposed Form SBS. Proposed Rule 18a-7 would require stand-alone SBSDs and
stand-alone MSBSPs to file proposed Form SBS monthly,1142 and would require bank SBSDs
and bank MSBSPs to file proposed Form SBS quarterly.1143 Stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone
MSBSPs would be required to complete more sections of proposed Form SBS than bank SBSDs
and bank MSBSPs, and would therefore experience a greater burden.
Stand-alone SBSDs would be required to file proposed Form SBS on a monthly basis.1144
Proposed Form SBS includes eleven sections and five schedules applicable to stand-alone
SBSDs.1145 Stand-alone SBSDs dually registered as FCMs would be required to complete five

Regulatory Capital Requirements (Non-Broker-Dealer); (4) Statement of Income (Loss); (5) Capital

additional sections, all of which the CFTC already requires or has proposed to require FCMs to
file as part of Form 1-FR-FCM.1146 In consideration of these additional requirements, the
Commission estimates that the requirement for stand-alone SBSDs to file proposed Form SBS
every month would impose an initial burden of 160 hours per firm and an ongoing annual burden
of 192 hours per firm. The Commission estimates that there are nine stand-alone SBSDs,
resulting in an industry-wide initial burden of 1,440 hours1147 and an industry-wide ongoing
burden of 1,728 hours per year.1148
Stand-alone MSBSPs would be required to file proposed Form SBS on a monthly
basis.1149 Proposed Form SBS includes three sections and five schedules applicable to standalone MSBSPs.1150 Stand-alone MSBSPs dually registered as FCMs would be required to

Withdrawals; (6) Capital Withdrawals – Recap; (7) Financial and Operational Data; (8) Financial and
Operational Data – Operational Deductions from Capital – Note A; (9) Financial and Operational Data –
Potential Operational Charges Not Deducted from Capital – Note B; (10) Computation for Determination
of the Amount to be Maintained in the Special Account for the Exclusive Benefit of Security-Based Swap
Customers – Rule 18a-4, Appendix A; (11) Information for Possession or Control Requirements under Rule
18a-4; (12) Schedule 1 – Aggregate Securities, Commodities, and Swaps Positions; (13) Schedule 2 –
Credit Concentration Report for Fifteen Largest Exposures in Derivatives; (14) Schedule 3 – Portfolio
Summary of Derivatives Exposures by Internal Credit Rating; and (15) Schedule 4 –Geographic
Distribution of Derivatives Exposures for Ten Largest Countries.
1146	

Stand-alone SBSDs also registered as FCMs would be required to file the following sections:
(1) Computation of CFTC Minimum Capital Requirement; (2) Statement of Segregation Requirements and
Funds in Segregation for Customers Trading on U.S. Commodity Exchanges; (3) Statement of Cleared
Swaps Customer Segregation Requirements and Funds in Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts under Section
4d(f) of the Commodity Exchange Act; (4) Statement of Segregation Requirements and Funds in
Segregation for Customers’ Dealer Options Accounts; and (5) Statement of Secured Amounts and Funds
Held in Separate Accounts for Foreign Futures and Foreign Options Customers Pursuant to CFTC
Regulation 30.7. The Commission does not estimate a burden for these 5 sections, since the CFTC already
requires FCMs to file these 5 sections on a monthly basis (17 CFR 1.10(b)(i)), and therefore, the hourly
burden is already accounted for in the PRA estimate for the CFTC’s Rule 1.10 (1 CFR 1.10). In addition,
the Commission does not anticipate that FCMs will be required to file both the CFTC’s Form 1-FR-FCM
and the Commission’s proposed Form SBS.

1147	

160 hours x 9 stand-alone SBSDs = 1,440 hours. These internal hours likely would be performed by a
senior compliance manager.

1148	

192 hours/year x 9 stand-alone SBSDs = 1,728 hours/year. These internal hours likely would be performed
by a senior compliance manager.

Stand-alone MSBSPs would be required to complete the following sections and schedules: (1) Statement of
Financial Condition; (2) Computation of Tangible Net Worth; (3) Statement of Income (Loss);

266 


complete five additional sections, all of which the CFTC already requires or has proposed to
require FCMs to file as part of Form 1-FR-FCM.1151 In consideration of these additional
requirements, the Commission estimates that the requirement for stand-alone MSBSPs to file
proposed Form SBS every month would impose an initial burden of forty hours per firm and an
ongoing annual burden of sixty hours per firm. The Commission estimates that there are four
stand-alone MSBSPs, resulting in an industry-wide initial burden of 160 hours1152 and an
industry-wide ongoing burden of 192 hours per year.1153
Bank SBSDs would be required to file proposed Form SBS on a quarterly basis.1154
Proposed Form SBS includes five sections and one schedule applicable to bank SBSDs.1155 The
Commission does not expect proposed Form SBS to impose a significant burden on bank
(4) Schedule 1 – Aggregate Securities, Commodities, and Swaps Positions; (5) Schedule 2 – Credit
Concentration Report for Fifteen Largest Exposures in Derivatives; (6) Schedule 3 – Portfolio Summary of
Derivatives Exposures by Internal Credit Rating; and (7) Schedule 4 –Geographic Distribution of
Derivatives Exposures for Ten Largest Countries.
1151	

Stand-alone MSBSPs also registered as FCMs would be required to file the following sections:
(1) Computation of CFTC Minimum Capital Requirement; (2) Statement of Segregation Requirements and
Funds in Segregation for Customers Trading on U.S. Commodity Exchanges; (3) Statement of Cleared
Swaps Customer Segregation Requirements and Funds in Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts under Section
4d(f) of the Commodity Exchange Act; (4) Statement of Segregation Requirements and Funds in
Segregation for Customers’ Dealer Options Accounts; and (5) Statement of Secured Amounts and Funds
Held in Separate Accounts for Foreign Futures and Foreign Options Customers Pursuant to CFTC
Regulation 30.7. The Commission does not estimate a burden for these 5 sections, since the CFTC already
requires FCMs to file these 5 sections on a monthly basis (17 CFR 1.10(b)(i)), and therefore, the hourly
burden is already accounted for in the PRA estimate for the CFTC’s Rule 1.10 (1 CFR 1.10). In addition,
the Commission does not anticipate that FCMs will be required to file both the CFTC’s Form 1-FR-FCM
and the Commission’s proposed Form SBS.

1152	

40 hours x 4 stand-alone MSBSPs = 160 hours. These internal hours likely would be performed by a senior
compliance manager.

1153	

48 hours/year x 4 stand-alone MSBSPs = 192 hours/year. These internal hours likely would be performed
by a senior compliance manager.

1154	

See paragraph (a)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-7.

1155	

Bank SBSDs would be required to complete the following sections and schedules: (1) Balance Sheet
(Information as Reported on FFIEC Form 031 – Schedule RC); (2) Regulatory Capital (Information as
Reported on FFIEC Form 031 – Schedule RC-R); (3) Income Statement (Information as Reported on
FFIEC Form 031 – Schedule RI); (4) Computation for Determination of the Amount to be Maintained in
the Special Account for the Exclusive Benefit of Security-Based Swap Customers – Rule 18a-4, Appendix
A; (5) Information for Possession or Control Requirements under Rule 18a-4; and (6) Schedule 1 –
Derivative Positions.

SBSDs, because two of the five sections require the firm to file calculations already computed in
accordance with proposed Rule 18a-3, and the other three sections either mirror or are scaled
down versions of schedules to FFIEC Form 031, which banks are already required to file with
their prudential regulator (although they would need to transpose this information from FFIEC
Form 031 to Form SBS). Although bank SBSDs dually registered as FCMs would be required to
complete 5 additional sections, the CFTC already requires or has proposed to require FCMs to
file these schedules on Form 1-FR-FCM.1156 In consideration of these additional requirements,
the Commission estimates that the requirement for bank SBSDs to file proposed Form SBS
quarterly would impose an initial burden of 36 hours per firm and an ongoing annual burden of
sixteen hours per firm. The Commission estimates that there are twenty-five bank SBSDs,
resulting in an industry-wide initial burden of 900 hours1157 and an industry-wide ongoing
burden of 400 hours per year.1158
Bank MSBSPs would be required to file proposed Form SBS on a quarterly basis.1159
Proposed Form SBS includes three sections and one schedule applicable to bank MSBSPs.1160
1156	

Bank SBSDs also registered as FCMs would be required to file the following sections: (1) Computation of
CFTC Minimum Capital Requirement; (2) Statement of Segregation Requirements and Funds in
Segregation for Customers Trading on U.S. Commodity Exchanges; (3) Statement of Cleared Swaps
Customer Segregation Requirements and Funds in Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts under Section 4d(f)
of the Commodity Exchange Act; (4) Statement of Segregation Requirements and Funds in Segregation for
Customers’ Dealer Options Accounts; and (5) Statement of Secured Amounts and Funds Held in Separate
Accounts for Foreign Futures and Foreign Options Customers Pursuant to CFTC Regulation 30.7. The
Commission does not estimate a burden for these 5 sections, since the CFTC already requires FCMs to file
these 5 sections on a monthly basis (17 CFR 1.10(b)(i)), and therefore, the hourly burden is already
accounted for in the PRA estimate for the CFTC’s Rule 1.10 (1 CFR 1.10). In addition, the Commission
does not anticipate that FCMs will be required to file both the CFTC’s Form 1-FR-FCM and the
Commission’s proposed Form SBS.

1157	

36 hours x 25 bank SBSDs = 900 hours. These internal hours likely would be performed by a senior
compliance manager.

Bank MSBSPs dually registered as FCMs would be required to complete five additional sections,
all of which the CFTC already requires or has proposed to require FCMs to file as part of Form
1-FR-FCM.1161 However, the Commission does not expect any banks to register with the
Commission as MSBSPs and therefore does not anticipate these requirements to impose an
additional burden.1162
4. 	

Proposed Amendments to Rule 17a-11 and Proposed Rule 18a-8

The proposed amendments to Rule 17a-11 and proposed Rule 18a-8 would impose
collection of information requirements that result in annual time burdens for broker-dealers,
SBSDs, and MSBSPs. Current Rule 17a-11 imposes an estimated annual burden of 1 hour per
firm and a total industry burden of 443 hours.1163 The Commission estimates that the proposed
amendments to Rule 17a-11 would impose the following initial and annual burdens:

Reported on FFIEC Form 031 – Schedule RC-R); (3) Income Statement (Information as Reported on
FFIEC Form 031 – Schedule RI); and (4) Schedule 1 –Derivative Positions.
1161	

Bank MSBSPs also registered as FCMs would be required to file the following sections: (1) Computation
of CFTC Minimum Capital Requirement; (2) Statement of Segregation Requirements and Funds in
Segregation for Customers Trading on U.S. Commodity Exchanges; (3) Statement of Cleared Swaps
Customer Segregation Requirements and Funds in Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts under Section 4d(f)
of the Commodity Exchange Act; (4) Statement of Segregation Requirements and Funds in Segregation for
Customers’ Dealer Options Accounts; and (5) Statement of Secured Amounts and Funds Held in Separate
Accounts for Foreign Futures and Foreign Options Customers Pursuant to CFTC Regulation 30.7. The
Commission does not estimate a burden for these 5 sections, since the CFTC already requires FCMs to file
these 5 sections on a monthly basis (17 CFR 1.10(b)(i)), and therefore, the hourly burden is already
accounted for in the PRA estimate for the CFTC’s Rule 1.10 (1 CFR 1.10). In addition, the Commission
does not anticipate that FCMs will be required to file both the CFTC’s Form 1-FR-FCM and the
Commission’s proposed Form SBS.

1162	

The Commission estimates that the requirement for bank MSBSPs to file proposed Form SBS quarterly
would impose an initial burden of 16 hours per firm and an ongoing annual burden of 8 hours per firm.

The Commission estimates that proposed Rule 18a-8 would impose an annual burden of
4.6 hours per year.
Estimated Ongoing Hours and Costs of Current Rule 17a-11
In the Supporting Statement accompanying the most recent extension of Rule 17a-11’s
collection, the Commission estimates that it takes one hour to prepare and file a notice required
under Rule 17a-11.1167 Given that 443 Rule 17a-11 notices were filed in 2012, current Rule
17a-11 creates an estimated industry-wide ongoing burden of 443 hours per year.1168
Estimated Hours and Costs of Proposed Amendments to Rule 17a-11
The Commission proposes to add paragraph (b)(6) to Rule 17a-11, which would require
broker-dealer MSBSPs to notify the Commission if their tangible net worth falls below $20
million.1169 Because the burden of actually calculating the firm’s tangible net worth is already
accounted for in the PRA estimate for proposed Rule 18a-2,1170 the burden imposed by paragraph
(b)(6) of Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended, is the requirement to notify the Commission

compliance manager.

when the firm’s tangible net worth falls to a certain level. However, the Commission does not
expect to receive any notices under this provision, since the Commission expects only one
broker-dealer MSBSP, which would already be subject to the more stringent net capital
requirements applicable to broker-dealers. Thus, the Commission does not expect paragraph
(b)(6) of Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended, to impose an additional burden.
The Commission proposes to add paragraph (e) to Rule 17a-11, which would require
ANC broker-dealers to notify the Commission if the monthly liquidity stress test indicates that
the firm’s liquidity reserve is insufficient.1171 Because the burden of actually performing the
liquidity stress test is already accounted for in the PRA estimate for Rule 15c3-1,1172 the burden
imposed by paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended, is the requirement to
notify the Commission of certain adverse test results. Given the similarity in the rules, the
Commission estimates that each required notice would take one hour to prepare and file.1173 The
Commission does not expect to receive many notices under paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11, given
that it did not receive any Rule 17a-11 notices from ANC broker-dealers in 2012. However,
since the Commission estimates that 4 additional firms will register as ANC broker-dealers, the
Commission estimates that one notice per year would be filed under paragraph (e) of Rule 17a11, resulting in an industry-wide ongoing burden of one hour per year.1174
The Commission proposes to add paragraph (f) to Rule 17a-11, which requires
broker-dealer SBSDs to notify the Commission if they fail to make a deposit required under
1171	

See paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended.

1 notice/year x 1 hour/notice = 1 hour/year. This internal hour likely would be performed by a compliance
manager.

271 


proposed Rule 18a-4.1175 Because the burden to calculate the reserve amount is already
accounted for in the PRA estimate for proposed Rule 18a-4,1176 the burden imposed by paragraph
(f) of Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended, is the requirement to notify the Commission
when the firm fails to act in accordance with proposed Rule 18a-4. Given the similarity in the
rules, the Commission estimates that each required notice would take one hour to prepare and
file.1177 Based on Commission experience with the number of notices filed under current Rule
17a-11,1178 the Commission estimates that 100 notices would be filed each year under paragraph
(f) of Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended, resulting in an industry-wide ongoing burden of
100 hours per year.1179
The Commission proposes to redesignate paragraph (f) of Rule 17a-11 as paragraph (g)
and to require a broker-dealer’s national securities exchange (“NSE”) or national securities
association (“NSA”) to notify the Commission if it learns that the broker-dealer failed to provide
a notice required under any paragraph of Rule 17a-11 (instead of just paragraphs (b) through (e)
of Rule 17a-11).1180 Thus, NSEs and NSAs would be subject to new burdens to file a delinquent
broker-dealer’s notices under new paragraphs (e) (liquidity stress test) and (f) (failure to deposit
in Rule 18a-4 account). After considering the similar Rule 17a-11 requirement, the Commission
estimates that each required notice would take one hour to prepare and file.1181 Based on
1175	

See paragraph (f) of Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended.

Commission experience with the number of notices currently filed by NSEs and NSAs, the
Commission estimates that ten notices would be filed pursuant to the amendment to paragraph
(g) of Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended, resulting in an estimated industry-wide ongoing
burden of 10 hours per year.1182
Estimated Hours and Costs of Proposed Rule 18a-8
Proposed Rule 18a-8 would require non-broker-dealer SBSDs and non-broker-dealer
MSBSPs to notify the Commission of certain indicia of their financial condition.1183 The
Commission estimates that each Rule 18a-8 notice would take approximately fifty-five minutes
to prepare and file, in contrast to its estimate that a Rule 17a-11 notice would take one hour to
prepare and file,1184 because stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs do not have a DEA
with which to file a copy of the Rule 17a-11 notice and bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs are not
required to file the Rule 17a-11 notice with their prudential regulator.1185
The Commission estimates that it would receive approximately five Rule 18a-8 notices
per year, based on the substantially smaller pool of possible respondents, as compared with
current Rule 17a-11. Under current Rule 17a-11, there are approximately 4,327 possible
respondents – 4,545 registered broker-dealers, minus 218 broker-dealers registered pursuant to
section 15(b)(11)(A) of the Exchange Act.1186 In contrast, the Commission estimates that there

1182	

10 notices/year x 1 hour/notice = 10 hours/year. These internal hours likely would be performed by a
compliance manager.

1183	

See proposed Rule 18a-8.

1184	

See Supporting Statement for the Paperwork Reduction Act Information Collection Submission for Rule
17a-11.

1185	

Compare paragraph (h) of Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended, with paragraph (h) proposed Rule
18a-8.

1186	

Rule 17a-11 does not apply to a broker-dealer registered pursuant to section 15(b)(11)(A) of the Exchange
Act (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(11)(A)) that is not a member of either a national securities exchange or a national
securities association. See paragraph (j) of Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended. The Commission
estimates that there are approximately 4,327 broker-dealers subject to Rule 17a-11 after consulting with the

273 


would be thirty-eight non-broker-dealer SBSDs and non-broker-dealer MSBSPs (twenty-five
bank SBSDs, nine stand-alone SBSDs, and four stand-alone MSBSPs). Assuming that each of
the five Rule 18a-8 notices takes fifty-five minutes to prepare and file, the Commission estimates
proposed Rule 18a-8 would result in an industry-wide ongoing burden of 4.6 hours per year.1187
5. 	

Proposed Rule 18a-9

Proposed Rule 18a-9, which is modeled on Rule 17a-13, would require stand-alone
SBSDs to establish a securities count program.1188 As explained below, the Commission
estimates that proposed Rule 18a-9 would impose an industry-wide initial burden of 225 hours
and an industry-wide ongoing burden of 900 hours per year.
The current approved PRA estimate for Rule 17a-13 estimates a securities count program
imposes an average ongoing cost of 100 hours per year.1189 The Commission is using this
estimate, and therefore estimates that proposed Rule 18a-9 would impose an ongoing annual
burden of 100 hours per stand-alone SBSD. The Commission estimates that there are nine standalone SBSDs, resulting in an estimated industry-wide ongoing burden of 900 hours per year.1190
The Commission also estimates that proposed Rule 18a-9 would impose an initial burden
of twenty-five hours per firm. The records required by proposed Rule 18a-9 should already be
recorded by the systems implemented under proposed Rules 18a-5 and 18a-6, and accordingly,

National Futures Association (4,545 registered broker-dealers – 218 broker-dealers registered pursuant to
section 15(b)(11)(A) of the Exchange Act = 4,327 Rule 17a-11 respondents).
1187	

5 notices/year x (55 minutes/notice / 60 minutes/hour) = 4.6 hours/year. These internal hours likely would
be performed by a compliance manager.

1188	

See proposed Rule 18a-9.

1189	

See Commission, Supporting Statement for the Paperwork Reduction Act Information Collection
Submission for Rule 17a-13 (May 3, 2011), available at
http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/DownloadDocument?documentID=245864&version=1.

1190	

100 hours/year x 9 stand-alone SBSDs = 900 hours/year. These internal hours likely would be performed
by an operations specialist.

274 


the resulting initial burden is largely already accounted for under these rules.1191 However, the
Commission estimates that the initial cost to establish procedures for conducting the securities
count program, including identifying the persons involved in the program, would create an initial
burden of approximately twenty-five hours per stand-alone SBSD, or 225 hours for the estimated
nine stand-alone SBSDs.1192
E.

Collection of Information Is Mandatory

The collections of information pursuant to the proposed amendments and new rules are
mandatory, as applicable, for broker-dealers, SBSDs, and MSBSPs.
F.

Confidentiality

The broker-dealer annual reports filed with the Commission are not confidential, except
that if the statement of financial condition is bound separately from the balance of the annual
reports, and each page of the balance of the annual reports is stamped “confidential,” then the
balance of the annual reports shall be deemed confidential to the extent permitted by law.1193
Subject to certain exceptions,1194 if there are material weaknesses, the accountant’s report on the
compliance report must be made available for customers’ inspection and, consequently, it would
not be deemed confidential.1195 Subject to certain exceptions,1196 a broker-dealer must furnish to
its customers its unaudited financial statements,1197 and must provide annually a balance sheet
with appropriate notes prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
1191

However, the Commission assumes that stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs do not currently
have a securities count program in place.

1192

25 hours x 9 stand-alone SBSDs = 225 hours. These internal hours likely would be performed by a senior
operations manager.

which must be audited if the broker-dealer is required to file audited financial statements with
the Commission.1198
The stand-alone SBSD and stand-alone MSBSP annual reports filed with the
Commission are not confidential, except that if the statement of financial condition is bound
separately from the balance of the annual reports, and each page of the balance of the annual
reports is stamped “confidential,” then the balance of the annual reports shall be deemed
confidential to the extent permitted by law.1199 Stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs
must also make publicly available on their websites audited and unaudited financial statements,
and also make these documents available in writing, upon request, to any person that has a
security-based swap account.1200 A stand-alone SBSD would also be required to disclose on its
website at the same time: (1) a statement of the amount of the firm’s net capital and required net
capital and other information, if applicable, related to the firm’s net capital;1201 and (2) if, in
connection with the firm’s most recent annual reports, the report of the independent public
accountant identifies one or more material weaknesses, a copy of the report.1202
With respect to the other information collected under the proposed amendments and
proposed rules, the firm can request the confidential treatment of the information.1203 If such a

Retention Period for Recordkeeping Requirements

Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended, specifies the required retention periods for a
broker-dealer.1205 Proposed Rule 18a-6 specifies the required retention periods for non-brokerdealer SBSDs and non-broker-dealer MSBSPs.1206 Many of the required records must be
retained for three years; certain other records must be retained for longer periods.1207
H.

Request for Comment

Pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3306(c)(2)(B), the Commission requests comment on the proposed
collections of information in order to:


Evaluate whether the proposed collections of information are necessary for the proper
performance of the functions of the Commission, including whether the information
would have practical utility;



Evaluate the accuracy of the Commission’s estimates of the burden of the proposed
collections of information;



Determine whether there are ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the
information to be collected; and



Evaluate whether there are ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information
on those who respond, including through the use of automated collection techniques or
other forms of information technology.
In addition, the Commission requests comment, including empirical data in support of

comments, in response to the following questions:

1204

See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552 et seq.; 15 U.S.C. 78x (governing the public availability of information obtained by
the Commission).

1.	 The Commission does not expect any banks to register with the Commission as MSBSPs.
Is this expectation correct? If not, please provide a suggested estimate and empirical
support for it.
2.	 The Commission estimates that 26 FCMs will register with the Commission as SBSDs or
MSBSPs – 16 broker-dealer SBSDs, 9 stand-alone SBSDs, and 1 broker-dealer MSBSP.
Is this estimate accurate? If so, provide empirical support for the Commission’s estimate.
If not, please provide a suggested estimate and empirical support for it.
3.	 The Commission believes that broker-dealers do not rely on paragraph (b)(2) of Rule
17a-3, which exempts from Rule 17a-3 transactions cleared by a bank if the bank keeps
the requisite records for the broker-dealer.1208 Is this correct? If not, please provide the
estimated burden associated with the Commission’s proposal to eliminate paragraph
(b)(2) of Rule 17a-3.
4.	 Do stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs already have record making, record
preservation, and reporting systems in place? If so, please identify them so they can be
taken into account in the Commission’s burden estimates under proposed Rules 18a-5
through 18a-9.
5.	 The Commission believes there is no burden associated with its proposed amendment to
paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17a-4, which would add a cross-reference to paragraph (a)(11)
of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended (regarding proof of money balances). Is this
estimate reasonable? Explain why or why not.
Persons submitting comments on the collection of information requirements should direct
their comments to the Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.

Introduction

The Commission is sensitive to the costs and benefits of its rules. Some of these costs
and benefits stem from statutory mandates, while others are affected by the discretion exercised
in implementing the mandates. The following economic analysis seeks to identify and consider
the benefits and costs – including the effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation –
that would result from the proposed new recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities
count rules for stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs and
from the proposed amendments to Rules 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5, and 17a-11. The costs and benefits
considered in proposing these new rules and amendments are discussed below and have
informed the policy choices described throughout this release.
As discussed more fully in section II. above, pursuant to sections 15F and 17(a) of the
Exchange Act, the Commission is proposing to amend Rules 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5, and 17a-11 to
279 


establish recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements for broker-dealer SBSDs and
broker-dealer MSBSPs to account for their security-based swap activities.1209 Pursuant to
section 15F(f) of the Exchange Act, the Commission is proposing new Rules 18a-5 through
18a-9 to establish recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements for stand-alone
SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs, and securities count
requirements for stand-alone SBSDs. Finally, pursuant to sections 15F(f) and 17(a) of the
Exchange Act, the Commission is proposing new Form SBS that would be used by all types of
SBSDs and MSBSPs to report financial information and, in the case of broker-dealer SBSDs and
broker-dealer MSBSPs, replace their use of Part II, Part IIA, Part IIB, or Part II CSE of the
FOCUS Report. The Commission believes these proposed rules and rule amendments will help
regulators determine whether relevant market participants comply with the proposed capital,
margin, and segregation requirements.1210 Additionally, the Commission is proposing technical
amendments to Rules 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5, and 17a-11, which will apply to all registered brokerdealers.
With regard to the proposed rules and rule amendments relating to security-based swap
recordkeeping and reporting, the baseline for the economic analysis is the OTC derivatives
markets as they exist today. The baseline includes any recordkeeping and reporting rules
currently applicable to participants in the OTC derivatives market including applicable rules
previously adopted by the Commission1211 but excluding the rules proposed here. The current
1209	

In addition, paragraph (a)(5) of Rule 17a-5, as proposed to be amended, and paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11,
as proposed to be amended, would require ANC broker-dealers to make additional reports related to the
liquidity stress test conducted pursuant to paragraph (f) of Rule 15c3-1. The Commission is also proposing
certain other amendments to Rules 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5, and 17a-11, as discussed above.

1210	

See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major SecurityBased Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR 70213.

1211	

The Commission notes that it has temporarily excluded security-based swaps from the definition of
“security.” See Order Granting Temporary Exemptions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in

280 


OTC derivatives market participants and the current reporting and recordkeeping regimes for
those entities are discussed more fully below. With respect to the proposed technical
amendments to Rules 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5, and 17a-11, the baseline for purposes of this
economic analysis is the current recordkeeping and reporting regime for broker-dealers under
such rules.1212
While the Commission does not have comprehensive information on the U.S. OTC
derivatives markets, the Commission is using the limited data currently available in considering
the effects of the proposals.1213 The Commission requests that commenters identify sources of
data and information as well as provide data and information to assist the Commission in
analyzing the economic consequences of the proposed rules. The Commission also requests
comment on all aspects of this initial economic analysis, including on whether the analysis has:
(1) identified all benefits and costs, including all effects on efficiency, competition, and capital
formation; (2) given due consideration to each benefit and cost, including each effect on
efficiency, competition, and capital formation; and (3) identified and considered reasonable
alternatives to the proposed new rules and rule amendments.
The sections below present an overview of the OTC derivatives markets, a discussion of
the general costs and benefits of the proposed recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and a

Swaps, and Request for Comment, 76 FR 39927; Order Extending Temporary Exemptions under the

to Encompass Security-Based Swaps, and Request for Comment, 78 FR 10218 (extending exemptive relief
through February 11, 2014). Thus, for purposes of the Commission’s baseline analysis for broker-dealers,
security-based swap activities would be excluded.

Analysis also includes a discussion of the potential effects of the proposed amendments and new
rules on competition, efficiency, and capital formation. The final section of the Economic
Analysis consists of a discussion of implementation considerations.
B. 	

Baseline of Economic Analysis
1. 	

OTC Derivatives Market

As stated above, to assess the costs and benefits of these rules, a baseline must be
established against which the rules may be evaluated. For the purposes of this economic
analysis, the baseline is the OTC derivatives markets1214 as they exist today, including applicable
rules adopted by the Commission but excluding the rules proposed here.1215 The markets as they
exist today are dominated, both globally and domestically, by a small number of firms, generally
entities affiliated with or within large commercial banks.1216
The OTC derivatives markets have been described as opaque because, for example,
transaction-level data about OTC derivatives trading generally is not publicly available.1217 This
1214	

OTC derivatives may include forwards, swaps, and options on foreign exchange, and interest rate, equity,
and commodity derivatives.

1215	

The baseline, however, for the proposed amendments to Rules 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5, and 17a-11 is the
current recordkeeping and reporting regime for broker-dealers under these rules.

economic analysis is supported, where possible, by data currently available to the Commission
from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation Trade Information Warehouse (“DTCCTIW”). This evaluation takes into account data regarding the security-based swap market and
especially data regarding the activity – including activity that may be suggestive of dealing
behavior – of participants in the single-name credit default swap market.1218 While a large
segment of the security-based swap market is comprised of credit default swaps, these
derivatives do not comprise the entire security-based swap market.
Available information about the global OTC derivatives markets suggests that swap
transactions, in contrast to security-based swap transactions, dominate trading activities, notional
amounts, and market values.1219 For example, the BIS estimates that the total notional amounts
outstanding and gross market value of global OTC derivatives were over $693 trillion and $20.2
trillion, respectively, as of the end of June 2013.1220 Of these totals, the BIS estimates that
foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts, and commodity contracts comprised
approximately 95% of the total notional amount and 93% of the gross market value.1221 Credit
default swaps, including index credit default swaps, comprised approximately 3.5% of the total
notional amount and 3.6% of the gross market value. Equity-linked contracts, including
forwards, swaps, and options, comprised approximately an additional 1.0% of the total notional
amount and 3.5% of the gross market value.1222

Id. Similarly, the OCC has found that interest rate products comprised 81% of the total notional amount of
OTC derivatives held by bank dealers whereas credit derivative contracts comprised 5%. See OCC,

283 


Security-based swaps represent a relatively small subset of the overall global OTC
derivatives market.1223 Consistent with the Commission’s authority over this subset of the OTC
derivatives market,1224 the recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements under
proposed Rules 18a-5 through 18a-9 would apply only to those firms that participate in the
security-based swap markets (although some of these firms may be dually-registered with the
CFTC or the prudential regulators and thus may be subject to the recordkeeping and reporting
rules of the CFTC and the prudential regulators governing swaps generally).1225 In addition,
although the proposed recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements apply to all
security-based swaps, not just single-name credit default swaps, the data on single-name credit
default swaps are currently sufficiently representative of the market to help inform this economic
analysis because when measured by notional value, single-name credit default swaps account for
95% of all SBS transactions.1226 The majority of these single-name credit default swaps, both in

http://www.occ.gov/topics/capital-markets/financial-markets/trading/derivatives/dq313.pdf.
1223	

For example, as of the end of June, 2013, BIS reports that the global notional amount outstanding of OTC
derivatives was $692,908 billion. Interest rate contracts, which generally are not security-based swaps,
comprised approximately 83.31% of the overall OTC derivatives market. Foreign exchange contracts,
another type of OTC derivative which generally is not a security-based swap, comprised another 11.69% of
the overall derivatives market. See BIS Statistical Release: OTC derivatives statistics at end-June 2013, p.

terms of aggregate total notional amount and total volume by product type reference corporate
and sovereign entities.1227
While the number of transactions in single-name credit default swaps is larger than the
number of index credit default swaps, the aggregate total notional amount of index credit default
swaps exceeds the notional amount of single-name credit default swaps.1228 For example, the
total aggregate notional amount for single-name credit default swaps was $6.2 trillion, while the
aggregate total notional amount for index credit default swaps was $16.8 trillion over the sample
period of January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. For the same sample period, however,
single-name credit default swaps totaled 69% of transactional volume, while index credit default
swaps comprised 31% of the total transactional volume.1229 The majority of trades in both
notional amount and volume for both single-name and index credit default swaps over the 2011
sample period were new trades in contrast to assignments, increases, terminations or exits.1230
The analysis of the 2011 data further shows that, as measured by total notional amount and total
volume, the majority of single-name and index credit default contracts have a tenor of five
years.1231 In addition, the data from the sample period indicates that the geographical
distribution of counterparties’ parent country domiciles in single name contracts are concentrated
in the U.S., United Kingdom, and Switzerland.1232

As described more fully in the CDS Data Analysis,1233 based on 2011 transaction data,
Commission staff identified entities currently transacting in the credit default swap market that
may register as SBSDs by analyzing various criteria of their dealing activity. The results suggest
that there is currently a high degree of concentration of potential dealing activity in the singlename credit default swap market. For example, using the criterion that dealers are likely to
transact with many counterparties who themselves are not dealers, the analysis of the 2011 data
shows that only 28 out of 1,084 market participants have three or more counterparties that
themselves are not recognized as dealers by ISDA.1234 In addition, the analysis suggests that
dealers appear, based on the percentage of trades between buyer and seller principals, in the
majority of all trades on either one or both sides in single-name and index credit default
swaps.1235 Additionally, according to the OCC, at the end of the first quarter of 2012, derivatives
activity in the U.S. banking system continues to be dominated by a small group of large financial
institutions. Four large commercial banks represent 93% of the total banking industry notional
amounts and 81% of industry net current credit exposure.1236
This concentration to a large extent appears to reflect the fact that those larger entities are
well-capitalized and therefore possess competitive advantages in engaging in OTC securitybased swap dealing activities by providing potential counterparties with adequate assurances of

1234	

Id. at Table 3c. The analysis of this transaction data is imperfect as a tool for identifying dealing activity,
given that the presence or absence of dealing activity ultimately turns upon the relevant facts and
circumstances of an entity’s security-based swap transactions, as informed by the dealer-trader distinction.
Criteria based on the number of an entity’s counterparties that are not recognized as dealers nonetheless
appear to be useful for identifying apparent dealing activity in the absence of full analysis of the relevant
facts and circumstances, given that engaging in security-based swap transactions with non-dealers would be
consistent with the conduct of seeking to profit by providing liquidity to others, as anticipated by the
dealer-trader distinction. See Further Definition of “Swap Dealer,” “Security-Based Swap Dealer,” “Major
Swap Participant,” “Major Security-Based Swap Participant” and “Eligible Contract Participant”, 77 FR at
30599 (discussing the dealer-trader distinction).

financial performance.1237 Also, the high barriers to entry indicate that only a limited number of
entities conduct business in this space.
Other than OTC derivatives dealers, which are subject to significant limitations on their
activities, broker-dealers historically have not participated in a significant way in security-based
swap trading for at least two reasons. First, because the Exchange Act has not previously
defined security-based swaps as “securities,” they have not been required to be traded through
registered broker-dealers.1238 And second, a broker-dealer engaging in security-based swap
activities is currently subject to existing regulatory requirements, including capital, margin,
segregation, recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities count requirements.
Specifically, the existing broker-dealer capital requirements make it relatively costly to conduct
these activities in broker-dealers.1239 Instead of occurring at broker-dealers, security-based swap
activities are currently mostly concentrated in entities that are affiliated with broker-dealers, but
not in broker-dealers themselves.1240
End users enter into OTC derivatives transactions to take investment positions or to
hedge commercial and financial risk. These non-dealer end users of OTC derivatives are, for
example, commercial companies, governmental entities, financial institutions, and investment
vehicles.1241 Available data suggests that the largest end users of credit default swaps are, in

counterparties seek to reduce risk of default by engaging in credit derivative transactions with wellcapitalized firms). See also Further Definition of “Swap Dealer,” “Security-Based Swap Dealer,” “Major

descending order, hedge funds, asset managers, and banks, which may have a commercial need
to hedge their credit exposures against a wide variety of entities or may take an active view on
credit risk.1242 Based on the available data, the Commission further estimates that these end
users currently participate in the security-based swap markets on a very limited basis.1243
Finally, this baseline will be further discussed in the applicable sections of the release below.
Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment about its preliminary estimates of the scale
and composition of the OTC derivatives market, including the relative size of the security-based
swap segment of that market. The Commission also requests comment on the Commission’s
understanding of which entities are engaged in the OTC derivatives market, as well as the
business practices of broker-dealer, bank, and stand-alone SBSDs and MSBSPs currently
engaged in the OTC derivatives markets. In addition, the Commission requests that commenters
provide data and sources of data to quantify:
1.	 The average daily and annual volume of OTC derivatives transactions;
2.	 The volume of transactions in each class of OTC derivatives (e.g., interest rate swaps,
index credit default swaps, single-name credit default swaps, currency swaps,
commodity swaps, and equity-based swaps);
3.	 The total notional amount of all pending swap transactions;
4.	 The total gross exposure of all pending swap transactions;
5.	 The total notional amount of all pending security-based swap transactions;

OTC Derivatives Market Participants and Broker-Dealers

The Commission has not promulgated final registration rules for SBSDs and MSBSPs.
Therefore, there are no entities currently registered as SBSDs or MSBSPs. As discussed above,
the Commission anticipates that certain entities (stand-alone firms, banks, and registered brokerdealers) may register as SBSDs or MSBSPs, but the number and type of these registrants is
uncertain. Below, the Commission has summarized the current recordkeeping practices of these
entities, although as noted below, the Commission does not have information regarding the
practices of some of these entities. The Commission also has provided below an overview of the
entities registered with the Commission as broker-dealers.

289 


a.

Stand-Alone SBSDs and Stand-Alone MSBSPs

Currently, there are firms that are neither banks nor broker-dealers that participate in the
market for security-based swaps. For these firms, the economic baseline would be the reports
and records these firms currently generate in the ordinary course of their business. The
Commission believes that firms engaged in the security-based swap market would produce
financial reports that are included in the financial reports it is proposing, such as a balance sheet
and an income statement quarterly and at year end, as a part of ordinary prudent business
practices. Such firms may not, however, produce annual audited financial statements. The
Commission also believes that firms engaged in the security-based swap business would need, as
a matter of prudent business practice, to maintain records documenting the firm’s derivatives
positions. Further, the Commission would expect that these firms would maintain these records
for the duration they held a given position and for some period of time thereafter. However, the
Commission does not believe that these firms would necessarily have any regulatory reporting
activities. In sum, the baseline for nonbank and non-broker-dealer firms would be the
recordkeeping, record retention, and financial reporting activities (if any) those firms currently
undertake. Given that the Commission has not previously regulated these firms, the Commission
does not have information regarding the recordkeeping and reporting costs these nonbank and
non-broker-dealer firms would presently incur in the ordinary course of business. Moreover,
while the Commission has estimated the current costs of recordkeeping and reporting for brokerdealer and banks below, the Commission does not believe these nonbank and non-broker-dealer
firms are currently subject to analogous recordkeeping and reporting requirements. As noted
above, the Commission believes that these firms would, however, as a matter of routine business
practice maintain some records documenting their business activities. Any new costs imposed
by the proposed rules would be incremental to costs currently being incurred by these entities. In
290 


order to help the Commission assess the costs associated with the proposed recordkeeping and
reporting requirements, and the extent to which the proposed recordkeeping and reporting rules
add costs above those already incurred by these firms in the ordinary course of business, the
Commission requests comment. Specific cost estimates would be particularly helpful to the
Commission’s analysis.
b. 	

Bank Security-Based Swap Dealers and Bank Major SecurityBased Swap Participants

Banks are already subject to recordkeeping and retention requirements by the prudential
regulators.1244 In addition, banks must file financial statements and supporting schedules known
as “call reports” with their prudential regulator.1245 The Commission believes that the most
common form of call report for a bank that would register as an SBSD or MSBSP is FFIEC
Form 031.1246 Like the FOCUS Report, FFIEC Form 031 elicits financial and operational
information about a bank, which is entered into uniquely numbered line items. A bank must
report detail about its assets, liabilities, and equity capital on Schedule RC to FFIEC Form
031.1247 A bank must report detail about its regulatory capital on Schedule RC-R to FFIEC Form
031.1248 The information elicited on Schedule RC-R is designed to facilitate an analysis of the

1244	

See, e.g., 12 CFR 12.3 (Department of Treasury); 12 CFR 219.21 et seq. (FDIC); 12 CFR 344.4 (FDIC).

1245	

See 12 U.S.C. 324; 12 U.S.C. 1817; 12 U.S.C. 161; 12 U.S.C. 1464.

1246	

FFIEC Form 031 is filed by banks with domestic and foreign offices, which the Commission believes will
characterize most bank SBSDs.

1247	

See FFIEC Form 031, Schedule RC, Balance Sheet, Lines 1–29. Schedule RC also has a “Memoranda”
section that which elicits information about bank’s external auditors and fiscal year end date. See FFIEC
Form 031, Schedule RC, Balance Sheet, Memoranda, Lines 1–2.

1248	

See FFIEC Form 031, Schedule RC-R, Regulatory Capital, Lines 1–62. Schedule RC-R also has a

bank’s regulatory capital. A bank must report detail about its income (loss) and expenses on
Schedule RI to FFIEC Form 031.1249
The Commission has estimated the cost of the existing recordkeeping, record retention,
reporting, and notification requirements that are applicable to nationally chartered banks under
existing regulations issued by the OCC. The Commission arrived at the estimate by examining
the universe of existing PRA collections to which national banks are subject and selecting those
collections which represent regulations that are analogous to the recordkeeping, record retention,
reporting, and notification rules the Commission is proposing herein.1250 The Commission then
estimated that reporting burdens generate approximately $79/hour of cost for national banks and
that recordkeeping burdens generate approximately $30/hour of cost for national banks.1251 The
Commission estimates that national banks currently incur $54,120,368 of costs to comply with
the OCC’s financial reporting, notification and recordkeeping rules.1252 The OCC’s rules

1249	

See FFIEC Form 031, Schedule RI, Income Statement, Lines 1–14. Schedule RI also has a “Memoranda”
section that elicits further detail about income (loss). See FFIEC Form 031, Schedule RI, Income
Statement, Memoranda, Lines 1–14.

1250	

PRA collections for OCC-regulated national banks, together with PRA collections for other federal
regulatory agency rules, are available at www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain.

1251	

This assumption is derived from OCC staff’s description of the hourly costs it estimates in connection with
Paperwork Reduction Act burdens. For the purposes of this Economic Analysis, the Commission assumes
that reporting burdens will be performed 5% by clerical staff at $20 an hour, 10% by managerial or
technical staff at $40 an hour, 55% by senior management at $80 an hour, and 30% by legal counsel at
$100 an hour, which, in the aggregate, equals $79 an hour. The Commission assumes that recordkeeping
burdens will be performed 70% by clerical staff at $20 an hour, 20% by managerial or technical staff at $40
an hour, and 10% by senior management at $80 an hour, which in the aggregate, equals $30 an hour.

1252	

The Commission derived the estimates of the hourly burden associated with these OCC rules from the
number of hours approved for information collection purposes by the Office of Management and Budget.
See the chart below for a representation of the calculation methodology:

generally relate to banking activities, not securities and security-based swap activities. The
Commission thus recognizes that some of the costs reflected in the OCC’s rules may not be
analogous to costs that may be imposed by the Commission’s proposed rules. Nonetheless, these
cost estimates may help provide context and cost ranges with respect to the nationally chartered
banks impacted by the Commission’s proposed rules.
c.

Entities Registered as Broker-Dealers

As of April 1, 2013, there were 4,545 broker-dealers registered with the Commission.
The broker-dealers registered with the Commission vary significantly in terms of their size,
business activities, and the complexity of their operations.1253 The Commission has previously
estimated that as of December 31, 2011, nine broker-dealers dominate the broker-dealer industry,
holding over half of all capital held by broker-dealers.1254 However, other than OTC derivatives

i. 	

Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4

The Commission is proposing amendments to Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 to establish
additional recordkeeping requirements for broker-dealer SBSDs, broker-dealer MSBSPs,1256 and
broker-dealers that conduct security-based swap activities but are not registered as SBSDs.1257
The baseline for this economic analysis with respect to the proposed amendments to Rules 17a-3
and 17a-4 is the broker-dealer recordkeeping regime as it exists today.
Under current Rule 17a-3, broker-dealers must make and keep certain books and
records.1258 The Commission estimates that current Rule 17a-3 imposes $191,858,085 of annual
costs on broker-dealers.1259 Current Rule 17a-4 requires that firms preserve the records made
and kept under Rule 17a-3, as well as additional records, including written agreements,
communications relating to its business as such, and records reflecting inputs into the FOCUS
Report. The rule also establishes retention periods for all records required to be made under
Rule 17a-3 and required to be preserved under Rule 17a-4, along with storage media
requirements for those firms that preserve records electronically. The Commission estimates that

1256	

See section II.A.2. of this release.

1257	

The proposed amendments to the recordkeeping and reporting rules would apply to all broker-dealers that
conduct security-based swap activities. The de minimis exception provided in Exchange Act Rule 3a71-2
applies solely to registration as an SBSD. See 17 CFR 240.3a71-2(a)(1) .

(2,449,755 hours x $63/hour national hourly rate for a compliance clerk) + $37,523,520 in external costs =
$191,858,085. See supra section IV.D.1. (PRA estimate of the total initial and annual recordkeeping and
reporting burden for current Rule 17a-3).

294 


current Rule 17a-4 imposes $95,454,090 of annual costs on broker-dealers.1260
ii.

R
	 ule 17a-5

The existing broker-dealer financial reporting requirements appear in Rule 17a-5. The
baseline for this economic analysis with respect to the proposed amendments to Rules 17a-5 is
the broker-dealer financial reporting requirements as they exist today (as recently amended).
The Commission estimates that current Rule 17a-5 imposes $210,776,086 of annual costs on
broker-dealers.1261
Rule 17a-5, as recently amended, has two main elements: (1) broker-dealers must file
periodic unaudited reports containing information about their financial and operational condition
on a FOCUS Report; and (2) broker-dealers must annually file financial statements and certain
reports and a report covering the financial statements and reports prepared by an independent
public accountant registered with the PCAOB in accordance with PCAOB standards.1262 In
addition to these two main elements, a few other aspects of Rule 17a-5 are described below.
a.

Periodic Reports

Broker-dealers periodically report information about their financial and operational
condition on the FOCUS Report Part II, Part IIA, Part IIB, or Part II CSE. Each version of the
report is designed for a particular type of broker-dealer and the information to be reported is
tailored to the type of broker-dealer. Specifically: (1) a broker-dealer that does not hold
customer funds or securities completes and files the FOCUS Report Part IIA; (2) a broker-dealer
that holds customer funds or securities completes and files the FOCUS Report Part II; (3) an
1260	

(1,154,430 hours x $63/hour national hourly rate for a compliance clerk) + $22,725,000 in external costs =
$95,454,090. See supra section IV.D.2. (PRA estimate of the total initial and annual recordkeeping and
reporting burden for current Rule 17a-4).

1261	

(734,294 hours x $269/hour national hourly rate for a compliance manager) + $13,251,000 in external costs
= $210,776,086. See supra section IV.D.3. (PRA estimate of the total initial and annual recordkeeping and
reporting burden for current Rule 17a-5).

Id. These requirements are described in more detail below.

295 


OTC derivatives dealer completes and files the FOCUS Report Part IIB; and (4) an ANC brokerdealer completes and files the FOCUS Report Part II CSE. The FOCUS Report Part II CSE
elicits the most detailed information of the four versions, including the most detail about a firm’s
derivatives activities.
b. 	

Annual Audited Reports and Related
Notifications

Under the recently adopted amendments to Rule 17a-5, a broker-dealer is required to,
among other things, annually file reports with the Commission that are audited by a PCAOBregistered independent public accountant, disclose certain financial information to customers,
notify the Commission of a change of accountant, and notify the Commission of its DEA’s
approval of a change in its fiscal year.1263 The recent rule amendments also require the
independent public accountant to notify the broker-dealer if the accountant discovers an instance
of non-compliance with certain broker-dealer rules or determines that any material weakness
exists.1264
c.

Customer Statements

Paragraph (c) of Rule 17a-5 requires, among other things, that certain broker-dealers
annually send their customers audited and unaudited statements regarding their financial
condition. A broker-dealer is exempt from sending the statement of financial condition to
customers if the broker-dealer, among other things: (1) sends its customers semi-annual
statements relating to the firm’s net capital and, if applicable, the identification of any material
weaknesses; and (2) makes the statement of financial condition described above available on the

1263	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d), (g), and (n)(1). Paragraph (n)(2) of Rule 17a-5 requires that the notice contain a
detailed explanation for the reasons for the change and requires that changes in the filing period for the
annual reports be approved in writing by the broker-dealer’s DEA.1263

reports with the Commission.1266 The reports contain information related to the ANC brokerdealer’s use of internal models to calculate market and credit risk charges when computing net
capital.1267
iii.

Rule 17a-11

The existing broker-dealer notice requirements are contained in Rule 17a-11. The
baseline for this economic analysis with respect to the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-11 is
the broker-dealer notification requirements as they exist today. Rule 17a-11 specifies the
circumstances under which a broker-dealer must notify the Commission and other securities
regulators about its financial or operational condition, as well as the form that the notice must
take.1268 The Commission estimates that current Rule 17a-11 imposes $119,167 of annual costs
on broker-dealers in the aggregate.1269
a.

Failure to Meet Minimum Capital Requirements

Paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-11 requires a broker-dealer to notify the Commission if the
firm’s net capital or, if applicable, tentative net capital declines below the minimum amount

required under Rule 15c3-1.1270 Paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17a-11 requires an OTC derivatives
dealer or an ANC broker-dealer to also notify the Commission when its tentative net capital falls
below the minimum required for these types of broker-dealers.1271
b. 	

Early Warning of Potential Capital or Model
Problem

Paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17a-11 requires an OTC derivatives dealer or an ANC brokerdealer to also notify the Commission when its tentative net capital falls below the minimum
required for these types of broker-dealers.1272 Paragraph (c) of Rule 17a-11 specifies four events
that, if they occur, trigger a requirement that a broker-dealer send notice promptly (but within
twenty-four hours) to the Commission.1273 These notices are designed to provide the
Commission with “early warning” that the broker-dealer may experience financial difficulty.1274
The events triggering the early warning notification requirements are:
	 The computation of a broker-dealer subject to the aggregate indebtedness standard of
Rule 15c3-1 shows that the firm’s aggregate indebtedness is in excess of 1,200% of its
net capital;1275
	 The computation of a broker-dealer which has elected to use the alternative standard of
calculating net capital under Rule 15c3-1 shows that the firm’s net capital is less than 5%
of aggregate debit items computed in accordance with Appendix A of Rule 15c3-3;1276

1270

13, 1993).

1275	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(c)(1). As discussed above, for certain types of broker-dealers, the minimum net
capital requirement is the greater of a fixed-dollar amount specified in the rule and an amount determined
by applying a 15-to-1 aggregate indebtedness to net capital ratio. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(1)(i).
Consequently, requiring notification when a broker-dealer has a 12-to-1 aggregate indebtedness to net
capital ratio provides notice before the firm reaches the minimum 15-to-1 requirement.

1276	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(c)(2). As discussed above, for certain types of broker-dealers, the minimum net
capital requirement is the greater of a fixed-dollar amount specified in the rule and an amount determined
by applying a 2% of aggregate debit items ratio. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(1)(ii). Consequently,

298 


	 A broker-dealer’s net capital computation shows that its total net capital is less than
120% of its required minimum level of net capital or of its required minimum level of
tentative net capital, in the case of an OTC derivatives dealer;1277
	 With respect to an OTC derivatives dealer, the occurrence of the fourth and each
subsequent backtesting exception under Appendix F of Rule 15c3-1 during any 250
business day measurement period.1278
c. 	

Failure to Make and Keep Current Books and
Records

Paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-11 requires a broker-dealer that fails to make and keep current
the books and records required under Rule 17a-3 to notify the Commission of this fact on the
same day that the failure arises.1279 The notice must specify the books and records which have
not been made or which are not current.1280 A broker-dealer is required to report to the
Commission within 48 hours of the original notice what the broker or dealer has done or is doing
to correct the situation.1281
d.

Material Weakness

Paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-11 requires a broker-dealer to provide notification about a
material weakness as that term is defined in Rule 17a-5.1282 Specifically, paragraph (e) provides
that, whenever a broker-dealer discovers or is notified by an independent public accountant of a
material weakness as defined in Rule 17a-5, the broker-dealer must: (1) give notice to the
Commission within twenty-four hours of the discovery or notification of the material weakness;

requiring notification when a broker-dealer has net capital equal to 5% of aggregate debit items provides
notice before the firm reaches the 2% minimum requirement.

ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAM AND ALTERNATIVES
1. 	

Overview – The Proposed Recordkeeping, Reporting, Notification,
and Securities Count Program

Generally, the proposed recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities count
requirements are intended to update the recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities
count requirements for broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer
MSBSPs, to account for their security-based swap activities. The proposal is also intended to
establish recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements for SBSDs and MSBSPs that
are not registered as broker-dealers as well as a securities count requirement for stand-alone
SBSDs. The recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities count rules being proposed are
based upon the comprehensive system of recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities
count rules applicable to broker-dealers, as proposed to be modified to capture and document the
security-based swap activities of broker-dealers, SBSDs, and MSBSPs. The recordkeeping,
reporting, notification, and securities count rules and rule amendments being proposed today

1283	

See 17 CFR 240.17a-11(e)(1) and (2). See also Broker-Dealer Reports, 78 FR at 51939 (discussing
amendment of material weakness standard in Rule 17a-5). As discussed above in section II.B.3.a. of this
release, the Commission is proposing to use the concept of material weakness in proposed Rule 18a-7.

represent the manner in which SBSDs and MSBSPs will document, report, and retain evidence
of their compliance with, among other things, the previously proposed capital, margin, and
segregation rules. The Commission believes that these rules, by their nature, will have a more
limited economic impact as compared to the Commission’s capital, margin, and segregation
proposals.1285
In proposing these requirements, the Commission is considering both the potential
benefits of improving the oversight, transparency, risk documentation and management of
security-based swap activities, and the potential costs to firms, the financial markets, and the
U.S. financial system if broker-dealers, SBSDs, and MSBSPs are required to comply with the
proposed rules.
The Commission notes that there are certain instances when it is difficult to quantify the
potential benefits and costs of the proposed rules. For example, firms that choose to register in
some capacity as an SBSD or MSBSP may not currently be subject to Commission, CFTC, or
prudential regulation. For these firms, the Commission is not certain of such firms’ current
recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities count practices with respect to their
security-based swap activities and thus it is difficult to reliably gauge the economic effect of the
proposed rules and rules amendments on these firms. With regard to other classes of regulated
entities, the Commission staff’s experience with broker-dealers under the existing recordkeeping,
reporting, notification, and securities count rules gives it a better understanding of the
compliance-related costs (such as those related to retaining attorneys, accountants, and other

1285

See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major SecurityBased Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR 70213.

301 


professionals) and in such cases the Commission has prepared below a summary of its
preliminary estimate of those costs.1286
As discussed in section II. of the release, the current broker-dealer recordkeeping,
reporting, notification, and securities count requirements serve as the template for the proposals
for several reasons. The financial markets in which SBSDs and MSBSPs are expected to operate
are similar to the financial markets in which broker-dealers operate in that they are driven in
significant part by dealers that buy and sell on a regular basis and that take principal risk. The
Commission believes it should take a similar regulatory approach for similar markets.
The Commission also believes that in order to prevent regulatory arbitrage, and to help
ensure appropriate accountability and oversight, security-based swap activity should be regulated
in a similar manner irrespective of whether it is conducted by, for example, a broker-dealer or
stand-alone SBSD. The proposals applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs
seek to regulate these firms’ security-based swap activity consistent with the regulation of
security-based swap activities conducted at broker-dealers, while reflecting the business model
of such entities.1287 The Commission is seeking to provide all security-based swap activity,
irrespective of the entity within which such activity is conducted, a level regulatory playing field
while being cognizant of the fact that firms with a more limited business should also be subject
to an appropriately circumscribed set of regulations.
Moreover, the rules ultimately adopted, in conjunction with other requirements
established under the Dodd-Frank Act, could have a substantial impact on international

1286

See infra section V.E.

1287

In this regard, the Commission notes the proposal excludes a number of recordkeeping requirements for
bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs. As discussed above in section I. of this release, section 15F(f)(1)(B) of
the Exchange Act requires such institutions to keep only those books and records of all activities related to
the conduct of business as an SBSD or MSBSP.

302 


commerce and the relative competitive position of intermediaries operating in various, or
multiple, jurisdictions. In particular, intermediaries operating in the U.S. and in other
jurisdictions could be advantaged or disadvantaged if corresponding requirements are not
established in other jurisdictions or if the Commission’s rules are substantially more or less
stringent than corresponding requirements in other jurisdictions. This could, among other
potential impacts, affect the propensity of intermediaries and other market participants based in
the U.S. to participate in non-U.S. markets and the propensity of non-U.S.-based intermediaries
and other market participants to participate in U.S. markets. Accordingly, substantial differences
between the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in the costs of complying with the requirements
established under the Dodd-Frank Act, including the reporting, recordkeeping, notification, and
security count requirements for security-based swaps between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions,
could have international implications.1288
The Commission also preliminarily believes that there are cost and compliance benefits
to be realized by utilizing an existing, well-known set of rules as a starting point. The
Commission notes that the broker-dealer recordkeeping, notification, securities count, and
reporting requirements have existed for many years and have facilitated the accountability and
oversight of broker-dealers. From the perspective of trying to minimize regulatory costs and
compliance concerns, the Commission would expect that broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer
MSBSPs would already be familiar with the structure and content of the recordkeeping and
reporting requirements. The Commission believes that these compliance and cost benefits could
be realized even by firms that are not currently registered as broker-dealers given that some of

1288

See Cross-Border Security-Based Swap Activities; Re-Proposal of Regulation SBSR and Certain Rules and
Forms Relating to Registration of Security-Based Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants, 78
FR at 31034.

303 


the new registrants would likely be part of larger financial firms that have a broker-dealer
affiliate, thus providing a source of in-house experience with the Commission’s broker-dealer
rules. Even for those firms that have no source of such in-house expertise, the Commission
expects that starting with the existing broker-dealer rules should require less expenditure than if
the Commission created entirely new rules given that outside expertise with the current brokerdealer rules is readily available. Notwithstanding this belief, the Commission acknowledges that
its proposals would likely still require new expenditures for these firms. In order to aid its
analysis, the Commission requests comment on the use of the existing broker-dealer rules as a
model. The Commission also requests comment on whether there are other existing rule sets that
would be more appropriate.
In determining appropriate recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities count
requirements, the Commission assesses and considers a number of different costs and benefits,
and the determinations it ultimately makes can have a variety of economic consequences for the
relevant firms, markets, and the financial system as a whole. The recordkeeping, reporting,
notification, and securities count requirements in particular are broadly intended to facilitate
effective oversight and improve internal risk management via requiring robust internal
procedures for creating and retaining records central to the conduct of business as an SBSD or
MSBSP. Requiring registered firms to comply with recordkeeping and reporting rules should
help ensure more effective regulatory oversight. The proposed rules would help the Commission
determine whether an SBSD or MSBSP is operating in compliance with the Exchange Act and
the rules thereunder.
The Commission also believes that the proposed rules could promote technology
improvements. Those SBSDs and MSBSPs that do not have the technology to store and

304 


maintain the information required by the proposed rules will need to invest in technology. The
technology improvements could help SBSDs and MSBSPs, particularly those that conducted the
security-based swap business outside of any regulated entity, more effectively track their trading
and risk exposure in security-based swaps. To the extent that these firms can better track their
risk, this should help them better manage risk.
The Commission also believes that the required annual audit of nonbank SBSDs’ and
nonbank MSBSPs’ financial statements and the public availability of firms’ Statement of
Financial Condition would permit customers and counterparties to have access to financial
information that would permit them to better assess the financial condition of the firm. While it
is difficult to quantify the current level of market confidence in the security-based swap
marketplace, the Commission staff’s experience is that market participants’ willingness to
engage in activities increases when such participants are better able to understand the financial
condition of other market participants and counterparties.
The Commission also recognizes that there will be costs associated with the proposal.
Those costs include the costs of complying with the proposed rules, one-time and ongoing
financial reporting costs, and costs associated with ongoing record maintenance.
2. 	

Alternatives to the Proposed Recordkeeping, Reporting, Notification,
and Securities Count Rules

The Commission recognizes that there may be other appropriate approaches to
establishing recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements. In the course of preparing
and considering the rules it is proposing today, Commission staff reviewed and analyzed
analogous rule sets utilized by the Commission’s fellow federal regulators, with a view towards
determining whether there may be other practicable alternatives. In a number of instances,

305 


Commission staff also consulted with staff from its fellow regulators regarding the proposals
herein.
The Commission believes the proposals herein are broadly consistent with the approach
taken by the CFTC. The CFTC’s proposed and ultimately final rules were modeled on an
existing set of the rules.1289 For existing broker-dealers and firms affiliated with existing brokerdealers, the Commission believes that starting with an existing and known set of rules offers
practical benefits for both the regulator and the regulated entities, as compared with starting with
a wholly new set of rules. The Commission acknowledges that the benefits of this approach
would be much more limited for firms such as stand-alone entities that are not currently brokerdealers and are not affiliated with broker-dealers.
Although it is not possible to precisely compare rule sets across agencies, the
Commission believes that the recordkeeping rules it is proposing are similar to those of the
CFTC in terms of their level of prescriptiveness. For example, paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 17a-3
sets forth the requirement that a broker-dealer make and keep current a trade blotter. The
Commission is also proposing very similar provisions in paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of
proposed Rule 18a-5, designed to apply, respectively, to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone
MSBSPs, as well as bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs. Paragraph (a)(2) of the corresponding
CFTC rule, Rule 202 (“Daily Trading Records”), prescribes that swap dealers and major swap
participants shall make and keep trade execution records that are very similar.1290

1289

See Swap Dealer and Major Swap Participant Recordkeeping, Reporting, and Duties Rules; Futures
Commission Merchant and Introducing Broker Conflicts of Interest Rules; and Chief Compliance Officer
Rules for Swap Dealers, Major Swap Participants, and Futures Commission Merchants, 77 FR at 20171
(stating swap dealer and major swap participant rules are modeled on existing rules as well as those of the
Commission).

1290

See 17 CFR 23.202(a)(2).

306 


In considering whether there were other practicable regulatory alternatives, the
Commission also examined rules of the prudential regulators. For example, the OCC has rules
governing recordkeeping and confirmation requirements for securities transactions effected by
national banks.1291 Paragraph (a)(1) of the OCC rule governing the record that a national bank
effecting securities transactions for customers must maintain, Rule 12.3, appears broadly
consistent with paragraph (a)(6) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended, as well as with
paragraph (b)(7) of proposed Rule 18a-5.1292
The Commission considered regulatory approaches outside of those utilized by other
regulators. One alternative would be for all SBSDs and MSBSPs to keep and report the same
records and other financial reports. While technically possible and arguably simpler to
implement and administer, the Commission does not believe such a requirement would be
justified given the different capital, margin, and segregation proposals that would apply to each
participant. For example, since a stand-alone MSBSP would not be subject to a minimum net
capital requirement under the proposed capital rules that would be applicable to SBSDs and
MSBSPs (it would be subject to a positive tangible net worth standard instead),1293 it may be
unduly burdensome to require stand-alone MSBSPs to calculate and report in Form SBS the
amount of net capital it holds. Hence, while the Commission considered such a simpler
approach, the Commission preliminarily believes that such an approach would be confusing and
unduly burdensome for firms required to complete and file Form SBS and would introduce

1291	

See 12 CFR 12.3.

1292	

Compare 12 CFR 12.3(a), with paragraph (a)(6) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended, and paragraph
(b)(7) of proposed Rule 18a-5.

See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major SecurityBased Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR 70213.

307 


significant compliance challenges beyond those imposed by the proposed rules and rule
amendments.
Another alternative to the rules the Commission is proposing would be rules that are less
prescriptive. Under such rules, detailed record production and retention requirements could be
replaced by more general references to the types of information the firm needs to document and
retain for examination purposes. This approach could promote a consistent view and
management of recordkeeping and reporting obligations within a large financial firm that has
numerous subsidiaries. This approach would also have the advantage of likely being less costly,
as the firm would be more able to conform its existing recordkeeping practices at the parent and
the subsidiaries. While this approach has its benefits, the financial markets and transactions in
which SBSDs and MSBSPs are expected to operate and engage in, respectively, are similar to
the financial markets and transactions in which broker-dealers operate, and the Commission
preliminarily believes these similarities argue for a consistent regulatory approach.1294 In
addition, as discussed above, the objectives of these broker-dealer requirements are similar to the
objectives underlying the proposals regarding securities-based swaps.1295 Notwithstanding its
preliminary analysis of the issue, the Commission requests comment on whether there are
existing alternative rule sets that could provide such a model, and the appropriateness of those
alternatives relative to what the Commission has proposed.
The Commission has also considered alternatives to the financial reporting rules being
proposed. For example, with respect to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs, one alternative would

1294

See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major SecurityBased Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70216 (stating a similar
rationale for basing the proposed capital, margin, and segregation requirements for SBSDs on the brokerdealer capital, margin, and segregation requirements).

1295

See supra section I.

308 


be to permit these firms to use the existing financial reports made with their respective prudential
regulators. This approach would allow the firms to avoid creating and filing an additional
financial report with the Commission, and would likely result in fewer compliance-related costs.
The Commission is aware of the burdens and costs associated with preparing an
additional regulatory submission such as Form SBS, but the proposal is designed to ameliorate
those burdens. Thus, while proposed Form SBS seeks specific transaction and position data
regarding bank SBSDs’ and bank MSBSPs’ security-based swap activities, the other required
financial data in Form SBS for bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs come directly from the filings
these firms currently make with their respective prudential regulators.1296 The Commission
invites comment on whether there are other ways of obtaining information regarding bank
SBSDs’ and bank MSBSPs’ security-based swaps transactions and positions that would be less
costly or burdensome and that would also facilitate Commission oversight of the transactions,
positions, and financial condition of these firms.
The Commission has also considered alternative financial reporting arrangements for
stand-alone SBSDs or stand-alone MSBSPs. For example, the Commission is aware that the
CFTC proposed that stand-alone swap dealers and stand-alone major swap participants be
required to submit monthly unaudited financial statements within 17 business days of the end of
the month, as well as GAAP financial statements within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year.1297
The CFTC did not prescribe any additional forms such as what the Commission is proposing
with Form SBS. The Commission preliminarily believes that that the information elicited by
Form SBS should assist the Commission and the firms’ DEAs to conduct effective examinations

1296	

See supra section II.B.2.b.

1297	

See Capital Requirements of Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants, 76 FR at 27813 (discussion of
proposed CFTC Regulation 23.106).

309 


of broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs. The broker-dealer SBSD and broker-dealer
MSBSP reporting requirements would promote transparency of the financial and operational
condition of the broker-dealer SBSD or broker-dealer MSBSP to the Commission and to the
public. In order to aid its analysis of whether there are other more appropriate alternatives
relative to what it has proposed, the Commission requests comment.
The Commission has also considered alternatives to the notification and securities count
proposals.1298 An alternative to the proposed notification proposal would be to not have such a
rule, or to have fewer events give rise to notification. Similarly, with respect to the quarterly
securities count proposal, the Commission believes the alternative would be to specify a less
frequent count or to omit a requirement for securities count.
The Commission has proposed the notification and securities count proposals because it
preliminarily believes that the rules are an appropriate component of its oversight of the financial
responsibility of firms engaged in a security-based swap business. The broker-dealer
recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and security count requirements are part of the brokerdealer financial responsibility rules.1299 The financial responsibility rules are designed to work
together to establish a comprehensive regulatory program designed to promote the prudent
operation of broker-dealers and the safeguarding of customer securities and funds held by
broker-dealers. In this regard, the notification and securities count proposals (in conjunction
with the recordkeeping and reporting proposals) are designed to promote compliance with the
capital, margin, and segregation requirements for broker-dealers. The proposed recordkeeping,
reporting, notification, and securities count requirements applicable to SBSDs and MSBSPs
along with the proposed capital, margin, and segregation requirements for these registrants, are
1298

See supra section II.D.1. (summarizing rationale underlying Rule 17a-13).

1299

See 17 CFR 240.3a40-1.

310 


designed to establish a comprehensive financial responsibility program for SBSDs and
MSBSPs. Like the broker-dealer rules, the proposed recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and
securities count requirements applicable to SBSDs and MSBSPs are designed to promote
compliance with the proposed capital, margin, and segregation requirements applicable to
SBSDs and MSBSPs. Omitting such proposals would create regulatory disparities between
broker-dealers, banks, and stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs. For these reasons, the
Commission preliminarily believes that alternative approaches would not be as effective in
helping to ensure compliance with the proposed capital, margin, and segregation requirements
applicable to SBSDs and MSBSPs. However, in order to assist its analysis of the proposed
notification and securities count proposals, as well whether there are more appropriate
alternatives, the Commission requests comment.
3. 	

Requirements to Make and Keep Records
a.

Rule 17a-3, as Proposed to be Amended

Rule 17a-3 is proposed to be amended to account for security-based swap activities of
broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs.1300 The Commission
is also proposing to add new provisions to Rule 17a-3 that would relate to its recently proposed
capital, margin, and segregation requirements applicable to SBSDs and MSBSPs.1301
In addition, as discussed above, the Commission has proposed amendments to Rule
15c3-1 that would establish liquidity stress test requirements for ANC broker-dealers.1302 The
1300	

See, e.g., paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended (proposed addition of information that
must be included in security-based swap purchase and sale blotters).

See paragraph (f) of Rule 15c3-1, as proposed to be amended. See also Capital, Margin, and Segregation
Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital
Requirements for Broker-Dealers, 77 FR at 70252–70254.

311 


Commission is proposing to amend Rule 17a-3 to include a requirement that ANC broker-dealers
make and keep current a report of the results of the monthly liquidity stress test, a record of the
assumptions underlying the liquidity stress test, and the liquidity funding plan required under the
proposed amendments to Rule 15c3-1.1303
The Commission would also add new provisions to Rule 17a-3 that are designed to create
a record of the broker-dealer’s compliance with business conduct standards that the Commission
proposed pursuant to Exchange Act section 15F(h), and with the designated compliance officer
requirement in Exchange Act section 15F(k) and Rule 15Fk-1.1304
The Commission is also proposing some changes that are designed to eliminate obsolete
or rarely used provisions of Rule 17a-3.1305 For example, the Commission is proposing to
remove references in the rule to “members,” as a distinct class of registrant in addition to brokers
and dealers.1306 These references are redundant because the rule applies to brokers and dealers,
which would include “members” of a national securities exchange since all such members are
also broker-dealers.
Generally, the Commission would not expect the proposed changes to Rule 17a-3 to have
a material economic effect, although as analyzed below the Commission does expect that there
will be costs related to complying with the proposed rules.1307 In order to assist its analysis the
Commission generally requests comment about the general costs and benefits of the proposed

1303

See paragraph (a)(24) of Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be amended.

rules. The Commission requests data to assess the costs and benefits of the proposals described
above.
b.

Proposed Rule 18a-5

The Commission is proposing new Rule 18a-5 – which is modeled on Rule 17a-3, as
proposed to be amended – to require stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs,
and bank MSBSPs to make and keep current certain records.1308 Not all of the provisions of
Rule 17a-3 would be imported into proposed Rule 18a-5 because some of Rule 17a-3’s
provisions relate to activities that are not expected or permitted of stand-alone SBSDs and
stand-alone MSBSPs. Further, and as described above,1309 the proposed requirements for bank
SBSDs and bank MSBSPs, which would be included in paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-5,
are more limited than the proposed requirements that would apply to stand-alone SBSDs and
stand-alone MSBSPs, which would be included in paragraph (a) of proposed Rule 18a-5. More
limited requirements would apply to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs because the Commission’s
authority under section 15F(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act is tied to activities related to their
business as an SBSD or MSBSP,1310 banks are already subject to the existing recordkeeping
requirements from prudential regulators, and the prudential regulators are responsible for capital,
margin, and other prudential requirements applicable to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs.
The Commission believes proposed Rule 18a-5 would provide improved regulatory
oversight of the security-based swap activities of stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank
SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs. For reasons discussed above, the Commission preliminarily
believes that the approach it has taken with respect to Rule 18a-5 – basing it upon an existing
1308

See supra section II.A.2.a. (describing proposed Rule 18a-5).

1309

Id.

1310

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(f)(1)(B)(i).

313 


rule (Rule 17a-3) – is a better approach than starting with a wholly new rule. The Commission
believes that many non-broker-dealer SBSDs and non-broker-dealer MSBSPs will be affiliates of
broker-dealers that already have familiarity with Rule 17a-3 upon which proposed Rule 18a-5 is
modeled. Greater familiarity with the rule should ease compliance burdens and costs for those
firms. The Commission acknowledges that with respect to firms not so affiliated, this approach
would seem much less likely to ease compliance burdens. In order to aid the Commission’s
analysis of the effects on these unaffiliated firms, and whether there are better alternatives, the
Commission requests comment.
As discussed in section V.C.1., above, the Commission believes that the proposed
requirements to make and keep records could improve the regulatory oversight, risk
documentation, and risk management of security-based swap activities.
The proposed requirements to make and keep records could also create costs to firms.1311
These increased costs may cause firms to cease participating in the market, thereby potentially
reducing efficiency due to loss of competition. In order to inform its analysis of the costs and
benefits involved with the proposals, the Commission requests comment. Data to evaluate the
costs and benefits of proposed Rule 18a-5 would be particularly useful to the Commission’s
analysis.
c.

Request for Comment on Recordkeeping Provisions

The Commission also requests data to evaluate the impact of the proposals against the
baseline. In addition, the Commission requests comment in response to the following questions:
1.	 In general terms, would the proposed rules result in effective documentation of the
security-based swap transactions of broker-dealers, broker-dealer SBSDs, broker-dealer

1311

See infra section V.E. (discussing implementation considerations).

314 


MSBSPs, stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs?
Please explain.
2.	 In general, would the proposed rules and rule amendments impact the capital of entities
that would need to register as SBSDs or MSBSPs? For example, would the costs
involved negatively impact the availability of funding to conduct the security-based swap
activities? If so, what would be the extent of the impact to these entities?
3.	 How important is it that the recordkeeping and reporting rules for SBSDs and MSBSPs
be analogous to the existing recordkeeping and reporting requirements for brokerdealers? How valuable or worthwhile are the benefits involved with this approach? How
costly is such an approach?
4.	 To what extent would the proposed regulatory requirements impact the amount of
liquidity provided for or required by security-based swap market participants, and to what
extent will that affect the funding cost for the financial sector in particular and the
economy in general? Please quantify.
5.	 Do the proposed record-making requirements provide a reasonable and workable solution
for broker-dealers, SBSDs and MSBSPs? Please explain. Are there preferable
alternatives? If so, describe those alternatives. Please specifically address why such
alternatives are preferable and the nature to which they fulfill the Commission’s need to
ensure that the financial responsibility requirements applicable to broker-dealers, brokerdealer SBSDs, broker-dealer MSBSPs, stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank
SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs are followed.

315 


6.	 If an SBSD or MSBP currently already has sufficient technology to track its trading and
risk exposure in security-based swaps, what additional costs, if any, would arise from the
proposed rules?
4. 	

Requirements to Preserve Records

As discussed above,1312 Rule 17a-4 requires a broker-dealer to preserve certain types of
records.1313 The rule also prescribes the time periods these records and the records required to be
made and kept current under Rule 17a-3 must be preserved and the manner in which they must
be preserved.1314 The Commission is proposing amendments to Rule 17a-4 to account for the
security-based swap activities of broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and brokerdealer MSBSPs, as well as certain technical amendments. With respect to stand-alone SBSDs,
stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs, the Commission is proposing new Rule
18a-6 – modeled on Rule 17a-4, as proposed to be amended – to establish record preservation
requirements for stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs.
a.

Rule 17a-4, as Proposed to be Amended

As described above,1315 paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-4 provides that broker-dealers subject
to Rule 17a-3 must preserve for a period of not less than six years, the first two in an easily
accessible place, certain records required to be made and kept current under Rule 17a-3.

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(a) and 240.17a-5(b)(1). Generally, the three year and six year retention periods in
Rule 17a-4 track the self-regulatory organization requirements and certain State regulations that were in
effect prior to the adoption of the National Securities Market Improvements Act of 1996, and they largely
represent a codification of prudent recordkeeping practices of many broker-dealers. Books and Records

Three-Year Preservation Requirement for Rule 17a-3 Records
As discussed above,1316 paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17a-4 provides that broker-dealers must
preserve for at least three years, the first two in an easily accessible place,1317 certain records
required to be made and kept current under Rule 17a-3.1318 The Commission is proposing to add
cross-references to certain new paragraphs that would be added to Rule 17a-3 to address
security-based swap activities of broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and brokerdealer MSBSPs.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the majority of the economic effects, ranging
from firm-specific costs to effects on the overall security-based swap market, will be associated
with the requirement that broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer
MSBSPs, make and keep current certain records as set forth in Rule 17a-3, as proposed to be
amended. However, in order to assist it in considering the full range of costs and any economic
effects associated with the proposed recordkeeping rules, the Commission requests data to assess
the costs and benefits of the proposals.
Three-Year Preservation Requirement for Certain Other Records Made or Received
Paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-4 also provides that broker-dealers must preserve for a period
of not less than three years, the first two in an easily accessible place, other categories of records
if the broker-dealer makes or receives the record. 1319 As discussed above,1320 the Commission is
1316

See supra section II.A.3.a. (discussing Rule 17a-4 retention requirements).

1317

The Commission has stated that “Rule 17a-4 seeks to address the tension between the need for quick
production of specific records and the volume of records generated on a daily basis, by requiring that more
current records be retained in an “easily accessible place,” which the Commission has not defined. See
Commission Guidance to Broker-Dealers on the Use of Electronic Storage Media under the Electronic
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act of 2000 with Respect to Rule 17a-4(f), 66 FR 22916.

proposing amendments to these provisions in paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-4 to account for
security-based swaps, and is proposing amendments that would require broker-dealers, including
broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs, to preserve certain additional records related
to security-based swap activities. For example, the Commission is proposing to amend the
preservation requirement in paragraph (b)(4) of Rule 17a-4 to include “recordings of telephone
calls required to be maintained pursuant to section 15F(g)(1) of the [Exchange] Act.” The
amendment would establish a preservation period for recorded telephonic communications that
have been recorded and relate to security-based swap activity.
As discussed above in section V.C.1. of this release, the Commission believes that the
proposed amendments to Rule 17a-4 will result in benefits of improving the regulatory oversight,
risk documentation, and risk management of security-based swap activities. The Commission
anticipates that there will also be costs related to the proposal.1321 The Commission believes that
the majority of the costs incurred by broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs relating to
recorded telephone calls would enhance the internal controls and procedures relating the
treatment of security-based swap-related telephone calls recorded by the firm. The Commission
requests comment on the costs or benefits that may accrue in connection with the proposal.
b.

Proposed Rule 18a-6

As described above, Rule 18a-6 is modeled on the retention requirements of Rule 17a-4,
but modified to account for differences applicable to stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs,
bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs.1322

1321

See infra section V.E. (discussing implementation considerations). 


1322

See supra section II.A.3.a. (discussing proposed amendments to Rules 17a-4 and 18a-6). 


318 


Six-Year Preservation Requirement
The Commission proposes that many, but not all, of the same recordkeeping requirements
that would be applicable to broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs under the proposed
amendments to Rule 17a-4 would also apply to stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank
SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs under proposed Rule 18a-6.
Paragraph (a) of Rule 18a-6 would require that certain records required to be created and
maintained under Rule 18a-5 be preserved for a period of not less than six years, the first two in
an easily accessible place. Further, paragraph (a)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would apply to
stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs. Paragraph (a)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would
apply to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs.
Three-Year Preservation Requirement for Other Rule 18a-5 Records
As discussed above,1323 paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed Rule 18a-5 would require
stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs to make and keep
current records that are modeled on the records required to be made and kept under Rule 17a-3.
Paragraph (b)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would require that records required to be made by
stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs under Rule 18a-5, be retained for three years, the
first two years in an easily accessible place. Paragraph (b)(2) of proposed Rule 18a-6 would
establish a three-year record retention period for certain delineated records, as well as the records
required to be made by bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs under Rule 18a-5.
Three-Year Preservation Requirement for Certain Other Records Made or Received

The Commission is also proposing in paragraph (b) of Rule 18a-6 that stand-alone 

SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs must preserve for a period of not 


1323

See supra section II.A.2.a. (discussing paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed Rule 18a-5).

319 


less than three years, the first two years in an easily accessible place, other categories of records
if the SBSD or MSBSP makes or receives the record.1324
As discussed below, the Commission preliminarily believes that there will be costs
stemming from the requirement that stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and
bank MSBSPs make and keep current certain records as set forth in proposed Rule 18a-5.1325 As
further discussed below, the Commission preliminarily believes that the requirement to retain
these records, once made and kept current, should represent a marginal cost to registrants.1326
In order to assist its evaluation of the costs and benefits, as well as any larger economic
effects associated with the proposal, the Commission requests comment.
5.

R
	 eporting

As stated above, Rule 17a-5 has two main elements: (1) a requirement that broker-dealers
file periodic unaudited reports containing information about their financial and operational
condition on a FOCUS Report; and (2) a requirement that broker-dealers annually file financial
statements and certain reports and a report covering the financial statements and reports prepared
by an independent public accountant registered with the PCAOB in accordance with PCAOB
standards.1327
The reporting program codified in Rule 17a-5 is designed, among other things, to
promote compliance with Rules 15c3-1 and 15c3-3 and to assist the Commission, SROs, and
state securities regulators in conducting effective examinations of broker-dealers. Those publicly
available broker-dealer reporting requirements, such as the statement of financial condition,

would promote transparency of the financial and operational condition of the broker-dealer to the
Commission, the firm’s DEA, and to the public.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the economic effects associated with the new
reporting requirements would depend upon the nature of the filings such registrants make today
based upon their registration status (e.g., broker-dealer vs. non-broker-dealer). The Commission
preliminarily believes that the majority of the economic effects associated with the Title VII
rulemakings will stem from the requirements relating to capital, margin, and segregation1328 as
compared to the proposed rules in the instant rulemaking.
The Commission is cognizant, however, that the proposed reporting requirements could
create costs to firms, and indirectly to the financial markets. For example, the Commission
recognizes that there will be new compliance and audit costs associated with the required
financial report and compliance report. While the Commission is aware of these costs, section
15F(f) of the Exchange Act provides the Commission with authority to require each registered
SBSD to make a report regarding, among other things, the financial condition of the firm. The
Commission believes that it would be impractical to monitor the financial condition of SBSDs
without periodic financial reports, including annual audited reports, that elicit detail about these
firms’ security-based swap activities.
The Commission notes that it has proposed steps to minimize costs where appropriate
and consistent with its statutory mandate. For example and as described in more detail
below,1329 for stand-alone SBSDs, the Commission would not require the filing of several of the

1328

For example, the Commission anticipates substantial economic costs to arise as a result of the capital,
margin, and segregation requirements that have been proposed to apply to SBSDs and MSBSPs. See
Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major SecurityBased Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers,77 FR at 70299–70328.

See supra section II.B.2.b.

321 


reports that are required to be filed by broker-dealers, such as the Form Custody or the
information filed with SIPC by broker-dealers.1330 Further, the decision to model Form SBS on
the current FOCUS Report was made in part to reduce the uncertainty and additional compliance
costs that would stem from devising an entirely new reporting form and rules. While the
Commission understands that stand-alone SBSDs may not currently be registered as brokerdealers and thus may not currently be filing the FOCUS Report (and thus have no familiarity
with it), many stand-alone SBSDs may be affiliated with or part of a larger financial firm that
contains a broker-dealer, thus providing a source of experience, internal to the firm, with the
FOCUS Report which in turn may reduce the compliance-related costs. Moreover, the
accounting and legal communities are familiar with the FOCUS Report, so the Commission
preliminarily believes that this familiarity should mitigate the compliance costs for stand-alone
SBSDs insofar as outside assistance is well-versed with the FOCUS Report. At the same time,
the Commission acknowledges that there may be stand-alone SBSDs affiliated with, for
example, FCMs, and those firms would conceivably benefit from rules based upon or similar to
CFTC rules.
In order to aid its analysis of the economic effects relating to the proposed reporting
requirements, the Commission requests comment. Comments setting forth specific costs related
to the proposed reporting requirements, as well as benefits, would be particularly helpful to the
Commission’s analysis.

a.

Broker-Dealer SBSDs and Broker-Dealer MSBSPs

Form SBS
As described above,1331 broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs would file
proposed Form SBS instead of a particular version of the FOCUS Report. An ANC brokerdealer that currently files FOCUS Part II CSE that registers with the Commission as an SBSD or
MSBSP would experience the smallest marginal impact on its reporting obligations. This is the
case because proposed Form SBS is modeled upon Part II CSE, but includes additional line items
and sections to elicit more detail about security-based swap and swap activities.1332 Similarly,
for dealers currently registered as OTC derivatives dealers, to the extent these firms decide to
register as broker-dealer SBSDs or broker-dealer MSBSPs, the Commission preliminarily
believes that the burdens involved would be similarly modest to those encountered by the ANC
broker-dealers because Part IIB of the FOCUS Report contains many similar line items as Part II
CSE.1333
The information elicited by Form SBS from the ANC broker-dealers and OTC
derivatives dealers that decide to register as broker-dealer SBSDs or broker-dealer MSBSPs
should assist the Commission and the firms’ DEAs to conduct effective examinations of brokerdealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs. The broker-dealer SBSD and broker-dealer MSBSP
reporting requirements would promote transparency of the financial and operational condition of
the broker-dealer SBSD or broker-dealer MSBSP to the Commission and to the public.
With respect to the economic effects associated with this aspect of the proposal, the
Commission preliminarily believes that the scope of additional information requested in Form
1331

See supra section II.B.2. (discussing broker-dealer SBSDs’ and broker-dealer MSBSPs’ use of proposed
Form SBS).

1332

See supra section II.B.2.b.

323 


SBS, generally related to the firms’ security-based swap activities, is relatively circumscribed
relative to what these registrants report in Part II CSE or Part IIB of the FOCUS Report.
With respect to broker-dealers that currently do not file FOCUS Part II CSE or FOCUS
Part IIB, the Commission believes the economic impact and, more specifically, the costs
associated with complying with new Form SBS, may be more substantial. This is the case
because, as described above,1334 Form SBS elicits much of the same information as FOCUS Part
II CSE and FOCUS Part IIB, but includes additional line items and sections to elicit more detail
about security-based swap and swap activities. Accordingly, for those firms not currently filing
FOCUS Part II CSE or FOCUS Part IIB, there will be a greater change, in terms of the amount
of information that will be elicited on the form. These firms may incur greater compliancerelated costs.
The Commission has carefully considered Form SBS in light of its experience with
broker-dealer regulation and in relation to its new statutory responsibilities under section 15F of
the Exchange Act and preliminarily believes that Form SBS would promote compliance with
Rules 15c3-1 and 15c3-3 and to assist the Commission, SROs, and state securities regulators in
conducting effective examinations of broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs. The
proposed broker-dealer SBSD and broker-dealer MSBSP reporting requirements would promote
transparency of the financial and operational condition of the broker-dealer to the Commission,
the firm’s DEA, and to the public.
The Commission has designed Form SBS to elicit the information that it believes it needs
to effectively oversee the financial condition of broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer
MSBSPs. To aid its analysis of whether there are parts of Form SBS that could be curtailed or

1334

See supra section II.B.2.

324 


eliminated in order to lessen compliance-related costs, the Commission requests comment. To
the extent that commenters believe that information the Commission has proposed to elicit is
unnecessary, specific reasons for such a view would be particularly helpful. Moreover, if
commenters object to certain sections of Form SBS, specific estimates of the costs to comply
with those sections would also aid the Commission’s analysis of regulatory necessity. Finally, in
order to help it consider and evaluate the full range of effects associated with the proposal, the
Commission requests data to assess the costs and benefits of the proposals with respect to the
various classes of registrants (e.g., Part IIA filers, Part II filers, Part IIB filers, and Part II CSE
filers).
Audited Annual Reports
As discussed below, the Commission anticipates that there may be costs associated with
broker-dealer SBSDs or broker-dealer MSBSPs completing and filing the annual reports required
under paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-5.1335 Currently, as described in more detail above, brokerdealers are required to file on an annual basis a financial report that includes many parts of the
FOCUS Report in a format consistent with the version of FOCUS Report filed by the brokerdealer.1336 The proposed amendments to the financial report would include additional
information about the broker-dealer’s security-based swap activity not included in the financial
report currently filed by broker-dealer.1337 Moreover, the proposal would increase the cost of
completing the annual compliance report filed by a broker-dealer SBSD because the compliance

report for such firms would include statements about the firm’s compliance with proposed Rule
18a-4, the proposed customer segregation rule that would apply to broker-dealer SBSDs.1338
The Commission also anticipates that the cost to audit the annual reports filed by brokerdealer SBSDs or broker-dealer MSBSPs would rise.1339 Currently, and as described in more
detail above, broker-dealers are required to engage a PCAOB-registered independent public
accountant to conduct an annual audit of the broker-dealer’s annual reports.1340 The Commission
believes the additional required components to the financial report and the compliance report
would increase the costs of ongoing compliance as well as the annual audit.
Liquidity Stress Test
As discussed above,1341 the Commission has proposed amendments to Rule 15c3-1 that
would establish liquidity stress test requirements for ANC broker-dealers, which would include
ANC broker-dealer SBSDs.1342 Under the proposed liquidity stress test requirements, ANC
broker-dealers would be required, among other things, to: (1) perform a liquidity stress test at
least monthly that takes into account certain assumed conditions lasting for 30 consecutive days;
and (2) maintain at all times liquidity reserves based on the results of the liquidity stress test
comprised of unencumbered cash or U.S. government securities.1343 The proposed liquidity
stress test requirement is designed to provide an additional level of protection against disruptions

in the firm’s ability to obtain funding for a firm with significant proprietary positions in
securities or derivatives.1344
The Commission is proposing that ANC broker-dealers report to the Commission the
results of the liquidity stress test on a monthly basis.1345 The Commission has discussed the
economic effects associated with the liquidity stress test requirement and requested comment on
those effects.1346 As discussed below, the Commission preliminarily believes that paragraph
(a)(5)(vii) of Rule 17a-5 would create a cost to file the report, but that such costs would not
materially contribute to the economic effects associated with the liquidity stress test proposal.1347
As discussed above in section V.C.1. of this release, above, the Commission believes that
the proposed reporting requirements will result in benefits of improving the oversight,
transparency, and accountability of security-based swap activities.
In order to help it consider and evaluate the full range of effects associated with the
proposal, the Commission requests comment on the anticipated benefits and costs of this portion
of the proposed rule changes. Quantitative and qualitative data would be particularly useful to
the Commission in helping it evaluate the proposals.
b.

Stand-Alone SBSDs

Form SBS
As described in more detail above,1348 stand-alone SBSDs would be required to file Form
SBS with the Commission or its designee on a monthly basis.1349 Given that stand-alone SBSDs

are not broker-dealers, these firms would not have experience filing the FOCUS Report, and thus
reporting on Form SBS could represent a significant undertaking. While the Commission
expects that stand-alone SBSDs currently prepare financial statements that encompass their
security-based swap activity, the reporting on Form SBS may require that firms establish new
systems that facilitate the reporting of the required information.1350 Relative to what these firms
generate now, Form SBS would likely elicit greater detail about the registrant’s security-based
swap positions, which in turn would require the registrants to have additional details about the
firm’s security-based swap positions in order to be able to provide the security-based swap
information elicited by Form SBS. Since many of the entities that the Commission expects will
register as stand-alone SBSDs are currently not regulated, they are likely to be unaccustomed to
completing and filing detailed reports with financial regulators. Therefore, and as discussed
below, the Commission anticipates that stand-alone SBSDs will bear substantial costs in
connection with completing and filing Form SBS.1351
Audited Annual Reports
In addition, stand-alone SBSDs would be required to generate and file its financial report
and compliance report with the Commission on an annual basis.1352 While the Commission
expects that stand-alone SBSDs currently prepare financial statements that encompass their
security-based swap activity, under the proposed rules, stand-alone SBSDs would be required to
prepare a financial report in a format consistent with Form SBS, which includes numerous
1349	

The Commission estimates that nine of the approximately fifty entities that it anticipates to register with the
Commission as SBSDs will be stand-alone SBSDs.

1350	

For example, stand-alone SBSDs would be required to submit computations relating to the firm’s level of
net capital, net capital required, and amount required to be held in the special reserve account for the
exclusive benefit of security-based swap customers. See supra section II.B.2.

1351	

See infra section V.E.

1352	

See paragraph (c) of proposed Rule 18a-7.

328 


entries, computations, and schedules that a stand-alone SBSD may not prepare on its own
accord. The compliance report would contain several statements and descriptions related to the
firm’s compliance with the financial responsibility rules that would be entirely new for most
stand-alone SBSD registrants. Stand-alone SBSDs would be required to hire a PCAOBregistered independent public accountant to prepare an audit report covering annual reports. As
explained below, the Commission estimates that all stand-alone SBSDs would incur compliancerelated costs engaging a PCAOB-registered accountant to perform the audit.1353
Stand-Alone ANC SBSD Reporting Requirements
For stand-alone ANC SBSDs, there would be a number of additional monthly and
quarterly reporting requirements, independent of those on Form SBS.1354 The additional standalone ANC SBSD reports are modeled on parallel reporting requirements for ANC brokerdealers.1355 Consequently, stand-alone ANC SBSDs would be required to file the same types of
additional reports relating to their use of internal models and liquidity stress tests as ANC
broker-dealers, including ANC broker-dealer SBSDs.
As discussed below, the Commission preliminarily believes that stand-alone ANC
SBSDs may incur compliance costs related to, among other things, preparing and filing the
additional reports that would be required under the proposed rules.1356 The Commission believes
the additional reports that stand-alone ANC SBSDs would be required to file with the
Commission would give rise to less substantial compliance costs relative to the other costs under
the proposal because the additional reporting obligations for such firms are relatively few and are

See supra section II.B.3.a. See also paragraph (a)(3) of proposed Rule 18a-7.

generally closely related to their use of internal models approved by the Commission to calculate
market and credit risk. Stand-alone ANC SBSDs would incur the majority of costs associated
with these internal models in designing and operating the models themselves rather than the
reports arising from these models.
The Commission also preliminarily believes that utilizing the new reporting requirements
would have the benefit of helping the Commission evaluate whether a stand-alone SBSD is
operating in compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder. For stand-alone
SBSDs that previously did not produce detailed financial statements, the proposal could require
these firms to upgrade their technology to store and maintain the information they need to report
on Form SBS. These upgrades would likely entail costs for the firms, discussed below, but also
possibly help these firms more efficiently track their trading and risk exposure in security-based
swaps.1357 The Commission also preliminarily believes that the availability of Form SBS will
greatly enhance the Commission’s ability to oversee the financial condition of these registrants,
and the public availability of a firm’s audited Statement of Financial Condition and net capital
computations will facilitate the public’s evaluation of the financial health of a registrant.
In order to assist its evaluation of any potential economic effects associated with the
proposals, the Commission requests data to help it evaluate the costs and benefits commenters
believe would result.
c.

Stand-Alone MSBSPs

The Commission preliminarily believes the economic impact associated with the
proposed reporting requirements on stand-alone MSBSPs would be significantly less than the
effects upon stand-alone SBSDs. As with stand-alone SBSDs, the reporting requirement would

1357

See infra section V.E.

330 


be an entirely new obligation for stand-alone MSBSPs. However, there would be a number of
important differences between the reporting requirements of stand-alone MSBSPs as compared
to stand-alone SBSDs.
Form SBS
First, stand-alone MSBSPs would be required to complete a simpler Computation of
Tangible Net Worth, compared to the much longer and complex Computation of Net Capital and
Computation of Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements sections in Part 1 of the form that
stand-alone SBSDs are required to complete.1358 The Commission believes that stand-alone
SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs will incur costs completing those parts of Form SBS that are
applicable to such entities, as discussed below.1359 Moreover, stand-alone SBSDs would not be
required to complete the sections in Part 1 of Form SBS that require firms to compute the
amount that must be maintained in the security-based swap customer reserve account or the
section relating to information for the possession or control requirements for security-based swap
customers because stand-alone MSBSPs generally will not be subject to those requirements
under proposed Rule 18a-4.1360 Furthermore, stand-alone MSBSPs would not be required to
complete and file a number of sections of Part 1 of the form that relate to the operational data
related to the firm; specifically, they would not be required to complete and file the Capital
Withdrawals, Capital Withdrawals Recap, and the Financial and Operational Data sections of
Form SBS.1361
1358	

Compare Form SBS, Computation of Tangible Net Worth, with Form SBS, Computation of Net Capital

Requirements (Non-Broker-Dealer).

331 


Audited Annual Reports
Stand-alone MSBSPs would be required to comply with the proposed requirements
relating to the preparation, auditing, and filing of the annual reports.1362 As discussed below, the
Commission estimates that all stand-alone MSBSPs would incur costs stemming from the
requirement to engage a PCAOB-registered auditor.1363 The Commission anticipates that standalone MSBSPs will incur fewer costs in complying with these requirements as compared to
stand-alone SBSDs because stand-alone MSBSPs would not be required to file the compliance
report or the exemption report.
As discussed above in section V.C.1. of this release, the Commission believes that the
proposed reporting requirements for stand-alone MSBSPs will result in benefits by improving
the regulatory oversight of security-based swap activities. The Commission also recognizes that
the proposed reporting requirements would create costs. Preliminarily, the Commission believes
most of these costs would be compliance-related, as discussed in more detail below.1364 In order
to help it consider and evaluate the full range of costs and larger economic effects, if any,
associated with the proposed requirement for stand-alone MSBSPs to complete and submit Form
SBS, and to submit annual audited financial statements, the Commission requests comment.
Data to assess the costs and benefits of the reporting requirements that would apply to standalone MSBSPs would be particularly useful.

Bank SBSDs and Bank MSBSPs

As described above,1365 bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs would also have to periodically
complete and file Form SBS with the Commission. However, relative to broker-dealer SBSDs,
broker-dealer MSBSPs, stand-alone SBSDs, and stand-alone MSBSPs, banks would report less
information on Form SBS. The financial information bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs would
provide in Part 2 of the Form is based on the “call report” banks file with the prudential
regulators.1366 Bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs would also report, in Part 5 of Form SBS,
information relating to their security-based swap activities, consistent with the directive in
section 15F(f) of the Exchange Act. Bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs would also be required to
report on change of fiscal year, as well as if the registrant changes accountants. However, bank
SBSDs and bank MSBSPs would not be required to complete and file the audited financial
report. The Commission has limited the number of schedules that would be required to be
completed and filed by bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs within Part 5 of Form SBS to one
schedule that elicits detailed information about the firm’s security-based swap positions. This
requirement in Part 5 would require the bank SBSD or bank MSBSP to create and maintain
additional details about the firm’s security-based swap positions in order to be able to disclose
the necessary detail on Form SBS.
As discussed in more detail below, the Commission preliminarily believes that bank
SBSDs and bank MSBSPs will incur compliance costs related to reporting the information that
would be required on Form SBS.1367 However, the Commission has limited the number of
schedules to be reported in Part 5 to one schedule that is generally derived from the bank

SBSD’s or bank MSBSP’s call report. Thus, the Commission does not believe Part 2 would
require substantial additional effort to complete.1368
The Commission preliminarily believes the reporting requirements for bank SBSDs and
bank MSBSPs would help ensure that registrants follow applicable capital, margin, and
segregation rules. The Commission believes that such capital, margin, and segregation rules are
an integral part to ensuring that security-based swap activity is conducted in a financially
responsible manner.
The Commission requests comment about its analysis of the costs and benefits of the
proposal with respect to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs. The Commission requests data to
assess the costs and benefits of the proposals for bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs.

N
	 otification Requirements

As discussed above,1369 the Commission is proposing certain notification requirements
for SBSDs and MSBSPs that are, in general, modeled on existing notification provisions that
apply to broker-dealers pursuant to Rule 17a-11. As discussed below, the Commission has
utilized its experience with broker-dealers utilizing Rule 17a-11 to prepare cost estimates of
certain compliance-related expenses.1370 As with the other proposals being considered, the
Commission believes that the vast majority of the economic effects associated with registering as
an SBSD or MSBSP would stem from the capital, margin, and segregation rules that the
Commission proposed pursuant to Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act.1371

1368	

Whenever possible, the Commission has proposed the same line item numbers as are used for the call
report (but appended with the letter “b” in Form SBS) to facilitate a bank SBSD’s or bank MSBSP’s use of
data from the call report.

a.

Broker-Dealer SBSDs and Broker-Dealer MSBSPs

A broker-dealer SBSD would be required to notify the Commission when it fails to make
a deposit in its security-based swap customer account, as required by proposed Rule 18a-4.1372
An ANC broker-dealer would be required to give immediate notice to the Commission if a
liquidity stress test it performs indicates an insufficient amount of liquidity reserve.1373 Finally,
broker-dealer MSBSPs would be required to notify the Commission when their level of tangible
net worth fell below $20 million.1374
Outside of certain compliance-related costs, discussed below, the Commission does not
believe that the notification requirements would have an economic impact.1375 In each case, the
notification requirement would be incidental to a related underlying substantive obligation that
would be the primary source of economic impact.
As discussed above in section V.C.1. of this release, the Commission believes that the
proposed amendments to Rule 17a-11 would result in improving the Commission and DEA
oversight of broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs’ security-based swap activities,
including activities and financial conditions that suggest a material level of risk to the firm.
The Commission requests comment about its analysis of the costs and benefits of the
proposal with respect to broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs. The Commission
requests data to assess the costs and benefits of the proposals for broker-dealer SBSDs and
broker-dealer MSBSPs.

b. 	

Stand-Alone SBSDs, Stand-Alone MSBSPs, Bank SBSDs, and
Bank MSBSPs

The Commission is proposing to establish notification requirements in Rule 18a-8 for
stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs that are modeled
closely upon the requirements applicable to broker-dealers. First, the Commission is proposing
to include a net capital deficiency and tentative net capital deficiency notification requirement in
paragraph (a)(1) of proposed Rule 18a-8 applicable to stand-alone SBSDs that is modeled on the
notification requirements applicable to broker-dealers, over-the-counter derivatives dealers, and
ANC broker-dealers that appear in paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended.1376
Furthermore, a stand-alone MSBSP would be required to notify the Commission when it fails to
maintain a positive tangible net worth.1377 The Commission is also proposing to include “early
warning” notification requirements in paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 18a-8 that would be
applicable to stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs that are modeled after the relevant
early warning provisions applicable to broker-dealers in paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-11, as
proposed to be amended.1378 The Commission also is proposing a requirement for a stand-alone
SBSD to notify the Commission in the event of the discovery of a material weakness, as is
required for broker-dealers under paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended.1379
Moreover, the proposed requirement for a stand-alone SBSD to notify the Commission if it fails
to make a required deposit in its security-based swap customer reserve account is modeled on a

requires notification of the discovery of a “material inadequacy” to an over-the-counter derivatives dealer.

336 


similar proposed requirement applicable to broker-dealers for failure to make a required deposit
into a security-based swap customer account.1380
The proposed requirement for a bank SBSD, bank MSBSP, stand-alone SBSD, and
stand-alone MSBSP to notify the Commission in the event that it fails to make and keep current
its required books and records is modeled on a similar requirement for broker-dealers.1381 The
proposed requirement for stand-alone ANC SBSDs to notify the Commission of an insufficient
level of liquidity reserves is modeled after a similar requirement for ANC broker-dealer
SBSDs.1382
With respect to bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs, the Commission is proposing to include
a notification requirement in proposed Rule 18a-8 that would require these entities to give the
Commission notice when they file an adjustment of its reported capital category with its
prudential regulator by transmitting a copy of the notice to the Commission.1383
In general, the Commission preliminarily believes most of the costs stemming from the
notification proposals would arise from preparing and filing the notices.1384
These notices serve an important role in the context of the reporting and recordkeeping
rules for broker-dealers, broker-dealer SBSDs, broker-dealer MSBSPs, stand-alone SBSDs,
stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs because they serve to alert the
Commission to the fact that certain events are occurring at a registrant that are highly relevant to
the registrant’s overall ability to continue to meet its obligations to customers and counterparties.

For example, a report of a capital deficiency would alert the Commission to the fact that a
registrant may lack sufficient capital to continue to operate its business and meet its obligations
to customers and counterparties. The notification requirements are thus critical to helping the
Commission fulfill its statutory responsibility to monitor whether SBSDs and MSBSPs are
operating in compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder.1385
In order to aid its analysis, the Commission generally requests comment about the general
costs and benefits of the Rule 17a-11, as proposed to be amended, and proposed Rule 18a-8. The
Commission requests data to evaluate the costs and benefits of the proposals.
7.

Quarterly Securities Count

As discussed in greater detail above,1386 the Commission is also proposing to establish a
securities count program for SBSDs under sections 15F and 17(a) of the Exchange Act that is
modeled on Rule 17a-13’s securities count program for broker-dealers. More specifically, standalone SBSDs would be subject to proposed Rule 18a-9. For reasons explained above, proposed
Rule 18a-9 would not apply to stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, or bank MSBSPs.1387
Paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-13 prescribes the requirement to perform a quarterly securities
count and specifies the steps a broker-dealer must take in performing a count. Paragraph (c) of
Rule 17a-13 prescribes the timing of the count, permitting a broker-dealer to perform the
securities count on a rolling basis throughout the quarter as opposed to all in one day. Paragraph
(d) of Rule 17a-13 provides that the examination, count, verification, and comparison performed
under the rule must be done by persons whose regular duties do not require them to have direct
responsibility for the proper care and protection of the securities or the making or preservation of

the subject records. Proposed Rule 18a-9 applies substantially all the same affirmative
obligations to stand-alone SBSDs that apply to broker-dealers under Rule 17a-13.1388
As was discussed above,1389 Rule 17a-13, the model for proposed Rule 18a-9, arose in the
aftermath of the 1967-1970 securities industry crisis where deficiencies in broker-dealers’
internal controls and procedures for, among other things, failing to adequately check and count
securities, created a serious “paper work crisis” in the securities markets.1390 The Commission
preliminarily believes that instituting a parallel provision could help to avoid a similar problem
for stand-alone SBSDs. Moreover, the Commission preliminarily believes that to the extent a
stand-alone SBSD has not invested in the technology necessary to help ensure that it can
accurately track and safeguard securities, the proposed rule will require such investments to be
made,1391 which could improve the quality of such tracking and safeguarding.
The Commission preliminarily believes most of the negative economic effects stemming
from the securities count proposal would arise from regulatory and compliance costs. The
Commission believes that the costs involved, and any larger economic effects, should be similar
to those associated with Rule 17a-13 and would be related primarily to the development and
maintenance of internal procedures and controls and the investment in technology.1392
The Commission generally requests comment about its analysis of the general costs and
benefits of the proposed securities count rules for stand-alone SBSDs. The Commission requests
data to assess the costs and benefits of the proposals for the stand-alone SBSDs.
1388

Compare proposed Rule 18a-9, with 17 CFR 240.17a-13. Proposed Rule 18a-9 omits the exemptions from
applicability of the rule that appear in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (e) of Rule 17a-13 because those
exemptions relate to broker-dealer-specific functions and broker-dealer registration status. See 17 CFR
240.17a-13(a) and (e).

Impact on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation

Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act provides that whenever the Commission engages in
rulemaking under the Exchange Act and is required to consider or determine whether an action is
necessary or appropriate in the public interest, the Commission shall also consider, in addition to
the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital
formation.1393 In addition, section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission, when
making rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact such rules would have on
competition.1394 Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act also prohibits the Commission from
adopting any rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in
furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act.1395 As stated above, the Commission believes
that the recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities count rules and rule amendments
being proposed today address, among other things, the documentation, reporting, and evidence of
compliance with the capital, margin, and segregation rules. Thus, the Commission believes that
these rules, by their nature, will have a more limited economic impact as compared to the
Commission’s capital, margin, and segregation proposals.1396 Thus, while the Commission
would expect that the adoption of these proposed rules and rule amendments, and their attendant
benefits and costs, would affect competition, efficiency, and capital formation, the Commission
preliminarily believes that such impact will be more limited than the impact from the capital,
margin, and segregation proposals. In most instances, the Commission believes the costs will
consist of the implementation-related costs of the proposed rules and rule amendments and the

340 


benefits will be those that stem from enabling the Commission to evaluate whether SBSDs and
MSBSPs are in compliance with the financial responsibility rules governing security-based swap
activities. The Commission requests comment on its analysis and underlying assumptions in this
regard.
In the aggregate, the proposed recordkeeping, reporting, and notification rules would be
an integral part of the proposed financial responsibility rules governing security-based swaps.
The rules are designed to provide greater regulatory transparency into the business activities of
these firms and to assist the Commission and other regulators in reviewing and monitoring
compliance with the capital, margin, and segregation requirements. In general, the Commission
believes that the proposals would thus help ensure that firms that engage in security-based swap
activity do so in a financially responsible manner. The Commission further believes that the
proposed rules and rule amendments, by improving its ability to monitor the financial condition
of these registrants, could contribute to confidence in the market and willingness of market
participants to engage in activities. It is the Commission staff’s experience that greater
confidence in a market promotes greater participation, leading to increased competition and
efficiency, which have a positive effect on capital formation in the security-based swap market.
The Commission is cognizant, however, that it must be sensitive to the costs and burdens
imposed by its rules. For example, overly restrictive or costly recordkeeping requirements could
reduce the willingness of firms to engage in such trading. This could, in turn, increase
transaction costs for market participants and contribute to less liquidity in the market. Even if
the cost of overly restrictive recordkeeping, reporting, notification, and securities count
requirements were shouldered only by those market participants that are subject to them, the
excess compliance costs incurred would not be available for potentially more efficient uses,

341 


which thereby could distort capital allocation and, in turn, adversely affect capital formation.
The Commission preliminarily believes the proposed recordkeeping, reporting, securities count,
and notification proposals are unlikely to materially increase the barriers to entry in this market.
As described in more detail above, broker-dealers historically have not participated in a
significant way in security-based swap trading, in part, because the existing broker-dealer capital
requirements make it relatively costly to conduct these activities in broker-dealers. As stated
above, the Commission estimates that approximately seventeen broker-dealers will register as
SBSDs or MSBSPs and approximately twenty-five registered broker-dealers will be engaged in
security-based swap activities but would not be required to register as an SBSD or MSBSP.1397
In addition, a broker-dealer may elect to register an affiliated entity as an SBSD or MSBSP,
instead of registering the broker-dealer itself as an SBSD or MSBSP. A market participant
unaffiliated with a broker-dealer, including a bank, which conducts security-based swap activity
in the U.S. may also register as an SBSD or MSBSP. As stated above, the Commission
estimates that approximately thirty-four such entities will register as SBSDs or MSBSPs.1398 As
discussed above, as of April 1, 2013, there were 4,545 broker-dealers registered with the
Commission.
To the extent that the proposed rules are burdensome or costly, they may impact the
incentives of market participants in terms of whether they seek to register as SBSDs or MSBSPs.
If fewer firms register, this could adversely impact competition and the overall efficiency of the
U.S. capital markets as fewer firms will conduct security-based swap activities in the U.S. For
example, excessive costs could discourage firms from engaging in security-based swap trading,
which would reduce competition among market participants, thereby leading to lower liquidity,
1397

See supra section IV.C.

1398

Id.

342 


impeded price discovery, and higher transaction costs, all of which are characteristics of reduced
levels of efficiency in the market. Moreover, it is possible that cost increases could lead to
certain broker-dealers ceasing to engage in security-based swap trading, which could then reduce
competition and impose inefficiency costs on the security-based swap marketplace. At the same
time, these market participants may seek to conduct the security-based swap business in
jurisdictions where regulations are, or are perceived to be, less burdensome.
In order to assist its evaluation of the proposed rules and rule amendments’ effects on
efficiency, competition, and capital formation, the Commission requests comment. Commenters
are asked to be as specific as possible in identifying those rule proposals that are particularly
beneficial or problematic, as the case may be, and in identifying alternative approaches or other
ways in which the harmful effect(s) of the proposals can be ameliorated or eliminated.
E.

	Implementation Considerations

The proposed new rules and rule amendments, as discussed above, would impose certain
implementation burdens and related costs on SBSDs and MSBSPs, as well as broker-dealers.
These costs may include start-up costs, including personnel and other costs, such as technology
costs, to comply with the proposed new rules and rule amendments. The Commission
understands that entities that will engage in security-based swap transactions currently incur
costs during their normal business activities and the proposed new rules would impose
incremental costs. While they are not negligible, the Commission preliminarily believes, as
discussed above, that they are unlikely to materially increase costs.
Based on section IV.D. of this release, the Commission has estimated the related costs of
these implementation requirements for SBSDs, MSBSPs, and broker-dealers.1399 The
1399	

See section IV.D. of this release (discussing total initial and annual recordkeeping and reporting burdens of
the proposed rules and rule amendments).

343 


Commission estimates for all SBSDs and MSBSPs, these initial implementation costs to be
approximately $10 million and the ongoing costs of implementation to be approximately $9
million, as summarized in more detail below.1400
Rule 17a-3, which requires broker-dealers to make and keep current certain records,
would be amended to account for security-based swap activities of broker-dealers, including
broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs.1401 The Commission is also proposing to add
new provisions to Rule 17a-3 that would relate to the recently proposed margin requirements
applicable to SBSDs.1402 Across all types of broker-dealers, including broker-dealers not
registered as SBSDs or MSBSPs, the requirements are estimated to impose a one-time and
annual aggregate cost of approximately $925,3601403 and $282,807, respectively.1404
The Commission is proposing new Rule 18a-5 – which is modeled on Rule 17a-3, as
proposed to be amended – to require stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs,
and bank MSBSPs to make and keep current certain records.1405 The Commission estimates that

MSBSPs not registered as broker-dealers.1406 On an annual basis, the Commission estimates that
proposed Rule 18a-5 would result in $890,475 of total industry costs to SBSDs and MSBSPs not
registered as broker-dealers.1407
As discussed above, the Commission is proposing amendments to Rule 17a-4 to account
for the security-based swap activities of broker-dealers, including broker-dealer SBSDs and
broker-dealer MSBSPs, as well as certain largely non-substantive technical amendments.1408
The Commission estimates that the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-4 would result in a total
initial industry cost of $1,167,452 to broker-dealers.1409 On an annual basis, the Commission
estimates that the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-4 would result in $174,388 of total annual
aggregate industry costs to broker-dealers.1410
The Commission is proposing new Rule 18a-6 – modeled on Rule 17a-4, as proposed to
be amended – to establish record preservation requirements for stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone
MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs. The Commission estimates proposed Rule 18a-6

SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2012, as modified by
Commission staff to account for an 1,800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses,
firm size, employee benefits, and overhead.

would result in $4,054,996 of initial costs to the industry1411 and $1,038,660 of annual costs to
the industry.1412
As stated above, the Commission is proposing to amend Rule 17a-5, to require brokerdealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs to file proposed Form SBS, instead of a particular part
of the FOCUS Report.1413 The Commission is also proposing amendments to Rule 17a-5 to
require additional information about the broker-dealer’s security-based swap activity in the
financial report filed by broker-dealers,1414 and to require ANC broker-dealers to report to the
Commission the results of the liquidity stress test on a monthly basis.1415 The Commission
estimates that the amendments to Rule 17a-5 would result in an initial total cost of $158,710 to
broker-dealers.1416 On an annual basis, the Commission estimates that the amendments to Rule
17a-5 would result in $1,089,450 of total annual costs to broker-dealers.1417
The Commission is proposing Rule 18a-7 to provide reporting requirements for standalone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs that are analogous to the
reporting requirements proposed for broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs. Proposed
Rule 18a-7 would also require stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs to file with the

12,914 hours x $314/hour national hourly rate for a senior database administrator = $4,054,996.

1412

(9,780 hours x $63/hour national hourly rate for a compliance clerk) + (38 hours x $379/hour for national
hourly rate for an attorney) + $204,078 in external costs = $1,038,660.

amendments to Rule 17a-5 are expected to result from the additional information elicited in Form SBS, as
compared to the FOCUS Report. Because broker-dealers would be required to file Form SBS on an
ongoing basis, it is characterized as an annual cost, rather than an initial cost.

As described in more detail above, the Commission is proposing to establish notification
requirements to require SBSDs and MSBSPs to timely notify the Commission of potential
problems at these registrants.1421 The Commission is proposing to amend Rule 17a-11 to add
certain notification requirements for broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs. In the
aggregate, the Commission expects the proposed amendments to Rule 17a-11 to result in an
annual industry cost of $29,859 to broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs.1422
The Commission is also proposing Rule 18a-8 to establish reporting requirements for
stand-alone SBSDs and stand-alone MSBSPs that are analogous to the reporting requirements for
broker-dealer SBSDs and broker-dealer MSBSPs, as well as a separate notification requirement
for bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs. The Commission expects that proposed Rule 18a-8 would

1419	

2,890 hours x $269/hour national hourly rate for a compliance manager = $777,410. See supra section
IV.D.3. (PRA estimate of the total initial and annual recordkeeping and reporting burden for proposed
amendments to Rule 17a-5 and proposed Rule 18a-7). The majority of costs SBSDs and MSBSPs would
incur as a result of proposed Rule 18a-7 is expected to result from the information elicited in Form SBS and
the required annual audit. Because the additional information in the Form SBS and the annual audit would
be required on an ongoing basis, the Commission is characterizing them as ongoing costs.

(3,978 hours x $63/hour national hourly rate for a compliance clerk) + $5,250,079 in external costs =
$5,500,693. See supra section IV.D.3. (PRA estimate of the total initial and annual recordkeeping and
reporting burden for proposed amendments to Rule 17a-5 and proposed Rule 18a-7).

proposed amendments to Rule 17a-11 and proposed Rule 18a-8).

result in an annual industry cost of $1,237 to stand-alone SBSDs, stand-alone MSBSPs, bank
SBSDs, and bank MSBSPs.1423
Proposed Rule 18a-9, which is modeled on Rule 17a-13, would require stand-alone
SBSDs to establish a securities count program.1424 The Commission estimates that proposed
Rule 18a-9 would impose an initial industry-wide cost of $76,7251425 and an industry-wide
annual cost of $113,400 per year.1426
VI. 	

REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT CERTIFICATION
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”)1427 requires federal agencies, in promulgating

rules, to consider the impact of those rules on small entities. Section 603(a)1428 of the
Administrative Procedure Act,1429 as amended by the RFA, generally requires the Commission to
undertake a regulatory flexibility analysis of all proposed rules, or proposed rule amendments, to
determine the impact of such rulemaking on “small entities.”1430 Section 605(b) of the RFA

1423	

4.6 hours x $269/hour national hourly rate for a compliance manager = $1,237. See supra section IV.D.4.
(PRA estimate of the total initial and annual recordkeeping and reporting burden for proposed amendments
to Rule 17a-11 and proposed Rule 18a-8).

1424	

See supra section II.D.

1425	

225 hours x $341/hour national hourly rate for a senior operations manager = $76,725. See supra section
IV.D.5. (PRA estimate of the total initial and annual recordkeeping and reporting burden for proposed Rule
18a-9). The $341 per hour figure for a senior operations manager is from SIFMA’s Management &
Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2012, as modified by Commission staff to account for an
1,800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and
overhead.

1426	

900 hours x $126/hour national hourly rate for an operations specialist = $113,400. See supra section
IV.D.5. (PRA estimate of the total initial and annual recordkeeping and reporting burden for proposed Rule
18a-9). The $126 per hour figure for an operations specialist is from SIFMA’s Management &
Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2012, as modified by Commission staff to account for an
1,800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and
overhead.

See 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.

1430	

Although section 601(b) of the RFA defines the term “small entity,” the statute permits agencies to
formulate their own definitions. The Commission has adopted definitions for the term “small entity” for
the purposes of Commission rulemaking in accordance with the RFA. Those definitions, as relevant to this

348 


states that this requirement shall not apply to any proposed rule or proposed rule amendment,
which, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities.1431
For purposes of Commission rulemaking in connection with the RFA, a small entity
includes: (1) when used with reference to an “issuer” or a “person,” other than an investment
company, an “issuer” or “person” that, on the last day of its most recent fiscal year, had total
assets of $5 million or less,1432 or (2) a broker-dealer with total capital (net worth plus
subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the prior fiscal year as of which its
audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to Rule 17a-5(d) under the Exchange
Act,1433 or, if not required to file such statements, a broker-dealer with total capital (net worth
plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last day of the preceding fiscal year (or
in the time that it has been in business, if shorter); and is not affiliated with any person (other
than a natural person) that is not a small business or small organization.1434 Under the standards
adopted by the Small Business Administration, small entities in the finance and insurance
industry include the following: (1) for entities in credit intermediation and related activities,1435
firms with $175 million or less in assets; (2) for non-depository credit intermediation and certain

proposed rulemaking, are set forth in Rule 0-10, 17 CFR 240.0-10. See Statement of Management on
Internal Accounting Control, Exchange Act Release No. 18451 (Jan. 28, 1982), 47 FR 5215 (Feb. 4, 1982).

See 17 CFR 240.0-10(c).

Including commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, firms involved in other depository credit
intermediation, credit card issuing, sales financing, consumer lending, real estate credit, and international
trade financing.

other activities,1436 firms with $7 million or less in annual receipts; (3) for entities in financial
investments and related activities,1437 firms with $7 million or less in annual receipts; (4) for
insurance carriers and entities in related activities,1438 firms with $7 million or less in annual
receipts; and (5) for funds, trusts, and other financial vehicles,1439 firms with $7 million or less in
annual receipts.1440
Based on available information about the security-based swap market, the market, while
broad in scope, is largely dominated by entities such as those that would be covered by the SBSD
and MSBSP definitions. Subject to certain exceptions, section 3(a)(71)(A) of the Exchange Act
defines security-based swap dealer to mean any person who: (1) holds itself out as a dealer in
security-based swaps; (2) makes a market in security-based swaps; (3) regularly enters into
security-based swaps with counterparties as an ordinary course of business for its own account;
or (4) engages in any activity causing it to be commonly known in the trade as a dealer or market
maker in security-based swaps. Section 3(a)(67)(A) of the Exchange Act defines major securitybased swap participant to be any person: (1) who is not an SBSD; and (2) who maintains a
substantial position in security-based swaps for any of the major security-based swap categories,
as such categories are determined by the Commission, excluding both positions held for hedging
1436	

Including firms involved in secondary market financing, all other non-depository credit intermediation,
mortgage and nonmortgage loan brokers, financial transactions processing, reserve and clearing house
activities, and other activities related to credit intermediation.

1437	

Including firms involved in investment banking and securities dealing, securities brokerage, commodity
contracts dealing, commodity contracts brokerage, securities and commodity exchanges, miscellaneous
intermediation, portfolio management, providing investment advice, trust, fiduciary and custody activities,
and miscellaneous financial investment activities.

1438	

Including direct life insurance carriers, direct health and medical insurance carriers, direct property and
casualty insurance carriers, direct title insurance carriers, other direct insurance (except life, health and
medical) carriers, reinsurance carriers, insurance agencies and brokerages, claims adjusting, third party
administration of insurance and pension funds, and all other insurance related activities.

1439	

Including pension funds, health and welfare funds, other insurance funds, open-end investment funds,
trusts, estates, and agency accounts, real estate investment trusts, and other financial vehicles.

1440	

See 13 CFR 121.201.

or mitigating commercial risk and positions maintained by any employee benefit plan (or any
contract held by such a plan) as defined in paragraphs (3) and (32) of section 3 of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1002) for the primary purpose of hedging or
mitigating any risk directly associated with the operation of the plan; whose outstanding
security-based swaps create substantial counterparty exposure that could have serious adverse
effects on the financial stability of the U.S. banking system or financial markets; or that is a
financial entity that is highly leveraged relative to the amount of capital such entity holds and
that is not subject to capital requirements established by an appropriate federal banking
regulator; and maintains a substantial position in outstanding security-based swaps in any major
security-based swap category, as such categories are determined by the Commission.1441
Based on feedback from industry participants about the security-based swap markets,
entities that will qualify as SBSDs and MSBSPs, whether registered broker-dealers or not, will
likely exceed the thresholds defining “small entities” set out above. Thus, it is unlikely that the
requirements applicable to SBSD and MSBSPs that would be established under the proposed
amendments to Rules 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5, and 17a-11, and proposed new Rules 18a-5, 18a-6,
18a-7 and 18a-8 and 18a-9, would have a significant economic impact on any small entity.
The Commission estimates that there are approximately 735 broker-dealers that were
“small” for the purposes Rule 0-10.1442 The amendments to Rules 17a-3, 17a-4, and 17a-5
1441	

See also Further Definition of ‘‘Swap Dealer,’’ ‘‘Security-Based Swap Dealer,’’ ‘‘Major Swap
Participant,’’ ‘‘Major Security-Based Swap Participant’’ and ‘‘Eligible Contract Participant”, 77 FR at
30743 (“The SEC continues to believe that the types of entities that would engage in more than a de
minimis amount of dealing activity involving security-based swaps – which generally would be major
banks – would not be ‘small entities’ for purposes of the RFA. Similarly, the SEC continues to believe that
the types of entities that may have security-based swap positions above the level required to be a ‘major
security-based swap participant’ would not be a ‘small entity’ for purposes of the RFA. Accordingly, the
SEC certifies that the final rules defining ‘security-based swap dealer’ or ‘major security-based swap
participant’ would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for
purposes of the RFA.”).

This estimate is based on the number of small broker-dealers as of December 31, 2012.

351 


relating to making and keeping records that include details about security-based swaps and
swaps and reporting information about security-based swaps and swaps would apply to all
broker-dealers with such positions. These proposed amendments, therefore, would apply to all
“small” broker-dealers in that they would be subject to the requirements in the proposed
amendments. It is likely, however, that these proposed amendments would have no, or little,
impact on “small” broker-dealers, since most, if not all, of these firms generally would not hold
these types of positions. In addition, the technical amendments to Rules 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5, and
17a-11 would apply to all broker-dealers, including broker-dealers that are small. However,
these amendments would have no impact on broker-dealers, including “small” broker-dealers,
because they would not establish new substantive requirements.
For the foregoing reasons, the Commission certifies that the proposed amendments to
Rules 17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5, and 17a-11, and new Rules 18a-5 through 18a-9, would not have a
significant economic impact on any small entity for purposes of the RFA.
The Commission encourages written comments regarding this certification. The
Commission requests that commenters describe the nature of any impact on small entities and
provide empirical data to illustrate the extent of the impact.
VII. 	 SMALL BUSINESS REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT FAIRNESS ACT
Under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996,1443 a rule is
considered “major” where, if adopted, it results or is likely to result in: (1) an annual effect on
the economy of $100 million or more (either in the form of an increase or a decrease); (2) a
major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or (3) significant adverse
effect on competition, investment, or innovation. The Commission requests comment on the
1443	

See Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104–121, 110 Stat. 847 (1996) (codified in
various sections of titles 5 and 15 of the U.S. Code, and as a note to 5 U.S.C. 601).

352 


potential impact of the proposed rule on the economy on an annual basis, any potential increase
in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries, and any potential effect on competition,
investment, or innovation. Commenters are requested to provide empirical data and other factual
support for their view to the extent possible.

§ 240.17a-3 -- Records to be made by certain brokers and dealers.
Section 240.17a-3 applies to a broker or dealer registered under section 15(b) of the Act
(15 U.S.C. 78o(b)), including a broker or dealer also registered as a security-based swap dealer
or major security-based swap participant under section 15F(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-8(b)).
A security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant registered under section
15F(b) of the Act that is not also registered as a broker or dealer under section 15(b) of the Act is
subject to the books and records requirements under § 240.18a-5.
(a) Every broker or dealer must make and keep current the following books and records
relating to its business:
(1) Blotters (or other records of original entry) containing an itemized daily record of all
purchases and sales of securities (including security-based swaps), all receipts and deliveries of
securities (including certificate numbers), all receipts and disbursements of cash and all other
debits and credits. Such records must show the account for which each such purchase or sale
was effected, the name and amount of securities, the unit and aggregate purchase or sale price (if

355 


any), the trade date, and the name or other designation of the person from whom such securities
were purchased or received or to whom sold or delivered. For security-based swaps, such
records must also show, for each purchase or sale, the type of security-based swap, the reference
security, index, or obligor, the date and time of execution, the effective date, the termination or
maturity date, the notional amount, the unique transaction identifier, and the unique counterparty
identifier.
(2) * * *
(3) Ledger accounts (or other records) itemizing separately as to each cash, margin, or
security-based swap account of every customer and of such broker or dealer and partners thereof,
all purchases, sales, receipts and deliveries of securities (including security-based swaps) and
commodities for such account, and all other debits and credits to such account; and, in addition,
for a security-based swap, the type of security-based swap, the reference security, index, or
obligor, the date and time of execution, the effective date, the termination or maturity date, the
notional amount, the unique transaction identifier, and the unique counterparty identifier.
(4) * * *
(vi) All long and all short securities record differences arising from the examination,
count, verification, and comparison pursuant to §§ 240.17a-5, 240.17a-12, and 240.17a-13 (by
date of examination, count, verification, and comparison showing for each security the number
of long or short count differences); and
(vii) Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.
(5) A securities record or ledger reflecting separately for each:
(i) Security, other than a security-based swap, as of the clearance dates all “long” or
“short” positions (including securities in safekeeping and securities that are the subjects of

356 


repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements) carried by such broker or dealer for its account or
for the account of its customers or partners, or others, and showing the location of all securities
long and the offsetting position to all securities short, including long security count differences
and short security count differences classified by the date of the physical count and verification
in which they were discovered, and in all cases the name or designation of the account in which
each position is carried.
(ii) Security-based swap, the reference security, index, or obligor, the unique transaction
identifier, the unique counterparty identifier, whether it is a “long” or “short” position in the
security-based swap, whether the security-based swap is cleared or not cleared, and if cleared,
identification of the clearing agency where the security-based swap is cleared.
(6)(i) A memorandum of each brokerage order, and of any other instruction, given or
received for the purchase or sale of a security, except for the purchase or sale of a security-based
swap, whether executed or unexecuted.
(A) The memorandum must show the terms and conditions of the order or instructions
and of any modification or cancellation thereof, the account for which entered, the time the order
was received, the time of entry, the price at which executed, the identity of each associated
person, if any, responsible for the account, the identity of any other person who entered or
accepted the order on behalf of the customer, or, if a customer entered the order on an electronic
system, a notation of that entry, and, to the extent feasible, the time of execution or cancellation.
The memorandum need not show the identity of any person, other than the associated person
responsible for the account, who may have entered or accepted the order if the order is entered
into an electronic system that generates the memorandum and if that system is not capable of
receiving an entry of the identity of any person other than the responsible associated person; in

357 


that circumstance, the broker or dealer must produce upon request by a representative of a
securities regulatory authority a separate record which identifies each other person. An order
entered pursuant to the exercise of discretionary authority by the broker or dealer, or associated
person thereof, must be so designated. The term instruction must include instructions between
partners and employees of a broker or dealer. The term time of entry means the time when the
broker or dealer transmits the order or instruction for execution.
(B) The memorandum need not be made as to a purchase, sale or redemption of a security
on a subscription way basis directly from or to the issuer, if the broker or dealer maintains a copy
of the customer's or non-customer’s subscription agreement regarding a purchase, or a copy of
any other document required by the issuer regarding a sale or redemption.
(ii) A memorandum of each brokerage order, and of any other instruction, given or
received for the purchase or sale of a security-based swap, whether executed or unexecuted. The
memorandum must show the terms and conditions of the order or instructions and of any

received; the time of entry; the price at which executed; the identity of each associated person, if
any, responsible for the account; the identity of any other person who entered or accepted the
order on behalf of the customer, or, if a customer entered the order on an electronic system, a
notation of that entry; and, to the extent feasible, the time of cancellation, if applicable. The
memorandum also must include the type of the security-based swap, the reference security,
index, or obligor, the date and time of execution, the effective date, the termination or maturity
date, the notional amount, the unique transaction identifier, and the unique counterparty
identifier. An order entered pursuant to the exercise of discretionary authority must be so
designated.

358 


(7)(i) A memorandum of each purchase or sale of a security, other than for the purchase
or sale of a security-based swap, for the account of the broker or dealer showing the price and, to
the extent feasible, the time of execution; and, in addition, where the purchase or sale is with a
customer other than a broker or dealer, a memorandum of each order received, showing the time
of receipt; the terms and conditions of the order and of any modification thereof; the account for
which it was entered; the identity of each associated person, if any, responsible for the account;
the identity of any other person who entered or accepted the order on behalf of the customer, or,
if a customer entered the order on an electronic system, a notation of that entry. The
memorandum need not show the identity of any person other than the associated person
responsible for the account who may have entered the order if the order is entered into an
electronic system that generates the memorandum and if that system is not capable of receiving
an entry of the identity of any person other than the responsible associated person. In that
circumstance, the broker or dealer must produce upon request by a representative of a securities
regulatory authority a separate record that identifies each other person. An order with a customer
other than a broker or dealer entered pursuant to the exercise of discretionary authority by the
broker or dealer, or associated person thereof, must be so designated.
(ii) A memorandum of each purchase or sale of a security-based swap for the account of
the broker or dealer showing the price; and, in addition, where the purchase or sale is with a
customer other than a broker or dealer, a memorandum of each order received, showing the time
of receipt; the terms and conditions of the order and of any modification thereof; the account for
which it was entered; the identity of any other person who entered or accepted the order on
behalf of the customer, or, if a customer entered the order on an electronic system, a notation of
that entry. The memorandum must also include the type of security-based swap, the reference

359 


security, index, or obligor, the date and time of execution, the effective date, the termination or
maturity date, the notional amount, the unique transaction identifier, and the unique counterparty
identifier. An order entered pursuant to the exercise of discretionary authority must be so
designated.
(8)(i) With respect to a security other than a security-based swap, copies of confirmations
of all purchases and sales of securities, including all repurchase and reverse repurchase
agreements, and copies of notices of all other debits and credits for securities, cash and other
items for the account of customers and partners of such broker or dealer.

(3) The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section will not apply to a member of a
national securities exchange or a registered national securities association if said exchange or
association maintains records containing the information required by Part I, Part II, or Part IIA of
Form X-17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter) or Form SBS (§ 249.617 of this chapter), as to such
member, and transmits to the Commission a copy of the applicable parts of Form X-17A-5
(§ 249.617 of this chapter) or Form SBS (§ 249.617 of this chapter) as to such member, pursuant
to a plan, the procedures and provisions of which have been submitted to and declared effective
by the Commission. Any such plan filed by a national securities exchange or a registered
national securities association may provide that when a member is also a member of one or more
national securities exchanges, or of one or more national securities exchanges and a registered
national securities association, the information required to be submitted with respect to any such
member may be submitted by only one specified national securities exchange or registered
national securities association. For the purposes of this section, a plan filed with the
Commission by a national securities exchange or a registered national securities association will
not become effective unless the Commission, having due regard for the fulfillment of the
Commission's duties and responsibilities under the provisions of the Act, declares the plan to be
effective. Further, the Commission, in declaring any such plan effective, may impose such terms
and conditions relating to the provisions of the plan and the period of its effectiveness as may be
deemed necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or to carry
out the Commission's duties and responsibilities under the Act.
(4) Every broker or dealer subject to this paragraph (a) must file Form Custody
(§ 249.639 of this chapter) with its designated examining authority within 17 business days after
the end of each calendar quarter and within 17 business days after the end of the fiscal year of

378 


the broker or dealer where that date is not the end of a calendar quarter. The designated
examining authority must maintain the information obtained through the filing of Form Custody
and must promptly transmit that information to the Commission at such time as it transmits the
applicable part of Form X-17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter), or Form SBS (§ 249.617 of this
chapter) as required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(5) Each broker or dealer that computes certain of its capital charges in accordance with
§ 240.15c3-1e must file the following additional reports with the Commission:

format that is consistent with the statements contained in Form X-17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this
chapter) Part II, Part IIA or Form SBS (§ 249.617 of this chapter), as applicable. If the Statement

or Form SBS, as applicable, is not consolidated, a summary of financial data, including the

382 


assets, liabilities, and net worth or stockholders' equity, for subsidiaries not consolidated in the
applicable Part II, Part IIA, or Form SBS Statement of Financial Condition as filed by the broker
or dealer must be included in the notes to the financial statements reported on by the independent

applicable, filed by the broker or dealer pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, a reconciliation,
including appropriate explanations, between the computation in the financial report and the
computation in the most recent Part II or Part IIA of Form X-17A-5 or Form SBS (§ 249.617 of

applicable, 240.18a-4(c) [as proposed at 77 FR 70214, Nov. 23, 2012] as of the end of the most

§§ 240.15c3-1, 240.15c3-3(e) and, if applicable, 240.18a-4(c) [as proposed at 77 FR 70214, Nov.

240.15c3-3(e) or, if applicable, 240.18a-4(c) [as proposed at 77 FR 70214, Nov. 23, 2012] as of
the end of the most recent fiscal year.
(ii) * * *
(iii) The broker or dealer is not permitted to conclude that its Internal Control Over
Compliance was effective during the most recent fiscal year if there were one or more material
weaknesses in its Internal Control Over Compliance during the most recent fiscal year. The
broker or dealer is not permitted to conclude that its Internal Control Over Compliance was
effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year if there were one or more material
weaknesses in its internal control as of the end of the most recent fiscal year. A material
weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in Internal Control Over Compliance
such that there is a reasonable possibility that non-compliance with §§ 240.15c3-1,
240.15c3-3(e) or 240.18a-4(c) [as proposed at 77 FR 70214, Nov. 23, 2012] will not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis or that non-compliance to a material extent with §

except for paragraph (c), § 240.17a-13 or any Account Statement Rule will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. A deficiency in Internal Control Over Compliance exists when the
design or operation of a control does not allow the management or employees of the broker or
dealer, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect on a
timely basis non-compliance with § 240.15c3-1, § 240.15c3-3, § 240.17a-13, § 240.18a-4 [as

(ii) A broker or dealer that files an annual report under paragraph (d) of this section that
is not covered by a report prepared by an independent public accountant must include in the oath
or affirmation required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section a statement of the facts and
circumstances relied upon as a basis for exemption from the requirement that the annual report
filed under paragraph (d) of this section be covered by reports prepared by an independent public
accountant.
(2) The broker or dealer must attach to each of the confidential and non-confidential
portions of the annual reports separately bound under paragraph (e)(3) of this section a complete
and executed Part III of Form X-17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter). The oath or affirmation
made in Part III of Form X-17A-5 must be made before a person duly authorized to administer
such oaths or affirmations. If the broker or dealer is a sole proprietorship, the oath or affirmation
must be made by the proprietor; if a partnership, by a general partner; if a corporation, by a duly
authorized officer; or if a limited liability company or limited liability partnership, by the chief

385 


executive officer, chief financial officer, manager, managing member, or those members vested
with management authority for the limited liability company or limited liability partnership.

except that, if the Statement of Financial Condition in a format that is consistent with Form X17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter), Part II, Part IIA or Form SBS (§ 249.617 of this chapter) is
bound separately from the balance of the annual reports filed under paragraph (d) of this section,
and each page of the balance of the annual reports is stamped “confidential,” then the balance of
the annual reports will be deemed confidential to the extent permitted by law. However, the
annual reports, including the confidential portions, will be available for official use by any
official or employee of the U. S. or any State, by national securities exchanges and registered
national securities associations of which the broker or dealer filing such a report is a member, by
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and by any other person if the Commission
authorizes disclosure of the annual reports to that person as being in the public interest. Nothing
contained in this paragraph may be construed to be in derogation of the rules of any registered
national securities association or national securities exchange that give to customers of a broker
or dealer the right, upon request to the broker or dealer, to obtain information relative to its
financial condition.

(F) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, a representation that the
broker or dealer agrees to allow representatives of the Commission or its designated examining
authority, if requested in writing for purposes of an examination of the broker or dealer, to
review the audit documentation associated with the reports of the independent public accountant
filed under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, ‘‘audit
documentation’’ has the meaning provided in standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board. The Commission anticipates that, if requested, it will accord confidential
treatment to all documents it may obtain from an independent public accountant under this
paragraph to the extent permitted by law.

(2)(i) To prepare an independent public accountant’s report based on an examination of
the statements required under paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A)(2) through (5) of this section in the
compliance report required to be filed by the broker or dealer under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B)(1) of
this section in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;
or
(ii) To prepare an independent public accountant’s report based on a review of the
statements required under paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section in the exemption
report required to be filed by the broker or dealer under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B)(2) of this section,
in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
(h) Notification of non-compliance or material weakness. If, during the course of
preparing the independent public accountant’s reports required under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of
this section, the independent public accountant determines that the broker or dealer is not in

387 


compliance with § 240.15c3-1, § 240.15c3-3, § 240.17a-13, or § 240.18a-4 [as proposed at 77
FR 70214, Nov. 23, 2012] or any rule of the designated examining authority of the broker or
dealer that requires account statements to be sent to the customers of the broker or dealer, as
applicable, or the independent public accountant determines that any material weaknesses (as
defined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section) exist, the independent public accountant must
immediately notify the chief financial officer of the broker or dealer of the nature of the noncompliance or material weakness. If the notice from the accountant concerns an instance of noncompliance that would require a broker or dealer to provide a notification under § 240.15c3-1, §
240.15c3-3, or § 240.17a-11, or if the notice concerns a material weakness, the broker or dealer
must provide a notification in accordance with § 240.15c3-1, § 240.15c3-3, or § 240.17a-11, as
applicable, and provide a copy of the notification to the independent public accountant. If the
independent public accountant does not receive the notification within one business day, or if the
independent public accountant does not agree with the statements in the notification, then the
independent public accountant must notify the Commission and the designated examining
authority within one business day. The report from the accountant must, if the broker or dealer
failed to file a notification, describe any instances of non-compliance that required a notification
under §§ 240.15c3-1, 240.15c3-3, or 240.17a-11, or any material weaknesses. If the broker or
dealer filed a notification, the report from the accountant must detail the aspects of the
notification of the broker or dealer with which the accountant does not agree.
Note to paragraph (h). The attention of the broker or dealer and the independent public
accountant is called to the fact that under § 240.17a-11(a)(1), among other things, a broker or
dealer whose net capital declines below the minimum required pursuant to § 240.15c3-1 must
give notice of such deficiency that same day in accordance with § 240.17a-11(h) and the notice

388 


must specify the broker or dealer’s net capital requirement and its current amount of net capital.
The attention of the broker or dealer and accountant also is called to the fact that under
§ 240.15c3-3(i), if a broker or dealer shall fail to make a reserve bank account or special account
deposit, as required by § 240.15c3-3, the broker or dealer must immediately notify the
Commission and the regulatory authority for the broker or dealer, which examines such broker or
dealer as to financial responsibility and must promptly thereafter confirm such notification in
writing.

effective during the most recent fiscal year;
(3) The Internal Control Over Compliance of the security-based swap dealer was
effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year;

(5) The information used to assert compliance with §§ 240.18a-1 and 240.18a-4(c) [as
proposed at 77 FR 70214, Nov. 23, 2012] was derived from the books and records of the

year.
(ii) The term Internal Control Over Compliance means internal controls that have the
objective of providing the security-based swap dealer with reasonable assurance that noncompliance with §§ 240.18a-1, 240.18a-4(c) [as proposed at 77 FR 70214, Nov. 23, 2012], or

Compliance was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year if there were one or more

425 


material weaknesses in its internal control as of the end of the most recent fiscal year. A material
weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in Internal Control Over Compliance
such that there is a reasonable possibility that non-compliance with §§ 240.18a-1 or 240.18a-4(c)

23, 2012], except for paragraph (c), or § 240.18a-9 will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. A deficiency in Internal Control Over Compliance exists when the design or operation of
a control does not allow the management or employees of the security-based swap dealer in the
normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect on a timely basis noncompliance with § 240.18a-1,§ 240.18a-4 [as proposed at 77 FR 70214, Nov. 23, 2012], or

region in which the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant has its
principal place of business and the Commission's principal office in Washington, DC.

to each of the confidential and non-confidential portions of the annual reports separately bound
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section a complete and executed Part III of Form X-17A-5
(§ 249.617 of this chapter). The oath or affirmation made in Part III of Form X-17A-5 must be
made before a person duly authorized to administer such oaths or affirmations. If the security-

426 


based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant is a sole proprietorship, the oath or
affirmation must be made by the proprietor; if a partnership, by a general partner; if a
corporation, by a duly authorized officer; or if a limited liability company or limited liability
partnership, by the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, manager, managing member,
or those members vested with management authority for the limited liability company or limited
liability partnership.
(2) The annual reports filed under paragraph (c) of this section are not confidential,
except that, if the Statement of Financial Condition is in a format that is consistent with Form
SBS (§ 249.617 of this chapter), and is bound separately from the balance of the annual reports
filed under paragraph (c) of this section, and each page of the balance of the annual report is
stamped “confidential,” then the balance of the annual reports will be deemed confidential to the
extent permitted by law. However, the annual reports, including the confidential portions, will
be available for official use by any official or employee of the U.S. or any State, by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board, and by any other person if the Commission authorizes
disclosure of the annual reports to that person as being in the public interest. Nothing contained
in this paragraph (d)(2) may be construed to be in derogation of the right of customers of a
security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, upon request to the
security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, to obtain information
relative to its financial condition.
(e)(1) Qualifications of independent public accountant. The independent public
accountant must be qualified and independent in accordance with § 210.2-01 of this chapter. In

dealer or major security-based swap participant that is required to file annual reports under

participant if earlier) a statement as prescribed in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section with the
Commission's principal office in Washington, DC and the regional office of the Commission for
the region in which its principal place of business is located. Such statement must be dated no
later than December 1 (or 20 calendar days after the effective date of its registration as a
security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, if earlier). If the
engagement of an independent public accountant is of a continuing nature, providing for
successive engagements, no further filing is required. If the engagement is for a single year, or if
the most recent engagement has been terminated or amended, a new statement must be filed by
the required date.
(ii) The statement must be headed "Statement regarding independent public accountant
under Rule 18a-7(e)(2)" and must contain the following information and representations:
(A) Name, address, telephone number and registration number of the security-based
swap dealer or major security-based swap participant;
(B) Name, address, and telephone number of the independent public accountant;
(C) The date of the fiscal year of the annual reports of the security-based swap dealer or
major security-based swap participant covered by the engagement;

428 


(3) Replacement of accountant. A security-based swap dealer or major security-based
swap participant must file a notice which must be received by the Commission's principal office
in Washington, DC and the regional office of the Commission for the region in which its
principal place of business is located not more than 15 business days after:
(i) The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant has notified
the independent public accountant that provided the reports the security-based swap dealer or
major security-based swap participant filed under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section for the
most recent fiscal year that the independent public accountant’s services will not be used in
future engagements; or
(ii) The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant has notified
an independent public accountant that was engaged to provide the reports required under
paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section that the engagement has been terminated; or
(iii) An independent public accountant has notified the security-based swap dealer or
major security-based swap participant that the independent public accountant would not continue
under an engagement to provide the reports required under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section;
or
(iv) A new independent public accountant has been engaged to provide the reports
required under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section without any notice of termination having
been given to or by the previously engaged independent public accountant.
(v) The notice must include:
(A) The date of notification of the termination of the engagement or of the engagement
of the new independent public accountant, as applicable; and

429 


(B) The details of any issues arising during the 24 months (or the period of the
engagement, if less than 24 months) preceding the termination or new engagement relating to
any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, auditing scope or
procedure, or compliance with applicable rules of the Commission, which issues, if not resolved
to the satisfaction of the former independent public accountant, would have caused the
independent public accountant to make reference to them in the report of the independent public
accountant. The issues required to be reported include both those resolved to the former
independent public accountant's satisfaction and those not resolved to the former accountant's
satisfaction. Issues contemplated by this section are those which occur at the decision-making
level – that is, between principal financial officers of the security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant and personnel of the accounting firm responsible for rendering
its report. The notice must also state whether the accountant's report filed under paragraph
(c)(1)(i)(C) of this section for any of the past two fiscal years contained an adverse opinion or a
disclaimer of opinion or was qualified as to uncertainties, audit scope, or accounting principles,
and must describe the nature of each such adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, or
qualification. The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant must also
request the former independent public accountant to furnish the security-based swap dealer or
major security-based swap participant with a letter addressed to the Commission stating whether
the independent public accountant agrees with the statements contained in the notice of the
security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant and, if not, stating the
respects in which the independent public accountant does not agree. The security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant must file three copies of the notice and the
accountant's letter, one copy of which must be manually signed by the sole proprietor, or a

430 


general partner or a duly authorized corporate, limited liability company, or limited liability
partnership officer or member, as appropriate, and by the independent public accountant,
respectively.
(f) Engagement of the independent public accountant. The independent public
accountant engaged by the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant
to provide the reports required under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section must, as part of the
engagement, undertake the following, as applicable:
(1) To prepare an independent public accountant’s report based on an examination of the
financial report required to be filed by the security-based swap dealer or major security-based
swap participant under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section in accordance with standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; and
(2) To prepare an independent public accountant’s report based on an examination of the
statements required under paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(A)(2) through (5) of this section in the compliance
report required to be filed by the security-based swap dealer under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this
section in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
(g) Notification of non-compliance or material weakness. If, during the course of
preparing the independent public accountant’s reports required under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of
this section, the independent public accountant determines that:
(1) A security-based swap dealer is not in compliance with § 240.18a-1, § 240.18a-4 [as
proposed at 77 FR 70214, Nov. 23, 2012], or § 240.18a-9, or the independent public accountant
determines that any material weaknesses (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section) exist,
the independent public accountant must immediately notify the chief financial officer of the
security-based swap dealer of the nature of the non-compliance or material weakness. If the

431 


notice from the accountant concerns an instance of non-compliance that would require a
security-based swap dealer to provide a notification under § 240.18a-8 or if the notice concerns a
material weakness, the security-based swap dealer must provide a notification in accordance with
§ 240.18a-8, as applicable, and provide a copy of the notification to the independent public
accountant. If the independent public accountant does not receive the notification within one
business day, or if the independent public accountant does not agree with the statements in the
notification, then the independent public accountant must notify the Commission within one
business day. The report from the accountant must, if the security-based swap dealer failed to
file a notification, describe any instances of non-compliance that required a notification under §
240.18a-8 or any material weakness. If the security-based swap dealer filed a notification, the
report from the accountant must detail the aspects of the notification of the security-based swap
dealer with which the accountant does not agree; or
(2) A major security-based swap participant is not in compliance with § 240.18a-2 [as
proposed at 77 FR 70214, Nov. 23, 2012], the independent public accountant must immediately
notify the chief financial officer of the major security-based swap participant of the nature of the
non-compliance. If the notice from the accountant concerns an instance of non-compliance that
would require a major security-based swap participant to provide a notification under § 240.18a8, the major security-based swap participant must provide a notification in accordance with §
240.18a-8 and provide a copy of the notification to the independent public accountant. If the
independent public accountant does not receive the notification within one business day, or if the
independent public accountant does not agree with the statements in the notification, then the
independent public accountant must notify the Commission within one business day. The report
from the accountant must, if the major security-based swap participant failed to file a

432 


notification, describe any instances of non-compliance that required a notification under
§ 240.18a-8. If the major security-based swap participant filed a notification, the report from the
accountant must detail the aspects of the notification of the major security-based swap
participant with which the accountant does not agree.
Note to paragraph (g): The attention of the security-based swap dealer, major securitybased swap participant, and the independent public accountant is called to the fact that under
§ 240.18a-8(a), among other things, a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap
participant whose net capital or tangible net worth, as applicable, declines below the minimum
required pursuant to § 240.18a-1 or § 240.18a-2 [as proposed at 77 FR 70214, Nov. 23, 2012], as
applicable, must give notice of such deficiency that same day in accordance with § 240.18a-8(h)
and the notice must specify the security-based swap dealer’s net capital requirement and its
current amount of net capital, or the extent of the major security-based swap participant’s failure
to maintain positive tangible net worth, as applicable.
(h) Reports of the independent public accountant required under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C)
of this section.
(1) Technical requirements. The independent public accountant’s reports must:
(i) Be dated;
(ii) Be signed manually;
(iii) Indicate the city and state where issued; and
(iv) Identify without detailed enumeration the items covered by the reports.
(2) Representations. The independent public accountant's reports must:
(i) State whether the examinations were made in accordance with standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board; and

433 


(ii) Identify any examination procedures deemed necessary by the independent public
accountant under the circumstances of the particular case which have been omitted and the
reason for their omission.
(iii) Nothing in this section may be construed to imply authority for the omission of any
procedure that independent public accountants would ordinarily employ in the course of an
examination for the purpose of expressing the opinions required under this section.
(3) Opinion to be expressed. The independent public accountant’s reports must state
clearly:
(i) The opinion of the independent public accountant with respect to the financial report
required under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section and the accounting principles and practices
reflected in that report; and
(ii) The opinion of the independent public accountant with respect to the financial report
required under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section, as to the consistency of the application of
the accounting principles, or as to any changes in those principles which have a material effect
on the financial statements; and
(iii) The opinion of the independent public accountant with respect to the statements
required under paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(A)(2) through (5) of this section in the compliance report
required under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section.
(4) Exceptions. Any matters to which the independent public accountant takes exception
must be clearly identified, the exceptions must be specifically and clearly stated, and, to the
extent practicable, the effect of each such exception on any related items contained in the annual
reports required under paragraph (c) of this section must be given.

434 


(i) Extensions and exemptions – on written request of a security-based swap dealer or
major security-based swap participant to the Commission or on its own motion, the Commission
may grant an extension of time or an exemption from any of the requirements of this section
either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions.
(j) Notification of change of fiscal year –
(1) In the event any security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant
for which there is no prudential regulator finds it necessary to change its fiscal year, it must file,
with the Commission’s principal office in Washington, DC and the regional office of the
Commission for the region in which the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap
participant has its principal place of business, a notice of such change.
(2) Such notice must contain a detailed explanation of the reasons for the change. Any
change in the filing period for the annual reports must be approved by the Commission.
(k) Filing Requirements. For purposes of filing requirements as described in this section,
filing will be deemed to have been accomplished upon receipt at the Commission's principal
office in Washington, DC, with duplicate originals simultaneously filed at the locations
prescribed in the particular paragraph of this section which is applicable.
§ 240.18a-8 Notification provisions for security-based swap dealers and major securitybased swap participants.

registered as a broker or dealer under section 15(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)). A broker or
dealer registered under section 15(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)), including a broker or dealer
registered as a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant under section

435 


15F(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)), is subject to the notification requirements under §
240.17a-11.
(a)(1)(i) Every security-based swap dealer for which there is no prudential regulator

paragraph (h) of this section. The notice must specify the security-based swap dealer’s net
capital requirement and its current amount of net capital. If a security-based swap dealer is
informed by the Commission that it is, or has been, in violation of § 240.18a-1 [as proposed at 77
FR 70214, Nov. 23, 2012] and the security-based swap dealer has not given notice of the capital
deficiency under this section, the security-based swap dealer, even if it does not agree that it is,
or has been, in violation of § 240.18a-1 [as proposed at 77 FR 70214, Nov. 23, 2012], must give
notice of the claimed deficiency, which notice may specify the security-based swap dealer’s
reasons for its disagreement.
(ii) Every security-based swap dealer for which there is no prudential regulator whose
tentative net capital declines below the minimum amount required pursuant to § 240.18a-1 [as

not given notice of the capital deficiency under this section, the security-based swap dealer, even
if it does not agree that it is, or has been, in violation of § 240.18a-1 [as proposed at 77 FR

Nov. 23, 2012] and the major security-based swap participant has not given notice of the capital
deficiency under this section, the major security-based swap participant, even if it does not agree

must give notice of the claimed deficiency, which notice may specify the major security-based

(1) If a computation made by a security-based swap dealer pursuant to § 240.18a-1 [as

that the amount of liquidity reserve is insufficient.
(g) If a security-based swap dealer fails to make in its special account for the exclusive

§ 240.18a-9 Quarterly security counts to be made by certain security-based swap dealers.

439 


Section 240.18a-9 applies to a security-based swap dealer registered under 15F(b) of the
Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-8(b)) that is not also registered as a broker or dealer under section 15(b) of
the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)); provided, however, that this § 240.18a-9 does not apply to a securitybased swap dealer that has a prudential regulator. A broker or dealer registered under section
15(b) of the Act, including a broker or dealer registered as a security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant under section 15F(b) of the Act, is subject to the securities count
requirements under § 240.17a-13.
(a) Any security-based swap dealer that is subject to the provisions of this rule must at
least once in each calendar quarter-year:
(1) Physically examine and count all securities held including securities that are the
subjects of repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements;
(2) Account for all securities in transfer, in transit, pledged, loaned, borrowed, deposited,
failed to receive, failed to deliver, subject to repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements or
otherwise subject to its control or direction but not in its physical possession by examination and
comparison of the supporting detailed records with the appropriate ledger control accounts;
(3) Verify all securities in transfer, in transit, pledged, loaned, borrowed, deposited,
failed to receive, failed to deliver, subject to repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements or
otherwise subject to its control or direction but not in its physical possession, where such
securities have been in said status for longer than thirty days;
(4) Compare the results of the count and verification with its records; and
(5) Record on the books and records of the security-based swap dealer all unresolved
differences setting forth the security involved and date of comparison in a security count
difference account no later than 7 business days after the date of each required quarterly security

440 


examination, count, and verification in accordance with the requirements provided in paragraph
(b) of this section. Provided, however, that no examination, count, verification, and comparison
for the purpose of this section is within 2 months of or more than 4 months following a prior
examination, count, verification, and comparison made hereunder.
(b) The examination, count, verification, and comparison may be made either as of a date
certain or on a cyclical basis covering the entire list of securities. In either case the recordation
must be effected within 7 business days subsequent to the examination, count, verification, and
comparison of a particular security. In the event that an examination, count, verification, and
comparison is made on a cyclical basis, it may not extend over more than 1 calendar quarteryear, and no security may be examined, counted, verified, or compared for the purpose of this
rule within 2 months of or more than 4 months after a prior examination, count, verification, and
comparison.
(c) The examination, count, verification, and comparison must be made or supervised by
persons whose regular duties do not require them to have direct responsibility for the proper care
and protection of the securities or the making or preservation of the subject records.
(d) The Commission may, upon written request, exempt from the provisions of this
section, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, any security-based swap
dealer that satisfies the Commission that it is not necessary in the public interest and for the
protection of investors to subject the particular security-based swap dealer to certain or all of the
provisions of this section, because of the special nature of its business, the safeguards it has
established for the protection of customers’ funds and securities, or such other reason as the
Commission deems appropriate.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
FOCUS Report Form SBS (“Form SBS”) constitutes the basic report required of those firms registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) as security-based swap dealers (“SBSDs”) or major securitybased swap participants (“MSBSPs”). The instructions issued from time-to-time must be used in preparing Form
SBS and are considered an integral part of this report.
Who Must File
An SBSD or MSBSP must file Form SBS. The Form consists of five Parts, which apply to an SBSD or MSBSP
based on the firm’s registration status: (1) an SBSD or MSBSP that is not also registered as a broker-dealer or bank
(respectively, a “stand-alone SBSD” or “stand-alone MSBSP”); (2) an SBSD or MSBSP that also is registered as a
broker-dealer (respectively, a “broker-dealer SBSD” or “broker-dealer MSBSP”); (3) an SBSD or MSBSP supervised
by a prudential regulator (respectively, a “bank SBSD” or “bank MSBSP”); or (4) any of the above if the SBSD or
MSBSP also is registered as a futures commission merchant (“FCM”). An SBSD or MSBSP must complete: (1) Parts
1 and 4 of Form SBS if it is a stand-alone SBSD, broker-dealer SBSD, stand-alone MSBSP, or broker-dealer
MSBSP; or (2) Parts 2 and 5 of Form SBS if it is a bank SBSD or bank MSBSP. In addition to completing those
parts, the SBSD or MSBSP also must complete Part 3 if is also registered as an FCM.
Filing Requirements
Form SBS must be filed by nonbank SBSDs and nonbank MSBSPs within 17 business days of the end of the
month in accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 240.17a-5 or 17 C.F.R. § 240.18a-7, as applicable. Form SBS must be filed
by bank SBSDs and bank MSBSPs within 17 business days of the end of the quarter in accordance with 17 C.F.R.
§ 240.18a-7.
Form SBS must be filed with the firm’s designated examining authority (“DEA”), or if none, then with the
Commission or its designee. The name of the SBSD or MSBSP and the report’s effective date must be repeated on
each sheet of the report submitted. If no response is made to a line item or subdivision thereof, it constitutes a
representation that the SBSD or MSBSP has nothing to report.
Consolidated Reporting
In computing net capital, firms should consolidate their assets and liabilities in accordance with 17 C.F.R.
§§ 240.15c3-1c or 18a-1c, as applicable.
Currency
Foreign currency may be expressed in terms of U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange as of the report’s effective
date and, where carried in conjunction with the U.S. dollar, balances for the same accountholder may be
consolidated with U.S. dollar balances and the gross or net position reported in its proper classification, provided the
foreign currency is not subject to any restriction as to conversion.
Rounding
As a general rule, money amounts should be expressed in whole dollars. No valuation should be used which is
higher than the actual valuation, i.e., for $170,000.85, use $170,000 but not $170,001. However, for any or all-short
valuations, round up the valuation to the nearest dollar, i.e., for $180,000.17, use $180,001 but not $180,000. Money
amounts should be expressed in whole dollars.
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
Financial statements must be prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, applied
on a basis consistent with that of the preceding report and must include, in the basic statement or accompanying
footnotes, all informative disclosures necessary to make the statement a clear expression of the organization’s
financial and operational condition. The broker or dealer must report all data after proper accruals have been made
for income and expense not recorded in the books of account and adequate reserves have been provided for deficits
in customer or broker accounts, unrecorded liabilities, security differences, dividends and similar items.

494 


The amount of terms (including commitment fees and the conditions under which lines may be withdrawn) of
unused lines of credit for short-term financing must be disclosed, if significant, in notes to the financial statements.

360	

Allowable – securities purchased under agreements to resell. Report the gross contract value receivable
(contract price) of reverse repurchase agreements that are deemed to be adequately secured. Contract
price includes accrued interest on the contract at the repurchase agreement’s rate (not the underlying

prepaid expenses, and deferred charges.

536	

Allowable – other assets – collateral accepted under ASC 860. Report here the market value of securities
received that are required to be reported under ASC 860.
Securities held as collateral for stock loan transactions are recognized as both an asset (Securities
accepted under ASC 860 (Line Item 536)) and as a liability (Obligation to return securities (Line Item 1686)).
Example: A firm loans 100 shares of stock valued at $1050 and receives stock collateral valued at
$1000. The market value of the collateral received should be reported on the FOCUS as follows:
Debit
Credit

special purpose entity (“SPE”) that do not qualify for sale treatment under ASC 860. Financial assets that
have been transferred to a qualifying SPE do not need to be reported on Form SBS. Financial assets that
have been transferred to a SPE that is not a qualifying SPE fail to qualify for sale treatment generally
because effective control over the assets is still maintained.

550	

Nonallowable – receivables from brokers/dealers and clearing organizations – other. Report nonallowable
or aged receivables from brokers/dealers and clearing organizations including floor brokerage,
commissions, trade date adjustment, and all other nonallowable gross receivables from brokers/dealers and
clearing organizations not already reported. Do not net unrelated receivables versus payables.

560	

Nonallowable – receivables from customers – securities accounts – partly secured accounts. Report those
portions of partly secured customer accounts that have not been secured by securities deemed to have a
ready market. See 17 C.F.R. § 240.15c3-1 or 17 C.F.R. § 240.18a-1, as applicable. Report deficits in partly
secured accounts of the introducing firm. Both the carrying broker and the introducing broker must report
this if their clearing agreement states that such deficits are the liability of the introducing broker.

498 


605	

Nonallowable – securities purchased under agreements to resell. Report the gross contract value
receivable (contract price) of reverse repurchase agreements that are not deemed to be adequately
secured. If collateral that secures a reverse repurchase receivable is non-marketable or illiquid, then the
amount receivable is nonallowable and should be reported here. Contract price includes accrued interest
