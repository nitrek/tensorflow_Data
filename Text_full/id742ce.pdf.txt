Procedural Background
On September 30, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) issued
an Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings (OIP) against China
Ruitai and the Individual Respondents (collectively, Respondents), pursuant to Exchange Act
Sections 4C and 21C and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
At an October 29, 2013, prehearing conference, the Division confirmed that it was in the
process of effecting service on the Individual Respondents in China pursuant to the Hague
Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or
Commercial Matters. Tr. 3-4.2 Service was completed on May 19, 2014. China Ruitai Int’l
Holdings Co., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 1587, 2014 SEC LEXIS 2397 (July 7, 2014).
On July 7, 2014, I ordered the Individual Respondents to show cause on or before July 17, 2014,
why this proceeding should not be determined against them due to their failure to file answers or
otherwise defend this proceeding. Id.
The Individual Respondents failed to answer the OIP or to show cause. I found the
Individual Respondents in default and directed the Division to file a motion for sanctions,
supported by sufficient evidence in accordance with Rapoport v. SEC, 682 F.3d 98 (D.C. Cir.
2012).3 See China Ruitai Int’l Holdings Co., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 1626, 2014 SEC

The Individual Respondents are in default for failing to answer the OIP or otherwise
defend this proceeding. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, except as

Findings of Fact
A.

Respondents

China Ruitai, incorporated in Delaware and located in the People’s Republic of China
(PRC or China), is a manufacturer of deeply processed chemicals used primarily in the
production of PVC, cosmetics, foods, and paints. OIP at 2. At all relevant times, China Ruitai’s
common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g) and
quoted on OTC Link, operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (formerly known as the “Pink
Sheets”) (OTC Link), under the ticker symbol “CRUI.” Id.
Min Ma, age forty-six, resides in the PRC and has been a Director and Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) of China Ruitai since 2007. Id. Min Ma, along with the President of China
Ruitai, owns 100% of the capital stock of Shandong Ruitai Chemical Co., Ltd. (Shandong
Ruitai), a related party to China Ruitai. Id. Min Ma also serves as the Finance Manager for
Taian Ruitai Cellulose Co., Ltd. (Taian Ruitai), a majority-owned (ninety-nine percent)
subsidiary of China Ruitai.5 Id.
Gang Ma, age forty, resides in the PRC and has been Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of
China Ruitai since 2007. Id. Gang Ma is also the Director of the Financial Department for Taian
Ruitai. Id.
Tian, age thirty-eight, resides in the PRC and has been a Director and Chief Accounting
Officer (CAO) of China Ruitai since 2007. Id. Tian is also an accountant for Taian Ruitai. Id.
B.

Related Entities
Taian Ruitai is located in the PRC and is the operational subsidiary of China Ruitai. OIP

at 2.

The Motion also refers to a second “Exhibit A” purportedly containing a summary of trading
activity in China Ruitai’s stock between September 30, 2010, and December 31, 2012, derived
from Yahoo Finance. Motion at 31. This exhibit was previously submitted as an attachment to
the Division’s Supplemental Motion for Sanctions against China Ruitai filed on April 17, 2014.
I refer to this exhibit as Supplemental Exhibit A.

According to China Ruitai’s 2011 Quarterly Reports, China Ruitai is a holding company,
whose business (along with another entity) is to hold an equity interest in Taian Ruitai. Div. Ex.
B at 5; Div. Ex. C at 5; Div. Ex. D at 7.
3

Shandong Ruitai, located in the PRC, is a related party to China Ruitai and holds one
percent of the capital stock of Taian Ruitai. Id. Shandong Ruitai is one-hundred percent owned
by Min Ma and China Ruitai’s President. Id. Shandong Ruitai is a dealer of hot steam, which it
sells to Taian Ruitai. Id.
C.

China Ruitai’s Misconduct and Auditor’s Resignation

From approximately January to December 2011, Respondents orchestrated a scheme to
fraudulently obtain up to $40 million in bank financing using falsified documents. OIP at 3.
China Ruitai, through its subsidiary, Taian Ruitai, falsified purchase orders to purchase steam
from Shandong Ruitai. Id. Aided by the cooperation of Shandong Ruitai, Taian Ruitai obtained
invoices from Shandong Ruitai for the fake purchase orders. Id.; see Div. Ex. J at 1. Taian
Ruitai then presented the fake invoices and purchase orders to various banks to obtain bank
acceptance notes. OIP at 3. Per the terms of the acceptance notes, China Ruitai deposited
between thirty and one hundred percent of the invoice amount with the bank, and the bank paid
the stated invoice amount to Shandong Ruitai. Id. The amounts that China Ruitai placed on
deposit with the banks were held in reserve until China Ruitai repaid the bank acceptance notes.
Id.
After Shandong Ruitai received funds from the banks, Shandong Ruitai typically
provided the funds to Taian Ruitai to be used as operating capital. Id. At other times, Shandong
Ruitai retained a portion of the funds for its own operational needs. Id. In both scenarios, the
scheme was effectuated by the efforts of China Ruitai as the originator of the purchase orders.
Id.; see Div. Ex. J. at 1.
During the time period of the scheme, China Ruitai filed Forms 10-Q for the periods
ended March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011, and September 30, 2011, and a Form 10-Q/A for the
period ended June 30, 2011 (Amendment). OIP at 3; Div. Exs. B-E. In its 2011 Quarterly
Reports and Amendment, China Ruitai did not disclose its obligations to the banks, the scheme it
was utilizing to provide working capital, and the risks associated with the ongoing scheme. OIP
at 3; see Div. Exs. B-E; cf. Div. Ex. F at 1-3; Div. Ex. J at 1. As a result of the scheme, China
Ruitai’s related-party obligations to Shandong Ruitai increased over $40 million, or in excess of
1,300 percent, from December 31, 2010, to December 31, 2011.6 Div. Ex. F at 1; Div. Ex. J at 1.
China Ruitai’s first Form 10-Q of 2011 reported a balance of nearly $8 million payable to
Shandong Ruitai. Div. Ex. B at 2, 13. Its second Form 10-Q of 2011 reported a balance payable
to Shandong Ruitai of over $24 million. Div. Ex. C at 2, 14. And its third Form 10-Q of 2011
reported a balance payable to Shandong Ruitai of over $34.5 million. Div. Ex. D at 4, 16.
As of September 30, 2011, China Ruitai’s related-party obligations to Shandong Ruitai
represented over thirty-six percent of its total liabilities and over thirty-seven percent of its
current liabilities. Div. Ex. D at 4; see OIP at 3; cf. China Ruitai Int’l Holdings Co., 2014 SEC
LEXIS 2817, at *10 (“over thirty-seven percent of its total liabilities”). The failure to disclose
6

Although the OIP alleges that the increase in related-party obligations was 1,600 percent, that
percentage is not supported by the evidence. OIP at 3; Div. Ex. F at 1; Div. Ex. J at 1.
4

the obligations to the banks and the nature of the activity to obtain bank financing
misrepresented the actual operations, obligations, solvency, and liquidity of China Ruitai.7 OIP
at 3. In footnotes to the financial statements contained in its 2011 Quarterly Reports, China
Ruitai described the resulting obligations as related-party notes payable that were “non-interest
bearing for the purpose of financing the Company’s operations due to a lack of working capital,
and have no fixed terms of repayment.” Id.; Div. Ex. B at 13; Div. Ex. C at 14; Div. Ex. D at 16.
These statements were false and misleading because they failed to disclose the nature and terms
of the obligations to the banks. OIP at 3. Furthermore, the loans themselves constituted an
undisclosed risk to the company, in view of their illegality. Id.; see Div. Exs. H-L.
Min Ma and Gang Ma each signed China Ruitai’s Quarterly Reports, as well as
certifications for those filings. OIP at 3; Div. Ex. B at 24 and Cert. Exs. 31.1-32.2; Div. Ex. C at
26 and Cert. Exs. 31.1-32.2; Div. Ex. D at 29 and Cert. Exs. 31.1-32.2. The Quarterly Reports
incorrectly stated that they did not “contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under
which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
report.” OIP at 3-4; Div. Ex. B at Cert. Exs. 31.1-31.2; Div. Ex. C at Cert. Exs. 31.1-31.2; Div.
Ex. D at Cert. Exs. 31.1-31.2. In fact, the statements and representations in China Ruitai’s
filings were materially misleading. OIP at 4.
Min Ma, Gang Ma, and Tian facilitated China Ruitai’s violations by perpetuating the
illegal scheme and directly and indirectly filing or causing to be filed with the Commission the
materially misleading 2011 Quarterly Reports and Amendment. Id. In particular, Min Ma and
Gang Ma signed certifications for those reports and attested to their accuracy. Id.; Div. Exs. BD. These were misrepresentations because Min Ma, Gang Ma, and Tian knew or were reckless
in not knowing that the bank financing transactions were illegal and that China Ruitai failed to
disclose its obligations to the banks. Id. China Ruitai could not have continued its scheme
without the substantial assistance of the Individual Respondents, and their fraudulent conduct is
imputable to China Ruitai. Id.
During fiscal year 2011, China Ruitai retained the independent registered public
accounting firm of Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk LLP (Marcum), a New York CPA firm with
offices in the PRC. Id. Marcum performed the review procedures for each of the first three
quarters of 2011. Id. In each of these quarters, China Ruitai provided to Marcum management
representation letters signed by Min Ma, Gang Ma, and Tian. Id. The representation letters
7

The OIP alleges, without further explanation, that “[t]he misstatements made it appear that
China Ruitai was meeting its working capital requirements with cash flows generated from
business activities, rather than financing from banks.” OIP at 3. It is not clear from the OIP or
an independent review of the 2011 Quarterly Reports how misstatements about China Ruitai’s
debt financing would have misled investors into believing that the company was meeting its
working capital requirements with cash flows generated from business activities. The 2011
Quarterly Reports make apparent that China Ruitai had negative working capital and a
significant decrease in cash flows from operating activities compared to 2010, and an increase in
cash flow generated from financing through related-party notes. Div. Ex. B at 4, 21; Div. Ex. C
at 4, 23-24; Div. Ex. D at 6, 26.
5

included misleading statements that: (1) management had no knowledge of any fraud; (2) all
related-party transactions had been properly disclosed; and (3) there had been no violations of
laws. Id.; see Div. Ex. G. These statements were misleading because China Ruitai’s scheme
was a violation of PRC laws, and the description of the related-party obligations misrepresented
the true nature of the activity. OIP at 4; see Div. Exs. H-L. Because of their management
positions as CEO, CFO, and CAO respectively, Min Ma, Gang Ma, and Tian knew or were
reckless in not knowing the true nature of the transactions and that the financing was obtained
fraudulently and illegally. OIP at 4. They also knew or were reckless in not knowing that the
misrepresentations would be incorporated into China Ruitai’s public filings and that the public
filings misrepresented the true nature of the transactions. Id.
Marcum also performed audit procedures in preparation for the filing of China Ruitai’s
Form 10-K. Id. As part of these audit procedures, Marcum performed substantive and analytical
procedures on the related-party balances between Taian Ruitai and Shandong Ruitai. Id.
Marcum made repeated inquiries regarding the related-party balances to employees of China
Ruitai, but the employees were uncooperative. Id. Despite the lack of cooperation, Marcum
identified at least $66.7 million in potentially fake purchase orders. Id. When confronted with
this information, Gang Ma admitted that the purchase orders and corresponding invoices
between Shandong Ruitai and Taian Ruitai were fictitious and that “no real deal occurred
between the two entities.” Div. Ex. F at 2; see OIP at 4. In a February 2012 audit findings and
issues memo, Marcum concluded that if these facts were true, China Ruitai’s behavior violated
Article 10 of the PRC’s Negotiable Instruments Law, which provides that: “The draft,
acquisition and transfer of a negotiable instrument shall follow the principle of authenticity and
credibility and be treated as a real act of trading or debt payment.” Div. Ex. F at 3. Marcum
expressed concern about exposure under the PRC’s Criminal Law and doubt about the integrity
of China Ruitai’s management. Id.
As a result of its discovery, Marcum demanded that China Ruitai obtain a legal opinion
regarding the legality of the above-described conduct in relation to PRC law. OIP at 4; see Div.
Ex. J at 2. China Ruitai, through its subsidiary Taian Ruitai, obtained a legal opinion from
counsel in the PRC, the Global Law Office, which concluded that the conduct violated Article 10
of the PRC’s Negotiable Instruments Law. OIP at 4-5; Div. Ex. H. The Global Law Office,
however, stated that PRC laws “do not provide specific penalties for this behavior, so there’s no
material responsibility under the Negotiable Instruments Law.” Div. Ex. H. at 1. For risks under
Article 175 of the PRC’s Criminal Law, the Global Law Office stated:
[Taian] Ruitai had signed series Acceptance Agreements with cooperating banks
before transferring bank acceptances to Shandong Ruitai . . . , which shows
[Taian] Ruitai had no fraud intention as the banks knew [Taian] Ruitai’s purpose
and process of using the acceptances. What’s more, the Basic Credit Report
shows, up to March 26, 2012, [Taian] Ruitai had no outstanding non-performing
loans, so no serious loss is caused to the banks, and no serious consequence had
been resulted.
Id. at 1-2.

6

Marcum obtained a separate legal opinion from Chinese counsel associated with the
international law firm DLA Piper, which also concluded that China Ruitai violated Article 10 of
the PRC’s Negotiable Instruments Law. OIP at 5; Div. Ex. I. Although DLA Piper agreed that
the Negotiable Instruments Law provides no specific penalties for China Ruitai’s violation, it
opined that China Ruitai could be civilly liable if it failed to repay the bank acceptance notes.
Div. Ex. I at 1-2. DLA Piper reasoned that if a lawsuit were filed against China Ruitai, the
chance of China Ruitai’s success in such a case was “unlikely to be high.” Id. at 2. DLA Piper
further opined that, under Article 175(I) of the PRC’s Criminal Law, if China Ruitai continued to
perform its obligations to the banks, with no loss to the banks, then its potential criminal liability
under Article 175(I) should be relatively low. Id. DLA Piper also opined that China Ruitai’s
conduct may constitute a violation of Article 52 of the PRC’s Contract Law, under which a
contract is invalid in circumstances where the parties intend to conceal an illegal purpose under
the guise of a legitimate transaction. Id. at 3. DLA Piper recommended disclosure of the details
of the underlying transactions in China Ruitai’s financial statements. Id. It also recommended
that the total amount of the notes, less the deposit paid by China Ruitai, should be booked as a
payable. Id.
Marcum reported its concerns to China Ruitai’s board of directors in a May 21, 2012,
letter, pursuant to Exchange Act Section 10A(b)(1), which requires the auditor to inform
management that it has information indicating an illegal act has or may have occurred. OIP at 5;
Div. Ex. J. Among other issues, Marcum reiterated its understanding that the purchase orders
underlying the bank loans (and, ultimately, the related-party notes payable to Shandong Ruitai)
were fake, and stated that it was unable to satisfactorily corroborate the fact asserted by the
Global Law Office that the banks actually knew that there were no real transactions behind the
notes. Div. Ex. J at 1-2. Min Ma, Gang Ma, and Tian all received the letter. OIP at 5; Div. Ex.
J. China Ruitai failed to take any remedial action in response to the letter. OIP at 5.
On July 25, 2012, Marcum issued a notice to China Ruitai, pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 10A(b)(2), indicating an illegal act had occurred and that failure of the company to take
remedial action would warrant resignation of Marcum as the independent registered public
accountant of China Ruitai. OIP at 5; Div. Ex. K. The notice informed China Ruitai that China
Ruitai was required to notify the Commission no later than one business day after it received
Marcum’s report, pursuant to Exchange Act Section 10A(b)(3). OIP at 5; Div. Ex. K. Min Ma,
Gang Ma, and Tian all received the letter. Div. Ex. K. Once again, China Ruitai failed to report
the matter to the Commission. OIP at 5.
On July 27, 2012, Marcum sent a letter, pursuant to Exchange Act Section 10A(b)(3), to
the Individual Respondents at China Ruitai, and sent a copy of it to the Commission. Id. at 5;
Div. Ex. L. That letter provided notice to the Individual Respondents that Marcum was resigning
from the audit engagement, effective immediately. OIP at 5; Div. Ex. L at 1. The letter also
informed China Ruitai that Marcum no longer wished to be associated with the Quarterly
Reports. OIP at 5; Div. Ex. L. The letter further requested that China Ruitai file a Form 8-K
disclosing to the Commission and to the public that Marcum should no longer be associated with
the Quarterly Reports, and that such financial statements were “not reviewed” in accordance with
Statement of Auditing Standards No. 100, as required by Rule 10-01(d) of Regulation S-X under
the Exchange Act. OIP at 5; Div. Ex. L.
7

As of the date of the OIP, China Ruitai had not complied with its obligation to report the
matter to the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 10A(b)(3). OIP at 5. China Ruitai
failed to respond to Marcum’s requests and cut off contact with Marcum. Id. In addition, China
Ruitai did not file a Form 8-K to announce the resignation of its auditor. Id.; see Div. Ex. M.
Since Marcum resigned as China Ruitai’s auditor, China Ruitai has failed to file its
required periodic reports. OIP at 5. China Ruitai’s last filing was a Form NT 10-K for the
period ended December 31, 2011, filed on March 30, 2012, notifying the Commission that it was
unable to file its Form 10-K on time. OIP at 5; see Div. Ex. N. China Ruitai’s last periodic
report filed with the Commission was its Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2011,
filed on November 14, 2011. OIP at 5; see Div. Ex. D.
D.

Exchange Act 12(j) Proceeding

On September 30, 2013, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative
Proceedings against China Ruitai, pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(j), alleging that China
Ruitai had a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the
Exchange Act and was delinquent in its current and periodic filings, in violation of Section 13(a)
of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13. China Ruitai Int’l
Holdings Co., Exchange Act Release No. 70580, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3090 (Sept. 30, 2013).
China Ruitai defaulted due to its failure to file an Answer, appear at the prehearing
conference, respond to an order to show cause, or otherwise defend the proceeding. China Ruitai
Int’l Holdings Co., Initial Decision Release No. 530, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3694, at *2-3 (Nov. 22,
2013). Accordingly, pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 155(a), I deemed the allegations
in the OIP true and issued an initial decision of default revoking the registration of China
Ruitai’s registered securities based on its failure to timely file required current and periodic
reports with the Commission, in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1, 13a11, and 13a-13. Id. at *1-3, *6-7, *10-11. On January 16, 2014, the Commission issued a notice
that the initial decision had become final. China Ruitai Int’l Holdings Co., Exchange Act
Release No. 71323, 2014 SEC LEXIS 162.
Conclusions of Law
A.

Secondary Liability

A finding of aiding and abetting requires proof of: (1) a primary violation of the
securities laws; (2) knowledge of the primary violation by the aider and abettor; and (3)
substantial assistance by the aider and abettor in the commission of the primary violation. SEC
v. DiBella, 587 F.3d 553, 566 (2d Cir. 2009). The knowledge requirement can be satisfied by
recklessness when the alleged aider and abettor is a fiduciary or an active participant. See
Geman v. SEC, 334 F.3d 1183, 1195-96 (10th Cir. 2003); Ross v. Bolton, 904 F.2d 819, 824 (2d
Cir. 1990). Negligence is sufficient to establish liability for causing a primary violation that does
not require scienter. KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, 54 S.E.C. 1135, 1175 (2001), recons. denied,
Exchange Act Release No. 44050, 2001 SEC LEXIS 422 (Mar. 5, 2001), pet. denied, 289 F.3d

109 (D.C. Cir. 2002). A respondent who aids and abets a violation also is a cause of the
violation. See Sharon M. Graham, 53 S.E.C. 1072, 1085 n.35 (1998), aff’d, 222 F.3d 994 (D.C.
Cir. 2000).
B.

Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5

Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 (collectively, Section 10(b)) make it
unlawful for any person in connection with the purchase or sale of any security to (a) employ any
device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; (b) make material misstatements or omissions; or (c)
engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or
deceit upon any person. 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b); 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5. Scienter is required to
establish violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680,
695 (1980). As explained more fully below, I find that (1) Min Ma violated Section 10(b) and
Rule 10b-5, (2) Gang Ma willfully violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and (3) Tian willfully
violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) and aided and abetted and caused China
Ruitai’s violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b).8

Fraudulent Scheme

Generally, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) prohibit schemes to
defraud. Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) make it unlawful for any person in connection with the purchase
or sale of securities to “employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud” or to “engage in any
act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any
person.” 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(a) and (c); see 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b). “Conduct itself can be
deceptive,” and there is no requirement that “there must be a specific oral or written statement
before there could be liability under § 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.” Stoneridge Inv. Partners, LLC v.
Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U.S. 148, 158 (2008).
Primary liability under Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) extends to one who employs any
manipulative or deceptive device or engages in any manipulative or deceptive act, with scienter
and in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. See John P. Flannery, Securities Act
Release No. 9689, 2014 WL 7145625, at *12 (Dec. 15, 2014). That standard “certainly would
encompass the falsification of financial records to misstate a company’s performance” and “the
orchestration of sham transactions designed to give the false appearance of business operations.”
Id. It also encompasses the “making” of a fraudulent misstatement to investors, and the drafting
or devising of such a misstatement. Id.
That is, “scheme liability does not preclude, outright, claims based upon a scheme to
misrepresent or omit material facts.” SEC v. Goldstone, 952 F. Supp. 2d 1060, 1206 (D.N.M.
2013); see In re Alstom SA Sec. Litig., 406 F. Supp. 2d 433, 475 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (stating “it is
possible for liability to arise under both subsection (b) and subsections (a) and (c) of Rule 10b-5
8

The OIP alleges that Min Ma violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, but not willfully. OIP at
5-6. “Willful” means intentionally committing the act that constitutes the violation; there is no
requirement that the actor must also be aware that she is violating any statutes or regulations.
See Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000).

out of the same set of facts, where the plaintiffs allege both that the defendants made
misrepresentations in violations of Rule 10b-5(b), as well as that the defendants undertook a
deceptive scheme or course of conduct that went beyond the misrepresentations”). Deceptive
conduct “irreducibly entails some act that gives . . . a false impression.” U.S. v. Finnerty, 533
F.3d 143, 148 (2d Cir. 2008); see Burnett v. Rowzee, 561 F. Supp. 2d 1120, 1125 (C.D. Cal.
2008) (stating that a deceptive act is one that has “the principle purpose and effect of creating a
false appearance of fact in furtherance of the scheme”) (internal quotations and citations
omitted).
The Individual Respondents’ violations included deceptive conduct beyond mere
misrepresentations in China Ruitai’s 2011 Quarterly Reports and Amendment. The Individual
Respondents orchestrated a scheme to fraudulently obtain up to $40 million in bank financing
using falsified documents. This conduct was found to have violated Article 10 of the PRC’s
Negotiable Instruments Law, and possibly Article 175(I) of the PRC’s Criminal Law and Article
52 of the PRC’s Contract Law, by two separate law firms. The Individual Respondents sought to
conceal this scheme from both China Ruitai’s auditor and its investors. For instance, during
Marcum’s review procedures for the first three quarters of 2011, the Individual Respondents
signed management representation letters that stated that (1) management had no knowledge of
any fraud, (2) all related-party transactions had been properly disclosed, and (3) there had been
no violations of laws. These and other statements were then incorporated into China Ruitai’s
2011 Quarterly Reports.
2.

Misrepresentations and Omissions

Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) make it unlawful for any person in
connection with the purchase or sale of securities to “make any untrue statement of a material
fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.” 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b); see
15 U.S.C. § 78j(b); VanCook v. SEC, 653 F.3d 130, 138 (2d Cir. 2011). Among other
requirements, Section 10(b) generally prohibits an issuer from making public statements that are
false or that fail to include material facts necessary to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. See 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b).
“[C]orporations have a duty to disclose all facts necessary to ensure the completeness and
accuracy of their public statements.” In re Marsh & McLennan Co. Sec. Litig., 501 F. Supp. 2d
452, 469 (S.D.N.Y. 2006).
In its 2011 Quarterly Reports, China Ruitai misrepresented and omitted facts regarding
its related-party obligations to Shandong Ruitai, and in its Amendment, China Ruitai omitted
facts regarding such obligations. OIP at 3-4; see Div. Exs. B-E. As a result of its scheme to
obtain bank financing, China Ruitai’s related-party obligations to Shandong Ruitai increased
over $40 million from December 2010 to December 2011. Div. Ex. F at 1; Div. Ex. J at 1; see
OIP at 3. In its 2011 Quarterly Reports, China Ruitai disclosed its related-party obligations to
Shandong Ruitai, reporting that by September 30, 2011, those obligations totaled over $34
million, or over thirty-six percent of China Ruitai’s liabilities. OIP at 3; Div. Ex. B at 2, 13; Div.
Ex. C at 2, 14; Div. Ex. D at 4, 16. However, China Ruitai: (1) inaccurately described the
resulting obligations as only related-party notes payable that were “non-interest bearing for the
10

purpose of financing the Company’s operations due to a lack of working capital and have no
fixed terms of repayment”; (2) failed to disclose its obligations to the banks and the nature of the
illegal activity to obtain bank financing, namely that it obtained such financing based on fake
purchase contracts; and (3) failed to disclose that such bank loans could result in risk to the
company if their illegal nature was exposed or challenged. OIP at 3; Div. Ex. F at 1-3; Div. Ex.
J; cf. Div. Ex. I.
In order for primary liability under Section 10(b) to attach, the alleged violator must be
the “maker” of the misleading statements. See SEC v. Wolfson, 539 F.3d 1249, 1257 (10th Cir.
2008). The “maker” of a statement is the person or entity with ultimate authority over the
statement, including its content and whether and how to communicate it. Janus Capital Grp.,
Inc. v. First Derivative Traders, 131 S. Ct. 2296, 2302 (2011). China Ruitai is thus a “maker” as
“the entity with ultimate authority over the statement.” Id. Min Ma and Gang Ma are also
“makers” because as CEO and CFO, respectively, they signed the Quarterly Reports and
Amendment and certifications that attested to their accuracy.
Although Tian is not a “maker” and thus does not have primary liability, he substantially
assisted China Ruitai’s Section 10(b) violation.
Tian signed inaccurate management
representation letters that were provided to Marcum during its review of China Ruitai for the first
three quarters of 2011, which China Ruitai needed to conceal the scheme from its auditor. The
management representation letters stated that (1) management had no knowledge of any fraud,
(2) all related-party transactions had been properly disclosed, and (3) there had been no
violations of law. These statements were misleading because China Ruitai’s scheme violated
PRC laws, and the description of the related-party obligations misrepresented the true nature of
the activity.
3.

Materiality

These misrepresentations and omissions were material because “there is ‘a substantial
likelihood that the disclosure of the [misstated or] omitted fact[s] would have been viewed by the
reasonable investor as having significantly altered the “total mix” of information made
available.’” Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 131 S. Ct. 1309, 1318 (2011) (quoting Basic
Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-32 (1988)). Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 99, issued by
the Staff of the Commission, provides guidance regarding materiality determinations. See SEC
SAB No. 99, 64 Fed. Reg. 45150 (Aug. 19, 1999) (codified at 17 C.F.R. pt. 211). Certain
qualitative factors considered include the concealment of an unlawful transaction and the
significance of the misstatement in relation to the company’s operations. See ECA & Local 134
IBEW Joint Pension Trust v. JP Morgan Chase Co., 553 F.3d 187, 197-98 (2d Cir. 2009); SAB
No. 99 at 45152 (1999).
China Ruitai’s related-party notes totaled millions of dollars, represented a significant
portion of its total liabilities, and were the result of an undisclosed and deceptive transaction. As
of March 31, 2011, China Ruitai’s related-party notes payable balance was almost $8 million,
which was about 9.7 percent of its total liabilities. Div. Ex. B at 2. As of June 30, 2011, China
Ruitai’s related-party notes payable balance was around $24.3 million, which was about twentyfive percent of its total liabilities. Div. Ex. C at 2. As of September 30, 2011, China Ruitai’s
11

related-party notes payable balance was around $34.7 million, which was about 36 percent of its
total liabilities. Div. Ex. D at 4. Both the Global Law Office and DLA Piper found that China
Ruitai’s conduct likely violated Article 10 of the PRC’s Negotiable Instruments Law, and DLA
Piper additionally found that China Ruitai could be held liable under Article 175(I) of the PRC’s
Criminal Law, and its conduct may also have constituted a violation of Article 52 of the PRC’s
Contract Law. OIP at 4-5; Div. Exs. H, I. A reasonable investor would have viewed China
Ruitai’s deceptive conduct in obtaining bank financing – in any amount, and particularly as an
increasingly larger percentage of China Ruitai’s total liabilities – as significantly altering the
total mix of information made available.
Further, Item 404 of Regulation S-K requires registrants to “[d]escribe any transaction,
since the beginning of the registrant’s last fiscal year . . . in which the registrant was or is to be a
participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any related person had or
will have a direct or indirect material interest” in Forms 10-K. 17 C.F.R. § 229.404(a).
Similarly, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 57 provides that a public
company’s “[f]inancial statements shall include disclosures of material related-party
transactions.” Related Party Disclosures, Statement of Fin. Accounting Standards No. 57 (Fin.
Accounting Standards Bd. Mar. 1982). “[D]isclosure is the overriding principle” governing
related-party transactions because, although “related party transactions are not inherently bad,
they have proven to be an easy and effective way for perpetrators of fraud and money laundering
schemes to misstate the economic substance and reality of financial transactions.” In re Am.
Preferred Prescription, Inc., Bankr. No. 893-84170-478, 1997 WL 158401, at *3 n.11 (Bankr.
E.D.N.Y. Mar. 21, 1997) (discussing such transactions in bankruptcy context); accord Zagami v.
Natural Health Trends Corp., 540 F. Supp. 2d 705, 711 (N.D. Tex. 2008) (discussing such
transactions in the securities fraud context).
Full disclosure of the true nature of the related-party notes was necessary to give
investors an accurate assessment of the company’s financial condition, especially given that
doubts about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern due to lack of working capital
were represented as being dependent on, among other things, obtaining debt financing. Div. Ex.
B at 5; Div. Ex. C at 5-6; Div. Ex. D at 7-8. By representing in its 2011 Quarterly Reports that
the company’s financing activities significantly increased through use of related-party notes,
China Ruitai misleadingly made it appear that it obtained legitimate debt financing to make up
for its otherwise negative operating cash flows. Div. Ex. B at 4, 13, 21; Div. Ex. C at 4, 14, 2324; Div. Ex. D at 6, 16, 26. It did not disclose that such notes were based on underlying bank
loans that had been obtained through fictitious purchase orders, which could result in risks to the
company if exposed or challenged by the banks or others, especially if China Ruitai failed to
repay the bank loans. OIP at 3; see Div. Ex. I; Div. Ex. J. Even if China Ruitai’s liability for
such illegally obtained bank financing under PRC law was low, as stated in the legal opinions by
the Global Law Office and DLA Piper,9 a reasonable investor would still find it significant that
the company’s debt financing was largely the product of fraud and risky bank financing.
In sum, by inaccurately describing and failing to disclose facts in its public filings
regarding the true nature and activity underlying millions of dollars in related-party obligations,
9

See Div. Exs. H and I.
12

China Ruitai, Min Ma, and Gang Ma misrepresented and omitted material facts regarding China
Ruitai’s actual operations, debt obligations, solvency, liquidity, and financial risks. OIP at 3. A
reasonable investor would view such information as material in deciding whether to invest in the
company. See SEC v. Murphy, 626 F.2d 633, 653 (9th Cir. 1980) (“[T]he materiality of
information relating to financial condition, solvency and profitability is not subject to serious
challenge.”); see also SEC v. Monterosso, 756 F.3d 1326, 1338 (11th Cir. 2014) (“revenue
overstatements would have been important to any reasonable shareholder”).
4.

Scienter

The Individual Respondents acted with scienter, a “mental state embracing intent to
deceive, manipulate, or defraud.” Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 686 n.5 (1980) (internal
quotation marks omitted). A finding of “extreme recklessness” satisfies the scienter requirement.
See Flannery, 2014 WL 71415625, at *10 n.24; David Disner, 52 S.E.C. 1217, 1222 & n.20
(1997). In the context of securities fraud, extreme recklessness is “highly unreasonable”
conduct, “which represents an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care . . . to the
extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must
have been aware of it.” Flannery, at *10 n.24; Novak v. Kasaks, 216 F.3d 300, 308 (2d Cir.
2000) (quoting Rolf v. Blyth, Eastman Dillon & Co., 570 F.2d 38, 47 (2d Cir. 1978)) (omission in
original). Proof of scienter may be inferred from circumstantial evidence. Herman & MacLean
v. Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375, 390-91 n.30 (1983).
Here, the Individual Respondents knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the bank
financing was obtained fraudulently. OIP at 3-4. Both Min Ma and Gang Ma signed China
Ruitai’s Quarterly Reports, as well as certifications for those filings. Id. at 3. In response to
Marcum’s inquiries regarding the purchase contracts underlying China Ruitai’s bank loans, Gang
Ma was unable to provide evidence confirming the existence of real purchases or sales between
China Ruitai and Shandong Ruitai; additionally, he admitted that such purchase orders were
fictitious. Div. Ex. F at 2-3; Div. Ex. J at 1; OIP at 4. Further, Min Ma is a co-owner of
Shandong Ruitai and thus would have had access to information concerning the true nature of the
purchase orders. See OIP at 2. Marcum was unable to satisfactorily corroborate the fact,
asserted by the Global Law Office apparently based on information supplied by China Ruitai,
that the banks actually knew that there were no real transactions behind the notes. Div. Ex. J at
2. Tian signed management representation letters directed to Marcus which falsely stated that
China Ruitai had no knowledge of any fraud. Div. Ex. G. As CAO, Tian knew or was reckless
in not knowing the true nature of the transactions and that the financing was obtained
fraudulently and illegal. OIP at 4. He also knew or was reckless in not knowing that the
misrepresentations would be incorporated into China Ruitai’s public filings and that the public
filings materially misrepresented the true nature of the transactions. Id.
A reasonable inference is that China Ruitai provided false information not only to the
banks, but also to its attorneys and auditor. Thus, the Individual Respondents were at least
extremely reckless in misrepresenting facts to China Ruitai’s attorneys and auditor, and in
publishing financial statements in China Ruitai’s 2011 Quarterly Reports and Amendment, when
they knew or should have known that those statements misrepresentations were inaccurate, false,
and misleading. See SEC v. Pirate Investor LLC, 580 F.3d 233, 243 (4th Cir. 2009) (citing
13

Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp., 284 F.3d 72, 83 (1st Cir. 2002); Fla. State Bd. of Admin. v. Green
Tree Fin. Corp., 270 F.3d 645, 665 (8th Cir. 2001)); Novak, 216 F.3d at 308-09.
5.

“In Connection” with the Purchase or Sale of Securities

The fraudulent scheme and the misrepresentations and omissions in China Ruitai’s 2011
Quarterly Reports and Amendment were “in connection with” the purchase or sale of domestic
securities. See 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b); Morrison v. Nat’l Australia Bank Ltd., 130 S. Ct. 2869, 2884
(2010) (“[T]he focus of the Exchange Act is not upon the place where the deception originated,
but upon purchases and sales of securities in the United States.”);10 cf. China Ruitai Int’l
Holdings Co., 2013 SEC LEXIS 3694, at *3 (China Ruitai’s common stock quoted on OTC
Link); SEC v. Ficeto, 839 F. Supp. 2d 1101, 1112 (C.D. Cal. 2011) (Section 10(b) applies with
equal force to market manipulation on national exchanges and the domestic over-the-counter
market). The Supreme Court has broadly construed the phrase “in connection with” under
Section 10(b); the requisite showing does not require deception of an identifiable purchaser or
seller, but rather that the fraud coincides with a securities transaction. Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U.S. 71, 85 (2006) (citing United States v. O’Hagan, 521
U.S. 642, 651, 658 (1997), and SEC v. Zandford, 535 U.S. 813, 819-20, 822 (2002)). Where the
fraud alleged involves the public dissemination of information in public filings with the
Commission, the “in connection with” element is generally met by proof of the means of its
dissemination and the materiality of the misrepresentation or omission. See SEC v. Wolfson, 539
F.3d 1249, 1262 (10th Cir. 2008); Semerenko v. Cendant Corp., 223 F.3d 165, 176 (3d Cir.
2000); SEC v. Rana Research, Inc., 8 F.3d 1358, 1362 (9th Cir. 1993); SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc.,
587 F.2d 1149, 1171 (D.C. Cir. 1978); SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 833, 860-62 (2d
Cir. 1968) (en banc).
The fraudulent scheme operated as a fraud on investors because in an effort to conceal
the scheme, the Individual Respondents made misrepresentations to Marcum, and these
misrepresentations were incorporated into China Ruitai’s 2011 Quarterly Reports. China
Ruitai’s public filings, were designed to reach investors and are documents upon which a
reasonable investor would rely in deciding whether to purchase its securities. See Wolfson, 539
F.3d at 1262-63; SEC v. Benson, 657 F. Supp. 1122, 1131 (S.D.N.Y. 1987); Rita J. McConville,
58 S.E.C. 596, 618-19 (2005), pet. denied, 465 F.3d 780 (7th Cir. 2006).
C.

Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13

Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder require issuers with
securities registered under Exchange Act Section 12 to file annual and quarterly reports with the
10

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may have overturned
Morrison in the context of Commission enforcement actions. Exchange Act Section 27(b)
provides the Commission with jurisdiction to bring an action alleging a violation of the antifraud
provisions involving “(1) conduct within the United States that constitutes significant steps in
furtherance of the violation, even if the securities transaction occurs outside the United States
and involves only foreign investors; or (2) conduct occurring outside the United States that has a
foreseeable substantial effect within the United States.” 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(b).
14

Commission. 15 U.S.C. § 78m(a); 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1, .13a-13. An issuer violates these
provisions if it files reports that contain materially false or misleading information. SEC v.
Kalvex, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 310, 315-16 (S.D.N.Y. 1975); Russell Ponce, 54 S.E.C. 804, 812 n.23
(2000), pet. denied, 345 F.3d 722 (9th Cir. 2003). Exchange Act Rule 12b-20 requires that
periodic reports filed with the Commission contain further material information “as may be
necessary to make the required statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made[,] not misleading.” 17 C.F.R. § 240.12b-20; SEC v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 629 F.2d 62,
72 (D.C. Cir. 1980). In addition, under Exchange Act Rule 13a-11, an issuer must file current
reports on Form 8-K, which requires disclosure of an auditor’s resignation within four business
days of such resignation. 17 C.F.R. § 240.13a-11; Form 8-K (SEC Form 873), General
Instructions B.1, Item 4.01. No showing of scienter is necessary to establish a violation of these
provisions. See McNulty, 137 F.3d at 740-741; SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C.
1978); Gregory M. Dearlove, CPA, Exchange Act Release No. 57244, 2008 SEC LEXIS 223, at
*112 (Jan. 31, 2008), pet. denied, 573 F.3d 801 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (en banc).
I find that Min Ma caused, and Gang Ma and Tian willfully aided and abetted and caused,
China Ruitai’s violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and
13a-13.11 As previously discussed, China Ruitai’s 2011 Quarterly Reports and Amendment
contained materially false and/or misleading statements. Thus, its misconduct violated Exchange
Act Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13. Moreover, China Ruitai violated
Exchange Act Rule 13a-11 by its failure to timely report Marcum’s resignation in a Form 8-K.
See China Ruitai Int’l Holdings Co., 2013 SEC LEXIS 3694, at *3-5 (describing China Ruitai’s
failure to file any periodic reports since it filed its Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30,
2011).
It is clear that the Individual Respondents caused, and Gang Ma and Tian knowingly and
substantially assisted, China Ruitai’s failure to comply with periodic reporting requirements. As
China Ruitai’s CEO and CFO, respectively, Min Ma and Gang Ma were responsible for China
Ruitai’s filings with the Commission. Min Ma and Gang Ma signed the 2011 Quarterly Reports
and Amendment and accompanying certifications attesting to their accuracy. Under Min Ma and
Gang Ma’s management, China Ruitai failed to timely report Marcum’s resignation in a Form 8K and ceased complying with the federal securities laws’ periodic reporting requirements. As
CAO, Tian played a significant role in communicating with China Ruitai’s auditor during the
2011 quarterly and annual reviews. Tian signed three inaccurate management representation
letters that were provided to Marcum. As public company officers, the Individual Respondents
knew or should have known that their acts or omissions would contribute to China Ruitai’s false
and misleading filings and its later failure to file required reports.
D.

Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2(a)

Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) requires China Ruitai, an issuer registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g), to “make and keep books, records, and
11

The OIP alleges that Min Ma caused China Ruitai’s violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a)
and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13, but not that he aided and abetted them. OIP at 6;
cf. Motion at 18.
15

accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the issuer.” 15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(A). Just as the false and
misleading financial statements contained in China Ruitai’s 2011 Quarterly Reports and
Amendment violated Exchange Act Section 10(b), they also violated Section 13(b)(2)(A). See
Ponce, 345 F.3d at 736-37 (Exchange Act 13(b)(2) liability predicated on Exchange Act Section
10(b) violation for financial misstatements in annual and quarterly reports); SEC v. Black, No.
04-cv-7377, 2008 WL 4394891, at *15 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 24, 2008) (financial misstatements
contained in Forms 10-K established Section 13(b)(2)(A) violation). Scienter need not be shown
to establish liability under Section 13(b)(2). Rita J. McConville, 58 S.E.C. at 622. The
Individual Respondents caused, and Gang Ma and Tian willfully aided and abetted and caused
China Ruitai’s violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A).12 The Individual Respondents
knowingly provided substantial assistance to China Ruitai in its books and records violations,
because as discussed above, they knowingly made or caused China Ruitai to make the false and
misleading statements contained in China Ruitai’s 2011 Quarterly Reports and Amendment.
Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 states that “[n]o person shall[,] directly or indirectly, falsify
or cause to be falsified, any book, record or account” subject to Exchange Act Section
13(b)(2)(A). 17 C.F.R. § 240.13b2-1. Scienter is not required for a finding of violation of Rule
13b2-1. Rita J. McConville, 58 S.E.C. at 620. I find that Min Ma violated, and Gang Ma and
Tian willfully violated Rule 13b2-1 because they falsified China Ruitai’s books, records, and
accounts that were presented to Marcum and incorporated into the 2011 Quarterly Reports and
Amendment.
Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2(a) makes it unlawful for a director or officer of an issuer to
make or cause to be made a materially false or misleading statement to an accountant or omit or
cause to omit any material information necessary to make the statements made not misleading in
connection with an audit of financial statements or reports filed with the Commission. 17 C.F.R.
§ 240.13b2-2(a). Scienter is not required for a finding of violation of Rule 13b2-2. SEC v.
World-Wide Coin Inv., 567 F. Supp. 724, 749 (N.D. Ga. 1983). The term “officer” includes
“president, vice president, secretary, treasurer or principal financial officer, comptroller or
principal accounting officer, and any person routinely performing corresponding functions with
respect to any organization.” 17 C.F.R. § 240.3b-2. Thus, Min Ma, Gang Ma, and Tian are
considered officers with respect to Rule 13b2-2(a). As discussed above, the Individual
Respondents signed management representation letters addressed to Marcum that contained false
and misleading statements that (1) management had no knowledge of any fraud, (2) all relatedparty transactions had been properly disclosed, and (3) there had been no violations of laws. I
find that Min Ma violated, and Gang Ma and Tian willfully violated Exchange Act Rule 13b22(a).

The OIP alleges that Min Ma caused China Ruitai’s violations of Exchange Act Section
13(b)(2)(A), but not that he aided and abetted them. OIP at 6; cf. Motion at 19-20. Also, it
alleges that Min Ma violated Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2(a), but not willfully. OIP at 6.

Under Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, the principal executive and principal financial officers
of an issuer with securities registered under Exchange Act Section 12 are required to sign a
certification that, based on their knowledge, the annual and quarterly reports filed with the
Commission do not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such
statements were made, not misleading. 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-14, 229.601(b)(31). I find that
Min Ma violated13 and Gang Ma willfully violated Rule 13a-14. As CEO and CFO, respectively,
Min Ma and Gang Ma signed the certifications for the 2011 Quarterly Reports. As discussed
above, Min Ma and Gang Ma knew that the 2011 Quarterly Reports contained material
misstatements and omissions.
Sanctions
The Division requests cease-and-desist orders and third-tier civil penalties against the
Individual Respondents. Motion at 1, 21-33. The Division does not request officer and director
bars against the Individual Respondents or that Gang Ma and Tian be denied the privilege of
appearing or practicing before the Commission as accountants. See OIP at 8; Motion at 21-33. I
therefore do not impose those sanctions.
A.

Cease-and-Desist Order

Under Exchange Act Section 21C, the Commission may order a person found to be
violating or to have violated a provision of the Exchange Act or any rule thereunder to cease and
desist from such violations. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-3(a). Although there must be some likelihood of
future violations whenever the Commission issues a cease-and-desist order, the required showing
is “significantly less than that required for an injunction.” KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, 54 S.E.C.
at 1185, 1191. Indeed, absent evidence to the contrary, a single past violation ordinarily suffices
to establish a risk of future violations. Id. at 1185, 1191.
In evaluating whether to issue a cease-and-desist order, the Commission considers “the
seriousness of the violation, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violation, the respondent’s
state of mind, the sincerity of the respondent’s assurances against future violations, the
respondent’s recognition of the wrongful nature of his or her conduct, and the respondent’s
opportunity to commit future violations.” Id. at 1192. In addition, the Commission considers
“whether the violation is recent, the degree of harm to investors or the marketplace resulting
from the violation, and the remedial function to be served by the cease-and-desist order in the
context of any other sanctions being sought in the same proceedings.” Id. The Commission
weighs these factors in light of the entire record, and no one factor is dispositive. Id.
The Individual Respondents’ violations were serious because they conducted multiple
fraudulent transactions and misrepresented these transactions to China Ruitai’s auditor and
investors, and in filings with the Commission. The Commission has “repeatedly held that
conduct that violates the antifraud provisions of the securities laws is especially serious and
subject to the severest of sanctions under the securities laws.” Peter Siris, Exchange Act Release
13

The OIP alleges that Min Ma violated Rule 13a-14, but not willfully. OIP at 6.

No. 71068, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3924, at *23 (Dec. 12, 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted),
pet. denied, 773 F.3d 89 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Additionally, the Individual Respondents made
blatant misrepresentations to Marcum regarding China Ruitai’s filings. The Individual
Respondents, as officers of China Ruitai, signed representation letters certifying that
management had no knowledge of any fraud, all related-party transactions had been properly
disclosed, and there had been no violations of laws. Because of these misrepresentations,
Marcum had no reason to believe fraudulent activity was occurring and, therefore, false
information was reported in the 2011 Quarterly Reports and Amendment. Furthermore, even
when Marcum identified the misrepresentations and illegal conduct, the Individual Respondents
blatantly disregarded Marcum’s Exchange Act Section 10A(b) notices and refused either to
correct the misrepresentations or file the necessary Form 8-K with the Commission. Indeed,
Gang Ma confirmed that the transactions were fictitious. Additionally, China Ruitai’s failure to
comply with the reporting provisions is serious because these provisions are central to the
Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic reporting is to supply investors with current and accurate
financial information about an issuer so that they may make sound investment decisions.
Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *26
(May 31, 2006). The seriousness of the violations is further underscored by the fact that it failed
to report Marcum’s resignation on Form 8-K, despite being notified that Marcum had resigned
following an alleged illegal act that the company failed to remedy.
The Individual Respondents’ violations were recurrent in that they repeatedly caused
China Ruitai to file materially false and misleading quarterly reports throughout 2011; failed to
correct China Ruitai’s misleading statements, even after the resignation of its auditor; and caused
China Ruitai to repeatedly fail to timely file required current and periodic reports. Additionally,
in each of the first three quarters of 2011, the Individual Respondents provided materially
misleading management representation letters to China Ruitai’s auditor.
The Individual Respondents acted with scienter in violating the antifraud provisions,
though a finding of scienter is not required for Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and
Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 13a-14. The Individual Respondents have provided no
assurances against future violations, nor generally recognized the wrongful nature of their
conduct.14 Their opportunities to commit future violations are high, as they are experienced
business persons, each in their late thirties to mid-forties, and have many working years ahead of
them.
The antifraud violations occurred in 2011, while the reporting requirement violations
occurred as recently as 2013. While the degree of harm to investors is difficult to quantify, as
discussed in more detail below, I find that investors suffered substantial loss or risk of substantial
loss. The degree of harm to the marketplace is thus high, as an efficient and honest market
requires accurate information to be distributed to investors. See Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S.
224, 230 (1988). As noted below, I am also imposing substantial civil penalties.

14

Gang Ma did admit to Marcum that the underlying transactions were fictitious, but it is not
clear that he recognized that his conduct overall was wrongful.
18

Applying these factors to the present case, each of the violations independently calls for
cease-and-desist relief. All of the factors, especially the seriousness of the violations, the
Individual Respondents’ failure to appreciate that seriousness, and particularly, the forwardlooking effect to be served by cease-and-desist orders, weigh in favor of imposition of ceaseand-desist orders.
Accordingly, cease-and-desist orders are appropriate.
B.

Civil Penalties

Under Exchange Act Section 21B, the Commission is authorized to impose a civil
penalty in a cease-and-desist proceeding where, as here, the respondent has violated the
Exchange Act or rules thereunder. See 15 U.S.C § 78u-2(a)(2). A three-tier system establishes
the maximum civil money penalty that may be imposed for each violation found: a first-tier
penalty may be imposed for each statutory violation; a second-tier penalty is permissible where
the respondent’s violation involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless
disregard of a regulatory requirement; and a third-tier penalty may be imposed where, in addition
to the first-tier and second-tier requirements, the violation directly or indirectly (1) resulted in
substantial losses, (2) created a significant risk of substantial losses to other persons, or (3)
resulted in substantial pecuniary gain to the person who committed the misconduct (loss prong).
15 U.S.C § 78u-2(b). The Commission must determine how many violations occurred to impose
civil penalties under the statute. See Rapoport, 682 F.3d at 108. For the relevant period, for an
individual the maximum third-tier penalty was $150,000. 17 C.F.R. § 201.1004 and Table IV to
Subpart E.
The Division seeks third-tier penalties for “not less than four” violations. Motion at 30.
There were four instances where the Individual Respondents caused China Ruitai to file
materially misleading Commission filings (the 2011 Quarterly Reports and Amendment), in
violation of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. The Individual Respondents’ four violations all
involved scienter, which is sufficient to establish fraud, deceit, and reckless disregard of a
regulatory requirement. See Ambassador Capital Mgmt., LLC, Initial Decision Release No. 672,
2014 WL 4656408, at *78 (Sept. 19, 2014), finality notice, Advisers Act Release No. 3979, 2014
WL 6985132 (Dec. 11, 2014). Thus, at least four second-tier penalties are warranted as to each
Individual Respondent.
The loss prong for assessing a third-tier penalty requires a more complex analysis. In its
Motion, the Division argues that a defendant’s conduct can create both a substantial loss to other
persons and the risk of substantial loss to other persons where victims of fraud purchased the
company’s stock, and were then stuck with it until the company’s financial demise. Motion at 29
(citing SEC v. Huff, 758 F. Supp. 2d 1288, 1364 (S.D. Fla. 2010), aff’d, 455 F. App’x 882 (11th
Cir. 2012)). The Division notes that during the relevant six-month period during which its
misinformation was “on the market, China Ruitai’s stock price remained “comparably stable at
prices between $.15 and $.30,” with over 395,000 shares trading hands in twenty-one
transactions. Id. at 31. After December 2011, however, trading in China Ruitai’s stock
effectively ceased, with only thirteen transactions in 2012 and a significant drop in price, down
to $.03 by the end of 2012. Id.
19

I find that with respect to the four 2011 Quarterly Reports and Amendment violations, the
loss prong is met and third-tier civil penalties should be imposed.
[I]n an open and developed securities market, the price of a company’s stock is
determined by the available material information regarding the company and its
business. . . . Misleading statements will therefore defraud purchasers of stock
even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements. . . . The causal
connection between the defendants’ fraud and the [purchasers’] purchase of stock
in such a case is no less significant than in a case of direct reliance on
misrepresentations.
Basic Inc., 485 U.S. at 241-42 (quoting Paul v. Speiser, 806 F.2d 1154, 1160-61 (3d Cir. 1986))
(omissions in original). China Ruitai’s misinformation spoiled the market from May 16, 2011 –
when China Ruitai filed its first quarter results for 2011 – through March 30, 2012 – when China
Ruitai filed a Form NT 10-K, announcing that its annual report would be delayed. Although the
misinformation was not revealed on March 30, 2012, after this date China Ruitai did not make
any additional filings, including its Form 8-K to announce the resignation of its auditor. See Div.
Ex. M. During this period, China Ruitai’s stock prices were at an artificially high level.
Investors who purchased stock during that period suffered substantial losses or risked substantial
losses once China Ruitai was unable to continue disseminating materially false and misleading
information. See Vladlen “Larry” Vindman, Securities Act Release No. 8679, 2006 SEC LEXIS
862, at *19, *35 (Apr. 14, 2006) (significant risk of substantial losses to those who traded in
stock that ranged from $.025 to $.36 per share). Stock prices ranged from a low of $.10 to a high
of $.51 during this period. Supplemental Ex. A. Trading was relatively robust from May 16,
2011, through the end of November 2011 (the period when China Ruitai was actively
disseminating materially false and misleading information), with around 400,000 shares trading
hands. Id. From December 2011 through March 30, 2012, a time when China Ruitai was no
longer actively disseminating materially false and misleading information but the information
remained in the market, trading dropped precipitously, with only 21,500 shares trading hands.
Id. After March 30, 2012, trading continued to be sparse, with only 73,500 shares trading hands
over twelve separate days through the end of 2012, and the price dropped from $.13 to $.03. Id.
Although the tier determines the maximum penalty, “each case has its own particular
facts and circumstances which determine the appropriate penalty to be imposed” within the tier.
SEC v. Opulentica, LLC, 479 F. Supp. 2d 319, 331 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (internal quotation marks
omitted); see Ronald S. Bloomfield, Exchange Act Release No. 71632, 2014 WL 768828, at *23
(Feb. 27, 2014). Within any particular tier, the Commission has the discretion to set the amount
of the penalty. See Brendan E. Murray, Advisers Act Release No. 2809, 2008 SEC LEXIS 2924,
at *42 (Nov. 21, 2008).
Several considerations bear on the amount of a penalty. In considering whether a penalty
is in the public interest, the Commission considers six factors: (1) fraud; (2) harm to others; (3)
unjust enrichment; (4) previous violations; (5) deterrence; and (6) such other matters as justice
may require. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-2(c). “Not all factors may be relevant in a given case, and the

20

factors need not all carry equal weight.” Robert G. Weeks, Initial Decision Release No. 199,
2002 WL 169185, at *58 (Feb. 4, 2002). In addition to these statutory factors, courts consider:
(1) the egregiousness of the violations at issue, (2) defendants’ scienter, (3) the
repeated nature of the violations, (4) defendants’ failure to admit to their
wrongdoing; (5) whether defendants’ conduct created substantial losses or the risk
of substantial losses to other persons; (6) defendants’ lack of cooperation and
honesty with authorities, if any; and (7) whether the penalty that would otherwise
be appropriate should be reduced due to defendants’ demonstrated current and
future financial condition.
SEC v. Lybrand, 281 F. Supp. 2d 726, 730 (S.D.N.Y. 2003), aff’d, 425 F.3d 143 (2d Cir. 2005).
Regarding the six statutory factors, factors one, two, and five weigh in favor of a large
penalty: the Individual Respondents’ violations involved fraud and harm to investors, and
substantial penalties will deter others. There is no evidence pertaining to the other three statutory
factors. Regarding the seven Lybrand factors, factors one through five weigh in favor of a heavy
sanction. No evidence regarding factors six and seven has been presented.
There is no clear evidence that any particular Individual Respondent is more culpable
than another, or that the various factors should be weighed differently for the different Individual
Respondents. On balance, I find four third-tier penalties of $100,000 each, or $400,000 total, to
be warranted for each Individual Respondent.
