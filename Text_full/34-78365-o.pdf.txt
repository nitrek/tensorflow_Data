In the Matter of

The Digital Development Group Corp.,

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) that there is a
lack of current and accurate information concerning the securities of Scanner Technologies Corp.
(“SCNI1”) (CIK No. 217222), a revoked New Mexico corporation located in Minneapolis
Minnesota with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") Section 12(g) because it is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for
the period ended September 30, 2008. On January 29, 2016, the Commission’s Division of
Corporation Finance (“Corporation Finance”) sent a delinquency letter to SCNI requesting
compliance with its periodic filing requirements but SCNI did not receive the delinquency letter
due to its failure to maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by
Commission rules (Rule 301 of Regulation S-T, 17 C.F.R. Section 232.301 and Section 5.4 of
EDGAR Filer Manual) (“Commission Issuer Address Rules”). As of July 14, 2016, the common
stock of SCNI was quoted on OTC Link operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (formerly “Pink
Sheets”) (“OTC Link”), had four market makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception
of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
