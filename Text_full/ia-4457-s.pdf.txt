SEC Announces Charges Against Texas-based Investment Adviser and Its Sole Owner and
Manager for Alleged Failure to Produce Documents to the SEC’s Examination Staff
July 18, 2016 – The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the institution of
proceedings against Texas-based investment adviser Saving2Retire, LLC and its sole owner and
manager, Marian P. Young, for conduct arising from the firm’s failure to produce required
documents to examination staff and other securities law violations.
According to the SEC’s order instituting a litigated administrative and cease-and-desist
proceeding, during an examination to determine whether Saving2Retire was eligible to register
with the SEC, the firm refused to produce certain documents – such as client account records and
the firm’s financial records – that an adviser is required to keep pursuant to the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. The Enforcement Division also alleges in the SEC’s order that
Saving2Retire improperly registered with the SEC.
The SEC’s order charges Saving2Retire with violating Sections 203A and 204 of the Advisers
Act and Rule 204-2(a) thereunder, and Young with willfully aiding and abetting and causing the
firm’s violations. The matter will be scheduled for a public hearing before an administrative law
judge, who will prepare an initial decision stating what, if any, remedial actions are appropriate.
The investigation was conducted by Catherine Floyd and supervised by Barbara Gunn and David
Peavler in the SEC’s Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC examination of Saving2Retire that
led to the investigation was conducted by Javier Villarreal and Linda Hoffman and supervised by
Michael Gunst. Jennifer Brandt will lead the Enforcement Division’s litigation.
