Status,” the second sentence is hereby deleted and replaced with the sentence: “As
noted above, Rule 15Fh-3(a)(3) differs from the CFTC’s rule, which instead

includes an opt-in for plans “defined in” ERISA, but not subject to Title I of
ERISA.” Footnote 1529 remains as published.
2. Also on page 30090, in the third column, in the fourth sentence under the same
heading, the phrase “complying with the rules, as adopted,” is replaced with the
phrase “complying with Rules 15Fh-3(a)(1) and (2)”.

begins after footnote 1531, beginning with the sentence “We do not anticipate any
ongoing burdens with respect to this rule.”
4. Also on page 30091, in the first column, under the same heading, the following
sentence is added to the end of the last paragraph under this heading: “We also
anticipate that all 55 SBS Entities will incur, on average, an initial internal burden
of 30 minutes to prepare the notice required pursuant to Rule 15Fh-3(a)(3) for
counterparties defined in Rule 15Fh-2(d)(4), for an aggregate total of 27.5 hours.”

6. Footnote 1655 on page 30110, is corrected to: “Initial outside counsel cost: $500
* (20 non-CFTC registered SBS Entities) = $10,000. Initial adherence letter and
notification burden: (In-house attorney at $380 per hour) x 47.5 hours = $18,050.”
