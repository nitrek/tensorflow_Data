ORDER GRANTING
EXTENSION OF TIME
TO SUBMIT PROPOSED
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an order for an
extension of time, until January 14, 2016, to submit a proposed plan of distribution in
the above-captioned matter pursuant to Rule 1101(a) of the Commission’s Rules on
Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans. In its request, the Division states that the
violations in this matter arise in connection with the same conduct alleged in SEC v.
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (the “Citigroup action” or the “civil action”) (11-cv7387), a settled case filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York, which settlement was rejected by the Court and the case set for trial on July 16,
2012. The SEC appealed the trial court’s rulings to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit (“Second Circuit”), and a stay was entered on March 15, 2012 pending
resolution of the appeal.1 Oral arguments were heard before the Second Circuit on

11-05227 (2d Cir., Dec. 20, 2011).

February 8, 2013. On August 5, 2014, final judgment was entered by the Southern
District of New York.2
Now that the final judgment has been entered, the Division states that
additional time is needed to determine the appropriate procedure and methodology to
utilize for a distribution to injured investors.
Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the
Division’s request for an extension of time until January 14, 2016, to submit a
proposed plan of distribution is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary
