In the Matter of
JASON MAIHER,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest to accept the Offer of Settlement submitted by Jason Maiher (“Maiher” or
“Respondent”) pursuant to Rule 240(a) of the Rules of Practice of the Commission, 17 C.F.R. §
201.240(a), for the purpose of settlement of these proceedings initiated against Respondent on
February 23, 2016, pursuant to Sections 4C, 15(b), and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (“Exchange Act”) and 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
II.
Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on
behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or
denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject
matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V,
Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial
Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Sections 4C, 15(b) and 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice (“Order”), as set
forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:
A.

SUMMARY

1.
These proceedings concern Respondent’s role in KeyBanc Capital Market Inc.’s
(“KBCM”) failure to make and keep accurate books and records.
2.
Beginning at some point prior to January 2011, and through January 2012,
Respondent, who was KBCM’s CFO (until November 2011) and Series 27 Financial and
Operations Principal (“FinOp”), directed that unsubstantiated entries (commonly known as “plug”
entries) be made to one or more accounts in KBCM’s general ledger, in order to complete
KBCM’s monthly close-the-books process.
3.
The plug entries resulted in KBCM overstating its assets and income in the
financial statements included in its fiscal year 2010 Annual Audited Report filed with the
Commission in February 2011, and also resulted in inaccurate financial information being included
in KBCM’s monthly reporting to FINRA (which furnished such monthly reports to the
Commission), including those filed in 2011and January 2012.
4.
In its Annual Audited Report for the year ended December 31, 2011, KBCM
disclosed that its prior period financial statements (for fiscal year 2010) included unsubstantiated
assets of $13,679,000 ($8,591,000 net of taxes). Specifically, the 2011 Annual Audited Report
stated “[t]he December 31, 2010, Statement of Financial Condition included $13,679[,000] in net
trade date receivables that was found to be unsubstantiated during 2011.”
B.

RESPONDENT

5.
Maiher, age 42, was KBCM’s CFO from April 2007 through November 2011 and
FinOp from April 2007 through December 2011. Maiher was primarily responsible for
maintaining KBCM’s financial records. He submitted KBCM’s Annual Audited Report to the
Commission and oversaw the filing of its monthly Financial and Operational Combined Uniform
Single Reports (“FOCUS Reports”) with FINRA, which then furnished the FOCUS Reports to the
Commission. Pursuant to internal policies and procedures that were applicable to KBCM, Maiher
was required to certify after the close of each month that KBCM’s general ledger balance sheet
information had been compared with, and reconciled to, the underlying back-office system
information.

RELEVANT ENTITY

6.
KBCM is a broker-dealer registered with the Commission and is a subsidiary of
KeyCorp, a financial services company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio.
D.

FACTS
KBCM’S BOOKS AND RECORDS WERE INACCURATE

7.
Beginning at some point prior to January 2011, and through January 2012,
Respondent directed that unsubstantiated (i.e., “plug”) entries be made to one or more accounts in
KBCM’s general ledger, in order to complete KBCM’s monthly close-the-books process. The
amount of these entries varied over time.
8.
The plug entries resulted in KBCM overstating its assets and income in its fiscal
year 2010 financial statements, which were included in its fiscal year 2010 Annual Audited Report
filed with the Commission in February 2011. Respondent signed this report, affirming that the
accompanying financial statements were “true and correct.”
9.
The plug entries to the general ledger also resulted in inaccurate financial
information being included in KBCM’s FOCUS Reports that Respondent caused to be filed with
FINRA, which then furnished the FOCUS Reports to the Commission, for some point prior to
January 2011 through January 2012. In 2012, KBCM filed amended FOCUS Reports.
10.
In its Annual Audited Report for the year ended December 31, 2011, KBCM
disclosed that its prior period financial statements (for fiscal year 2010) included unsubstantiated
assets of $13,679,000 ($8,591,000 net of taxes). Specifically, the 2011 Annual Audited Report
stated “[t]he December 31, 2010, Statement of Financial Condition included $13,679[,000] in net
trade date receivables that was found to be unsubstantiated during 2011.”
RESPONDENT DIRECTED THAT UNSUBSTANTIATED ENTRIES
BE MADE TO KBCM’S GENERAL LEDGER
11.
KeyCorp’s written policies and procedures1 that were applicable to KBCM required
KBCM’s finance department, led by Respondent, to reconcile certain general ledger accounts to
the back office securities trading and inventory software system. The general ledger system was
referred to as MSA. MSA was the source of the official books and records of KBCM. The back
office system for KBCM was referred to as Broadridge.
12.
The purpose of reconciling accounts was to ensure that the information in MSA
was accurate. Generally, reconciliation is an accounting process used to compare two sets of
These included “Policy ACC-403: KeyCorp Reconciliation and Certification Policy” and
“Procedure AR-5001: Reconcilement Process & Account Certification.”
1

3

records to ensure the figures are in agreement. During the relevant period, KeyCorp’s
Reconcilement Process & Account Certification Procedure stated that the goal of reconciliation
was “to verify that the balance and activity in the [general ledger] account agrees with the expected
balance and activity as recorded elsewhere.” This document further explained that “[w]hen
external reports are published to our shareholders and government agencies, it is critical that the
general ledger system from which those reports are prepared be correct.”
13.
The applicable policies and procedures required accounts to be reconciled on a
periodic basis, which was generally daily or weekly “unless the account has very low transaction
volume.” At a minimum, all accounts were to be reconciled monthly.
14.
Among the accounts that Respondent and his team were required to reconcile were
the firm’s inventory accounts. Despite the fact that the inventory accounts did not have “very low
transaction volume,” they were reconciled only monthly.
15.
The applicable policies and procedures required Respondent to segregate the duties
of preparing, reviewing, and certifying the inventory accounts reconciliations. Accordingly, one of
KBCM’s accountants was responsible for preparing the reconciliations, KBCM’s Controller was
responsible for reviewing the reconciliations, and Respondent was responsible for certifying them.
Specifically, Respondent was responsible for timely certifying the inventory accounts in
KeyCorp’s On-Line Certification System.
16.
As explained in KeyCorp’s policies and procedures, Respondent’s certification of a
general ledger account was a formal attestation that: properly documented controls and procedures
were in place; reconciliations were routinely performed according to an established schedule; the
reconciliation for the account was current; and the supporting sub-system, which is Broadridge in
this instance, was in agreement with the general ledger.
17.
Further, as stated in the policies and procedures, by certifying an account,
Respondent was making himself “personally accountable for the integrity of the account” and
stating that “a formal reconciliation, with all pertinent documentation, has been prepared and
reviewed, and that all reconciling items have been adequately documented.”
18.
As part of KBCM’s reconciliation process, any difference between related account
balances in MSA and Broadridge needed to be identified and was considered a reconciling item.
Reconciling items needed to be researched and resolved within established time limits. The
inventory accounts were subject to a 30-day aging period, after which any unresolved differences
between MSA and Broadridge were to be written off consistent with KeyCorp policy. The
approval needed to charge off an item depended on the dollar amount. Respondent’s write-off
authority was capped at $100,000 per KeyCorp policy. Stale items in excess of $100,000 were
only to be written off with the approval of KeyCorp’s Chief Accounting Officer, CFO, or
Corporate Controller.
19.
If a reconciling item was deemed a “reportable exception,” it needed to be recorded
in the on-line certification system. A “reportable exception” was defined as a reconciling item
4

“deemed significant enough to alert senior management to a potential problem which may indicate
a breakdown of internal controls or present the possibility of significant loss.” Variances between
MSA and Broadridge of $10,000 or more, which had not cleared through the normal transaction
life cycle, fell into this category.
20.
It was Respondent’s responsibility, as certifier of the inventory accounts, to
describe any reportable exception in clear language, explain the efforts being made to correct the
exception, and provide the anticipated date of resolution. Respondent had until the 20th of each
month to timely certify the prior-month inventory account balances and document any reportable
exceptions in the on-line certification system.
21.
Beginning at some point prior to 2011, and through January 2012, Respondent
directed that unsubstantiated entries be made to the general ledger in order to balance and be able
to close the books on a monthly basis.
22.
During 2010, 2011, and January 2012, as part of the monthly close-the-books
process, at Respondent’s direction, the staff accountant populated the reconciliation spreadsheet for
the inventory accounts. The initial iteration of this spreadsheet showed the variances between the
general ledger and Broadridge. At Respondent’s direction, the staff accountant also prepared a
corresponding “correcting entry” spreadsheet that, in more summary fashion, compared the monthend MSA long and short inventory balances with the long and short inventory trade date balances
in Broadridge. The “correcting entry” spreadsheet was a tool that served as the basis for a series of
manual adjusting entries that were then made to the general ledger to make the general ledger
match Broadridge. These adjusting entries were described as “Trade Date Long” or “Trade Date
Short” and were made to the 129186 “Trading Inv-Other” and 273500 “Liab for Shrt Positions”
accounts. After these entries were posted to the general ledger, the staff accountant updated the
reconciliation spreadsheet; certain variances that appeared on the pre-close version of the
spreadsheet were thus absent from the final version that was signed by Respondent as certifier,
post-close.
23.
The securities inventory reconciliation and the related “correcting entry”
spreadsheet also computed manual adjustments that were made each month to general ledger
accounts 196727 “Trade Date Receivable” and 299220 “Trade Date Payable.” Respondent
directed these adjustments, in combination with the manual adjustments to accounts 129186 and
273500, to be made in order to purportedly reflect the MSA inventory account balances on a trade
date basis for regulatory reporting purposes.
24.
If all of the month-end adjusting entries did not result in MSA balancing, the staff
accountant, at Respondent’s direction, would include an additional adjusting entry to plug the
unexplained difference in order to be able to close the books in the firm’s internal system. In most
instances, Respondent directed that this entry be described as a “Trade Date Adjustment.” All of
the manual adjusting entries were typically made on either day 1 or day 2 after the month-end and
the books were closed on day 3.

26.
Although the purpose of the KBCM inventory reconciliation process was to
identify, research and timely resolve any differences between corresponding account balances in
MSA and the Broadridge subsystem, through the process undertaken by Respondent and his staff,
differences were routinely eliminated through the expedient of adjusting entries made during the
monthly close, after which the inventory account balances were certified by Respondent as
reconciled. For example, for February, March, April and June 2011, Respondent certified the
inventory accounts without an exception of any kind. For other months, he certified with certain
exceptions but did not disclose that unsubstantiated adjustments had been made to the general
ledger.
27.
By coming up with the process by which the reconciler determined the adjusting
entries, directing that they be made to the general ledger, and then certifying the inventory account
reconciliations, Respondent also failed to ensure appropriate segregation of duties, in violation of
the applicable policies and procedures.
28.
KBCM hired a new CFO in November 2011. After he was hired, the new CFO
discovered the variances after reviewing the most recent reconciliations and notified KBCM’s and
KeyCorp’s management. Respondent was subsequently terminated from KBCM in May 2012.
29.
Through the conduct described above, Respondent caused unsubstantiated entries to
be made in the records of KBCM; caused the records of KBCM to be inaccurate; caused false
FOCUS Reports and financial statements to be filed with FINRA, which then furnished the
FOCUS Reports to the Commission; and caused a false Annual Audited Report to be filed with the
Commission.

E.

VIOLATIONS

30.
As a result of the conduct described above Respondent willfully aided and abetted
and caused KBCM’s violations of Sections 17(a) and 17(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 17a3(a)(2), 17a-5(a), and 17a-5(d) thereunder, which require registered broker-dealers to make and
keep accurate records, including current ledgers reflecting all assets and liabilities relating to the
firm’s business, and to make and disseminate accurate reports prescribed by Commission rule,
including a balance sheet and income statement certified by a public accounting firm, annual
audited reports, and periodic FOCUS Reports.
F.

FINDINGS

31.
Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Respondent Maiher willfully
aided and abetted and caused KBCM’s violations of Sections 17(a) and 17(e) of the Exchange Act
and Rules 17a-3(a)(2), 17a-5(a), and 17a-5(d) thereunder.
G.

impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:
A.
Respondent Maiher shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations

the purchase or sale of any penny stock;

7

with the right to apply for reentry after two (2) years to the appropriate selfregulatory organization, or if there is none, to the Commission.
C.
Any reapplication for association by the Respondent will be subject to the
applicable laws and regulations governing the reentry process, and reentry may be conditioned
upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of any or all of the
following: (a) any disgorgement ordered against the Respondent, whether or not the Commission
has fully or partially waived payment of such disgorgement; (b) any arbitration award related to the
conduct that served as the basis for the Commission order; (c) any self-regulatory organization
arbitration award to a customer, whether or not related to the conduct that served as the basis for
the Commission order; and (d) any restitution order by a self-regulatory organization, whether or
not related to the conduct that served as the basis for the Commission order.
D.

this Order, petition the Commission to: (1) reopen this matter to consider whether Respondent
provided accurate and complete financial information at the time such representations were made;
and (2) seek an order directing payment of the maximum civil penalty allowable under the law.
No other issue shall be considered in connection with this petition other than whether the financial
information provided by Respondent was fraudulent, misleading, inaccurate, or incomplete in any
material respect. Respondent may not, by way of defense to any such petition: (1) contest the
findings in this Order; (2) assert that payment of a penalty should not be ordered; (3) contest the
imposition of the maximum penalty allowable under the law; or (4) assert any defense to liability
or remedy, including, but not limited to, any statute of limitations defense.

8

V.
It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section
523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by
Respondent, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other
amounts due by Respondent under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree or
settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by
Respondent of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set
forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).
