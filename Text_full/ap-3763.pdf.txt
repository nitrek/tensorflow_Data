ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS RULINGS
Release No. 3763/April 5, 2016
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-15764
In the Matter of
GARY L. MCDUFF

ORDER REGARDING MOTION FOR A
DECISION ON THE SCOPE OF HEARING

On April 23, 2015, the Commission remanded this proceeding, directing me to consider
whether Gary L. McDuff was acting as a broker or dealer at the time of his misconduct, and what
sanctions, if any, should be imposed against him in the public interest. See Gary L. McDuff,
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Release No. 74803, 2015 WL 1873119, at *3. On February 18,
2016, I held a telephonic prehearing conference to discuss the logistics of holding a hearing. I
opined that the hearing should be limited temporally by confining its scope to “whether McDuff
was acting as a broker or dealer at the time of his misconduct.” Id.; Prehearing Conf. Tr. 24-26.
On February 26, 2016, McDuff filed a document seeking clarification of my remarks at
the prehearing conference. On February 29, I granted McDuff’s request and clarified that the
question of sanctions was thoroughly addressed in the parties’ summary disposition briefing, and
may not require additional evidence at the hearing. Gary L. McDuff, Admin. Proc. Rulings
Release No. 3654, 2016 SEC LEXIS 754, at *2. I assured McDuff that I had made no final
rulings on the scope of the issues to be litigated at the hearing, and that I intended to give both
parties an opportunity to be heard on that subject before the hearing commenced. Id.
On April 1, 2016, McDuff filed a motion for a ruling on the scope of the hearing, with an
attached memorandum and declaration. McDuff argues that the hearing should “not be limited
to the broker-dealer issue” but “must be plenary instead.” Mem. at 5. McDuff contends that he
requires resolution of this issue immediately, so that he can begin subpoenaing the thirty-five
witnesses he believes are necessary at the hearing. Decl. at 1-2.
As stated in my February 29 order, I intend to give the parties an opportunity to be heard
on this subject before the hearing. Accordingly, I ORDER the parties to confer and provide my
office with a time and date for a telephonic prehearing conference. I also DENY McDuff’s
motion without prejudice, and will allow him to re-raise his motion at the prehearing conference.
The parties should also be prepared to identify what witnesses they will call at the hearing.
SO ORDERED.
