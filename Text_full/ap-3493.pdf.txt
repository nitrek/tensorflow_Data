On December 3, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings (OIP) against Respondents. A

At the prehearing conference, counsel for Respondents waived their right to a hearing
within sixty days of service of the OIP. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77h-1(b), 78u-3(b). The parties also
agreed that the hearing would be held in Chicago, Illinois, at a venue to be determined, and
would run at least from May 4 to May 13, potentially continuing until May 20.
The parties are ORDERED to file, by January 25, a joint proposed prehearing schedule,
which should include dates for the following events: 1) motions for summary disposition
(including dates for the filing of oppositions and replies); 2) exhibit and witness lists; 3) the
exchange of final pre-marked exhibits; 4) objections to witnesses and exhibits, stipulations, and
motions in limine; 5) prehearing briefs; and 6) a final telephonic prehearing conference, to be
held shortly before the hearing commences.
SO ORDERED.
