COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) alleges as follows:
SUMMARY OF THE ACTION
1.

This is a disclosure and accounting fraud case arising from the failure of RPM

International Inc. (“RPM”) to timely disclose a loss contingency, or record an accrual for, an
investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ investigation”). A public company
facing a loss contingency, such as a lawsuit or government investigation, is required under
accounting principles and the securities laws to (1) disclose the loss contingency if a material
loss is reasonably possible, and (2) record an accrual for the loss contingency if a material loss is
probable and reasonably estimable. In connection with the DOJ investigation, RPM faced a
material loss that was probable and reasonably estimable, but RPM failed to disclose the loss
contingency or record an accrual on its books when required to do so.
2.

The DOJ investigation began in 2011 in response to a complaint filed under the

False Claims Act against RPM and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tremco, Inc. (“Tremco”), and
concerned whether Tremco overcharged the federal government on certain government

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 2 of 28

contracts. In 2013, RPM settled the DOJ investigation and the underlying litigation for nearly
$61 million.
3.

Defendant Edward W. Moore, RPM’s General Counsel and Chief Compliance

Officer, oversaw RPM’s response to the DOJ investigation, but failed to disclose material facts
about the investigation to RPM’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Audit
Committee, and independent auditors (the “Audit Firm”). For example, Moore knew but failed
to inform them: (1) that RPM sent DOJ several analyses estimating that Tremco overcharged the
government by at least $11.9 million on the contracts under investigation; (2) that RPM agreed to
submit a settlement offer by a specific date to resolve the DOJ investigation; and (3) that, prior to
submitting the settlement offer, RPM’s overcharge estimates increased substantially to at least
$27-28 million. Additionally, Moore made material misrepresentations to the Audit Firm about
the DOJ investigation in connection with the Audit Firm’s reviews and audits of RPM’s financial
statements and SEC filings.
4.

As a result of Moore’s misstatements and his failure to disclose key facts regarding

the DOJ Investigation, from October 2012 through December 2013 RPM submitted multiple
materially false and misleading filings to the SEC. For example, RPM’s SEC filings from
October 2012 through January 2013 failed to disclose any information about the DOJ
investigation, including any loss contingency or accrual on RPM’s financial statements, as
required by the governing accounting principles and securities laws. Those filings also did not
disclose any material weakness in RPM’s internal controls over financial reporting or its
disclosure controls when in fact such weakness existed.
5.

Moreover, even after RPM disclosed the DOJ investigation and recorded an accrual

in April 2013, the company’s SEC filings continued to be misleading. For example, RPM’s

2

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 3 of 28

filings from April to December 2013 indicated that RPM timely disclosed and accrued for the
DOJ investigation when in fact disclosure and accrual were required in earlier reporting periods.
In addition, those SEC filings still failed to disclose any material weakness in RPM’s internal
controls over financial reporting or its disclosure controls.
6.

Because of RPM’s false and misleading SEC filings, investors were not timely

informed that a material loss relating to the DOJ investigation was reasonably possible or
probable. Investors also were not timely notified of a material weakness in RPM’s internal
control over financial reporting and its disclosure controls.
7.

In August 2014, RPM restated its financial results for three quarters that occurred

during the DOJ investigation and filed amended SEC filings for those quarters. RPM’s amended
SEC filings – unlike the original filings – disclosed the DOJ investigation and recorded accruals
in each quarter showing the company’s best estimates of probable losses related to the
investigation. Further, in connection with the restatement, RPM admitted that it made “errors”
relating to the “timing of disclosure and accrual” for the DOJ investigation and that the company
had a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting and its disclosure controls.
RPM’s restatement thus confirmed that the company’s original SEC filings referenced above
were materially false and misleading.
8.

By engaging in the conduct described herein, RPM violated antifraud, reporting,

books and records, and internal controls provisions of the securities laws, including Sections
17(a)(2) and (a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a)(2)
and 77q(a)(3)]; Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the “Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(a), 78m(b)(2)(A), and 78m(b)(2)(B)]; and
Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.12b-20, 240.13a-1,

3

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 4 of 28

240.13a-11, and 240.13a-13]. Unless restrained and enjoined, RPM will violate those provisions
again in the future.
9.

Moore violated antifraud, books and records, and misleading accountant or auditor

provisions of the securities laws, including Sections 17(a)(2) and (a)(3) of the Securities Act [15
U.S.C. §§ 77q(a)(2) and 77q(a)(3)], and Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2(a) [17 C.F.R.
§§ 240.13b2-1 and 240.13b2-2(a)]. Unless restrained and enjoined, Moore will violate those
provisions again in the future.
10.

The SEC therefore seeks a judgment against RPM and Moore providing permanent

injunctive relief and ordering RPM and Moore to pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest
and civil money penalties.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
11.

The SEC brings this action, and this Court has jurisdiction, pursuant to Securities

Act Sections 20(b), 20(d), and 22(a) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), (d), and 77v(a)], and Exchange Act
Sections 21(d)(1) and 27 [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d)(1) and 78aa].
12.

Defendants directly or indirectly, singly or in concert with others, made use of the

means or instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce, or of the
mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the acts,
transactions, and practices alleged in this Complaint.
13.

Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Securities Act Section 22(a) [15 U.S.C. §

77v(a)] and Exchange Act Section 27 [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] because Defendants transact business
in this district and violations of the securities laws alleged in this Complaint occurred within this
district, including the filing of false and misleading documents with the SEC.

through May.
15.

Edward W. Moore, age 59, is a resident of Ohio and a lawyer admitted to the Ohio

bar since 1982. From 1982 to 2006, Moore practiced corporate and securities law at a law firm.
From 2007 to the present, Moore has served as RPM’s General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
Beginning in 2011, and continuing to the present, Moore also has served as RPM’s Chief
Compliance Officer. At all relevant times, Moore was responsible for reviewing RPM’s SEC
filings and ensuring that the filings complied with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally,
at all relevant times, Moore acted within the course and scope of his employment by RPM.
FACTS
A.
16.

The FCA Complaint is Filed Against RPM and Tremco
The False Claims Act (“FCA”), 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729 – 3733, is a civil fraud statute

that allows triple damages and penalties against a party who submits a false claim to the
government. See 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a). The qui tam provisions of the FCA allow a plaintiff,
known as a “relator,” to bring an action in federal court in the name of the government. See 31
U.S.C. § 3730(b). When a relator files a complaint under the FCA, the complaint is filed under

5

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 6 of 28

seal and provided to DOJ so that DOJ may investigate the relator’s allegations. See id. After the
investigation, DOJ informs the court whether DOJ will intervene and litigate the case or decline
to intervene and allow the relator to litigate the case alone. Id.
17.

In July 2010, a former Tremco employee filed a qui tam complaint under the FCA

(the “FCA complaint”) in federal court against RPM and Tremco. The FCA complaint alleged
that Tremco overcharged the government under certain government contracts by, among other
things, failing to provide required price discounts. The FCA complaint was filed under seal and
provided to DOJ so that DOJ could investigate the allegations and decide whether to intervene in
the lawsuit.
B.
18.

The DOJ Investigation Begins
In March 2011, RPM learned of the DOJ investigation when Tremco received a

subpoena from the government, requesting documents related to Tremco’s government contracts.
19.

As RPM’s General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, Moore oversaw the

response of RPM and Tremco to the DOJ investigation. Moore also was required to keep RPM’s
CEO, CFO, and Audit Committee reasonably informed, with timely and accurate information,
regarding the status of the DOJ investigation. Additionally, Moore was responsible for updating
the Audit Firm on the status of the DOJ investigation.
20.

Moore was responsible for providing RPM’s CEO and CFO with timely and

accurate information about the DOJ investigation so that, among other things, the CEO and CFO
could evaluate RPM’s disclosure and accrual obligations before certifying the accuracy of certain
SEC filings, including RPM’s quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q, annual reports on Forms 10-K,
and the financial information therein.
21.

Soon after learning of the DOJ investigation in March 2011, RPM retained a law

6

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 7 of 28

firm (“RPM’s counsel”) to represent RPM in connection with the DOJ investigation. From the
outset of that engagement, RPM’s counsel and RPM understood that, in order to settle an FCA
matter, DOJ generally required at least two times the amount of actual damages sustained from
the false claims. RPM’s counsel that worked on the DOJ investigation did not act as RPM’s
securities disclosure counsel for SEC filings; instead, a different law firm served as RPM’s
disclosure counsel.
22.

At RPM’s quarterly Audit Committee meeting on April 5, 2011, which was

attended by RPM’s CEO and representatives from the Audit Firm, Moore discussed the DOJ
investigation. Once the Audit Firm became aware of the DOJ investigation in April 2011, its
auditors asked Moore on at least a quarterly basis whether any new developments had occurred
in the DOJ investigation.
C.
23.

Disclosure and Accrual Provisions Relating to the DOJ Investigation
Once RPM became aware of the DOJ investigation, the company had to ensure that

it complied with certain disclosure and accrual provisions of the federal securities laws in
connection with the investigation. For example, Regulation S-X requires that financial
statements included with an issuer’s SEC filings must comply with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), and provides that financial statements filed with the SEC that
are not prepared in accordance with GAAP are presumed to be misleading. See 17 C.F.R.
§210.4-01. Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 450-20 codifies GAAP regarding “loss
contingencies.” 1 A loss contingency is an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances
involving uncertainty as to a possible loss that will be resolved when one or more future events
occurs or fails to occur. See ASC 450-20-20. Loss contingencies include, among other things,
1

The ASC became effective in 2009. Prior to the ASC, GAAP regarding loss contingencies was set forth in
the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, which was often referred to as “FAS 5.”

7

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 8 of 28

(i) actual or possible claims and (ii) pending or threatened litigation. See ASC 450-20-05-10.
Under GAAP, an issuer must disclose a loss contingency if a material loss is reasonably possible,
see ASC 450-20-50-3, and an issuer must record an accrual for a loss contingency, as a charge
against income, if a material loss is probable and reasonably estimable, see ASC 450-20-25-2.
From at least March 2011 through August 2013, the DOJ investigation represented a loss
contingency.
24.

Additionally, under Item 303 of Regulation S-K (“Item 303”), which addresses

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(“MD&A”) for Forms 10-K and 10-Q, an issuer must describe any known trends or uncertainties
that have had, or that the issuer reasonably expects will have, a material unfavorable impact on
net sales, revenues, or income from continuing operations. See 17 C.F.R. § 229.303.
25.

Moreover, under Exchange Act Rule 12b-20, along with the information expressly

required to be included in an SEC filing, an issuer must also disclose such further material
information as may be necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances,
not misleading. See 17 C.F.R. § 240.12b-20.
D.

26.

The Audit Firm Suggests that RPM Consider Disclosing the DOJ
Investigation, But RPM and Moore Decide Not to Disclose
On June 7, 2012, the Audit Firm sent an e-mail to Moore regarding the Form 10-K

that was scheduled to be filed in July 2012. The e-mail stated in part: “As we head into yearend and start thinking about disclosures, etc. I wanted to pass along the attached, which is a
document with an example disclosure related to . . . government investigations.” The Audit Firm
attached to the e-mail sample language used by another public company to disclose a
government investigation in an SEC filing.
27.

Despite the Audit Firm providing sample disclosure language, RPM and Moore

8

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 9 of 28

decided not to disclose the DOJ investigation at that time.
E.
28.

DOJ Provides a Copy of the FCA Complaint to RPM
On August 9, 2012, DOJ provided a copy of the FCA complaint, which had been

partially unsealed, to RPM. Only a small group of RPM personnel, including Moore, reviewed
the FCA complaint.
29.
F.

30.

Moore did not disclose the FCA complaint to the Audit Firm.
RPM Informs DOJ that Tremco Did Not Comply with the Government
Contracts Under Investigation, and Produces Estimates of Overcharges
On September 12, 2012, with Moore’s knowledge and authorization, RPM’s

counsel met with DOJ to discuss the DOJ investigation. During that meeting, RPM’s counsel
informed DOJ that Tremco had not complied with the pricing terms of its government contracts.
RPM’s counsel also discussed with DOJ an analysis prepared by a consultant for RPM and
Tremco, which calculated that Tremco overcharged the government by at least $11 million
during part of the time period under investigation. Soon after concluding the September 12
meeting with DOJ, RPM’s counsel told Moore what transpired during the meeting, including that
the $11 million overcharge analysis was discussed with DOJ.
31.

On or around September 28, 2012, in connection with the Audit Firm’s first quarter

review of RPM, the Audit Firm asked Moore about the status of the DOJ investigation. In
response, Moore falsely told the Audit Firm that “no claim has been asserted” and the matter was
“investigative in nature and not in litigation.” In fact, Moore knew the FCA complaint had been
filed against RPM and Tremco in federal court.
32.

On October 1, 2012, about two weeks after the September 12 meeting with DOJ,

Moore sent a management representation letter to the Audit Firm in connection with the first
quarter review of RPM. In the letter, Moore stated that, “since June 1, 2012, neither I, nor any of

9

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 10 of 28

the lawyers over whom I exercise general legal supervision, have given substantive attention to,
or represented the Company in connection with, material loss contingencies” exceeding $1.2
million. That representation was materially false and misleading because Moore knew that he
and RPM’s counsel represented RPM in connection with the DOJ investigation, and that RPM’s
potential loss relating to the DOJ investigation was at least $11 million.
33.

That same evening, on October 1, 2012, with Moore’s knowledge and

authorization, RPM sent DOJ a written analysis, estimating that Tremco overcharged the
government by approximately $11.4 million during part of the time period under investigation.
That analysis set forth in writing the information that had been shared orally with DOJ at the
meeting on September 12, and did not include any damages multiplier under the FCA.
Moreover, as the $11.4 million overcharge estimate related to only part of the time period under
investigation and to only one of the contracts under investigation, and additional overcharge
analyses were planned or underway, Moore knew or should have known that the total amount by
which Tremco overcharged the government likely was greater than $11.4 million.
34.

The next morning, on October 2, 2012, RPM’s Audit Committee held its quarterly

meeting, which was attended by, among others, the CEO, the CFO, representatives from the
Audit Firm, and Moore. During the meeting, however, Moore failed to disclose the $11.4
million overcharge estimate that had been sent to DOJ.
35.

As of October 2, 2012, the date of the Audit Committee meeting, RPM had not yet

submitted its SEC filings for the fiscal first quarter ended August 31, 2012. Even without
considering the effect of any possible multiplier under the FCA, the $11.4 million overcharge
estimate sent to DOJ was material because it equaled approximately 30% of RPM’s net income
for the first quarter.

10

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 11 of 28

G.

RPM’s First Quarter SEC Filings Do Not Disclose Any Information or
Accrual Relating to the DOJ Investigation

36.

On October 3, 2012, RPM filed a Form 8-K, signed by Moore, which attached a

press release concerning RPM’s financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended August 31,
2012. The next day, October 4, 2012, RPM filed a Form 10-Q for the fiscal first quarter.
37.

By the dates of those SEC filings on October 3 and 4, 2012, Moore knew or should

have known it was not only reasonably possible, but probable and reasonably estimable, that
RPM would incur a material loss in connection with the DOJ investigation. Similarly, by the
dates of those SEC filings, Moore knew it was reasonably likely that the DOJ investigation
would have a material unfavorable impact on RPM’s income in the future because the likely
floor for RPM’s range of loss was at least $11.4 million, even before considering the impact of
any damages multiplier under the FCA.
38.

Nevertheless, despite the disclosure duties imposed by ASC 450-20 (requiring the

disclosure of a material loss contingency or accrual), Item 303 (requiring the disclosure of a
trend or uncertainty reasonably expected to have a material unfavorable impact), and Rule 12b20 (requiring the disclosure of additional material information needed to make the statements in
an SEC filing not misleading), neither the Form 8-K nor the Form 10-Q disclosed any
information or accrual relating to the DOJ investigation.
39.

RPM’s Form 8-K filed October 3, 2012 purported to provide the company’s

financial results for its fiscal first quarter but misleadingly failed to disclose the material impact
of the DOJ investigation on those results. As shown by RPM’s subsequent restatement, contrary
to the originally reported first quarter results, RPM was required to record an accrual for the DOJ
investigation as a charge against income in its first quarter.
40.

Although RPM’s Form 10-Q filed October 4, 2012 discussed “contingencies” in the

11

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 12 of 28

notes to the company’s financial statements and in the MD&A section, RPM omitted any
information about the DOJ investigation, which was necessary to make the discussion regarding
contingencies not misleading. RPM’s Form 10-Q also stated that, “We are party to various
claims and lawsuits” and “we record provisions when we consider the liability probable and
reasonably estimable,” but misleadingly failed to disclose that in fact a material loss relating to
the DOJ investigation was probable and reasonably estimable by October 4, 2012, when the
Form 10-Q was filed.
41.

Additionally, RPM’s Form 10-Q falsely and misleadingly stated that, as of the end

of RPM’s first quarter, “our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange
Act (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
Commission’s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow for
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.” In fact, as RPM later admitted in connection
with its restatement, its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the end of the
first quarter.
42.

On October 19, 2012, about two weeks after RPM’s first quarter SEC filings, RPM

filed with the SEC a Prospectus Supplement for a $300 million notes offering. Moore oversaw
the notes offering and reviewed the Prospectus Supplement before it was filed with the SEC.
The Prospectus Supplement stated to investors that “[i]t is important for you to read and consider
all information . . . incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement . . . in making your
investment decision.” The Prospectus Supplement incorporated by reference RPM’s SEC
filings, including the materially misleading first quarter Form 10-Q filed on October 4, 2012.

12

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 13 of 28

RPM’s sale of the notes closed on or around October 23, 2012.
H.

Moore’s Awareness of Negative Repercussions from Disclosing the DOJ
Investigation or Recording an Accrual

43.

Around the time of RPM’s first quarter SEC filings in October 2012, Moore was

aware of pressure to avoid, or at least postpone, recording another one-time charge on RPM’s
books. In RPM’s Form 8-K filed on October 3, 2012, which related to RPM’s first quarter
results, the company disclosed two one-time charges that were unrelated to the DOJ
investigation: a $45 million charge for certain work in India, and another $11 million charge for
other work overseas. According to the Chairman of RPM’s Audit Committee, at the Audit
Committee meeting on October 2, 2012, the Committee communicated that “we’re not going to
be accepting of ongoing extraordinary charges or one-time charges. We didn’t think that that
would bode well for the company and . . . the impression of our shareholders and others of how
we run the business, and we made that clear.” Similarly, at RPM’s annual shareholder meeting
on October 4, 2012, RPM’s CEO told the shareholders that RPM would not “water torture them”
with additional one-time “charges quarter after quarter.”
44.

Moore also was aware that disclosing the DOJ investigation or recording an accrual

could negatively affect RPM’s stock price. According to Moore, disclosing the DOJ
investigation in RPM’s first quarter SEC filings could have caused “uncertainty” and
“depress[ed] the value of the stock.” Moore had a personal interest in RPM’s stock price
because, as of August 31, 2012, he owned 65,952 shares of RPM stock – worth more than $1.8
million – plus 65,000 RPM stock options.
45.

In addition, Moore was aware that disclosing the DOJ investigation might cause

reputational harm to RPM and Tremco. According to Moore, disclosing the DOJ investigation in
RPM’s first quarter SEC filings could have caused “harm to [RPM’s] roofing business.” Further,

13

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 14 of 28

according to Moore, if the FCA complaint “became public and everybody read about these really
scandalous allegations,” that could “really damage [Tremco’s] business, possibly irreparably.”
I.

46.

DOJ Conveys a Deadline for Intervention in the FCA Case, and RPM Says It
Will Submit a Settlement Offer
On November 5, 2012, DOJ notified RPM by e-mail that the seal on the FCA

complaint would expire on January 17, 2013, and thus DOJ “want[ed] to make sure that the
parties are in an appropriate posture by that date (i.e., this matter is resolved or the United States
is prepared to inform the Court of its intervention determination).” RPM’s counsel conveyed
DOJ’s message to Moore.
47.

On November 29, 2012, Moore attended a seminar regarding the FCA. According

to Moore, during that seminar it was discussed that DOJ typically seeks to settle FCA cases for at
least two times the amount of damages sustained from the false claims.
48.

On December 14, 2012, with Moore’s knowledge and authorization, RPM sent DOJ

another analysis, calculating that Tremco overcharged the government by an additional $487,000
on its government contracts. Therefore, by December 14, 2012, Moore knew that Tremco had
overcharged the government by at least $11.9 million, and that RPM was working on additional
overcharge calculations, so the total overcharge amount likely would continue to rise.
49.

On December 19, 2012, with Moore’s knowledge and authorization, RPM informed

DOJ that RPM would submit a settlement offer to resolve the DOJ investigation and the
underlying FCA case by January 11, 2013. No later than December 19, 2012, with Moore’s
knowledge and authorization, RPM’s counsel began preparing a written settlement offer.
50.

Two days later, on December 21, 2012, RPM’s counsel and certain RPM personnel,

including Moore, held a conference call to discuss the DOJ investigation and RPM’s planned
settlement offer. During the call, the participants discussed the components of the planned

14

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 15 of 28

settlement offer and those components totaled $27-28 million. That figure represented the
amount that RPM calculated Tremco had overcharged the government on the contracts under
investigation, without considering any damages multiplier under the FCA.
51.

One week later, on December 28, 2012, Moore sent another management

representation letter to the Audit Firm in connection with the second quarter review of RPM. In
the letter, Moore stated that, “since June 1, 2012, neither I, nor any of the lawyers over whom I
exercise general legal supervision, have given substantive attention to, or represented the
Company in connection with, material loss contingencies” exceeding $1.2 million. That
representation was materially false and misleading because Moore knew that he and RPM’s
counsel represented RPM in connection with the DOJ investigation; that RPM was planning to
submit a settlement offer to resolve the DOJ investigation by January 11, 2013; and that
estimates for the settlement offer were approximately $27-28 million.
52.

Also on or around December 28, 2012, as part of the second quarter review of

RPM, the Audit Firm again asked Moore about the status of the DOJ investigation. During that
conversation, Moore falsely stated that “no claim has been filed” and “no loss contingency
exists.” Contrary to that statement, however, Moore knew the FCA complaint had been filed
against RPM and he knew about the DOJ investigation.
53.

On January 4, 2013, four days before RPM was scheduled to file its Form 10-Q for

the fiscal second quarter, RPM’s Audit Committee held its quarterly meeting. That meeting was
attended by, among others, RPM’s CEO, CFO, the Chairman of the Audit Committee,
representatives from the Audit Firm, and Moore. During the meeting, Moore purported to
provide an update on the current status of the DOJ investigation. But Moore’s update was
materially inaccurate because he did not disclose: (1) any of the overcharge estimates that had

15

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 16 of 28

been sent to DOJ, which by this time totaled nearly $12 million; (2) that RPM had told DOJ a
settlement offer would be submitted by January 11, 2013; or (3) that calculations for the
settlement offer had reached $27-28 million. Indeed, Moore did not disclose that information to
RPM’s CEO, CFO, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, or the Audit Firm at any time prior to
RPM’s second quarter SEC filings on January 8, 2013. Additionally, prior to January 8, 2013,
Moore did not disclose the underlying FCA complaint to the Audit Firm.
J.

RPM’s Second Quarter SEC Filings Do Not Disclose Any Information or
Accrual Relating to the DOJ Investigation
On January 8, 2013, RPM filed a Form 8-K, signed by Moore, which attached a

press release concerning RPM’s financial results for the fiscal second quarter ended November
30, 2012. That same day, RPM also filed a Form 10-Q for the fiscal second quarter.
55.

By the date of those SEC filings on January 8, 2013, Moore knew or should have

known it was not only reasonably possible, but probable and reasonably estimable, that RPM
would incur a material loss in connection with the DOJ investigation. Similarly, by January 8,
Moore knew it was reasonably likely that the DOJ investigation would have a material
unfavorable impact on RPM’s income in the future because the likely floor for RPM’s range of
loss was at least $27-28 million, even before considering the impact of a damages multiplier
under the FCA.
56.

But again, in violation of the disclosure duties imposed by ASC 450-20, Item 303,

and Rule 12b-20, neither RPM’s Form 8-K nor its Form 10-Q disclosed any information or
accrual relating to the DOJ investigation.
57.

RPM’s Form 8-K filed January 8, 2013 purported to provide the company’s

financial results for its fiscal second quarter but misleadingly failed to disclose the material
impact of the DOJ investigation on those results. As shown by RPM’s subsequent restatement,

16

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 17 of 28

contrary to the originally reported second quarter results, RPM was required to record an accrual
for the DOJ investigation as a charge against income in its second quarter.
58.

RPM’s Form 10-Q filed January 8, 2013 again discussed “contingencies” in the

notes to RPM’s financial statements and in the MD&A section but omitted any information
about the DOJ investigation, which was necessary to make the statements made regarding
contingencies not misleading. Also, the Form 10-Q again stated that RPM records accruals for
claims and lawsuits “when we consider the liability probable and reasonably estimable,” but
misleadingly failed to mention that in fact a material loss relating to the DOJ investigation was
probable and reasonably estimable by January 8, 2013, when the Form 10-Q was filed.
59.

Additionally, RPM’s Form 10-Q falsely and misleadingly stated that, as of the end

of RPM’s second quarter, the company’s “disclosure controls and procedures were effective.”
But, as RPM later admitted in connection with its restatement, its disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective at the end of the second quarter.
60.

As of January 8, 2013, when RPM’s second quarter Form 10-Q was filed with the

SEC, Moore had only told the Audit Firm that the range of loss for the DOJ investigation was
approximately $5 million. That representation was materially false and misleading because
Moore knew that RPM had submitted overcharge estimates to DOJ totaling nearly $12 million
(without considering any damages multiplier under the FCA), and that RPM was planning to
submit a settlement offer of approximately $27-28 million in a matter of days.
K.
61.

RPM Submits a Settlement Offer to DOJ and Records an Accrual
On January 10, 2013, two days after RPM’s second quarter Form 10-Q was filed

with the SEC, Moore told RPM’s CEO for the first time that the potential range of loss for the
DOJ investigation had grown from $5 million to $28 million. Upon learning that information,

17

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 18 of 28

the CEO was surprised and angry and asked Moore, “How the hell could this happen?”
According to the CEO, it was “impossible” for the range of loss to have grown so significantly
between January 8 and 10, 2013.
62.

The next day, January 11, 2013, RPM submitted a 44-page settlement proposal to

DOJ, offering to settle the DOJ investigation and the underlying FCA case for $28.3 million –
the amount that RPM estimated Tremco overcharged the government without any damages
multiplier under the FCA.
63.

RPM’s CFO did not learn that the company made a settlement offer of $28.3

million until eleven days later, at a Board of Directors meeting on January 22, 2013. The CFO
was shocked to learn that RPM’s offer, and its financial exposure in the DOJ investigation, were
so high. The CFO did not know the true amount or range of RPM’s reasonably possible or
probable loss in the DOJ investigation prior to that Board meeting because Moore failed to
inform him of material developments in the investigation.
64.

On March 29, 2013, DOJ conveyed a settlement counter-offer of $71 million, which

included a damages multiplier of approximately 2.5 under the FCA. On April 1, 2013, RPM for
the first time recorded an accrual for the DOJ investigation, in the amount of $68.8 million,
which was reflected on the company’s books as of the fiscal third quarter.
L.
65.

RPM Discloses the DOJ Investigation and Accrual
On April 4, 2013, RPM filed a Form 8-K, signed by Moore, which attached a press

release concerning RPM’s financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended February 28, 2013,
and publicly disclosed for the first time the DOJ investigation and related accrual. Later that
day, RPM filed a Form 10-Q for its third quarter that also discussed the DOJ investigation and
accrual. The Form 10-Q reported a net loss by RPM of $42.2 million for the third quarter,

18

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 19 of 28

compared to net income of $7.9 million for the same quarter one year earlier. According to the
10-Q, the “primary driver of the decline” was the $68.8 million accrual for the DOJ
investigation. Both the Forms 8-K and 10-Q misleadingly indicated that RPM had timely
disclosed and accrued for the DOJ investigation in the fiscal third quarter, when in fact
disclosure and accrual were required in the first and second quarters, as indicated by RPM’s
subsequent restatement.
66.

As of April 4, 2013, when RPM publicly disclosed the DOJ investigation, the

underlying FCA complaint remained under seal. Thus, the fact that the complaint was sealed did
not prevent RPM from disclosing the DOJ investigation in an SEC filing.
M.
67.

Moore Makes Further Misrepresentations to the Audit Firm About the DOJ
Investigation
On June 10, 2013, in connection with RPM’s fiscal year audit and the preparation

of its Form 10-K, the Audit Firm met with Moore and asked about the timing of RPM’s accrual
for the DOJ investigation. During the meeting, Moore stated that, after RPM’s Form 10-Q was
filed on January 8, 2013, RPM completed additional pricing calculations for certain years under
investigation and the government threatened to unseal the FCA complaint, and therefore RPM
decided to make a settlement offer of $28 million on January 11, 2013.
68.

Moore’s June 10, 2013 statements to the Audit Firm were materially false and

misleading because on December 19, 2012 – weeks before RPM’s Form 10-Q was filed on
January 8, 2013 – RPM told DOJ a settlement offer would be submitted by January 11, 2013.
Further, Moore’s June 10, 2013 statements to the Audit Firm were misleading because Moore
still did not disclose the overcharge estimates that RPM had sent to DOJ prior to submitting the
settlement offer or that RPM’s estimates of the contractual overcharges had grown to $27-28
million by the time RPM’s second quarter Form 10-Q was filed on January 8, 2013.

N.

RPM’s Form 10-K Discusses the DOJ Investigation, But Fails to Disclose
Any Material Weakness in RPM’s Controls and Misleadingly Indicates that
RPM Timely Disclosed and Accrued for the DOJ Investigation

69.

On July 24, 2013, RPM filed its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013.

The Form 10-K discussed the DOJ investigation and the related accrual that RPM recorded in its
third quarter ended February 28, 2013. The Form 10-K, however, misleadingly indicated that
RPM timely disclosed and accrued for the DOJ investigation in the third quarter, when in fact
disclosure and accrual were required in the first two quarters. Additionally, the Form 10-K
misleadingly failed to disclose any material weakness in RPM’s internal control over financial
reporting at any point during the fiscal year, when in fact such weakness existed. Instead, the
Form 10-K misleadingly stated that RPM’s internal controls were effective.
70.

In July 2013, RPM paid Moore a cash bonus of $300,000 for the fiscal year ended

May 31, 2013. That bonus was based in part on RPM’s financial performance during the fiscal
year, including the company’s net income, which was bolstered by the October 2012 notes
offering.
71. In August 2013, RPM settled the DOJ investigation and the underlying FCA case
for approximately $61 million. DOJ issued a press release announcing the settlement on August
28, 2013.
72. On December 5, 2013, RPM filed with the SEC a Prospectus Supplement for a
$200 million notes offering. The underwriters exercised an option to purchase additional notes,
bringing the total amount of the offering to $205 million. Moore oversaw the notes offering and
reviewed the Prospectus Supplement before it was filed with the SEC. The Prospectus
Supplement incorporated by reference RPM’s SEC filings, including the materially misleading
Form 10-K filed on July 24, 2013, and stated that it was “important” for investors to consider
this information. RPM’s sale of the notes closed on or around December 9, 2013.

O.
73.

The Audit Firm Learns New Facts About the DOJ Investigation
On March 31, 2014, RPM sent the SEC staff a written chronology of events related

to the DOJ investigation. Moore reviewed and authorized the chronology before it was sent to
the SEC.
74.

The chronology discussed RPM’s communications with DOJ in 2012 and 2013.

Among other things, the chronology stated that, “[o]n December 19, 2012, RPM and Tremco
informed the DOJ that a settlement proposal would be submitted by January 11, 2013.”
75.

On April 5, 2014, the Audit Firm received a copy of RPM’s chronology and learned

for the first time that, on December 19, 2012, RPM told DOJ a settlement offer would be
submitted by January 11, 2013. Upon learning that new information, the Audit Firm was
concerned. Shortly after reviewing RPM’s chronology, on April 5, 2014, the Audit Firm sent an
e-mail to Moore and RPM’s CFO, stating in part: “We had an Audit Committee meeting on
January 4, 2013 and the November 30, 2012 10-Q was filed January 8 I believe. At this time, we
were told the whole matter was still a $5 million issue.”
P.

The Audit Firm Asks Additional Questions About the DOJ Investigation,
and Moore Makes Additional Misrepresentations

76.

On April 8, 2014, members of the Audit Firm met with Moore and RPM’s CFO to

discuss the chronology that RPM submitted to the SEC and a Form S-3 registration statement for
which RPM needed the Audit Firm’s consent before filing with the SEC. During the meeting,
Moore told the Audit Firm that: (1) on December 19, 2012, the range of reasonably possible loss
for the DOJ investigation was $0 to $10 million; (2) the range of reasonably possible loss
continued to be $0 to $10 million through January 8, 2013, when RPM’s second quarter Form
10-Q was filed; and (3) the range of loss went from $0 to $10 million up to $28 million, and
became probable, between January 8 and 11, 2013.

21

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 22 of 28

77.

Moore’s April 8, 2014 statements to the Audit Firm were materially false and

misleading because Moore knew that: (1) by December 19, 2012, the overcharge estimates RPM
had sent to DOJ totaled nearly $12 million without any damages multiplier under the FCA; (2)
by January 8, 2013, RPM’s calculations for its settlement offer had reached $27-28 million; and
(3) RPM’s range of reasonably possible or probable loss had reached $27-28 million by
December 21, 2012 – it did not jump to that amount between January 8 and 11, 2013. Based on
Moore’s misrepresentations, the Audit Firm provided its consent for the Form S-3, which RPM
filed with the SEC.
78.

In July 2014, RPM paid Moore a cash bonus of $400,000 for the fiscal year ended

May 31, 2014. That bonus was based in part on RPM’s financial performance during the fiscal
year, including the company’s net income, which was bolstered by the December 2013 notes
offering.
Q.
79.

RPM Restates its Financial Statements
During the summer of 2014, the Audit Firm learned additional facts about the DOJ

investigation, including the overcharge estimates that RPM sent to DOJ in 2012. As a result of
that new information, on or around July 17, 2014, the Audit Firm told RPM that the Audit Firm
would not sign off on RPM’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014, unless RPM
conducted an independent investigation regarding its disclosure and accrual for the DOJ
investigation. In response, RPM’s Audit Committee hired a law firm to conduct an investigation
(the “Audit Committee investigation”). The Audit Committee investigation took place from late
July through early August 2014.
80.

On August 10, 2014, the findings of the Audit Committee investigation were shared

with the Audit Firm in a conference call. Those findings included, among other things, that by

22

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 23 of 28

the end of the third week of December 2012, it became “known to Ed Moore” that RPM’s
financial exposure in the DOJ investigation was “going to jump” from around $11 million to
around $28 million; that RPM’s securities “[d]isclosure counsel [was] not aware” of the
overcharge estimates sent to DOJ; and that Moore made “mistakes,” including “no disclosure to
[the Audit Firm] or audit committee” at the Audit Committee meeting on January 4, 2013.
81.

The next day, August 11, 2014, the Audit Committee directed RPM to restate the

first, second, and third quarters of fiscal year 2013. RPM determined that its restated financial
statements would reflect an $11.4 million accrual for the DOJ investigation in the first quarter
(which corresponded to the $11.4 million estimate sent to DOJ on October 1, 2012), and an
additional $16.9 million accrual for the investigation in the second quarter (for a total accrual of
$28.3 million, which corresponded to RPM’s settlement offer to DOJ on January 11, 2013).
RPM also restated its third quarter to reduce the accrual in that quarter from $68.8 million to
$40.5 million, since $28.3 million was accrued in the restated first and second quarters.
82.

On August 14, 2014, RPM filed a Form 8-K, signed by Moore, to announce the

restatement. The Form 8-K stated that RPM made “errors” in disclosing and accruing for the
DOJ investigation. The restatement was necessary because RPM’s disclosure and accounting
errors were material. Moreover, RPM’s Form 8-K also disclosed that “the restatement reflects a
material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and that its
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective” as of the first and second fiscal quarters
ended on August 31 and November 30, 2012.
83.

Also on August 14, 2014, RPM filed amended Forms 10-Q for the first quarter

ended August 31, 2012, and the second quarter ended November 30, 2012. The amended Forms
10-Q, unlike the originals, disclosed the DOJ investigation and reflected accruals showing

23

Case 1:16-cv-01803 Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 24 of 28

RPM’s “best estimate of the amount of probable loss” associated with the DOJ investigation.
84.

RPM’s restatement and amended SEC filings thus confirmed that RPM’s original

SEC filings in 2012 and 2013, referenced above, were materially inaccurate. By filing amended
Forms 10-Q that disclosed the DOJ investigation and related accruals, RPM essentially admitted
not only that a material loss was reasonably possible by October 4, 2012 and January 8, 2013,
when the original Forms 10-Q were filed, but also that a material loss was probable and
estimable by those dates.
