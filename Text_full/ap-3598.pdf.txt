The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on January 13, 2016, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(e) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and the
hearing was scheduled to commence on February 16, 2016. The proceeding is a follow-on
proceeding based on SEC v. Hansen, No. 1:13-cv-1403 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 21, 2015), appeal filed,
No. 16-74 (2d Cir. Jan. 8, 2016), in which Respondent RAHFCO Management Group, LLC, was
enjoined against violations of the antifraud provisions. Randal Hansen, a partner of RAHFCO,
has appeared on behalf of RAHFCO and timely filed an Answer to the OIP. See 17 C.F.R. §§
201.102(b), 220.
The Division of Enforcement has requested that the hearing be postponed and a
prehearing conference scheduled. Since Hansen is currently incarcerated at Duluth FPC,1 the
Division is directed to contact that facility to determine when he can be available for a telephonic
prehearing conference and to report on its efforts by February 22, 2016. The hearing will be
postponed sine die.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
