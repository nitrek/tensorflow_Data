ORDER DISMISSING
APPLICATION FOR REVIEW

ROGELIO GUEVARA

FINRA requests that we dismiss an application for review filed by Rogelio Guevara
(“Guevara”).1 Guevara seeks review of a FINRA order barring him for failing to respond to its
requests that he provide information in connection with an inquiry regarding his conduct. In
seeking Commission review, Guevara failed to comply with the filing deadline established by
Section 19(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and our Rule of Practice 420(b) by filing
his application more than 30 days after he received FINRA’s decision.2 In addition, Guevara
failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with FINRA. For these independent reasons, we
dismiss Guevara’s application.
Background
On July 17, 2015, Guevara was permitted to resign from his position as a registered
representative at Northwestern Mutual Investment Services (“Northwestern Mutual”). At the
time, Guevara was under internal review for using his personal bank account to make premium
payments for clients on several non-variable life insurance policies.
On September 15, 2015, FINRA notified Guevara that it was conducting an inquiry with
respect to a Form U5 filing from Northwestern Mutual alleging that he had made the premium
payments. FINRA informed Guevara that the “purpose of the inquiry is to determine whether
violations of the federal securities laws or FINRA, NASD, NYSE, or MSRB rules have
occurred.” Pursuant to its Rule 8210, FINRA directed Guevara to provide it with certain

documents by September 29, 2015.3 FINRA sent the letter by certified and first class mail to
Guevara’s address as listed in the Central Registration Depository (“CRD”) system.4
On October 5, 2015, FINRA sent Guevara an additional letter at his CRD address, also by
certified and first class mail. It stated that Guevara had not responded to the September 15, 2015
letter and directed him to provide the documents requested to FINRA by October 19, 2015.
Guevara did not do so.
On November 20, 2015, FINRA notified Guevara by certified and first class mail that,
unless he provided the requested documents, he would be suspended, pursuant to FINRA Rule
9552, from associating with any FINRA member on December 14, 2015.5 That letter also
informed Guevara that he could request a hearing before the suspension date, which would stay
the effective date of the suspension, and that, if he were suspended, he could file a written
request for termination of the suspension on the ground of full compliance with the notice. But if
Guevara failed to do so by February 23, 2016, the letter stated, he would automatically be barred
from associating with any FINRA member in any capacity.6 FINRA again sent its notice to
Guevara by certified and first class mail to the address listed in the CRD system.
On December 15, 2015, FINRA notified Guevara that he had been suspended because he
had not provided the requested documents. FINRA also reminded Guevara that he could file a
request to terminate the suspension on the ground of full compliance. On February 23, 2016,
having received no documents or such request from Guevara, FINRA informed him that he had
been barred from association with any FINRA member. FINRA advised Guevara that, if he
wished to appeal the bar, he would need to file an application for review with the Commission
within 30 days of his receipt of its letter. As with its other notices to Guevara, FINRA sent these
letters to Guevara’s CRD address by certified and first class mail.

On April 14, 2016, Guevara filed an application for review of FINRA’s action with the
Commission. Guevara asserted that he had moved from his CRD address in April 2015 and,
only on April 8, 2016, had he collected and reviewed FINRA’s letters. In his application,
Guevara admitted to making the payments at issue from his personal bank account, admitted that
he “made a mistake,” and attached several statements and documents purporting to explain the
circumstances under which the payments were made.
Analysis
We dismiss Guevara’s application for review for two independent reasons. First,
Guevara filed it after the deadline to do so. Under Exchange Act Section 19(d), a person who
wishes to appeal a FINRA decision imposing a “final disciplinary sanction” must file an
application for review with the Commission “within thirty days after the date” notice of the
decision “was filed with [the Commission] and received by such aggrieved person.”7 FINRA
served notice of its decision on Guevara at his CRD address on February 23, 2016, by certified
and first class mail, which “started the running of the appeal period.”8 Because FINRA served
Guevara by mail, we add an additional three days to the 30-day appeal period.9 Therefore,
Guevara had until March 28, 2016, to file his application for review. Guevara filed his
application for review on April 14, 2016—17 days after the appeal period expired. It is thus
untimely.
Our Rule of Practice 420(b), which is “the exclusive remedy for seeking an extension of
the 30-day [filing] period,” provides that we will not grant an extension “absent a showing of
extraordinary circumstances.”10 Guevara asserts that he took possession of FINRA’s
correspondence on April 8, 2016, when he collected mail from his CRD address, at which he
states that he has not resided since April 2015. But because Guevara failed to keep his CRD

address current as FINRA’s by-laws require,11 his belated collection of FINRA’s bar notice does
not excuse his failure to timely file his application.12 Guevara also asserts that he has now
provided the documents FINRA requested as attachments to his application for review. This
does not provide exceptional circumstances either because to treat it as such “would undermine
the important investor protections Rule 8210 is meant to safeguard.”13
Second, we also dismiss Guevara’s application for the independent reason that he failed
to exhaust his administrative remedies before FINRA. “[W]e will not consider an application for
review if that applicant failed to exhaust FINRA’s procedures for contesting the sanction at
issue.”14 Guevara “was given the opportunity to avail h[im]self of FINRA’s administrative
process through taking corrective action, requesting a hearing in response to the notice of
suspension, or filing for termination of the suspension.”15 Although FINRA advised Guevara of
each of these options, Guevara failed to pursue any of them.
By going directly to the Commission, Guevara seeks to bypass FINRA’s process. But
allowing applicants to do so “would severely hinder the self-regulatory capabilities of the SROs

and prevent the efficient resolution of disputes” with associated persons.16 Requiring applicants,
like Guevara, to exhaust all available SRO remedies and appeals before we will consider a
challenge to FINRA action “promotes the development of a record in a forum particularly suited
to create it, upon which the Commission and, subsequently, the courts can more effectively
conduct their review.”17 Because Guevara failed to take advantage of the opportunities for
compliance and review that FINRA provided him, he failed to exhaust his administrative
remedies before FINRA.18
Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth above, IT IS ORDERED that Rogelio
Guevara’s application for review is DISMISSED.

Id. FINRA rules required Guevara “to provide the [requested] documents to FINRA in
the first instance.” Ceballos, 2013 WL 772515, at *5. Had Guevara done so, instead of
attaching documents to his application for review by the Commission, FINRA could have
“evaluate[d] the sufficiency of [Guevara’s] response and provided a record for us to review.” Id.
FINRA also could have corrected any errors in its determination. MFS Sec. Corp. v. SEC, 380
F.3d at 621 (holding that the administrative exhaustion requirement “provides SROs with the
opportunity to correct their own errors prior to review by the Commission”).

exhaust administrative remedies where, as here, applicant “failed to exercise her rights at any
stage of the process before FINRA”).
