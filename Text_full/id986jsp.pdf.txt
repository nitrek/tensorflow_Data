In the Matter of
IREECO, LLC, AND
IREECO LIMITED

APPEARANCES:

INITIAL DECISION
March 24, 2016

Andrew O. Schiff for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission
Joseph A. Sacher, Gordon & Rees LLP, for Respondents

BEFORE:

Jason S. Patil, Administrative Law Judge
Summary

In this initial decision, I order Respondent Ireeco, LLC (Ireeco LLC), to pay disgorgement
of $1,700,000 plus prejudgment interest and Respondent Ireeco Limited to pay disgorgement of
$1,479,633.85 plus prejudgment interest. I do not order a civil penalty against either Respondent.
Procedural History
On June 23, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in
which it accepted Respondents’ offers of settlement and made findings. Specifically, the
Commission found that Respondents willfully violated Exchange Act Section 15(a)(1); ordered
them to cease and desist from committing or causing such violations or future violations;
censured them; and ordered additional proceedings to determine the appropriateness of
“disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and/or civil penalties.” OIP at 5.
Based on the parties’ agreement to proceed by motion and documentary evidence rather
than a live hearing, I set a schedule for the filing of motion papers, allowing Respondents to file
a sur-reply, as well as provided for an oral argument, at the parties’ option. Ireeco, LLC, Admin.
Proc. Rulings Release No. 3004, 2015 SEC LEXIS 3148 (ALJ Aug. 3, 2015). The Division filed
its motion on August 18, Respondents filed their opposition on September 28, the Division filed

its reply on October 9, and Respondents filed their sur-reply on October 19, 2015. I entered a
protective order on September 30 to keep sensitive financial information concerning
Respondents’ alleged inability to pay from the public record. Portions of this initial decision
covered by the protective order are redacted. Ireeco, LLC, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No.
3176, 2015 SEC LEXIS 3992. The parties did not request an oral argument.
I determined the issues in this proceeding “on the basis of affidavits, declarations,
excerpts of sworn deposition or investigative testimony, and documentary evidence.” OIP at 5. I
have considered all evidence, and where I have found a fact supported by the preponderance of
evidence, and relevant to any remaining remedies issues, I have noted both my finding and
evidentiary support in my analysis. See Steadman v. SEC, 450 U.S. 91, 100-04 (1981).
Facts
For this proceeding, the Commission’s findings in the OIP are “deemed true” and
Respondents are “precluded from arguing they did not violate the federal securities laws
described in [the OIP].” OIP § IV. While I do not recite all of the Commission’s factual
findings contained in the OIP, I include a brief summary below and incorporate the remainder by
reference.
Ireeco LLC, a Florida limited liability company, was formed in May 2006 by Stephen
Parnell and Andrew Bartlett and was based in Boca Raton, Florida. OIP ¶ 1. Ireeco LLC was
never registered with the Commission in any capacity. Id. From at least January 2010 through
May 2012, Ireeco LLC acted as an unregistered broker-dealer in connection with the sales of
securities involving the EB-5 visa program, which provides immigrants to the United States with
the opportunity to become lawful permanent residents by investing in the U.S. economy through
EB-5 projects.1 Id. ¶¶ 1, 5.
Ireeco Limited, a Hong Kong entity, was formed by Parnell and Bartlett in May 2012 for
tax purposes. OIP ¶ 2. Ireeco Limited is the 100% owner of Ireeco LLC. Id. Ireeco Limited
has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity. Id. From at least May 2012
through June 2015, Ireeco Limited acted as an unregistered broker-dealer in connection with the
sales of securities involving the EB-5 visa program. Id. Parnell and Bartlett are the co-managing
members of Ireeco LLC and principals and equal co-owners of Ireeco Limited. Id. ¶¶ 3-4.
Respondents offered to assist foreign investors in choosing the right EB-5 projects. OIP
¶ 11. More specifically, once Respondents understood a potential investor’s EB-5 preferences
and suitability, they would provide one or more EB-5 projects as possible choices, as well as
background information on the projects. Id. ¶ 14. Respondents also performed due diligence on
each of the projects it selected for their customers. Id. After investors identified which project
they were most interested in, Respondents “registered” the customers with the project by
providing their names, contact information, and visa status. Id. ¶ 15. The investors then dealt

EB-5 projects are investment projects based on proposals for promoting economic growth and
are administered by EB-5 regional centers. OIP ¶ 6. A regional center is any economic entity,
public or private, which is involved with the promotion of economic growth, improved regional
productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment. Id.
2

directly with the project, with Respondents being consulted by investors on occasion, such as
when investors had questions about the investment or offering materials. Id. As part of the
investment process, many projects required each applicant investor to pay an administrative fee,
which varied from project to project, and was typically used to offset legal fees, travel, and other
project expenses. Id. ¶ 7.
Respondents entered into referral partner agreements with the EB-5 projects they
recommended to their customers. OIP ¶ 16. Respondents were compensated by the EB-5
projects for each registered investor who invested funds in an EB-5 offering. Id. The fee was a
commission based on a fixed portion of an administrative fee paid by each investor upon
investing in a project, averaging around $35,000 per investor. Id. Respondents only earned the
fee once an investor’s conditional green card was approved. Id. From January 2010 through
June 2015, Respondents were paid fees for actively soliciting over 158 foreign investors for
selected EB-5 projects. Id. ¶ 17. Together, these investors invested a combined total of $79
million. Id. Respondents referred most of the investors to the same handful of EB-5 projects.
Id.
The referral fees received by Respondents during the period alleged in the OIP were as
follows: $2,146,116.15 by Ireeco LLC and $1,479,633.85 by Ireeco Limited. See Motion, Ex. A
& Exs. 1-3.2 Respondents do not dispute these fees were paid to them by the EB-5 projects after
their referred investors received conditional green cards, and, although certain documents call
these fees “consultancy fees,” such fees were essentially commissions. See OIP ¶¶ 16-17;
Motion, Ex. A. These fees were unlawful because Respondents were not registered or associated
with a registered broker-dealer. OIP ¶ 18.
From 2010 to 2012, Ireeco LLC distributed $1.7 million to its sole officers, Parnell and
Bartlett. Motion, Ex. A at Ex. 3.
Reply, Ex. 1 at 27, 42.
Remedial Actions
Inability to Pay
Respondents maintain that they are unable to pay disgorgement or civil penalties. See
Opp. at 6-9. In accordance with Rule 630, in support of their inability to pay defense,
Respondents submitted the declaration of Parnell, along with supporting financial statements and
disclosures for both Respondents (Opp. Ex. A Parts 1 and 2) and the declaration of CPA Gary

Exhibits 1-2 of Exhibit A, which is the declaration of Division Counsel Brian T. James,
represent the fees paid to Ireeco LLC and Ireeco Limited from January 2010 through February
2014, totaling $3,625,750. Motion, Ex. A ¶ 4-5. Exhibit 3 contains the profit and loss figures
for Ireeco LLC, for the years 2010 through 2013, which shows a total income of $2,146,116.15.
Id. ¶ 5. The difference between the total fees received and the total income of Ireeco LLC
represents fees of $1,479,633.85 paid to Ireeco Limited. Id.

The Commission may consider a respondent’s ability to pay in determining civil penalties
under the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-2(d). Commission Rule of Practice 630, 17
C.F.R. § 201.630, permits a respondent to present evidence of an inability to pay disgorgement,
interest, or a penalty. I give the inability to pay less weight in determining disgorgement than
civil penalties because violations should be made unprofitable to the wrongdoer. See SEC v.
First Jersey Secs., Inc., 101 F.3d 1450, 1474 (2d Cir. 1996) (“The effective enforcement of the
federal securities laws requires that the SEC be able to make violations unprofitable. The
deterrent effect of an SEC enforcement action would be greatly undermined if securities law
violators were not required to disgorge illicit profits.” (citations omitted)). Giving ability to pay
significant weight in the disgorgement context would create a perverse incentive for securities
law violators to spend ill-gotten gains quickly and without restraint, or to transfer them
elsewhere. In the same vein, entities should not be able to escape an order of disgorgement by
dissolving their assets. See SEC v. Pentagon Capital Mgmt. PLC, No. 08-cv-3324, 2012 WL
1036087, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2012) (“[T]o the degree that Defendants’ [inability-to-pay]
argument relies on Defendants’ decision to wind down PCM [an entity defendant], PCM’s status
is self-inflicted, and Defendants have long been aware of this action, their late trading, and their
potential liability.”), aff’d in part, vacated, and remanded on other grounds, 725 F.3d 279 (2d
Cir. 2013). Ability to pay is only one factor that informs the determination of whether a
respondent should be required to pay disgorgement, interest, or civil penalties. Gregory O.
Trautman, Securities Act of 1933 Release No. 9088, 2009 SEC LEXIS 4173, at *93 (Dec. 15,
2009). Even when a respondent demonstrates an inability to pay, the Commission has discretion
not to waive the monetary sanction. Robert L. Burns, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release
No. 3260, 2011 SEC LEXIS 2722, at *39 (Aug. 5, 2011).
Based on the foregoing evidence, I find that Respondents lack the ability to pay the
monetary remedies requested by the Division. However, the analysis does not end here, because
Respondents are solely owned and controlled by two individuals, Parnell and Bartlett. The
reason why Respondents are insolvent is because throughout the unlawful referral scheme,
Parnell and Bartlett used the money to pay themselves, as “consultants” and “managers” of their
entities. As a practical matter, because only the insolvent respondent-entities were charged, and
not their officers, any disgorgement may be difficult to collect.4 However, it would make a
4

Indeed, Respondents persuasively make that precise point:

4

mockery of the remedy of disgorgement against an entity if the unjustly enriched entity were to
be excused simply because it transferred the unlawful profits, through pay or other means, to the
only two people who controlled the entity throughout the course of its misconduct. To excuse
disgorgement in this case based on inability to pay would encourage the redirecting of illegal
profits from an entity into the pockets of its officers. Thus, as a matter of discretion, I decline to
entirely excuse disgorgement based on an inability to pay; instead, I will consider inability to pay
only as to the amount of unjust enrichment exceeding what the principals paid themselves.
Disgorgement
Exchange Act Sections 21B(e) and 21C(e) authorize me to order disgorgement in this
proceeding, including reasonable interest. 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u-2(e), 78u-3(e); see OIP at 5-6.
Commissions received from unlawful sales may provide the required reasonable approximation of
a respondent’s ill-gotten gains. Ralph Calabro, Securities Act Release No. 9798, 2015 WL
3439152, at *44-45 (May 29, 2015). As the Commission explained,
Disgorgement is intended primarily to prevent unjust enrichment. Although the
amount of disgorgement should include all gains flowing from the illegal activities,
calculating that amount requires only a reasonable approximation of profits causally
connected to the violation. Once the Division shows that its disgorgement figure
reasonably approximates the ill-gotten gains, the burden shifts to the respondent to
demonstrate that the Division’s estimate is not a reasonable approximation. Thus,
exactitude is not a requirement; so long as the measure of disgorgement is
reasonable, any risk of uncertainty should fall on the wrongdoer whose illegal
conduct created that uncertainty.
Id. at *44 (footnotes, quotations, and alterations omitted). Although Calabro involved fraud,
which is not present here as Respondents point out, Opp. at 10-11 & n.3, commissions are also an
appropriate measure of disgorgement with respect to a violation not requiring scienter. See
Ronald S. Bloomfield, Securities Act Release No. 9553, 2014 WL 768828, at *20-21 (Feb. 27,
2014) (ordering disgorgement of commissions for sale of unregistered securities), partially
vacated on other grounds, Robert Gorgia, Securities Act Release No. 9743, 2015 WL 1546302
(Apr. 8, 2015); cf. SEC v. Rockwell Energy of Tex., LLC, No. H-09-4080, 2012 WL 360191, at *6
Despite this knowledge [that Respondents are insolvent], the Commission
knowingly entered into a negotiated, partial-settlement with the Respondent
entities, only, with the understanding that their principals would not be named in
this action, as Respondents or even Relief Defendants. Thus, the Division cannot
claim that it is surprised by the Financial Disclosures. Respondents’ financial
condition was fully disclosed to the Staff, as well as Respondents’ intent to seek
protection under Rule 630, prior to the execution of the Respondents’ Offers of
Settlement, and prior to the Commission’s acceptance of the Offers and issuance
of the OIP.
Sur-reply at 6. Despite the persuasiveness of this point, it does not follow that I should excuse
Respondents from disgorgement because they were always quick to move money to their two
principals.
5

(S.D. Tex. Feb. 1, 2012) (“Disgorgement is appropriate not only in cases of fraud . . . but also
where a defendant violates the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws.”).
Although Respondents strive energetically to distinguish cases on disgorgement, they are
distinctions without a difference, because as a rule, unlawful referral fees should be disgorged.
Respondents assert, based on a fragment of Parnell’s investigative testimony, that
Respondents provided a variety of other services to clients over the long-term that were wholly
unrelated to the investment scheme, and hence, should not be disgorged. Opp. at 11-12, Ex. C at
29-30. This assertion is unpersuasive given the lack of any corroborating evidence for it.
Furthermore, Respondents expressly disclaim any attempt to value such services, pronouncing
that “[i]t would be wholly improper for Respondents to now attempt to document prior events
that were not contemporaneously documented.” Sur-Reply at 10. Yet, for me to diminish a
reasonable approximation of disgorgement, I need more than unsupported assertions
accompanied only by refusals to quantify how much, if any, the amount should be decreased.
See SEC v. Bilzerian, 814 F. Supp. 116, 121 (D.D.C. 1993) (finding that because it is difficult to
separate legal from illegal profit, “it is proper to assume that all profits gained while defendants
were in violation of the law constituted ill-gotten gains”), aff’d, 29 F.3d 689 (D.C. Cir. 1994). I
do not find sufficient evidence, based on other purported services, to adjust downward the
Division’s approximations of the unlawful referral fees.
I find that the unlawful referral fees paid to Ireeco LLC of $2,146,116.15 and to Ireeco
Limited of $1,479,633.85 are thus reasonable approximations of those entities’ unjust
enrichment. However, in light of the fact that Ireeco LLC has no ability to pay, I will limit the
order of disgorgement concerning that entity to $1.7 million, which is the full amount it paid to
its principals for their consulting and management. For Ireeco Limited, though it is also
insolvent, given that it paid the two principals more than the full amount sought, I order that it
disgorge the full amount it was unjustly enriched of nearly $1.5 million.
The issue of prejudgment interest was already decided by the OIP, which provided that:
“If disgorgement is ordered, Respondents shall pay prejudgment interest thereon, calculated
from January 1, 2010, based on the rate of interest used by the Internal Revenue Service for the
underpayment of federal income tax as set forth in 26 U.S.C. § 6621(a)(2).” OIP at 5 (emphasis
added). As a result, I do not consider Respondents’ arguments that there should be no
prejudgment interest.
Civil Penalties
The Division seeks one first-tier penalty of $75,000 against each Respondent for their
misconduct after June 23, 2010.5 Motion at 10; Reply at 4. Civil penalties “are intended to punish,
and label defendants wrongdoers.” Gabelli v. SEC, 133 S. Ct. 1216, 1223 (2013). Penalties also
serve to deter both the violator and “others in similar positions from future violations.” John P.
Flannery, Securities Act Release No. 3981, 2014 WL 7145625, at *41 (Dec. 15, 2014), vacated
5

The Division’s request for a civil penalty relates to conduct that the OIP makes clear occurred
within the five-year period of limitation. Therefore, Respondents’ insistence that they also
committed misconduct before the five-year period is irrelevant for my penalty analysis. Opp. at
15 n.7, 17 n.9, 18; Sur-reply at 13-14 & n.12.
6

on other grounds, 810 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2015). Exchange Act Section 21B(a)(2) authorizes civil
penalties in any proceeding instituted under Exchange Act Section 21C if a respondent is
violating, has violated, or is or was a cause of the violation of any provision of the Exchange Act
or rule thereunder. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-2(a)(2). Exchange Act Section 21B(a)(1) provides for civil
penalties in any proceeding instituted pursuant to certain sections of the Exchange Act, including
Section 15(b)(4) and (6). 15 U.S.C. § 78u-2(a)(1). This subsection requires a public interest
determination as well as a finding of willfulness. Id. The public interest factors enumerated in
Exchange Act Section 21B(c) are as follows: (1) whether the violation involved fraud, deceit,
manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement; (2) whether the
violation resulted in harm to others; (3) the extent to which there was unjust enrichment; (4)
whether the respondent has committed previous violations; (5) the need to deter the respondent
and others; and (6) such other matters as justice may require. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-2(c).
Exchange Act Section 21B(b) establishes a three-tier system of penalties. 15 U.S.C. § 78u2(b). Under the first tier, the maximum penalty for an entity is $75,000 per violation occurring
after March 3, 2009, and until March 5, 2013; after March 5, 2013, an entity can be penalized up to
$80,000 per violation. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-2(b)(1); 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.1004-1005, Subpt. E, Tbls. IVV. The second and third tiers require “fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless
disregard of a regulatory requirement,” none of which applies here. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-2(b)(2), (3);
see Reply at 4.
It is not in the public interest to impose a penalty as none of the foregoing factors weigh
strongly enough in favor of a penalty.
First, there was no “fraud,” no “deceit,” no “manipulation,” nor any “deliberate or reckless
disregard of a regulatory requirement.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-2(c)(1). The Division contends that
Respondents knew that their conduct “placed them at risk of being found to have acted as a
broker,” Reply at 1, but does not dispute that until this case, the Commission had not charged any
similar entity or individual for such misconduct in connection with EB-5 projects. See Opp. at 1.
In fact, the June 23, 2015, press release about this case announced that “[t]he charges are the first
against brokers handling investments in the government’s EB-5 Immigrant Investor
Program . . .” Id. at 4 (citing Press Release, SEC, SEC Charges Unregistered Brokers in EB-5
Immigrant Investor Program (June 23, 2015), https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015127.html). The Division also contends that Respondents “amplified that risk by continuing to
engage in the conduct after becoming aware of the Division’s investigation.” Reply at 1.
However, this does not negate the preceding point that, in the absence of ever having heard of any
similarly situated business being charged, the mere fact of an investigation was not as significant as
it would have otherwise been. In addition, Respondents put forth a plausible argument that the
Commission’s investigation
included one period of extensive non-activity from approximately April of 2013
until late February of 2014, during which time Ireeco was left with the distinct
impression that the investigation had been concluded, that the Staff was satisfied,
that no further action would be taken, and that Ireeco could continue conducting
business in the normal course.

7

Opp. at 2-3.
Second, there is no evidence that Respondents’ violations caused harm or injury. Third,
while the Respondents were unjustly enriched to the extent the fees they earned were unlawful
because they were operating as unregistered broker-dealers, the foregoing order of disgorgement
sufficiently addresses that issue. Fourth, prior to the instant action, neither Respondent had been
found to have violated (or been enjoined from violating) securities laws or rules, or related laws.
Fifth, deterrence does not require civil penalties here. The bringing of this case, which debilitated
both Respondents, and the remedies otherwise imposed, will be more than sufficient to satisfy the
interests of deterrence. Finally, I credit Respondents’ willingness to enter into the consent order
and cease all operations voluntarily. Considering all of the factors together, I find that a penalty
against either Respondent would not serve the public interest.
ORDER
I ORDER that, pursuant to Sections 21B(e) and 21C(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934:
Ireeco, LLC, shall PAY DISGORGEMENT in the amount of $1,700,000, plus
prejudgment interest; and
Ireeco Limited shall PAY DISGORGEMENT in the amount of $1,479,633.85,
plus prejudgment interest.
Prejudgment interest shall be calculated from January 1, 2010, to the last day of the
month preceding the month in which payment of disgorgement is made, consistent with 17
C.F.R. § 201.600. Prejudgment interest shall be calculated at the underpayment rate of interest
established under Section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 6621(a)(2), and
shall be compounded quarterly. 17 C.F.R. § 201.600(b). Interest shall continue to accrue on all
funds owed until they are paid.
Payment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest shall be made no later than twentyone days following the day this initial decision becomes final, unless the Commission directs
otherwise. Payment shall be made in one of the following ways: (1) transmitted electronically
to the Commission, which will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;
(2) direct payments from a bank account via Pay.gov through the SEC website at
http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or (3) by certified check, bank cashier’s check,
United States postal money order, or bank money order made payable to the Securities and
Exchange Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to the following address alongside a cover
letter identifying Respondent and Administrative Proceeding No. 3-16647: Enterprises Services
Center, Accounts Receivable Branch, HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341, 6500 South MacArthur
Blvd., Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73169. A copy of the cover letter and instrument of payment
shall be sent to the Commission’s Division of Enforcement, directed to the attention of counsel
of record.

8

This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule 360 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to
that rule, a party may file a petition for review of this initial decision within twenty-one days
after service of the initial decision. A party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of
fact within ten days of the initial decision, pursuant to Rule 111 of the Commission’s Rules of
Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111. If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party,
then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the
undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact. The initial
decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality. The Commission
will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or motion to correct a
manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the initial
decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become final as
to that party.
