SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS
1.

From May 2015 through February 2016, Sawa,a former registered representative

While operating Five Star, Sawa misappropriated $38,719.98 from Five Star for

purely personal expenses, including, among other things, lodging during an international
vacation, home improvement expenditures, and cash withdrawals. During the period when
Sawa was acting as a corrupt investment adviser and stealing money from Five Star, Sawa also
collected $19,600 in fees for managing Five Star's investments.

DEFENDANT
10.

Savva, age 41, is a resident of Brooklyn, New York, and is the founder, sole

owner and manager of Five Star, which he operated from his residence.

11.

Sawa first became registered with FINRA as a registered representative in 1996.

He worked at various broker-dealers unti12014, when he was terminated by his broker-dealer
employer,following a 2012 FINRA decision to deny his employer's application to allow his
continued association with that employer and a 2014 denial by the Commission of Sawa's and
his then-employer's appeal ofthe 2012 FINRA decision.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
Sawa's Five Star Fund
12.

In 2014, after the Commission denied Sawa's appeal, he founded a hedge fund,

Five Star. Sawa operated Five Star out of his home in Brooklyn, New York.
13.

Sawa drafted promotional materials for Five Star, which he provided to potential

investors when soliciting investments.
14.

Between May 2015 and November 2015, Sawa sold to 12 investors a total of

$1.4 million worth of limited partnership interests in Five Star, whose assets were held at bank
and brokerage accounts that Sawa controlled.
15.

Between May 2015 and February 2016,Sawa used the majority of Five Star's

assets to trade securities via its brokerage accounts. His trading strategy, however, was
thoroughly unsuccessful, and resulted in net losses of over $1.3 million. In February 2016,
Savva ceased trading and closed Five Star's brokerage accounts, which, by that point, held just
$24,123.71 in total assets.
Sawa's False and Misleading Statements While Soliciting Five Star Investors
16.

Sawa made false and misleading statements to his investors when he sold

interests in Five Star.
17.

First, promotional materials, which Savva drafted and provided to investors

L~

during his solicitations, claimed that Five Star had a "team" ofinvestment professionals with a
total of over 30 years of securities trading experience. Sawa also included photos and resumes
of successful investment professionals in promotional materials, which he gave to investors, to
convey the impression that these professionals were associated with Five Star. In fact, these
materials were false and misleading because Sawa was the only person associated with Five
Star, and none ofthe investment professionals knew that their photos and resumes were being
used by Sawa.
18.

Second, these promotional materials touted Sawa's vast work experience in the

securities industry, claiming that he "has over twenty years market experience, with a bachelor's
degree from Stony Brook University. He has traveled the world and has taken courses with
some ofthe best technical and fundamental strategists in the country.... Surrounding himself
with these investment legends [referring to the photos/resumes ofthe various securities
professionals], he has been successful at developing investment strategies." However, the
materials misleadingly omitted to disclose that he had been statutorily disqualified from
associating with any FINRA firm.
19.

Third, Sawa lied to investors about Five Star's performance and provided at least

one investor with a false statement showing gains in his account. Additionally, when soliciting
one investor in July and August 2015, Savva falsely told the investor that Five Star was then
profitable when,in fact, Five Star had incurred unrealized losses of over $100,000 in July 2015
and unrealized losses of over $600,000 in August 2015.
Sawa Misappropriated Five Star Assets
20.

Sawa misappropriated atotal of$38,719.98 from Five Star for purely personal

expenses. Although Five Star's operating agreement permitted Savva to use fund assets to pay

for specific business expenses, Sawa used Five Star assets for personal expenses that were well
outside the type of legitimate business expenses permitted by the operating agreement.
21.

In particular, Sawa misappropriated Five Star funds to pay for his personal

expenses, including: medications, hotel expenses during a vacation to Greece,food shopping,
home improvement purchases, payments to a building contractor, and various cash withdrawals.
22.

During the period when Sawa was acting as a corrupt investment adviser and

stealing money from Five Star, Sawa also collected $19,600 in fees for managing Five Star's
investments.
