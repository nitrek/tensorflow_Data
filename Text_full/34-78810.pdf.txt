Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it necessary and
appropriate for the protection of investors to accept the Offer of Settlement submitted by Legal
Life Plans, Inc. (“Legal Life Plans” or “Respondent”) pursuant to Rule 240(a) of the Rules of
Practice of the Commission, 17 C.F.R. § 201.240(a), for the purpose of settlement of these
proceedings initiated against Respondent on August 9, 2016, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).
II.
Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on
behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or
denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject
matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order
Making Findings and Revoking Registration of Securities Pursuant to Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as to Legal Life Plans, Inc. (“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that 1 :
1.
Legal Life Plans (CIK No. 876367) is a Delaware corporation located in
Bristol, Tennessee. At all times relevant to this proceeding, the securities of Legal Life
Plans have been registered under Exchange Act Section 12(g). As of May 31, 2016, the
company’s stock (symbol “LLFP”) was traded on the over-the-counter markets.
2.
Legal Life Plans has failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and
Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder because it has not filed any periodic reports with the
Commission since the period ended August 31, 2013. Legal Life Plans has also failed to
comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-11 thereunder when it failed to
timely report the termination of the auditor-client relationship, as required by Item 304 of
Regulation S-K.

IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it necessary and appropriate for the
protection of investors to impose the sanction specified in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
Pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(j), registration of each class of Respondent’s
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 be, and hereby is, revoked.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary
