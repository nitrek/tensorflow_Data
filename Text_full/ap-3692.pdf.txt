ORDER FOLLOWING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding on March 30, 2015.
This proceeding was stayed, pursuant to a request by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of
New York, from June 10, 2015, to February 29, 2016. Aegis Capital, LLC, Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3653, 2016 SEC LEXIS 750 (ALJ Feb. 29, 2016).
A telephonic prehearing conference was held yesterday, attended by Shawn Murnahan
for the Division of Enforcement, Harlan Protass for Diane W. Lamm, and Robert Heim for
Strategic Consulting Advisors, LLC, and David I. Osunkwo. The parties agreed to confer and
submit a joint letter suggesting a prehearing schedule, hearing location, and a hearing date
commencing in July. See Aegis Capital, LLC, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 2704, 2015
SEC LEXIS 2014 (ALJ May 21, 2015).
Before the proceeding was stayed, I ordered Aegis Capital, LLC, and Circle One Wealth
Management, LLC, to show cause by May 28, 2015, why this proceeding should not be
determined against them due to their failures to file answers, appear at the prehearing conference,
or otherwise defend this proceeding. Aegis Capital, LLC, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No.
2684, 2015 SEC LEXIS 1937 (ALJ May 18, 2015). Aegis Capital and Circle One did not
respond to the show cause order, but this proceeding was stayed before the Division could file a
motion for default and sanctions as to these Respondents. I now direct the Division to file such
motion by March 24, 2016, attaching the evidence and authority referenced in my order of May
18, 2015. See id. at *2-3.
