Lynn Tilton, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 2647, 2015 SEC LEXIS 1773 (A.L.J. May 7,
2015).
The prehearing steps through August 31, 2015, had been accomplished or waived by
September 17, 2015, the date when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stayed the
1

Expert witnesses’ direct testimony will be via expert report. The experts will present a brief
summary of their testimony and be made available for cross examination.

proceeding. Tilton v. SEC, No. 15-2103, ECF No. 76. In June 2016, the court vacated its stay.
Tilton v. SEC, No. 15-2103, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 9970, at *37 (2d Cir. June 1, 2016).2
In light of the passage of time, the parties may amend their previously filed witness and
exhibit lists by August 12, 2016. The parties have suggested a hearing date in December 2016.
However, a December 2016 hearing date is inconsistent with a timely resolution of this
proceeding consistent with 17 C.F.R. § 201.360.3 Accordingly, the parties should, by no later
than July 22, 2016, propose an earlier hearing date in September 2016 as well as dates for the
remaining prehearing steps.
IT IS SO ORDERED.

The court ordered: “[O]ur stay on further proceedings by the SEC is VACATED.” Id. On
June 28, 2016, the court ruled on the Commission’s motion for clarification: “it is hereby
ORDERED that the stay is vacated, subject, however, to a continuation of the stay until July 6,
2016, to permit Tilton to file a motion seeking a stay from the Supreme Court and, if such a stay
motion is timely filed, until the Supreme Court or a Justice thereof has definitely ruled on such a
motion.” Tilton v. SEC, No. 15-2103, ECF No. 125. No such motion was filed. On July 12,
2016, the court denied Tilton permission to file, together with Barbara Duka, appellee in Duka v.
SEC, No. 15-2732 (2d Cir.), a joint petition for rehearing in response to the court’s June 1, 2016,
opinion. Tilton v. SEC, No. 15-2103, ECF No. 146.

Recently, counsel who previously represented Respondents withdrew, and new counsel
appeared for Respondents. However, such a change cannot be allowed to delay the proceeding.
