In the Matter of
SCHEDULING ORDER
CURTIS A. PETERSON
On August 23, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondent. Per my instructions, the parties filed a joint prehearing
conference statement on September 29, 2016. The joint statement notes that Respondent waives
his right to a hearing between thirty and sixty days after service of the OIP, and confirms that
such service occurred on August 26, 2016. Further, the joint statement reflects the parties’
agreement that this matter may be resolved by summary disposition, and proposes a briefing
schedule, which I ADOPT as follows:
October 21, 2016:

Division of Enforcement’s motion for summary disposition is due.

November 21, 2016: Respondent’s opposition is due, including materials concerning
inability to pay.
An inability to pay defense should be
accompanied by a Disclosure of Assets and Financial Information
Form, which the Division shall provide to Respondent on his
request. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.630(a)-(b).
December 7, 2016:

Division’s reply is due.

In addition to the required filing with the Office of the Secretary, electronic courtesy
copies of filings should be emailed to alj@sec.gov in both PDF text-searchable format and, when
possible, Microsoft Word format. Electronic copies of exhibits should not be combined into a
single PDF file, but submitted as separate attachments.
