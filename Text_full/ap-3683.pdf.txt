LAWRENCE R. LUX

ORDER FINDING
RESPONDENT EDWARD M.
DASPIN IN DEFAULT

After Respondent Edward M. Daspin failed to appear at a hearing that was scheduled to
begin on January 4, 2016, I ordered that a separate hearing be held on February 11, 2016, to
address the reason for Daspin’s absence. See Edward M. Daspin, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release
No. 3481, 2016 SEC LEXIS 72 (ALJ Jan. 8, 2016). Daspin did not appear at the hearing on
February 11, and took steps to prevent another witness—his wife—from appearing. See Edward
M. Daspin, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3606, 2016 SEC LEXIS 562, at *1 (ALJ Feb. 16,
2016). During the hearing, the Division of Enforcement presented unrebutted evidence that
Daspin voluntarily absented himself from the hearing on January 4.
As a result of these events, I ordered Daspin to show cause why he should not be found in
default. See Edward M. Daspin, 2016 SEC LEXIS 562, at *3. Daspin responded but did not
sufficiently address the Division’s evidence that he invented the reason for his absence on
January 4, and, in any event, was voluntarily absent from both the January 4 and February 11
hearings. Given the Division’s unrebutted evidence and Daspin’s own admissions, Daspin is in
DEFAULT for failing to appear at the hearings on January 4 and February 11, 2016. 1 See OIP at
15; 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a)(1).

Daspin may move to set aside the default in this case. Rule of Practice 155(b) provides

that:
A motion to set aside a default shall be made within a reasonable
time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. In
order to prevent injustice and on such conditions as may be
appropriate, the hearing officer, at any time prior to the filing of

Background
After the Commission initiated this proceeding, Daspin submitted evidence that he
suffers from a serious medical condition. Edward M. Daspin, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No.
2810, 2015 SEC LEXIS 2387, at *1 (ALJ June 15, 2015). Specifically, Daspin’s treating
physician, Dr. Alan Puzino, M.D., an internist, stated that Daspin “
” while being deposed by the Division of Enforcement and that Daspin’s
participation in this proceeding would “without question, pose an imminent and unconditional
threat to his life.” Declaration (May 11, 2015) at 1-4, 10. Based on this evidence, the
administrative law judge previously assigned to this proceeding indefinitely postponed the
hearing as to Daspin in June 2015. Edward M. Daspin, 2015 SEC LEXIS 2387, at *2. In late
July 2015, Dr. Puzino “opined that it would take months of consultations to determine an
appropriate treatment plan for Daspin and a year before he could say whether Daspin could
handle the stress associated with participating in a hearing.” Edward M. Daspin, Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3263, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4435, at *2 (ALJ Oct. 28, 2015).
This matter was reassigned to me at the end of July, and in August I lifted the
postponement, having determined that I lacked the authority to indefinitely continue this matter.
See Edward M. Daspin, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3041, 2015 SEC LEXIS 3348, at
*3-8 (ALJ Aug. 14, 2015). In late September, Daspin’s counsel withdrew. Edward M. Daspin,
Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3183, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4001, at *3 (ALJ Sept. 30, 2015).
Between September 29 and October 6, 2015, Daspin, or others on his behalf, sent my
office dozens of e-mails variously asserting that because he is ill and not sufficiently computer
literate, he cannot participate in this proceeding. See generally Edward M. Daspin, Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3202, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4103 (ALJ Oct. 6, 2015); see also Div. Ex. 6 at
1-4, 9-11, 15, 18, 20, 22. 2 Daspin submitted additional medical evidence, including evidence
from Dr. Puzino. He also submitted a continuing series of requests to postpone the hearing or
dismiss the proceeding. See Edward M. Daspin, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4435, at *2, 8-10, 12-13;
Div. Ex. 6 at 1-3, 9, 20-22.
Among other things, the Division responded to Daspin’s requests by submitting a letter
from Dr. Stanley J. Schneller, M.D., who has been a professor of cardiology at Columbia
University since 1985. Schneller Letter at 1. Dr. Schneller reviewed Daspin’s medical history
and noted that Daspin repeatedly avoided or delayed a recommended

Dr. Schneller explained that Daspin's condition is treatable, his risk of ha1m is low, and
he can live a "nonnal life." Schneller Letter at 11. Dr. Schneller also explained that Dr. Puzino
had supplied "misleading statements [and] unfounded opinions and describe[d] a peculiar
approach to [Daspin's] complaints that is outside standard medical care." Id. at 10; see id. at
11-12; see also Edward M Daspin, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4435, at *5. Dr. Schneller added that
nothing suppoited Dr. Puzino's statement that Daspin while being
deposed by the Division. Schneller Letter at 2, 10. He also offered that there was no medical
validity to Dr. Puzino 's opinion that Daspin's condition would "preclude [his] paiiicipation in
[these] proceedings." Id. at 11, 12 (describing the opinion as "medically insuppo1iable"); see id.

then said that Dr. Schneller 's opinion was baseless, because am ong all doctors, Dr. Puzino---who
is not a cai·diologist-had "srecial insight," making him the sole physician qualified to diagnose
and treat Daspin. Id. at 5-6. In later denying Daspin's motions to dismiss or continue, I found
Dr. Schneller 's opinion convincing and Dr. Puzino's opinion not credible. Edward M Daspin,
2015 SEC LEXIS 4435 , at *10 & n.2.
Throughout November, Daspin continued to send e-mails making substantive ai·guments
about the case and asse1iing that his medical condition would or should prevent his pa1iicipation
in the hearing then scheduled for Januaiy 4, 2016. Div. Ex. 6 at 24-25, 27, 36, 38-39, 45, 55, 59,

See Edward M Daspin, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3328, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4758, at *1
(ALJ Nov. 18, 2015).
In December, Daspin filed untimely motions to stay and for sllllllllary disposition. I
denied these motions because they were baseless. Edward M Daspin, Admin. Proc. Rulings
Release No. 3409, 2015 SEC LEXIS 5125 (ALJ Dec. 17, 2015). Throughout this time, Daspin
continued to send e-mails claiming to be ill while simultaneously arguing the merits of the
allegations and decrying the Division's effo1is in pursuing its case against him. Div. Ex. 6 at
95-97, 99-106, 111 , 118.

During a prehearing conference in December, the paiiies and I discussed the Division's
effo1is to pe1mit Daspin to appear at the Januaiy 4 heai·ing by video teleconference. See
Preheai·ing Tr. at 46-54. Because the paiiies' effo1i s were unsuccessful, I directed that the

The rebuttal also contained legal ai·guments, which included references to settlement and
a Second Circuit decision, as well as asse1i ions that "this matter should not even be in this
comi," "the Sec [sic] has bigger fi.y to go after," and Daspin "will be able to be sued in federal
comi." Rebuttal at 2, 5. The presentation of the medical claims in the rebuttal, along with its
legal assertions and stylistic eccenti·icities, sti·ongly suggest that the rebuttal was authored, at
least in paii, by Daspin himself.

Release No. 3429, 2015 SEC LEXIS 5227 (ALJ Dec. 22, 2015).
Daspin did not appear at the hearing on Monday, Januaiy 4, 2016. Tr. 3. Counsel for the
Division stated during the hearing that he had been info1med that Daspin had been hospitalized
the previous Saturday. Tr. 4. I then granted the Division's request to delay the hearing to
provide it time to investigate the reason for Daspin's absence. Tr. 5-7.
Within days, the Division submitted evidence that Daspin had been admitted to a hospital
as a result of a pmpo1i ed

I held a telephonic conference on January 8, 2016. Edward M Daspin, 2016 SEC LEXIS
72, at *1. During the conference, I scheduled a hearing for Febrnai·y 11, 2016, solely to address
the reason for Daspin's absence from the heai·ing on Januaiy 4. Id. at *2. Following the
conference, I issued an order setting the heaillig date and ordering Daspin to "make himself
available" by Febrnaiy 3, 2016, "for an in-person medical evaluation by an expe1i provided by
the Division." Id.
Daspin was released from the hospital by Janua1y 13, 2016. See Div. Ex. 6 at 127.
Between then and Febrnaiy 16, 2016, he sent my office fo1iy e-mails, many of which were
abusive and unprofessional. Edward M Daspin, 2016 SEC LEXIS 562, at *1 n.1. 4 In those
e-mails, Daspin resisted attending the hearing on Febrnaiy 11. See Div. Ex. 6 at 129, 131-32,
136.
I held a telephonic conference on Januaiy 29, 2016, during which Daspin said that he was
"not committed to pa1iicipate in this proceeding because" the Second Circuit had stayed the
proceeding as to Respondent Luigi Agostini, and he was likewise entitled to a stay.5 Tr. 95,

Daspin has repeatedly and consistently violated my orders instructing him to stop sending
my office argumentative e-mails. Edward M Daspin, 2016 SEC LEXIS 562, at *1 n.1 (citing
orders).

Daspin filed an action in the District of New Jersey, seeking to enjoin this proceeding.

See Daspin v. SEC, No. 15-cv-8299 (D.N.J. Dec. 30, 2015), ECF No. 15. The comi dismissed
that action for lack of jurisdiction. Id. Meanwhile, Agostini filed an action in the Southern
Disti·ict of New York, which was also dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Agostini v. SEC, No.

15-cv-9595 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 18, 2015), ECF No. 18. After Agostini appealed, the Second Circuit
ordered that "the Securities and Exchange Commission proceedings against [Agostini] are
STAYED pending fmi her order of [the] Court." Agostini v. SEC, No. 15-4114 (Jan. 12, 2016),

101-02. I then attempted to quote the Second Circuit's order for the record, but Daspin
intenupted to say that he disagreed with my "interpretation." Tr. 100. I explained that I was not
inte1preting the order but was instead quoting its literal language. Tr. 100. Daspin apologized
and said that because the Second Circuit had stayed the case as to Agostini, he was likewise
entitled to a stay. Tr. 100-01. I then explained my concerns with delaying the investigation into
Daspin's absence, including "prejudice [to Daspin's] ability to show why [he was] not present."
Tr. 101. Daspin again intenupted me, saying that we were straying beyond what Division
counsel had told him would be discussed, claimed to be experiencing chest pain, and hung up the
phone. Tr. 102.

Meanwhile, the Divis~edule Daspin's interview with its expe1i at
but Daspin did not respond to the Division 's
either the Division 's office
e-mails. See Letter from Bany O 'Connell, Ex. A (Feb. 3, 2016). Consistent with my Januaiy 8,
2016 order, the Division then scheduled Daspin to be inte1viewed by its expe1i on Febmary 3,
2016. See id. Although he had filed no objections to the order directing the inte1view, Daspin
did not appeai· for the inte1v iew. Instead, he sent an e-mail on the morning of Febmaiy 3 saying
that he was ill. Id., Ex. B.
On Febma1y 9, 2016, Daspin submitted a motion on behalf of his wife to quash a
subpoena I issued requiring her to appeai· and testify at the Febmai·y 11 heai·ing. On Febma1y
10, I denied the motion. Edward M Daspin, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3594, 2016 SEC
LEXIS 496. That night, Daspin sent an e-mail infonning my office and the Division that he had
taken affmnative steps to prevent his wife from testifying. Div. Ex. 12 at 1; see Edward M
Daspin, 2016 SEC LEXIS 562, at *1. Neither Daspin nor his wife appeai·ed at the hearing on
Febmai·y 11, 2016. Tr. 16-17.
During the heai·ing on Febmaiy 11, the Division called Dr. Hai·old J. Bursztajn, M.D., to
testify. The Division also offered, and I admitted, Dr. Bursztajn's expe1i repo1i into evidence
along with a number of other exhibits. Tr. 14, 28-29; see Div. Ex. 1. Dr. Bursztajn has practiced
clinical and forensic neuropsychiatry since 1982. Tr. 18. He explained that ~non"

Dr. Bursztajn was also strnck by the notes of Daspin's treating clinicians. See Tr. 54-57,
60-62. He explained that a treating clinician must take a patient's "suffering impulse at face
value" and tiy "[t]o create a therapeutic alliance." Tr. 54. Dr. Bursztajn was thus surprised to
see that two of Daspin's ti·eating clinicians raised the possibility that Daspin "was manipulating
them . . . for the pmpose of creating a record to derail legal proceedings." 6 Tr. 55; see Ex. 2 at
55, 479, 648.
Based on his review of the available evidence, Dr. Bursztajn opined that Daspin's
" was "consistent with a life-long pattern of manipulation and conning people in
order to be able to avoid the foreseeable consequences of his actions." Tr. 65. He concluded
that there is no medical reason Daspin cannot paiiicipate in this proceeding. Tr. 65.
The Division called no other witnesses at the hearing on Febrnaiy 11 . Because he failed
to appear, Daspin presented no evidence.
Because he failed to appear at the heai·ings on Janua1y 4 and Febrnaiy 11, I ordered
Daspin to show cause why this proceeding should not be detennined against him. Edward M
Daspin, 2016 SEC LEXIS 562, at *3. Daspin filed an answer to the order to show cause on
Febrnary 26, 2016. In his answer, he alternates between attempting to refute the Division 's case

Dr. Bursztajn also remarked that his review of the available medical evidence led him to

Discussion
Under the Commission's Rules of Practice, if a paiiy is notified about a heai·ing but fails
to appeai-, the paiiy may be found in default and an administrative law judge may detennine the
proceedings against the paiiy based on the record and the allegations in the OIP. 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.155(a)(l). In light of Rule 155, the predicate question here is whether Daspin was
voluntai·ily absent from either heai·ing. In a criminal case, a defendant who intentionally fails to
appeai· acts voluntai·ily and waives his right to be present. 7 See United States v. Yannai, 791 F.3d
226, 239 (2d Cir. 2015), pet.for cert filed, No. 15-8278 (U.S. Feb. 19, 2016); United States v. St.
James, 41 5 F.3d 800, 804-05 (8th Cir. 2005). "[O]rdinarily,'' a district comi, when addressing an
absence "at a critical stage" of a criminal proceeding, "must conduct an inqui1y on the record to
detennine whether the defendant has a sound excuse for his absence." Yannai, 791 F.3d at 240;
see United States v. Achbani, 507 F.3d 598, 601 -02 (7th Cir. 2007); St. James, 415 F.3d at
803-04.
In this case, the Division presented Dr. Bursztajn's testimony and repo1i. Dr. Bursztajn
was convincing and credible and Daspin presented no evidence to rebut Dr. Bursztajn' s
testimony. I find that the Division has shown that Daspin ~ absent from the
hearing on Januai·y 4, 2016. Specifically, I find that he staged a in order to avoid
the heai·ing and manipulate this proceeding. 8

As Dr. Bursztajn explained with reference to the
every indicator suggests that Daspin's purpo1ied
was not genume. See Tr. 32-40;
Div. Ex. IA. Critically, even Daspin's treating clinicians expressed doubts about Daspin's

7

This is not a criminal matter. If, however, a given procedure is sufficient to protect the
rights of a criminal accused, the procedure is necessarily sufficient to protect the rights of a
respondent in administrative proceedings. See United States v. Lopez, 445 F.3d 90, 99 (2d Cir.
2006) (noting that administrative procedures "do[] not cany all of the protections of a criminal
proceeding").
8

Daspin was the subject of a lawful subpoena to testify. It was therefore his burden to
show that his absence from the heai·ing on Januai·y 4, 2016, was involuntaiy See Meacham v.
Knolls Atomic Power Lab., 554 U.S . 84, 91 (2008) (noting the principle that a paiiy seeking to
benefit from an exception beai·s the burden to show entitlement to it). Because he failed to
appear and present evidence on Febrnary 11, 2016, he necessai·ily failed to cany his burden.
Even if the burden were on the Division, however, the result would be the saine. It presented
convincing evidence which went unrebutted.
7

motivation. As Dr. Bursztajn explained, the fact that the clinicians expressed these doubts in
writing is telling.
That Daspin's pmported
was not genuine is farther supported by the fact
that Daspin previously presented tenuous medical evidence that his .
condition prevented
him from ~aiiicipate . Dr. Schneller refoted this evidence. Together with Daspin's
condition reflects a
pmpo1ied -, the evidence of Daspin's allegedly serious .
pattern of attempts to manipulate this proceeding in order to avoid a hearing.
Additionally, Daspin failed to appeai· at the heai·ing on Febmaiy 11, despite being
info1med that the heai·ing would be his oppo1iunity to explain why he was absent on Januaiy 4.
See Edward M Daspin, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3564, 2016 SEC LEXIS 332, *3
(ALJ Feb. 1, 2016). Daspin also failed to make himself available for an examination by Dr.
Bursztajn and took affinnative steps to prevent his wife from appeai·ing at the Febmaiy 11
hearing even though she was subpoenaed. These latter actions reflect Daspin 's consciousness of
liability.9
fu answering the order to show cause, Daspin claims that his was
genuine. But Dr. Bursztajn's testimony refotes that assertion. Moreover~ had

But Daspin prevented her from
testifying on Febmaiy 11. At this point, her competence is not relevant. And Daspin's reference
to his medical evidence misses the point. He had an opportunity to present his side of the sto1y
on Febmai·y 11 but voluntai·ily chose not to attend the heai·ing.
The record establishes that Daspin has twice tried to use alleged medical issues to avoid a
hearing. While this soli of medical evidence was credited once, nothing requires me to credit it
now, especially after the evidence has twice been refoted. The Due Process Clause entitles
Daspin to an unbiased adjudicator, not a gullible one. Cf In re J. P. Linahan, Inc., 138 F.2d 650,
654 (2d Cir. 1943) ("Impaiiiality is not gullibility. Disinterestedness does not mean child-like
innocence. If the judge did not fo1m judgments of the actors in those comi-house drainas called
trials, he could never render decisions.").

Daspin cast his action as protecting his wife from d~Ex. 12 at 1 ("I am a
ve1y sick man but am willing to die trying to protect her "). Dr. Bursztajn's
description of Daspin's grandiosity, however, strongly suggests that Daspin was not motivated
by any danger faced by his wife, but rather the danger to him if she were to testify. See Tr.
42-43, 45-46.

And as to the February 11 hearing, Daspin asserts that he could not attend because he had
and the Second Circuit stayed the Commission from proceeding against
Agostini. Answer at 8-9, 14. Given that Daspin was notified of the hearing well in advance and
was required to attend, the former assertion is not a reason for missing the hearing. And the
latter reason is meritless because, as I have explained to Daspin, the Second Circuit’s order did
not apply to him. See Edward M. Daspin, 2016 SEC LEXIS 332, at *2. Indeed, that court has
rejected Daspin’s own stay request. See SEC v. Daspin, No. 13-4622 (2d Cir. Feb. 23, 2016),
ECF No. 83. Daspin has thus failed to show cause why he did not attend two hearings.
In light of these findings, I determine that, despite being informed of the hearing on
January 4, 2016, Daspin voluntarily failed to appear for that hearing. I reach the same
conclusion regarding the hearing on February 11, 2016. Daspin is therefore in default. 10 Under
Rule 155(a)(1), I deem as true the allegations in the OIP, insofar as those allegations relate to
Daspin. 11 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a)(1).
The Division had asked that I stay this matter as to Daspin pending a decision from the
Second Circuit in Agostini’s appeal. Since then, however, the Second Circuit has rejected
Daspin’s attempts to ride Agostini’s coattails. See SEC v. Daspin, No. 13-4622, ECF No. 83.
Because this matter as it relates to Daspin could efficiently be resolved through a motion for
sanctions, the Division should advise my office by letter filed within five business days whether
it continues to believe that this proceeding should be stayed as to Daspin. If the Division is still
of that belief, it should advise how it foresees the presentation of witnesses and evidence
occurring at a hearing in light of Daspin’s default.

Because Daspin has failed to carry his burden to show cause, the Division’s opposition to
Daspin’s response to the show cause order is moot.
11

The findings of this order do not apply as to Agostini, nor are any allegations in the OIP
deemed true as to him.
