THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
OF 1934

Telestone Technologies Corp.,
US Fuel Corp., and
Victory Eagle Resources Corp.,
Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it necessary
and appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative proceedings be,
and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (“Exchange Act”) against Respondents Telestone Technologies Corp., US Fuel
Corp., and Victory Eagle Resources Corp.
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
A. RESPONDENTS
1. Telestone Technologies Corp. (CIK No. 817129) is a void Delaware
corporation located in Beijing, China with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). Telestone Technologies Corp. is
delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic
reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2012, which
reported a loss of over $13.8 million for the prior nine months. As of September 22,
2016, the company’s stock (symbol “TSTC”) was traded on the over-the-counter
markets.
2. US Fuel Corp. (CIK No. 1116112) is a dissolved Nevada corporation located
in Atco, New Jersey with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to

Exchange Act Section 12(g). US Fuel Corp. is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the
period ended June 30, 2014, which reported a net loss of $231,368 for the prior six
months.
3. Victory Eagle Resources Corp. (CIK No. 1304898) is a revoked Nevada
corporation located in Mexico City, Mexico with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). Victory Eagle Resources Corp. is
delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic
reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period ended April 30, 2013, which reported a
net loss of $259,754 from its March 18, 2004 inception to April 30, 2013.
B. DELINQUENT PERIODIC FILINGS
4. As discussed in more detail above, all of the Respondents are delinquent in
their periodic filings with the Commission, have repeatedly failed to meet their
obligations to file timely periodic reports, and failed to heed delinquency letters sent to
them by the Division of Corporation Finance requesting compliance with their periodic
filing obligations or, through their failure to maintain a valid address on file with the
Commission as required by Commission rules, did not receive such letters.
5. Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require
issuers of securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the
Commission current and accurate information in periodic reports, even if the registration
is voluntary under Section 12(g). Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file annual
reports, and Rule 13a-13 requires domestic issuers to file quarterly reports.
6. As a result of the foregoing, Respondents failed to comply with Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and/or 13a-13 thereunder.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission
deems it necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors that public
administrative proceedings be instituted to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations contained in Section II hereof are true and, in
connection therewith, to afford the Respondents an opportunity to establish any defenses
to such allegations; and,
B.
Whether it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to
suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of each
class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act of the
Respondents identified in Section II hereof, and any successor under Exchange Act Rules
12b-2 or 12g-3, and any new corporate names of any Respondents.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking
evidence on the questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and
place to be fixed, and before an Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further

201.110].
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that Respondents shall file an Answer to
the allegations contained in this Order within ten (10) days after service of this Order, as
provided by Rule 220(b) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b)].
If Respondents fail to file the directed Answers, or fail to appear at a hearing after
being duly notified, the Respondents, and any successor under Exchange Act Rules 12b-2
or 12g-3, and any new corporate names of any Respondents, may be deemed in default
and the proceedings may be determined against them upon consideration of this Order,
the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f),
221(f), and 310 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a),

Commission Rules of Practice.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(2), the Administrative Law
Judge shall issue an initial decision no later than [30] days from the occurrence of one of
the following events: (A) The completion of post-hearing briefing in a proceeding where
the hearing has been completed; (B) Where the hearing officer has determined that no
hearing is necessary, upon completion of briefing on a motion pursuant to Rule 250 of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.250; or (C) The determination by the
hearing officer that a party is deemed to be in default under Rule 155 of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.155 and no hearing is necessary.
In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the
Commission engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this
or any factually related proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the
decision of this matter, except as witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to
notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within the meaning of Section 551 of
the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the provisions of Section
553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action.
By the Commission.
