In the Matter of
GREG RUEHLE

ORDER POSTPONING HEARING,
SCHEDULING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE, AND DIRECTING FOR
DECLARATION REGARDING SERVICE

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
in this matter on May 10, 2016. Respondent shall file an answer to the OIP’s allegations within
twenty days after service of the OIP. See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). To date, however, it
appears that service of the OIP has not been accomplished in accordance with Rule of Practice
141(a)(2)(i), 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(i). Based on tracking information provided by the Office
of the Secretary, the OIP was sent by U.S. Postal Service certified mail to an address in Lake
Elsinore, California, but was not delivered.
I therefore ORDER the Division of Enforcement to file a declaration regarding the status
of service by June 6, 2016, and, if service has been accomplished by then, to provide supporting
evidence.
I further ORDER that the hearing currently scheduled for June 6, 2016, is POSTPONED
sine die, and a telephonic prehearing conference is scheduled for June 8, 2016, at 2:00 p.m.
Eastern. At the conference, the parties should be prepared to discuss the items enumerated under
Rule of Practice 221(c), 17 C.F.R. § 201.221(c), including whether this proceeding may be
resolved by summary disposition.1
The parties are asked to e-mail PDF text-searchable courtesy copies of any filings in this
proceeding to alj@sec.gov. Email, however, is not a substitute for the required paper filing with
the Office of the Secretary.
