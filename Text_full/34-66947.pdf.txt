On September 23, 2010, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(“Commission”) issued a Notice of Proposed Plan of Distribution and Opportunity for Comment
(Exchange Act Rel. No. 62979) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Funds
and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103. The Notice was modified on February 1, 2011
(Exchange Act Rel. No. 63813) (“Modified Notice”). The Modified Notice advised parties they
could obtain a copy of the modified proposed Distribution Plan at www.sec.gov. The Modified
Notice also advised that all persons desiring to comment on the Modified Distribution Plan could
submit their comments, in writing, no later than 30 days from the date of the Notice. No

2011, the Commission issued an Order Approving Distribution Plan of a Fair Fund and
Appointing a Fund Administrator (Exchange Act Rel. No. 64081).
The Modified Distribution Plan states that monies from the Fair Fund will be distributed

from the Fair Fund.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the distribution described above is approved and ratified
as of the day of distribution, December 12, 2011.
