ADVISORS, INC. AND COLUMBIA
FUNDS DISTRIBUTOR, INC.,
Respondents.

PROPOSED PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
I.

Background

1.1. On February 9, 2005 the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC” or “Commission”) entered an order in this proceeding (the “Order”)
reciting, among other things, that “[f]rom at least 1998 through October 2003,
Columbia [Management] Advisors[, Inc.] and some of its predecessor entities
(“Columbia Advisors”), the investment adviser to over 140 of the mutual funds in
the Columbia mutual fund complex (the “Columbia Funds”), and Columbia
[Funds] Distributor [,Inc.], the principal underwriter and distributor of those funds,
violated antifraud provisions of the securities laws by allowing certain preferred
customers to engage in short-term or excessive trading, contrary to the
restrictions and/or representations set forth in the Columbia Funds’
prospectuses, that was detrimental to Columbia Funds but benefited respondents
without disclosing these trading arrangements to fund shareholders or to fund
trustees.” (Order ¶1). The Order required Respondents to pay $70,000,000 in
disgorgement and $70,000,000 in civil money penalties, and established a Fair
Fund consisting of the sum of those payments, for a total fund of $140,000,000.
(Order ¶IV(E)). The Order required an Independent Distribution Consultant
(“IDC”) to develop a plan (the “Distribution Plan,” or “Plan”) for the distribution of
the Fair Fund, “according to a methodology developed by the IDC in consultation
with Respondents and the independent trustees of the Columbia Funds mutual
funds and acceptable to the staff of the Commission.” (Order ¶67). Shortly after
the entry of the Order, Professor Lawrence A. Hamermesh, Ruby R. Vale
Professor of Corporate and Business Law at Widener University School of Law in
1

Wilmington, Delaware, was appointed as the IDC in this proceeding. 1 On
February 25, 2005, Respondents deposited the amount of the Fair Fund
($140,000,000) at the Bureau of Public Debt for investment in government
obligations. Other than interest from these investments and funds to be received
pursuant to the plan of distribution in the Bank of America/Nations Funds
Proceeding, it is not anticipated that the Fair Fund will receive additional funds. If
any other funds are received before distributions under this Plan have begun,
such funds will be distributed by means of proportionally increasing distributions
otherwise provided for in this Plan (¶¶7.3 - 7.7), or by such other means
approved by the IDC in consultation with the Respondents, the trustees of the
Columbia Funds, and the Commission or its staff. After distributions under this
Plan have begun, the Fund does not intend to accept additional funds for
distribution.
1.2. This Distribution Plan is the result of extensive consultation. Among
other efforts, Professor Hamermesh:
•
•

•

Met with Navigant Consulting, Inc. to review the analyses it prepared for
the Independent Trustees of the Columbia Funds to assist with their
evaluation of the effects of market timing activity in the Columbia Funds.
Met and spoke with Respondents’ economic adviser Lexecon, which has,
at Professor Hamermesh’s request and under his guidance, managed the
trading data and developed and executed the numerical and financial
analyses of that data.
Retained Professor Erik R. Sirri, professor of finance at Babson College
and former Chief Economist of the Commission, and consulted him on
issues of financial and economic analysis associated with the
development of the Distribution Plan with respect to distributions to
Columbia Funds shareholders.

1.3. Before describing how this Distribution Plan allocates and distributes
the Fair Fund, it is helpful to separate into two broad categories the trading
addressed by the Order. The first category, identified here as “Arrangement
Trading,” involves market timing activity by nine entities with whom Respondent
Columbia Funds Distributor, Inc. (“Columbia Distributor”) was found to have
entered into an arrangement or understanding allowing rapid trading in one or
more of the Columbia Funds. (Order ¶¶13-40). The second category involves
market timing activity by persons with whom the Respondents had no
1

Professor Hamermesh also serves as IDC for the fair fund established under the February 9,
2005 order in In the Matter of Banc of America Capital Management, LLC, BACAP Distributors,
LLC, and Banc of America Securities, LLC (the “Bank of America/Nations Funds Proceeding”).
That proceeding involves a separate fair fund from the fund established with respect to the
Columbia Funds. As prescribed in the Order in this proceeding involving the Columbia Funds
(¶67), Respondents have agreed to pay all compensation of and expenses incurred by Professor
Hamermesh as IDC for the Columbia Funds Fair Fund.

2

arrangement or understanding with respect to short term trading. Because of the
absence of any such arrangement or understanding, trading by these persons is
described here as “Non-Arrangement Timing.” The persons who engaged in
Non-Arrangement Timing in turn fall into two distinct categories: those (identified
as “retail traders”) who traded through accounts held in their own names (“retail
accounts”); and others (“omnibus traders”) who traded through accounts that
aggregated trading and ownership by multiple beneficial owners (“omnibus
accounts”). (Order ¶41).

II. Distribution Methodology – In General
2.1. The methodology for the distribution of the money in the Fair Fund is
designed to provide compensation for dilution and related harm to
contemporaneous long term fund shareholders arising from the two principal
categories of trading identified in the Order. The term “contemporaneous,” as
used in this Distribution Plan, refers to those persons who were fund
shareholders at the time of the trading identified in the Order, regardless of
whether such persons continued to hold fund shares thereafter.
2.2. The methodology employed in this Plan attempts to estimate, on a
daily basis over the course of that trading, the extent to which a fund’s net asset
value (NAV) would have been greater or less than the actual NAV had that
trading not occurred. That difference (where positive) is the estimate of the
dilution and related harm to the contemporaneous holders of the fund on each of
the days on which such trading occurred. The sum of those daily increments
(both positive and negative) represents the aggregate harm to each fund’s
shareholders during the period in which timing trading occurred. 2
2.3. The methods of calculation of each eligible contemporaneous
shareholder’s share of the Fair Fund are intended to result in a payment from the
Fair Fund to each such shareholder that restores the impaired value of such
shareholder’s investment in a particular fund. The methods of calculation are
intended by the Commission to fairly estimate the impaired value that each
investor has suffered and to make a payment in that amount. In the view of the
IDC, these methods of calculation are fair and reasonable in the context of this
case, and result in a fair and reasonable allocation of the Fair Fund.
III. Estimation of Dilution and Related Harm to Contemporaneous Shareholders
2

There may be instances of accounts for which the effect of timer trading was beneficial (and for
which harm-based compensation would be inappropriate). Because of this possibility, it may also
be the case that the other account holders’ share of estimated harm would in the aggregate
exceed the aggregate amount estimated for the fund as a whole. At this point, however, it
appears that such instances are both unusual and small in scope, and are not likely to have a
substantial effect on the ultimate distribution.

3

A. Estimating Dilution
3.1. The starting point in estimating the dilution arising from timer trading
is a determination of the net gains realized through that trading. Each timer’s
purchases and sales are formed into buy-sell pairs using a LIFO methodology. 3
3.2. For any given mutual fund, if the funds a timer uses to purchase fund
shares (“timer funds”) were never invested in risky portfolio assets by the
portfolio manager, timer net gains would accurately measure dilution to
contemporaneous shareholders. To the extent, however, that timer funds were
invested in risky assets, dilution may diverge from timer net gains. Accordingly, it
is necessary to estimate the extent to which portfolio managers invested in (and
sold) portfolio assets in response to timer investment (and sales). 4
3.3. For each buy-sell pair, the mutual fund’s incremental investment in
risky assets is estimated by assuming that a constant fraction of the timer funds
is invested in risky assets each day until either the timer funds are invested or the
timer’s shares are redeemed. When the timer’s shares are redeemed, the
portfolio manager is assumed to sell risky assets at the same rate to fund the
redemption. 5
3.4. To illustrate, take the case where a timer buys 10 fund shares for
$100 on day 1, sells those 10 shares on day 4 for $110, and the estimated daily
average investment rate is 10 percent per day. The model assumes the portfolio
3

Because of the focus on the actual dilutive impact on fund shareholders, aggregate timer gains
and losses in each individual fund are netted through the period in which timer trading occurred.
4

Trades" (September 27, 2004). http://ssrn.com/abstract=596482
5

Daily average investment rates for use in this cash investment model and for calculating
transaction costs are estimated from data on flows of money during 2002 and 2003 into 15 of the
Columbia Funds and data on portfolio manager investments for those funds. The 15 funds were
among those with the largest dilution.

Regression analysis is used to estimate the daily average investment rate where investment in
risky assets is regressed on flows. The daily average investment rate is calculated by averaging
the regression coefficients on the flow variables. Many regression specifications were tried,
including regressions with lead and contemporaneous variables, and the specification that
produced the highest daily average investment rate was used.
To measure typical portfolio manager reaction to recurring timer flows, outliers in the flow and
investment data are removed. (For instance, investment rebalancing by large shareholders, such
as pension plans, periodically caused large movements of assets between funds.)
Where flow or portfolio investment data are unavailable for a fund, a weighted average of the
daily investment rates for the funds with available data is used, and a minimum investment rate of
one percent per day is imposed. The overall dilution estimate is not sensitive to the daily average
investment rate; doubling the rate reduces overall dilution by an insignificant amount.

4

manager invests $10 per day in risky assets on days 2 through 4. Consequently,
before the redemption on day 4, the fund holds $30 of the timer funds in risky
assets and $70 in cash; and immediately after the redemption on day 4, the fund
holds $30 of the timer funds in risky assets and has a cash deficit of $40 (= $70 $110). On days 5 through 14, the portfolio manager is assumed to sell $40 of
risky assets at the rate of $4 per day to offset the cash deficit and return the fund
to its previous cash level.
3.5. To estimate the effect of the incremental investment in risky assets,
the fund’s profits and losses on the incremental investment are estimated for
each day, and the total effect is the sum of the daily profits and losses. The
effect of the incremental investment each day is estimated as the fund’s return
that day multiplied by the incremental investment in risky assets that day. For
example, continuing the previous illustration, the fund’s investment in risky assets
is $20 higher on day 3 than it would have been absent the timing activity. If the
fund’s return on day 3 was 1 percent, then the investment of the timer funds
benefited the fund’s shareholders that day by $0.20 (= $20 * .01); and if the
fund’s return on day 3 was -2 percent, then the timing activity harmed the fund’s
shareholders that day by $0.40 (= $20 * .02).
3.6. Last, the effects of all incremental investments are summed and
added to the total net profits made by the timers ($10 in this example) to arrive at
an estimate of the total dilution harm to shareholders from the timing activity.
B. Estimating Transaction Costs Related to Timer Trading
3.7. The Order states that timer trading may have adversely affected the
funds’ NAV’s in an additional way, aside from dilution (Order ¶9). To the extent
that timer investment and disinvestment resulted in excess portfolio purchases
and sales, the funds may have incurred transaction costs that reduced their
NAV’s. Such transaction costs can be estimated by comparing estimated
transaction costs due to the funds’ actual inflows and outflows to the estimated
transaction costs that would have occurred had there been no timing activity.
The difference between the two estimates of transaction costs is taken as the
incremental transaction costs attributable to the timing activity.
3.8. Incremental transactions in response to a given inflow or outflow are
modeled by assuming that the portfolio manager invests (or disinvests) in risky
assets at the estimated daily investment rate until the flow is completely invested
(or disinvested). For each inflow or outflow, this produces a series of daily
investments or disinvestments. To get the total investment or disinvestment on
any given day, all investments and disinvestments on that day due to all inflows
and outflows are summed. Where there is investment due to previous inflows
and disinvestment due to previous outflows, the investments and disinvestments
are netted against each other for that day. Investments and disinvestments are
not netted against each other across days.

5

3.9. Transaction costs are estimated from the daily series of net
investments by multiplying the investment or disinvestment on each day by the
transaction cost per dollar of investment or disinvestment. Total transaction
costs are the sum of the daily transaction costs.
3.10. Transaction costs vary by fund type and time period. Funds are
classified into four fund groups based on their Morningstar classification: U.S.
Large-Cap, U.S. Small-Cap, International, and Bond. (When a fund’s category
cannot be identified, the U.S. Small-Cap classification is used.) Transaction
costs for U.S Large-Cap, U.S. Small-Cap and International funds are from Plexus
and are the sum of “commissions” and “impact costs.” Bond fund transaction
costs are from Schultz, Paul, 2001, “Corporate Bond Trading Costs: A Peek
Behind the Curtain,” The Journal of Finance 56, 677– 698 at 677.
3.11. Applying the foregoing methodology to the data available for the
Columbia Funds results in an estimate of transaction costs that is on average
approximately 8% of dilution.
C. Interest
3.12. In order to make compensation on an equivalent basis for losses
spread over time, and to provide appropriate compensation to long-term fund
shareholders, it is necessary to make some adjustment for the time value of the
estimated harms. Therefore, the methodology incorporated in this Distribution
Plan builds in a component of interest on estimates of harm, accruing from the
time of dilution harm through the date of payment into the Fair Fund. The rate of
interest was selected to approximate Bank of America’s cost of unsecured
borrowing, 6 and is estimated by reference to the Merrill Lynch index of 1-3 year
A-rated corporate debt over the course of the period in which timer trading
occurred.
IV. Application of the Methodology to Arrangement Trading
4.1. As previously noted, the first category of trading addressed in this
Distribution Plan is the Arrangement Trading (i.e., market timing activity by the
nine entities identified in the Order (¶¶13-40) with whom Respondent Columbia
Distributor was found to have entered into an arrangement or understanding
allowing rapid trading in one or more of the Columbia Funds). Some of the
entities that engaged in Arrangement Trading made purchases and sales that
involved “sticky” assets (i.e., long term investments) in the very funds in which
the Arrangement Trading occurred (see, e.g., Order ¶¶16, 23, 34, 37).
Accordingly, and to focus the ultimate distribution on contemporaneous fund
6

Interest" (May 31, 2005). http://ssrn.com/abstract=732765.

6

holders adversely affected by excessive rapid trading (as opposed to trading in
“sticky” assets), the methodology for measuring the impact of Arrangement
Trading includes all matched buy and sell pairs except those in which the holding
period exceeded 21 trading days.
4.2. The result of this approach to Arrangement Trading is a distributional
allocation in the aggregate amount (including transaction costs and interest) of
approximately $32.6 million. In addition to that allocation, this Distribution Plan
will also return, to contemporaneous holders of the funds affected by such
trading, advisory and administrative fees paid by those funds to Respondents
Columbia Advisors and Columbia Distributors as a result of the investment of
timer funds during the periods in which the Arrangement Trading in those funds
occurred. Order ¶¶49-50. Over the 1999-2003 time period, such fees amounted
to approximately $500,000. Taken together with the allocation attributable to
dilution and related harm, the total allocation proposed with respect to
Arrangement Trading is approximately $33.1 million.
V. Application of the Methodology to Non-Arrangement Timing
5.1. The balance of the Fair Fund will be applied to the Non-Arrangement
Timing. While such trading is only briefly mentioned in the Order (¶41), it
accounts for the largest portion of the allocation contemplated in the Distribution
Plan, and presents a distinct set of challenges. Although the Order notes
numbers of round trips in the Columbia Funds in non-omnibus accounts, and
notes that omnibus accounts also made numerous round trips, it does not
specify, for purposes of the distribution of the Fair Fund, which of those round
trips were by market timers and which of these round trips should result in an
allocation from the Fair Fund.
5.2. Likewise, although the Order mentions round trips in both omnibus
and retail accounts, there are obvious differences between the two types of
accounts from the perspective of identifying and policing market timing. The
aggregated nature of omnibus accounts may mask market timing at the subaccount level. For example, it might not be apparent to an advisor or distributor
that a buy through an omnibus account is “matched” at the sub-account level with
a subsequent sale through the same omnibus account. Moreover, while it might
be appropriate to shut down a retail account when there is a pattern of short term
trading, that might not be an appropriate response in the omnibus account
situation due to the consequences to innocent long-term investors holding
through the omnibus account.
5.3. Accordingly, in identifying the trading with respect to which dilution
and related harm should be estimated, the IDC requested an examination of the
entire set of trading data in the Columbia Funds over an extended time frame
(1998-2003). Trading through Banc of America Securities (compensation for
which is being addressed in the Bank of America/Nations Funds distribution plan)

7

was then excluded from that data set. In addition, trading in 1998 was also
excluded for a variety of reasons, including: (1) the data suggest that the short
term trading prior to January 1, 1999 was relatively insignificant, and (2) as
reflected in the Order, nearly all of the Arrangement Trading occurred after
January 1, 2000.
5.4. For the remaining trading, certain criteria were selected and applied
to these data to identify the trading in respect of which compensation is to be
made under this Plan. In the absence of evidence of specific relevant
communications with specific fund holders as to their investment motivations, no
set of criteria for identifying market timing accounts can possibly be completely
accurate. Accordingly, the application of any set of criteria to the remaining
trading will probably result in the inclusion of some trades that were not driven by
market timing considerations, and the exclusion of some trades that were. The
criteria selected in this Plan, therefore, seek to draw distinctions among accounts
based on observable behavior, reasonably inferable investment motivation, and
reasonable expectations concerning the Respondents’ ability to have halted
observable market timing activity. The goal in selecting these criteria is to arrive
at some reasonable way to allocate the Fair Fund so that distributions to
contemporaneous shareholders are directed to the funds and shareholders most
heavily affected by Non-Arrangement Timing.
5.5. The criteria selected are:
(1) Exclude all purchase/sale pairs in which the holding period exceeded
seven trading days, and exclude all trading in any account in which there was
never a purchase/sale pair involving amounts greater than $100,000 and
$50,000 respectively. 7
(2) For each fund, and for those purchase/sale pairs that satisfy the
criteria in the preceding paragraph, identify the first observance of two round trips
in a retail account in a quarter (on a rolling basis), or, if none, the first five round
trips in a retail account in a year (on a rolling basis), and exclude those trades
and any prior trades.
(3) Exclude purchase/sale pairs in omnibus accounts where the date of
the purchase does not coincide with a date of a purchase in a buy/sell pair in the
same fund that is identified as Arrangement Trading or trading in a retail account
identified pursuant to the two criteria noted above. 8
7

The selected period is shorter than the comparable period selected for Arrangement Trading,
because it is intended to retrospectively identify market timing accounts, rather than distinguish
market timing activity from long-term investment activity in the case of known market timers.

8

In late 2002 the Columbia Funds imposed redemption fees on short-term trading of international
funds by retail accounts, which resulted in a substantial reduction in timing trades by those
accounts. All omnibus trading pairs that meet criterion 1 above for international funds after those
fees were imposed on retail accounts were included in identifying Non-Arrangement Timing.

8

(4) For each fund, and for those trades that satisfy the previous criteria,
identify the first observance of five round trips in an omnibus account in a quarter
(on a rolling basis), or, if none, the first ten round trips in an omnibus account in a
year (on a rolling basis), and exclude those trades and any prior trades.
VI. De Minimis Analysis and Prioritization
6.1. The foregoing analysis, taken together with the analysis of
Arrangement Trading, yields an estimate of total dilution for each of the Columbia
Funds. (See Table 2). This Distribution Plan excludes from the distribution those
Columbia Funds in which the estimate of aggregate dilution harm from 1999
through 2003 was less than either $100,000 or 0.2% of average fund assets.
This approach excludes a large number of the Columbia Funds for which trading
data were studied (see Table 2). Many of these funds are focused on
investments that do not fluctuate rapidly in value or otherwise do not offer
significant opportunity for profitable market timing activity (e.g., municipal bonds,
or domestic large cap stocks).
6.2. The remaining Columbia Funds are identified as “Participating
Funds.” (See Table 1). Of these Participating Funds, the first priority for
distribution will be to the funds in which there was estimated dilution on account
of Arrangement Trading. Distribution in respect of the remaining Participating
Funds will be made, in descending order of estimated dilution as a percentage of
average fund assets, to the point that a minimum of $4 million (plus attributed
interest thereon since February 25, 2005) remains in the Fair Fund as a holdback
described in paragraph 7.8 below. Table 1 sets forth the Participating Funds in
the order of priority of distribution as explained above.
VII. Administration of the Distribution
A. Allocating the Distributions Among Contemporaneous Shareholders.
7.1. Application of the methodology described above permits the
calculation of a distribution amount, by date, for each of the funds affected by the
identified timer trading. In turn, each holder of shares in one or more of those
funds during the period affected by timer trading will be identified in order to
determine that holder’s appropriate allocation of the Fair Fund. There are a
number of difficulties, however, in simply directing payment of those amounts to
those holders. The balance of this Distribution Plan addresses these and other
aspects of implementation and administration of the Plan.
7.2. This Fair Fund is not being distributed according to a claims-made
process, so the procedures for providing notice and for making and approving
claims are not applicable.

9

7.3. Under this Distribution Plan there will be no distribution to any of the
nine persons identified in the Order as having engaged in late trading or market
timing. Similarly, but with the caveat noted below, there will be no distribution to
any person or entity identified as the holder of a retail account identified as a
market timing account using the criteria described above. Such persons or
entities will be notified that they are not to receive a distribution unless they
present to the IDC, within a 60-day period after notice, evidence demonstrating to
the satisfaction of the IDC that their trading was not motivated by timing
considerations. The IDC will evaluate and determine the merits of each such
presentation within 30 days after its submission, and will advise the presenter,
the Respondents and the Commission of the determination promptly upon
making it. The aggregate of amounts excluded on the foregoing basis will be
disbursed in accordance with paragraph 7.8 below.
7.4. Returns on the Fair Fund that have accrued since its establishment in
February 2005 through the date of approval of the Distribution Plan will be
allocated in proportion to the allocation otherwise contemplated under the Plan.
7.5. In any given fund there will be holders identified for whom the
estimated distribution is so small that it would be impractical and ineffective to
send a check. In general, no distribution of less than $10 will be made. Two
steps will be taken, however, to minimize the number of such de minimis
situations, and maximize the number of individual holders who will be receiving a
distribution: (i) an effort will be made to identify, by common social security
number or other administratively feasible mechanism, instances in which
distribution amounts attributable to an individual shareholder in multiple affected
funds can be aggregated into a single amount in excess of $10; and (ii) other
accounts for which the distribution would amount to less than $10 will be
aggregated, with the resulting sum distributed in $10 units to the holders of those
accounts, in descending order of attributable dilution harm.
B. Distributions to Omnibus Accounts and Retirement Accounts.
7.6. (a) For distributions with respect to omnibus accounts (but not for
ordinary trusts, pension plans and 529 plans), it will be necessary to evaluate the
cost associated with commercially reasonable best efforts to identify and
distribute funds to contemporaneous beneficial owners.
(b) If the aggregate amount of the distribution attributable to a
particular omnibus account is $1,000 or more, the account holder will be
contacted in order to determine an appropriate method for distributing the funds
to contemporaneous beneficial owners holding through the omnibus account.
Unless the account holder agrees to distribute the funds to beneficial owners at
its own expense, in accordance with the specifications supplied by or on behalf of
the IDC, the account holder will be asked to estimate the costs of commercially
reasonable efforts to identify and distribute funds to the beneficial owners.

10

(c) If the aggregate amount of the distribution with respect to an
omnibus account exceeds such costs, the omnibus account holder will be asked
to elect, within 45 days after notice of the proposed distribution, whether to (i)
supply to the IDC the sub-account information necessary for the IDC to distribute
funds to the beneficial owners, (ii) supply such information to the IDC, who will
calculate the amount of distributions to beneficial owners so that the account
holder can make such distributions itself, or (iii) distribute the funds itself, using
specifications supplied by or on behalf of the IDC as necessary to determine the
appropriate allocation of the funds among contemporaneous beneficial owners
holding through the omnibus account. In any of these three cases, Respondents
will reimburse the omnibus account holder for the reasonable out of pocket costs
of gathering and supplying the necessary sub-account information. If the
omnibus account makes no election within the time specified in this
subparagraph, it will be deemed to have elected to proceed under subparagraph
(i) of this paragraph.
(d) If the omnibus account holder elects to proceed under
subparagraph (c)(ii) or (c)(iii), the account holder may either send a check to the
beneficial owner or, if the beneficial owner has a current sub-account, credit that
sub-account. Except where the omnibus account holder credits current subaccounts in lieu of sending checks, it will be required to develop and execute a
program similar to the one described in paragraph 7.5(ii) for dealing with
individual distributions of less than $10.
(e) If the aggregate amount of the distribution attributable to a
particular omnibus account is less than either (a) $1,000 or (b) the costs of
commercially reasonable efforts to identify and distribute funds to
contemporaneous beneficial owners, the omnibus account holder will be given
the choice of refusing the distribution or applying any distribution technique, at its
own expense, that the account holder, in the exercise of its reasonable
discretion, deems to be consistent with its fiduciary, contractual or other legal
obligations. If the omnibus account holder refuses the distribution, the otherwise
distributable amount will be added to the holdback described in paragraph 7.8.
(f) For purposes of this paragraph, “commercially reasonable best
efforts” to identify and distribute funds to beneficial owners in omnibus accounts
involve assembly, in appropriate format, of (i) names, addresses and other
necessary identifying information for beneficial owners, and (ii) daily records (or,
if daily records are not available, the most extensive records (monthly, quarterly
or yearly) that are available) of each such owner’s fund share balance during the
period to which the distribution in question relates. The foregoing information
provided by omnibus account holders shall be maintained confidentially and held
exclusively by the Fund Administrator, and Respondents shall not have access to
that information. Respondents and the Fund Administrator shall maintain records
of efforts made to obtain the cooperation of omnibus account holders, and of the
responses to these efforts.
(g) If the distribution to an omnibus account holder is less than the
payments to beneficial owners calculated in accordance with the specifications

11

supplied by the IDC (due to netting at the omnibus account level), the amounts to
be distributed to beneficial owners will be proportionally reduced.
(h) Distributions with respect to omnibus accounts shall be
completed within 180 days after receipt by the omnibus account holder of funds
from this Plan (or, within 180 days after receipt by the IDC of the information
specified in subparagraph (c)(1), if applicable), unless the account holder
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the IDC that good cause exists to extend that
deadline. Omnibus account holders seeking to alter the procedures specified in
this paragraph may apply to the Fund Administrator for permission for such
alteration within 90 days of receiving notice of the proposed distribution from the
Fund Administrator, and the IDC will rule on such applications within 60 days
after their submission to the Fund Administrator. The IDC may grant such
applications if the requested alteration would not materially affect the distribution
of funds to the contemporaneous beneficial owners.
7.7. Intermediaries of retirement accounts shall be required to distribute
the monies received under this Plan in accordance with their fiduciary and
contractual obligations, and consistent with guidance issued by the Department
of Labor, if any.
C. Holdback.
7.8. The holdback described in paragraph 6.2 above will be applied first
toward any distributions necessary to respond to claims, if any, by shareholders
in the Participating Funds for distributions in addition to those contemplated
under this Plan. To the extent that there are funds remaining after all such
claims have been resolved, that remainder should be paid to holders of any of
the other Participating Funds to whom no distribution has been made, again in
descending order of estimated dilution as a percentage of average fund assets.
Finally, any additional funds remaining shall be distributed in a manner consistent
with the plan as approved, as determined by the IDC on notice to Respondents,
the Independent Trustees of the Columbia Funds, and the SEC.
D. Unclaimed Distributions.
7.9. In situations in which distributions are unclaimed (checks not
cashed), or persons to whom a distribution would otherwise be made cannot be
identified or located, the distributable amounts should be added to the amount
held back pursuant to paragraph 6.2 above. All distributions should be on terms
providing that checks not cashed within six months after distribution shall be void,
and the issuing financial institution shall be instructed to stop payment on those
checks or otherwise assure that payment on such checks is prevented.

12

E. Fund Administrator and Tax Administrator.
7.10. Rust Consulting, Inc. (“Rust”), if approved by the Commission, will
serve as the administrator of the Fair Fund (“Fund Administrator”) and will be
compensated by the Respondents. Appendix A to this Plan provides additional
information about the Fund Administrator. The IDC requests that the
Commission waive, for good cause shown (specifically, the facts set forth in
Appendix A), the requirement that a bond be posted pursuant to Rule 1105(c) of
the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans. Under the
supervision of the IDC, Rust will be responsible for, among other things:
overseeing the administration of the Fair Fund, obtaining accurate mailing
information for shareholders, preparing accountings, cooperating with the Tax
Administrator in providing the information necessary to accomplish the income
tax compliance, distributing money from the Fair Fund to shareholders in
accordance with and subject to approval of this Plan, and setting up and staffing
a call center to address shareholder questions or concerns regarding the
distribution. The Fund Administrator will provide customer support and
communications programs which will become active at least by the time the first
distribution occurs. These services will include a toll free number and a website
accessible to the public. The Commission retains the right to review and approve
any material posted on the website. While the distribution is being implemented,
the Fund Administrator will submit to the IDC and the staff of the Commission an
accounting during the first ten days of each calendar quarter, and will submit a
final accounting for approval of the Commission before termination of the Fair
Fund and discharge of the Fund Administrator. The IDC and Rust currently have
an agreement in place requiring Rust to perform certain tasks in preparation for
the forthcoming distribution of the Fair Fund. To date, Rust has successfully met
its obligations under the agreement and the IDC believes that Rust will perform
satisfactorily as the Fund Administrator.
7.11. The Commission has appointed Damasco & Associates as the Tax
Administrator (“Tax Administrator”) of the Fund (Order Directing Appointment Of
Tax Administrator, in the Matter of Certain Disgorgement and Fair Funds in
Administrative Proceedings, Exchange Act Rel. No. 51341, March 9, 2005). The
IDC, Fund Administrator and Respondents will cooperate with the Tax
Administrator in providing information necessary to accomplish the income tax
compliance, ruling and advice work assigned to the Tax Administrator by the
Commission. The Tax Administrator shall be compensated by the Respondents.
F. Payment of Distributions.
7.12. In order to distribute funds, and promptly after the necessary
information becomes available, the IDC will submit a validated list of payees and
the payment amounts to the assigned Commission staff. The staff shall obtain
authorization from the Commission to disburse funds pursuant to Rule
1101(b)(6), upon staff receipt and acceptance of a validated payment file or list.

13

It is anticipated that the entire distribution may not be validated at one time. As
and when additional payee distribution information becomes available, the IDC
will submit additional validated lists of payees and payment amounts for
distribution as authorized. In each instance, the payees and amounts will be
validated at the IDC’s direction by Rust. The validation will state that the list was
compiled in accordance with the Plan and provides all information necessary to
make disbursement to each distributee. Unless otherwise directed by the
Commission, the Commission staff will direct the release of funds to the bank
account established by the Fund Administrator based upon the validated list and
representation by the Fund Administrator that the checks will be issued the next
business day.
7.13. All payments shall be preceded or accompanied by a
communication that includes, as appropriate: (a) a statement characterizing the
distribution; (b) a description of the tax information reporting and other related tax
matters; (c) a statement that checks will be void after 180 days; and (d) the name
of a person to contact, to be used in the event of any questions regarding the
distribution. Any such information letter or other mailing to recipients
characterizing their distribution shall be submitted to the assigned Commission
staff for review and approval. Distribution checks, on their face, or in the
accompanying mailing will clearly indicate that the money is being distributed
from an SEC Fair Fund.
7.14. In implementing the distribution under this Plan, the Fund
Administrator will prepare a “positive pay file” for clearing checks at a bank (the
“Escrow Bank”), and will provide that file to the Escrow Bank separately from the
physical checks themselves. The Escrow Bank will be instructed to clear only
checks matching entries in the positive pay file and for the amount in the file.
When checks are printed, a reconciliation report will be provided which lists the
total number of checks and sequenced numbers printed. These totals will be
compared to the total records from the payment file to confirm all checks were
printed. Printed checks will be kept in a secured area until they are mailed and
will generally be printed just in time for mailing. Only authorized individuals will
be allowed access to the check area for printing and performing quality control
procedures. Processing of the mailing of checks will be subject to appropriate
security procedures.
7.15. If a check is returned as undeliverable, the Fund Administrator will
send the name, current address it has on file, and the tax identification number
for the individual/entity, to a company that has access to credit bureau header
type information. That company will then search for the most current address
available through its proprietary databases, and will then return each record back
to the Fund Administrator. If the returned file contains new addresses for records
where the company has a more current address, with a date that corresponds
with that address, the Fund Administrator will then update its database for
records with better addresses, with a code that notes that the new address was

14

obtained through a trace process and the date the new address was obtained.
This new address will then become the current address for that record in its
database. The Fund Administrator will not overwrite or delete previous
addresses, which it will maintain in an address history with dates and codes that
identify when an address is used and why an address was updated.
7.16. The IDC and the Fund Administrator shall use their best efforts to
assure that distribution of payments to investors shall be substantially completed
within 90 days following the later of the approval of the Plan by the Commission
or the date of receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS (the “IRS Ruling”) on
the reporting of payments to investors under this Plan. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event the IRS Ruling requires reporting of all or a portion of the
payments the IDC and the Fund Administrator shall use their best efforts to
assure that distribution of payments shall be substantially completed no later
than six months from the date of that ruling. The Fair Fund shall terminate
effective upon the later of September 30, 2007 or 60 days after the final
distribution of funds to investors and the resolution of uncashed or unclaimed
funds and the final accounting by the Fund Administrator has been submitted to
and approved by the Commission. Before the termination of the Fair Fund, the
IDC shall cooperate with the Tax Administrator to make adequate reserves for
tax liability and for the costs of tax compliance. Upon termination as defined in
this paragraph, all undistributed assets remaining in the Fair Fund, minus any
reserves for tax liability and tax compliance costs shall be remitted to the United
States Treasury or to such other person or entity as the Commission may direct.
7.17. The Fair Fund constitutes a Qualified Settlement Fund (“QSF”)
under Section 468B(g) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. §468B(g), and
related regulations, 26 C.F.R. §§1.468B-1 through 1.468B-5. The Commission
has custody of the Fair Fund and shall retain control of the assets of the Fair
Fund. The Fair Fund is currently deposited at the U.S. Treasury Bureau of Public
Debt (“BPD”). Upon approval of the Plan, the Fund Administrator shall establish
one or more accounts at the Escrow Bank (i.e., Deutsche Bank or such other
bank as shall be selected by the IDC and determined to be acceptable by the
staff of the Commission), in the name of and bearing the Taxpayer Identification
Number of the QSF. Following approval of the Plan and submission by the IDC
of a list of payees and amounts to the Commission staff, and to the extent
necessary to fund payments as and when contemplated under paragraph 7.12,
and unless otherwise directed by the Commission, the Commission staff shall
cause the balance in the Fair Fund to be deposited in an escrow account
established by the Fund Administrator in the name of and bearing the Taxpayer
Identification Number of the Qualified Settlement Fund (“QSF account”). The
Fund Administrator shall be the signer on the QSF account, subject to the
continuing jurisdiction and control of the Commission. Funds deposited in the
QSF account shall remain in that account until necessary for distribution as
provided in this Plan, at which point they shall be deposited in one or more
disbursement accounts established by the Fund Administrator at the Escrow

15

Bank. The Fund Administrator shall authorize the Escrow Bank to provide
account information to the Tax Administrator. The Fund Administrator shall use
the assets and earnings of the Fair Fund to provide payments to Investors and to
provide the Tax Administrator with assets to pay tax liabilities and tax compliance
fees and costs. The QSF account shall be invested in direct obligations of the
United States Government of a type and term necessary to meet the cash
requirements of the payments to Investors, tax obligations and fees.
7.18. The Respondents will pay all fees and costs associated with the
administration of the Distribution Plan, except for tax liabilities of the QSF, which
shall be paid in accordance with Rule 1105(e) of the Commission’s Rules on Fair
Fund and Disgorgement Plans.
G.

Amendment, Termination and Notices.

7.19. The IDC will inform the Commission staff of any material changes in
the Plan, and will obtain approval from the Commission prior to their
implementation. If material changes are required, this Plan may be amended
upon the motion of the Respondents, the Fund Administrator or upon the
Commission’s own motion. Under this Distribution Plan the IDC has discretion,
again in consultation with the Respondents and the Commission’s staff, to make
supplemental specifications to the Plan of Distribution after its approval that are
not materially inconsistent with the Plan as approved. There have been
substantial regulatory settlements with several entities (such as CIBC, Calugar
and Bear Stearns) which engaged in or facilitated market timing or late trading in
one or more of the Columbia Funds. The IDC under this Distribution Plan will
attempt to coordinate with the IDCs supervising the plans of distribution for those
settlements, for the purpose of facilitating distribution to holders of Columbia
Funds affected by the pertinent trading.
7.20. Notices to be given under the terms of this Plan (other than under
paragraph 7.21) shall be given in writing to:

Appendix A
The Fund Administrator
The Fund Administrator has provided information regarding the Fund Administrator and
its procedures to the IDC for inclusion in this Appendix.
1. Custody / Risk Protection
The Plan provides that money from the Qualified Settlement Fund, which is
currently being held in the U.S. Treasury Bureau of Public Debt (“BPD”), would be
transferred to one or more escrow accounts to be established by the Qualified
Settlement Fund at the Escrow Bank, no more than two business days prior to the date
on which checks would be mailed to shareholders, and that on behalf of the Qualified
Settlement Fund, Rust Consulting, Inc (“Fund Administrator”) would manage the printing
and mailing of checks that would be drawn on those escrow accounts, subject to
procedures described below to protect against misappropriation.
The distribution of the Qualified Settlement Fund will take place in multiple steps,
rather than all at once. The monies will be transferred from the BPD to the Escrow
Bank two business days before each of those steps, thus minimizing the amount of time
that the monies are held pending actual distribution to shareholders. The Fund
Administrator contemplates that the steps in the distribution of the Qualified Settlement
Fund will include:
•
•

Distribution of checks to contemporaneous Columbia Funds retail holders and
other direct record owners (“direct accounts”) in successive mailings, beginning
with reliable/clear addresses.
Distributions to Omnibus Accounts. Monies will not be transferred from the
Qualified Settlement Fund to the Escrow Bank until the Omnibus Account is
prepared to complete the distribution of any payment they receive under the Plan
to its Beneficial Shareholders.

As a result, much less than the full amount of the Qualified Settlement Fund will ever be
in the control of the Escrow Bank and/or the Fund Administrator at any given time.
Once the Fund Administrator has completed calculations for the account holder
distribution accounts, the IDC will take steps sufficient to satisfy the IDC as to the
accuracy of the Fund Administrator’s calculations, including reference to determinations
by Lexecon as to whether its own calculations agree with those of the Fund
Administrator. Once the IDC is satisfied with the accuracy of the calculations, those
calculations will be the basis on which the positive pay file described in paragraph 7.14
of the Plan and ultimately used to control the distribution is generated.

Page 1 of 3

The cost of obtaining a bond under the circumstances of this proceeding, in lieu
of the protections described in this Appendix and in the Plan itself, would be prohibitive,
even if such a bond could be obtained at all.
2. Custody Procedures
The Fund Administrator specializes in claims administration and the development
and implementation of plans for the distribution of settlement funds, and has
administered more than 500 cases worth billions of dollars with class sizes ranging from
80 class members to more than 100 million. The Fund Administrator has been in
existence since 1976 and has never had any occurrence of employee or vendor
problems or claims against its Errors & Omissions insurance due to employee theft or
dishonesty. Over the past three years alone, the Fund Administrator has distributed
approximately $1.8 billion in settlement disbursements to approximately 9.6 million
recipients without incident. The Fund Administrator typically oversees the check printing
process and relies on a third-party check-printing vendor.
The Fund Administrator’s databases are configured so that modifications can
only be made to data through programs; individuals are not allowed direct access to
underlying production databases. Only designated individuals with security clearances
at the Fund Administrator can access data used in completing the distribution. If an
individual has security clearance to make changes in data (e.g., to update an address
through an on-line screen), all original data (e.g., the original address) is automatically
maintained by the Fund Administrator’s systems, and the system records the identity of
the individual who made the change. Individuals cannot alter award amounts. Duties
are segregated: award calculations are separate from the preparation of checks, which
is in turn separate from submission of files to a bank, so that no individual or working
team could affect more than one of these processes.
3. Additional Risk Protection
The Escrow Bank, which will hold Plan assets during the check-cashing period,
maintains a Financial Institutions (FI) Bond including errors and omissions coverage
with an aggregate limit of 200 MM Euro. The primary insurer is American International
Group, which, as of its most recent renewal, was rated A+ by A.M. Best. The Escrow
Bank has 200 MM Euro of E&O insurance. In addition, the Escrow Bank has a bankers
blanket bond of 250 MM Euro from Chubb (which is rated A++ by A.M. Best), which the
Escrow Bank has advised the IDC includes coverage for wrongful acts (i.e., an act,
errors and omissions, misstatement, etc.) or failure to safeguard proprietary information
in connection with rendering of professional services. The Fund Administrator has $10
million in E&O insurance, as well as $2 million fiduciary insurance. The Escrow Bank
annually assesses the adequacy of its policy limits through extensive analysis of
historical loss data, exposure to loss and internal company controls.
The Fund Administrator maintains and will continue to maintain until termination
of Plan, an errors and omissions insurance policy. The primary insurer, Illinois Union
Insurance Co, is a company which, as of its most recent renewal, was rated A+ by A.M.
Page 2 of 3

Best. The policy is in the amount of $10 million per occurrence. The Fund
Administrator also maintains, and will continue to maintain until termination of Plan, a
fiduciary insurance policy. The primary insurer, St. Paul Companies, is a company
which, as of its most recent renewal, was rated A+ by A.M. Best. The policy is in the
amount of $2 million per occurrence. The Fund Administrator’s print vendor maintains
and will continue to maintain until termination of Plan, an errors and omissions
insurance policy. The primary insurer, Illinois Union Insurance Co (ACE USA), is a
company which, as of its most recent renewal, was rated A+ by A.M. Best. The policy is
in the amount of $25 million per occurrence. Under the Plan of Distribution, at no time
will there be funds under the custody and control of the Fund Administrator that exceed
the amount covered by insurance. Certificates of insurance for these policies have
been provided to the assigned SEC staff for review and have been deemed “not
unacceptable.”
Definitions
“Escrow Bank” means Deutsche Bank or such other bank as shall be selected by the
IDC and determined to be acceptable by the staff of the Commission
“Rust” mean Rust Consulting, Inc., experts in the development and implementation of

These calculations include only pairs with holding periods of 1 to 7 trading days for omnibus and retail accounts and
1 to 21 trading days for episode accounts.
For a given retail account / fund, calculations begin after the first two round-trips in a 90 days, or five round trips

in 365 days. For omnibus accounts, calculations begin after the first five round trips in 90 days, or ten in 365 days.

LIFO pairs for omnibus accounts were restricted to those purchased on the same date that an episode account or a retail account
