LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
Philadelphia

3, Pa., Pebruarp

21,

1946.

Sir:

I have the honor to transmit to you the Eleventh Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in accordance with
the provisions of Section 23 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, approved June 6, 1934, Section 23 of the Public utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, approved August 26, 1935, Section 46 (a) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, approved August 22, 1940, and Section
216 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, approved August 22, 1940.
Because of the extensive report made a year ago covering
the ten years of the Commission's existence, we have attempted to condense this report as much as possible.
In this first annual report following the cessation of
hostilities, it is appropriate to express our grateful appreciation
to the large number of Commission employees who entered the military
service of our country. The Commission's honor roll of 472 employees
is printed at the beginning of this report. It lists the names of
those members of our staff who gave their service and those who gave
their lives.

Respectfully,

Ganson Purcell,
Chai man.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE
1HE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Washineton, D. C.

PART
ADMINISTRATION

I

OF THE SECURITIES

ACT OF 19))

Objectives of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the general nature
and scope of registration and examination procedures developed by the Commission for
their effectuation are discussed in the Tenth Annual Report, pages 13-17 inclusive,
and previous annual reports.
Driefly stated, the Act provides for full disclosure
by means of registration statements and prospectuses of pertinent informatlon regarding securities publicly offered for sale in interstate commerce or ~hrough the
mails, without conferring upon the Commission the power to approve or pass upon the
merits of any security.
The Act is also designed to prevent misrepresentation,
deceit, and other fraudulent practices in the sale of securities.
While the RCv
does not insulate investors against risk, it does make available to them Lnf'or-mat.Lr n
with which to gage the risk.
NEW RULES, R3GULATIONS

AND FORMS FOR REGISTRATION

OF SECURITIES

Simplification of registration procedure.--In continuance of its efforts to
simplify the registration sta~ements required to be filed under the Act, the Commission adopted, during the year, tlVO ne~ forms for use in registering certain classes
of securities.
Limitations placed on the use of both forms have per.,litted considerable simplification of previous forms. The first of these additional forms is
designated as Form S-ll. It is designed to facilitate the registration of shares of
exploratory mining corporations.
It is prOVided for the use of mining corporations
that have not engaged in active ore production and have no mining property developed
beyond the exploratory stage. Its use is limited to corporations that have not been
involved in recent successions and are without important subsidiaries.
It is
believed that a large part of the registrants making offerings of unseasoned mine
securities will be able to use the form.
The form also involves several innovations.
It dispenses with the requirement
for certification of financial statements by independent accountants, since the type
of corporation eligible t8 use the form will generally have had few important
financial transactions.
In addition, a booklet has been designed for use in connection with the form to aid registrants in preparing registration statements.
This
booklet, entitled "Supplement to Form S-ll under the Securities Act of 1933", contains quotations of the var .LOUS sect Ions of the Act and the rules thereunder which
are referred to in the form. It also contains a digest of certain views taken from
the Commission's formal opinions which bear on problems which may arise under the
Act in connection with primary mine financing.
This compilation of applicable provisions of the Act, rules, and administrative decisions should greatly facilitate
the preparation of re~istration statements on Form S-ll.
The othar new registration .form is designated as Form S-12, and it is to be
used for the registration of shares of corporations not more advanced than the
development stage. This form may be used by such corporations (other than those in
the insurance, investment ~nd mining business) if they do not have and do not intend to acquire subsidiaries of importance, if they have not been involved in a recent succession, and if there is no long term debt. It is believed that the form
will prove of value, particularly to new small corporations already organized and
those to be organized in the postwar period.
The various items of Lhe form and the instructions have been reduced in number
and simplified in compar~son with previous formso A balance sheet is not required
but may be filed. A supplem8nt to the form has been prepared to facilitate the
preparation of the registration statement.
It contains the parts of the Securities
Act and the ru~es thereunder that are generally pertinent to registration.

- 2 In keeping ldth the Commission's practice,
draf't copies of the form were circulated to attorneys, accountants, and others interested in public financing.
Their
comments and euggestions proved most helpf'ul in preparing the final draft of the
form.
STATISTICS

There were 340
registration statements that became fully effective under the
Securities Aot during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1945. These covered 508 issues
in the total amount of $3,224,584,000. The portion registered for sale for accounts
of the issuers amounted to $2,714,776,000, not including $229,719,000 which were to
be first offered in exchange for outstanding securities.
Bonds and notes accounted for $1,707,574,000, or 63 percent, of all types of
new issues registered for sale. Preferred stock amounted to $406,875,000, or 15 percent, common stock to $316,178,000, or 12 percent, and all other types, including
certificates of participation and face amount installment certificates, aggregated
$284,149,000, or 10 percent, of the volume of all types registered for sale for accounts of the issuers.
A breakdown of the new issues registered for sale - by method of issuance shows that $2,662,416,000, or 98 percent, were to be offered through investment
bankers: 81 percent by purchase and resale, and 17 percent on a "best-efforts"
basis. Only 2 percent of the total, or $52,360,000, were to be offered directly to
investors by the issuers.
An analysis of the industries represented shows that electric, gas, and water
companies registered $1,285,262,000, or 47 percent of the new issues registered for
sale for accounts of all issuers. Manufacturing concerns ~~re next with
$786,003,000, or 29 percent. Finance and investment companies registered
$505,274,000, or 19 percent, transportation and communication companies, $77,756,000,
or 3 percent, and all other issuers, $60,481,000, or 2 percent. 3/

Costs of flotation reported in the registration statements amounted to 3.7 percent of the aggregate value of the new issues registered for sale and this was divided
between 3.2 percent commissions and discounts and 0.5 percent for all other expenses
incidental to flotation (including costs related to registration). The proportion of
aggregate gross proceeds paid in commissions to investment bankers on issues regisshowed a downward trend over
tered for sale throu~h ~h2m to the general public
recent years for each of the three principal types of security as shown in the following tabulation:

l a r g e s t volume of private placements since 19W. However, publicly offered corporate
issues (both registered and unregistered) increased in volume even more, so that the
r e l a t i v e importance of private placements actually declined. Gnly a l i t t l e over 20
percent of a l l issues of corporate bonds and notes were privately placed during the
past f i s c a l year compared with 44 and 46 percent for the tm preceding years.

ECEWTION FROM REGISTRATION
The Commission i s authorized under Section 3 (b) of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, to provide, by rules and re,glations, conditional exemption from the
registration requirements of that Act for Certain small security offerings. The Act
imposed a maximum limitation of $100,000 upon the amount of an offering which the
Commission could thus exempt from registration u n t i l , by amendment of the statute
effective BBay 15, 1945, this l h i t a t i o n was increased t o $300,000.
Promptly
a f t e r the enactment of this amendment, the Commission on May 22 amended its Regulat i o n A so as t o extend the general exemption from the registration requirements
which is provided thereby up t o a maximum offering of $300,000.

&/ 	 For

greater detail, see Appendix Table 2, which gives t h e average compensation,
a s n e l l as the number of issues and dollar volume, for registered offerings of
various degrees of s i z e and quality.

- 5 Regulation A amended to raise exemption limit to $3oo,OOO.--Under Regulation A
as thus amended by the COJIIIIlis15ion,
issuers meeting the conditions of the Regulation
may make a public offering of securities not exceeding $300,000 in aggregate offeriTJg price without filing a registration statement with the Conunission
Prior to
t.he enactment of this amendment, the limitation on offerings under Section 3 (b) was
$100,000. The new Regulation still permits an offering not exceeding $100,000 to be
made by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of any person controlling, controlled by,
or under common control with the issuer. However, the aggregate amount of such
offerings, and those by the issuer, cannot exceed $300,000 in any period of twelve
months. The amended Regulation provides that offerings may be made at the expiration of five days after a letter of notification is filed with the appropriate
regional office of the Commission.
o

Section 3 (b) as amended Yay 15, 1945 remains permissive and preserves the Commission' s authority, in granting exemption, to impose terms and conditions found
necess~
to protect the public interest.
It should be emphasized that the Commission's amendment of Regulation A is of a
0emporar,y nature and is not to be construed as indicating a final determination by it
that the requirements set forth in the new Regulation are regarded as adequate in the
case of all issues up to $300,000.
It is further pointed out that the exemption from registration permitted by Section 3 (b) is not complete exemption from all pr-ovi.s Lons of the Act. It is limited
by express provisions in Section 12 which impose civil liability on persons who sell
securities in interstate conmerce or through the mails by means of untrue statements
or misleading omissions, and by Section 17 which makes it unlawful to sell securities by such means or by other types of f'r-aud , Sections 12 and 17 are applicable
even though the securities involved are exempted under Section 3 (b).

In connection with small issues exempted under Regulation A, there were filed
with the Commission during the fiscal year a total of 578 letters of notification,
and 325 amendments thereto, representing an aggregate offering price of $38,848,8930
Included in this total were 46 letters of notification with an aggregate offering
price of $2,775,957, relating to oil and gas leases and securities of companies
engaged in various phases of the oil and gas business. Some idea of the increase
during the past 3 years in the number and dollar-amount involved in offerings under
Regulation A may be gained from the following comparison:

The ra~s1Dg of the exemption limit under Regulation A to $300,000 does not account for all the increase shonn in the last line of this comparison. However, it
may be noted that, during the fi~t 5 weeks that the increased limit was in effect,
there were filed with the Commission 31 letters of notification for offerings in
amounts between $100,000 and $300,000 each, representing an aggregate offering price
of $6,866,372, which figures are included in the total shown for the year 1945. It
may be worthwhile to note fUrther below a classification of these 31 somewhat
larger offerings according to specif'ied size groups. Y

Some of these exempted offerings were made by large established companies. In
future reports, additional data will be presented as to the size and type of
offerings under Regulation A.

Adoption of Rule 240 of Regulation A-M.--The Commission adopted on March 24,
1945 a new rule pursuant to Section 3 (b) of the Act, designated as Rule 240 of
Regulation A-ill,which provides under certain specified conditions a special exemption from registration for offerings of assessable shares of mining corporations to,
a maximum of $100,000 in one year. Pursuant to this rule, the aggregate offer~
price of the issuer's securities offered to the public (other than securities effectively registered under the Act) in each successive yearly period commencing with
the filing date of the latest prospectus required by the rule p'Ius the amount received in each such period as a result of all assessments must not exceed $100,000.
The aggregate amount of the securities proposed to be offered must not exceed
$100,000 less the aggregate amount of securities being currently offered to the public (other than effectively registered securities) and the aggregate sales price of
securities sold within one year (other than sales of effectively registered securities). Not more than one offering of securities by an issuer under the rule is
allowable in any period of one year.
While the adoption of such a rule had been urged by various members of the
mining industry, and the Commission benefited from the suggestions of various mining
men, mining organizations, attorneys, accountants, and others Who had been furnished
draft copies for review and criticism before it was promulgated, a number of objections to the rule were raised on the ground that it was contrary to public interest.
The Commission therefore adopted this rule on a trial basis. If abuses develop under
the rule to a point where it appears to the Commission that the public interest is
adversely affected, action will be taken to rescind or modify this rule.
During about three months that Rule 240 had been in effect up to the end of the
fiscal year, there were filed under the rule two prospectuses with an aggregate
offering price (including contemplated aesesanent.s for a period of one year) of
$117,000.
Exempt offerings under Regulatioll B.- Pursuant to Regulation B, which provides
for the conditional exemption from registration of fractional undivided interests in
oil or gas rights where the aggregate offering price does not exceed $100,000, the
Commission received and examined during the year 272 offering sheets, and 299 amendments to such offering sheets, with respect to which the following actions were
taken &

-7Confidential written reports of sales under Regulation B.--The Commission also
received and examined during the year 2,770 confidential written reports required
pursuant to Rules 320 (e) and 322 (c) and (d) of Regulation B concerning sales made
by a broker-dealer or offeror to an individual, and from one dealer to another.
This total consisted of 1,930 reports on Form I-G and 840 on Form 2-G, representing
sales in the aggregate of $1,509,740 and $1,309,371, respectively.
If the examination of these reports indicates that a violation of the law may have occurred, the
Commission makes appropriate investigations and, in instances where the facts are
deemed to warrant it, rescissions are required.
The Commission not only maintains an Oil and Gas Unit within th~ framework of
the Corporation Finance Division at headquarters, but has also established a
petroleum geologist at Tulsa, Oklahoma, to facilitate the making of field investigations and reports upon tracts with respect to which offering sheets have been
filed. The establishment of this additional field representative provides the Con~ission and its various regional offices with facilities for research at the source and
technical reports needed for the prompt disposition of offering sheets that are filed
as well as for the orderly conduct of investigations that may be opened.
The importance of this source of supplemental technical information was particularly marked
last year when unusual activity occurred in the West Edmund field of Oklahoma and led
to the filing of many offering sheets relating to tracts in that field.
Oil and gas investigations.--The
Commi~sion conducted a total of 125 investigations during the year in cases involving oil and gas properties or proposed offerings
of oil and gas securities.
l~ost of these investigations arose out of complaints received by the Commission and were aimed at determining whether transactions in question were effected in violation of Sections 5 or 17 of the Securities Act of 1933.
Others related to the question of pos~ible violation of Section 15 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Five investigations were closed during the year and the remaining 120 were pending at the end of the year. A summary of these investi~ations
is tabulated below:

To illustrate the results of such investigations, it may be pointed out that
the persons concerned in 2 cases were enjoined from violating the registration or
fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933; the facts developed in another case
were referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, while in 3
~ases indictments were returned.
It may also be noted that convictions obtained in
4 cases led to the following sentence~: (1) Roy E. Wilson was sentenced to 3 years
imprisonment and $5,000 fine, (2) four defendants in the case of S. S. Alexander, et
ale were imprisoned for periods ranging from,3 years to 2 months, 0) W. W. L:esel, Jr.

CIVIL ACTIO~S INSTITUTED BY THE COMMISSION
During the past fiscal year the Commission sought injunctions restraining violations of the fraud and registration provisions of the Securitie:5 Act of 1933 in a
number of cases. None of these cases, however, was of sufi'icient novelty to warrant
more than passing mention. y

PART II
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE SECURITIES

EXCHANGE

ACT OF 1934

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is designed to eliminate fraud manipulation
and other abuses in the trading of securities both on the organized exchanges and in
the over-the-counter markets, vnlich together constitute the nation's facilities for
trading in securities; to make available to the public information regarding the condition of corporations whose securities are listed on any national securities exchange; and to regulate the use of the nation's credit in securities trading. The
authority to issue rules on the use of credit in securities transactions is lodged
in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but the administration of
these rules and of the other provisions of the Act is vested in the Commission.
REGULATION

OF EX.CHANGES AND EXCHANGE TRADmG

Registration of Exchanges
There was no change during the past fiscal year in the number of exchanges
registered with the Commission as national securities exchanges, nor in the number
of exchanges exempted from such registration; the numbers were ~9 and 5,respectively.
Various changes were effected by the exchanges in their rules, practices, and
organizations during the year, such changes being reflected in amendments to their
ap~lications for registration or exemption. A total of 99 amendments and supplements to these applications were filed by the exchanges and each was studied and
anal~ed for its effects upon the public interest and its compliance with the relevant regulatory provi.et.ons ,
Value and Volume of Trading
As shown in Appendix Table 7, trading on regist'Sred securities exchanges during
the fiscal year 1945 had an aggregate value of $15,160,875,000, as against
$10,746,044,000 in the preceding year. Stock trading had a value of $13,141,773,000
in the 1945 period, as against a value of $8,792,692,000 a year earlier. The volume
of stock trading was 595,133,000 shares in the twelve months ended June 30, 1945, as
compared with 410,940,000 shares for the preceding twelve months.
Exchange Membership
As of the close of the fiscal year, according to Commission records, 2,840 individuals and 975 firms (sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations) were
full or associate members of one or more of the registered exchanges, excluding The
Board of Trade of the City of Chicago which is primarily a commodities exchange.
Disciplinary Actions
In connection with the Commission's investigatory activities, the exchanges
report periodically to the Commission all cases of disciplinary action which they
ta~e against their membership for violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
any rule or reguJation thereunder, or any exchange rule. Dur-Ing the year, six
exchanges reported such actd.ons taken against a total of 29 members, member firms,
or partners of member :firms. The disciplinary- actd.ons included a six-month suspension of membership 1.'1 one case and fines up to $5,000 in other cases, while in some
instances the members involved were required t~ u~~e mvnetary adjustments to
customers or were 5imply censured or r-epr-imanded; Various infractions were involved
in these actions, the principal violations being of eXCh<LTlb8 ru.Les regarding minimum

- 10 -

capital, margin trading, partnership agreements, floor trading, splitting commissioll5
with non-members, and special of'f'er'Lngs , The individual who was suspended from membership ~~s found guilty of rebating commissions and of allocating transactions subsequent to their execution, such allocations having been made at the expense .of
customers over whose accounts he had discretion~
authority.
Special Offering Plans
Rule X-IOB-2 permits special offerings of blocks of securities on national securities exchanges where such offerings are effected pursuant to a plan filed with and
declared effective by the Commission. No new special offering plan became effective
during the year; the plans of seven exchanges, !I which had previously been declared
effective, remained in effect throughout the year y
o

Special offerings on registered securities exchanges in the twelve months ended
June 30, 1945, produced sales of 1,ll5,201 shares of stock, as against 975,173 shares
in the preceding twelve months. Special commissions amounted to $626,000 as compared
with $593,000 in the preceding year. Offerings on the New York Stock Exchange accounted for 1,013,154 of the 1,J-l5,201 shares sold in special offerings in the fiscal
year 1945. Further details are given in Appendix Table 6.
Floor Trading
On -January 15, 1945, the Trading and Exchange Division reconrrnendedthe adoption
of a rule, pursuant to Section 11 (a) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
which would prohibit floor trading in stocks on the New York Stock Exchange and the
New York Curb Exchange. This recormnendation W3.S accompanied by a report which outlined the legislative background of the Comrrassion's powers with respect to floor
trading, discussed the steps which had been taken in the past to regulate that activity, and described the nature and effects of such trading in considerable
detail. V

A public conference was held on May 16, 1945, for the purpose of considering
the merits of the proposal. At the conference, the Commission heard statements from
all persons who wished to be heard; in addition, the Commission received various
coromunications and other documents, among them a supp.l.ement.ary report prepared by the
staff. ~
 Subsequent to the public conference, representatives of the Commission and
of t.heFew York Stock Exchange met from time to time for additional discussions.
Fin.ally, acceding to the request of the New York. Stock Exchange, the Cormnission
agreed to Ynt!h~old action on its staff's proposal and to permit the exchanges to
adopt experimentally certain rules restricting floor trading. The Commission is continuing its studies of floor trading as anno~~ced in its decision as follows:

y

The seven exchanges were the Chicago Stock Exchange, Cincinnati Stock Exchange,
Detroit Stock Exchange, New York Curb Exchange, New York Stock Exchange,
Philadelphia Stock Exchange, and the San Francisco Stock Exchange.

V

The Chicago Stock Exchange was the only exchange to file an amendment to its plan,
such amendment being declared effective by the Commission on September 21, 1944.

Short Selling
The Commil!!sion
adopted one minor amendmentto its short-selling
rules under Section 10 (a) of the Act. In general, these rules prohibit short sales on a decline in
price, requ1re the marking of' orders for short sales, and require the covering of
short sales which have been improperly executed as long sales.
Rule X-IOA-2 (b) provides an exemption from the requirements relating to the covering of iJIlproperly
marked orders f'or short sa'Les , :if the exchange upon which the sal.e was executed makes
certain findings.
The amendmenthas the ef'fect of reducing the necessary findings
under certain cirC1JDlStances. Whereas exchanges fonnerly were required to make findings relating to good faith and due diligence and to the hardship which would be
incurred in covering the transaction,
the amendmenteliminates the necessity for the
exchanger IS making alV finding relating to hardship in order to grant relief,
where
the mistake in marking was made by a broker and the sale did not violate the price
restrictions
of the short-selling
rules.

This report must be filed within 30 days after the close of each
fiscal quarter or within 30 days after the effective date of the };lew rule, whichever
is later.

Prior to adoption, drafts of the proposed rules were widely distributed for
to interested persons, as well as certain government agencies. COIIIIIlents
were
COIIIIIlent
received from many sources and a number 'of staff discussions were held with interested
persons.
In addition, the proposals were discussed lIith the Office of Censorship
and the War and Navy Departments to ensure conformity to the requirements of the Code
of wartime Practices and the security regulations of these agencies.
As a result of these conferences and the cOBDJlents
received, the rules were
~implified and clarified in certain r-especte before they were adopted. In addition,
a number of special instructions were added to adapt the general requirements for
use where war business is conducted under special types of contracts.
Finally, it
may be pointed out that the revised instructions penuit the use of estimates where
by reason of the nature of the business it is impracticable to furnish exact information as to certain of the item:J in the report.
Rule X-12A-5 enanded.-During
the year the Commissionadopted an amendmentto
Rule X-la-5,
effec i ve Dec€lllber29, 1944. This rule providel5 a temporary exemption
from the registration
requirements of Section 12 (a) of the Act for certain new
securities arising out of old securitie15 previously listed or admitted to unlisted
trading privileges on a national securities
exchange. The purpose of the amendment
'is to permit an exchange, under certain cirC1JDl.l5tances
not previously covered by the
rule, to trade in the entire class of the new securities under the temporary exemption afforded by this rule where the entire c'laas of new securities has been lawfully admitted to dealing on another exchange.

t e beginning of the fi8cal year under review, were
Ji5C1.lS~edin the last annual report, page 49. The first of the15erules provides
that, whenever a companywith a security registered on a national Becurities exchange declares a dividend or distribution
in a form other than cash or !Securities,
it shall promptly file a telegraphic report with the Commission, containing a: f'ull
and accurate description of the contemplated dividend. or distribution.
If the Commission finds that the available information with reepect to the contemplated
dividend or distribution
is inadequate to permit investors to make a proper appraisal
of tne value of the security, it may exercise its authority under Section 19 (a) (4)
of the Act to order a temporary suspensd.on o:f trading in the security on the exchange
on wh~ ch it is registered,
pending the availability
of more adequate information.
The seccnd rule -providr.iSthe.t, whenever exchange trading i8 thus ~

- 1.3by the Commission, any act of a broker or dealer designed to effect or induce an
over-the-counter tr~actibn
with a customer in the security during the period of
suspension is a fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative act. The~e rules were
designed to prevent potential abuses in trading in securities before adequate information was available as to the nature and amount of the dividend or distribution.
Termination of Registration under Section 19 (a) (2)
Two proceeQings for the termination.of registration pursuant to Section 19 (a)
(2) were pending at the beginning of the year. During the year an additional one was
instituted upon failure of an is~uer to file the annual report required by Section
13, while another was df.smi seed upon the filing by the Lssuer- of an amendment disclosing required information, leaving two such proceedings pending at the close of the
period.
Investigation of Elastic Stop Nut Corporation of America
On Decp.mber 8, 1940 the Commission authorized an investigation and public hearing to determine whether a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of
1933 and an application for registration filed under the Securities Exchange Act of
19.34were complete and accurate, and whether any violation of the anti-fraud provisions of those Acts had been connnitted.

The 19.3.3Act registration statement covering $3,500,000 of the company's 15Year 5% Sinking Fund Debentures became effective January 14, 1944. The application
for registration on the New York Stock Exchange of the company's $1 common stock
became effectivp. on September 29, 1944. Two months thereafter the president of the
company took his own life. On the same day, November 29, 1944, the Commission for
the first time issued an order under Section 19 (a) (4) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 which summarily suspended trading in the company's common stock on the
New York Stock Exchange.
In a statement issued upon the conclusion of its hearings the Commission revealed that the 1933 Act registration statement had failed to disclose in full the
facts regarding a downward trend in the company's incoming orders and backlog of
orders, an abnormal inventory situation, and the company's increased costs of production. In addition, it appeared that the statement of the company regarding its
controlling stockholders was inadequate in material respects. 11
The Commission's release also pointed out that the application for registration
under the 19.34Act failed to disclose adequately the facts regarding the operating
losses in the months immediately preceding its filing, an excess and obsolete inventory condition, the surplus stocks in the hands of the industry which would constitute a block to new business, a drastic decline in the volume of incoming orders,
and in the amount of unfilled orders on the books of the company. Moreover, the
application for registration omitted to state that in 1944 its production was decreasing and that the demands of the aircraft industry were decreasing.
On December 4, 1944 the company filed a supplement to the prospectus issued in
connection with the 19.3.3registration statement which contained material additions to
the information theretofore supplied. On December 22 and 23, 1944 and Jan'J.ary1,
1945, while the Commission proceedings were in progress, the company filed amendments
to its 1934 application. In addition, on May 31, 1945 the company filed its annual
report, pursuant to the 1934 Act, for the fiscal year ended November 30, 1944.

any evidence of concentration of buying or selling or manipulation of securities of
the company. The Commission concluded that neither stop-order proceedings with respect to the registration statement covering the debentures, nor delisting proceedings with respect to the company's common stock would be in the public interest or
afford additional protection to the investors

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS OF CORPORATE INSIDERS

Each officer, director and principal stockholder 1/ of a company having equity
securi.t.ieslisted and registered on any national secur!ties exchange is required by
Section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to file with the Commission
and the exchange an initial report showing his direct and indirect beneficial ownership of his company's equity securities and a report of transactions and holdings
each month thereafter in l'Ihichchanges in such beneficial. owner-ehdp occur. The provisions of Section 17 (a) of the Public utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and
Section 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 require that corresponding security ownership reports be filed with the Commis~ion by officers and directors of
registered holding companies and by office~, directors, principal security holders,
members of advisory boards, investment advisers and certain other affiliated persons
of registered closed-end investment companies.
After these security ownership reports are received and examined by the Commission, the information they contain is extracted and published each month in the
Official Summary of Security Transactions and Holdings which is distributed to newspapers, individual security holders and other per-sons interested in the security
t.ransact.Lons
and holdings of corporate insiders. Altogether during the past 11 years

11 A

principal stockholder means a beneficial owner of more than 10% of the issued
amount of any class of listed and re~is1;-eredequity security.

- 15 more than 230,000 reports have been filed by more than 37,000 persons subject to
these requirements. All such reports are available for public inspection at the
Commission's main office in Philadelphia as ~ll as the exchange at which additional copies must also be filed; while complete sets of the summary may be. inspected
at each regional office of the Commission as well as each national securities
exchange.
Changes oc~g
in the volume of reports filed during recent war years are reflected in these figures for the past four fiscal y-ears: 1942, 18,600; 1943, 14,972;
1944, 14,765; 1945, 16,613. It will be noted that the volume of these repu~ts last

SOLICITATION OF PROXIF3, CONSENTS, A1IDAUTHORIZATIONS
The Commission's Regulation X-14, which was adopted pursuant to Sections 14 (a)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 12 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935 and 20 (a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, prescribes information
which companies subject to these acts must make available to their security holders
whose proxies, consents or authorizations are solicited. !I
During the year the Commission received and examined under that regulation both
the preliminary and defini~ive material required with respect to 1,630 such solicitations, as well as nfollow-up" material employed in 263 instances.
Modification of Proxy Rules.--An amendment to Rule X-14A-l relating to the
solicitation of proxies was adopted February 1, 1945. Paragraph (b) of the rule as
originally adopted prevented the management of a corporation from soliciting
proxies for use at a meeting at which the election of directors was an item of business unless security holders had been furnished or were concurrently furnished with
an annual report including financial statements of the company. The effect of this
provision was to confine the management's solicitation to the period bet"l'v-een
the
date on which the financial statements became available and the date of the stockholders' meeting while opposition solicitation was not similarly limited. The amendment permits manager.ent1s solicitation in advance of mailing the annual report in
cases in which solicitations are being made in opposition to the management provided
the management's proxy soliciting material contains an undertaking to furnish the
annual report at least twenty days before the meeting.

. other than those o~which unlisted trading privileges existed and 149 issues had only an
unlisted trading status.
The 149 issues included 24 issues aggregating $572,335,500
principal amount admitted under requirements substantially
equivalent to those for registered issues.
The remaining 125 issues, aggregating $1,008,932,035 principal amount,
represented original admissions made on the basis of the fact that unlisted trading
privileges in these ismes had existed prior to March 1, 1934. All of the 149 issues,
except 3 issues aggregating $4,860,000, were on the NewYork Curb Exchange.

2V

The aggregate of stock and bond issues admitted only to unlisted trading haa
been diminishing through the years, in accordance with the expectation of Congress
when it authorized continuance of such privileges in 1936. A survey of the stock
issues removedfrom unlisted trading since the passage of the Securities Exchange
Act indicates that if they were actively traded on the exchanges prior to their removal they or their successors for the most part subsequently became fully listed
and registered.
The principal exceptions were in cases of Lssues called for redemption or issues extinguished for one reason or another.
In the latter category were
issues extinguished upon reorgan:i.zation or liquidation of issuers, rights and
warrants expired at the end of their term, and depositary receipts withdrawn on
termination of depositary agreements"
The decline in bond issues admitted only to unlisted trading has followed
pri. 1cipally upon the listing of such issues or their successors and upon the retirement of issues by the private placing of new issues or by bank loans or otherwise.
Bond issues admitted to exchange trading on an unlisted basis have been principally
those of utility
holding companysystems and the outlook is for a continuing decline
in such issues as the integration proceedings under the Holding CompanyAct continue.

DELISTllJG

OF SECURITIES

FROM EXCHANGES

Securities ~elisted by Application
Section 12 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 defines the Commission's
powers with respect to application3 by an issuer or an exc~ange to delist securities
from an exchange. It provides that a security may be withdrawn or Btricken from
listing and registration L~accordance with the rules of the exchange and upon such
terms as the Commission may deem necessary to impose for the protection of investors.
Pursuant to this section and in accordance with the procedure prescribed by
Rule X-12D2-l (b:, 8 issues wore delis ted upon application of issuers and 33 issues
were delisted upon application of exchanges during the fiscal year. In one instance
the'same issue v~s deJisted from two exchanges upon their applications; thus the
total delistings, ll,~luding this duplication, numbered 42. In each of these cases
the application was granted without the imposition of any terms upon the de1isting.
Of the 8 issueB delis ted upon application of issuers, 4 had little or no exchange
activity during r~cent years, 1 remained listed and registered on another exchange,
and 1 had become very closely held with only a negligible number of shares remaining
in public hands; in the remaining cases, holders of more than two-thirds of the
shares had approved Lhe action pursuant to the requirements of the exchange from
which the securities ~e~e delisted.
During the fiscal year the Commission considered the application of TI1e
Torrington Company to Yd. thdraw its common stock from Boston Stock Exchange. The application was granted Bubject to the condition that the ~~thdrawal should not become
effective until the applicant had submitted the delisting proposal to its stockholders and obtained their consent thereto.
After the close of the year the Commission dismissed this application upon being advised that the company had determined
not to solicit its stockholders' consent to the proposed delisting ;I

y

q

This was the second time that the Commission imposed material terms upon the
granting of a delisting application. The first such case occurred in May 1944, when
it granted the application of Shawmut Association to withdraw its common sto~k from
Boston Stock Exchange.
While the assent of stockholders to the proposed delisting was also required in that case, the precise terms differed. The Commission's
order in the Shawmut case required consent by a majority of the company's 4,000
stockholders and by the holders of a majority of its outstanding stock. In the
Torrington case, however, because of the apparent practical difficulties in obtaining assents from a majority of the company's 11,000 stockholders, the term imposed
was to require assents by a majority of the shares voted and a majority of the stockholders voting, provided not less than fifty percent of the outstanding shares ,vere
voted.

Securities Delisted by Certification
Under Rule X-12D2-2 (a) an exchange, without the necessity of application and
hearing, may remove from listing and registration upon certification to the Commission securities which have been paid at maturity or are otherwise redeemed or retired in full, or issues which are exchangeable for other securities. During the
year 319 issues were delisted under this rule. Some of these issues were delisted
from more than one exchange; thus the total delis ting s, including these duplications,
numbered 354.
Rule X-12D2-1 (d) provides that an exchange may remove any security from listing and registration if tradin[ therein has been terminated pursuant to a rule of the
exchange requiring such termination whenever the security becomes listed and admitted
to trading on another exchange. Under this rule, 6 issues were. delisted frem the
New York Curb Exchange when they became listed and registered on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Securities Removed from Listing on Exempted Exchanges
The listing of a security upon an exempted exchange may be terminated upon the
filing by an exchange of an appropriate amendment to its applica.tion for exemption.
Two exempted exchanges filed such amendments during the year, terminating the listing
of 5 issues.
Temporary Exemption of Substituted or Additional Securities
In order to provide continuity of exchange trading in cases where securities
have come to evidence other securities, Rule X-12A-5 affords a temporary exemption
from the operation of Section 12 (a) of the ~ct to such securities to the extent
necessary to render law:ful the effecting of transactions therein on the exchange.
During the year, 67 issues were admitted to trading under this rule. In some instances the same issue was, admitted to trading on more than one exchange; the total
of such admissions, including these duplications, numbered S6.
STABILIZATION

AND MANIPULATION

Manipulation
In its administration of the statutory provisions of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 relating to the manipulation of securities markets, the Commission's
policy is to attempt to detect manipulative practices at their inception, before the
public has been harmed. At the same time, it seeks to avoid interfering with the
legitimate functioning of the s ecurities markets. In brief, the Commission 1 s investigations in this area take two forms. The "flying quiz", or preliminary investigation, is designed to detect and discourage incipient manipulation by a prompt
determination of the reason for unusual market behavior. If a legitimate reason for
the activity is ur..covered,the case is closed. If more extended investigation seems
required, a formal order is sought of the Commission under which members of the
staff are empowered to subpoena pertinent material and take testimony under oath.
These formal investigations often cover substantial periods of time, and trading
operations involving large quantities of shares are carefully scrutinized.

The Commission keeps confidential the fact that any security is under investigation so that the market in the security may not be unduly affected or reflections
be unfairly cast upon individuals or firms Whose activities are being investigated.
As a result, the Commission occasionally receives criticism for failing to investigate situations when, in fact, it is actually engaged in an intensive investigation
of those very matters.

Stabilization
During the fiscal year en:led June 30, 1945, the Commission continued the administration of Rules X-17A-2 and X-9A6-1. Rule X-17A-2 requires the filtng of detailed reports of all transactions incident to offerings in respect of which a
registration statement has been filed under the Securities Act of 1933 where any
stabilizing operation is undertaken to facilitate the offering. Rule X-9A6-1 governs
stabilizing transactions in securities registered on national securities exchanges,
effected to facilitate offerings of securities so registered, in which the offering
prices are represented to be "at the market" or at prices related to market prices.
During the eleventh fiscal year of the Commission 402 registration statements
were filed under the Securities Act of 1933. Of these, 276 contained a statement of
intention to stabilize to facilitate the offerings covered by such registration
statements. Because of the fact that a registration statement sometimes covers more
than one class of
security, there were 325 offerings of securities in respect of
which a statement was made, as required by Rule 827 under the Securities Act,-to the
effect that a stabilizing operation was contemplated. Stabilizing operations were
actually conducted to facilitate 64 of these offerings. In the case of bonds, public offerings of $65,246,735 principal amount were stabilized. Offerings of stock
issues aggregating 9,866,465-1/6 shares and having an aggregate estimated public
offering price of $173,984,000 were also stabilized. In connection with these
stabiliZing operations, 16,000 stabilizing reports were filed with the COIIIIIlission
dUring the fiscal year. Each of these repcrts has been analyzed, thereby enabling
the staff to determine whether the stabilizing activities were lawful.
To facilitate compliance with the Commission's rules on stabilizing and to
assist issuers and underwriters to avoid violation of the statutory provisions dealing with manipulation and fraud, many conferences were held "With the representatives
of such issuers and underwriters and many written and telephone requests were
answered. A total of 1,611 letters and memoranda of such conferences and telephone
requests and memoranda to the regional offices of the Commission were written in
connection "With the adm:Inistration and enforcement of the stabilization and manipulation statutes and regulations.

Broker-Dealer Inspections
As authorized by Section 17 of the Securities Exchange Act, the Commission
regularly inspects the bocks and records of registered brokers and dealers to determine whether registrants' financial condition and business practices conform with
the requirements of law. The results of 825 broker-dealer inspections were reported
by the regional offices during the 1945 fiscal year.
For the .first tilllein four
years, the number of inspections reported during a fiscal year showed an increase
over the number reported during the preceding year.
Among the situations reported in the inspections were: 27 cases of unsatisfactory .financial condition, ranging .from cases requiring immediate corrective action
to cases requiring merely continued surveillance; 137 cases in which the prices
charged by dealers may not have been reasonably related to the market; 119 cases of
.failure to comply nth the provisions of Regulation T relating to the extension of
credit; 47 cases o.fnon-compliance with the rules relating to hypothecation and commingling o.fcustomers' securities, or the use of customers' free fUnds or securities;

11 This

figure represents the net registrations placed on inactive status during the
year. The registrations of eighteen brokers and dealers, whose lIhereabouts,
despite careful inquiry, could not be ascertained, were placed on inactive status.
Eleven such registrations were removed from this status either through cancellation or through restoration to active status.

- 23 and 21 cases in which brokers took secret profits from customers by misrepresenting
prices at Which the customers' orders had been executed.
In accordance with established policy, minor infractions are called to the attention of the firm at the time of the inspection and corrective measures are generally agreed to. In some of these instances, a check-up is made within a reasonable time
to ascertain whether the promised corrections have been effected. When the circumstances indocate the infractions may be of a serious nature, further investigation is
made to de te.rm.lne whether action by the Commission may be necessary or appropriate.
In 50 inspections, matters were disclosed which required further inquiry or investigation. As a result of such investigations the Commission filed a bill in equity
against one firm to enjoin certain fraudulent practices and obtained a permanent injunction. The facts in five instances were referred to state agencies and in six
others to the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD). In eight other
cases, including one in which an injunction :was obtained, 1/ the Commission instituted
administrative proceedings to revoke the registration of the broker-dealer involved.

(1945), Securities Exchange Act

28

-24Amongthe adJDinistrative proceedings decided by the Commissi'onduring the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1945, three are especially noteworthy. The proceeding against
E. H. Rollins & Sons, Inc. and Walter C. Rawls
involved the finn's and Rawls'
transactions wi. th the Board of Missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, a
religious and charitable corporation organized tinder the laws of the State of
Tennessee. Since early in 1935 Rawls, on behalf of Rollins, had handled practically
all of the securities
business in three funds of the Board of Missions of the
Methodist Episcopal Church, South. In 1940 he registered with the Commissionindividually as a broker-dealer and thereafter engaged in some transactions with the
Board for his own account., but he also continued to handle Rollins' business with
the Board. With respect to a great number of sales by Rollins to the three funds at
prices far exceeding the prevailing prices and beating no reasonable relation to such
prices, the Commissionfound that the Board had not been truthfully
informed of the
differences between the current prices and the prices charged by Rollins, and that
without such disclosure the prices charged operated as a fraud on the funds. The
Commissionalso found that the excessive trading with one of the funds, in the light
of the ~~rounding circumstances, operated as a fraud.
Holding that Rawls, L~ dealings with the Board on his own behalf and on behalf of Rollins, was guilty of
fraudulent conduct, the Commissionordered his registratr~tion
revoked. On the further finding that Dryden, vice president in charge of Rollins' Chicago office
through which its transactions with the Board were effected, was or should have been
aware of the fraudulent nature of the firm's and Rawls' dealings with the Board of
Missions and that Rollins could not escape responsibility
for the conduct of its
employees, the Commissionsuspended Rollins from membership in the NASD
for a period
of 60 ~s
commencingMarch 6, 1945.

!I

The opinion stated, however, that a case for revocation of Rollins' registration had been made, far Section 15 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act provides that
the Commissionshall revoke the registration
of a broker or dealer if it finds that
such action is in the public interest and if it finds that any "officer, director
or branch manager" or "any person. • .controlled by such broker or dealer" has
wilfully violated the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act or the regulations thereunder.
The Commissionsaid that this result might be avoided and hardship on any innocent persons be madeunnecessary if Rawls and Dryden were separated
from the organization.
SUbsequently, upon submission by Rollins of evidence showing
that the resignations of Rawls and Dryden from their respective positions had been
accepted, the Commissiondismissed the proceeding with respect to revocation of
Rollins' registration.
A motion filed with the Commissionby Rollins on April 11,
1945, asking relief from the suspension order on the ground that the suspension had
resulted and would continue to result in large losses to Rollins both in current
earnings and through disruption of its sales organization, was denied. 3.1

21

In the proceeding against H~, Fales & Co.,
the ultimate issue was Whether
a broker Whicheffects transactions on the order of an outside person holding discretionary powers over cuatomera J accounts is under the duty of making full disclosure to those customers of all material facts concerning the securities which are
the subject of such transactions.
The issues arose out of the purchase of the
securities of two promotional companies by a limited group of customers, all of Whom

were clients of R. C. M. Page. Page, who was not a registered broker or dealer,
held discretionary authority over a number of investment accounts and custo~arily
used registered firms in effecting transactions for these accounts. In 1939, in exchange for office space, Page transferred these accounts to the Hay, Fales firm.
Page initiated transactions for the accounts, and the orders were executed by Hay,
Fales as a broker; the firm confirmed transactions directly to the customers, sent
them monthly statements, and took full brokerage commissions on transactions so
executed.
Page was known by the firm to be president of the two promotional companies.
Hay, one of the members of the firm, was a director of one of these promotional companies and was aware of its precarious financial condition, but he did not disclose
the company's condition to customers whose orders, placed by Page, the firm executed.
Upon orders of Page, the firm also confirmed purchases of securities not yet issued,
and effected cross-trades between customers' accounts at prices which were obviously
not the best prices at which such securities could be obtained; these facts were not
disclosed to the customers.
In defense of its conduct, the firm insisted that it owed no duty of disclosure
to any of Page's clients. It pointed out that although its confirmations were made
out directly to Page's clients it neither recommended nor initiated the transactions
of such clients. The firm claimed that since Page had discretionary power to deal
with its clients' accounts the firm was fully authorized to accept his orders and
that it owed no duties as broker except to Page.

The Commission rejected these claims. The facts which imbued all of the transactions with fraud were apparent and known to the firm. By continuing with the
execution of Page's orders under these circumstances, the firm participated in and
made itself a part of Page's scheme. To avoid individual responsibility for this
fraud, the Commission said, the firm was obligated to make the fullest disclosure
directly to the customer, and it held that this conclusion would be applicable even
if the firm had dealt exclusively with Page and had not undertaken to make any direct
disclosures to customers.
While concluding that it was necessary in the public interest to revoke the
firm's registration under Section 15 (b), !I the Commission ordered that, because
the major pattern of the firm's conduct was one of carelessness and misunderstanding
rather than evasion or wilful violation of the Act, revocation would be without
prejudice to an application for re-registration after 30 days.
The proceedings against Abe Abrahams,

Emanuel

21 and

Administrator of New York County. The Public Administrator is an official who, under
the circumstances prescribed by state law, administers decedents' estates in New York
Courrty in the event that there is no private person qualified to perform that
function. In general these estates are small, but in the aggregate the assets in

!/ Revocation

of registration under Section 15 (b) automatically disqualifies a firm
from membership in the NASD while the revocation is in effect.

- 26 the Public Administrator's hands, including securitie s, run to substantial amounts.
In liquidating estates, the Public Administrator sells seCurities through brokers.
In 1940, at the suggestion of Frank J. McCabe, then a member of the New York
Curb Exchange and a friend o:fthe Public Administrator, the latter employed Emanuel
& Company as its broker.
In exchange for this business Deetjen, a general partner in
the Emanuel :firm, agreed that the firm would use McCabe in the execution of Curb floor
business and that it would give some over-the-counter business to Abra.luuns,a friend
of McCabe. This arrangement continued from 1940 to 1942. McCabe, dissatisfied with
the amount of his reciprocal Curb business from Emame1 & Company, had the Public
Administrator transfer his official account to Baker, Weeks & Harden Where it remained
for about three months.

While the account was with Emanuel & Company, Abrahams purchased about 170 lots
of listed and unlisted securities from the Public Administrator's official account
through the Emanuel firm. These lots had been delivered to the firm for sale flatthe
market." Abrahams, with a free hand in the account, milked it by devious methods.
He bought many listed securities from the account at prices substantially lower than
the lowest contemporaneous exchange quotations, and ma~ unlisted securities at
prices lower than the lowest reported bids, and resold these securities on the day
of the purchase or soon thereafter at substantial mark-ups, without risk and without
any considerable investment of his own funds.
After the account had been transferred to Baker, Weeks & Harden, Abrahams continued this course of conduct; in twenty transactions he purchased securities from
the Public Administrator's official account at prices below prevailing markets and
profited through immediate resales. Abrahams t continued course of business defrauded
not customers who could meet him face to face but the heirs of many small estates, in
the main helpless to protect themselves.
The Commission, on findings of wilful violations of the Act, revoked Abrahams'
registration as a broker and dealer. The Commission found, however, that Abrahams'
scheme was possible only through the lack of effective supervision by both Emanuel &
Company and Baker, Weeks & Harden over the handling of the Public Administrator's
official account, amounting to an abdication of responsibility by the firm and an
unwarranted delegation of control over the account to Abrahams.
Holding that four partners in Emanuel & Co. y knew or should have known what
was taking place and that it blinked at Abrahams I conduct, the Commission concluded
that the firm had wilfully violated the Act, and ordered its registration revoked
but without prejudice to an application for re-registration at the end of thirty days
following the effective date of revocation order.
As to Baker, Weeks & Harden, however, the Commission concluded that the evidence
did not establish that its violations were wilful and the proceedings, insofar as
they involved the question of revocation of the firm's registration, were dismissed.
But a violation of the Exchange Act need not be wilful for the purposes of discipl.ina:ry
action suspending or expelling an exchange member under Section 19 (a) (3) or
a member of a national securities association under Section 15A (1) (2) (A). The
finding that Baker, Weeks & Harden had violated the Act, although not wilfully,
resulted in an order suspending the firm from the NASD for a period of ten days.

!I The

firm of Emanuel & Co. included at the time of these proceedings five general
partners and Victor Emanuel, a limited partner. As a limited partner, Victor
Emanuel exercised no supervision over the firm. The evidence showed that he spent
practically no time with the affairs of Emanuel & Co. and that he was completely
unaware of the facts upon which this proceeding was based. No fjnding made with
respect to the firm or any of its partners applied to Victor Emanuel.

 27Capital Requirements

On October 29, 1942 the Commissionadopted Rule X-15C3-l prescribing for brokers
and dealers a maximum ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital of 2,000 percent, but deferred the effectiveness of the rule pending adoption of definitions
of
aggregate indebtedness and net capital.
Shortly after the rule was announcedja
draft of proposed definitions of these terms was submitted to the industry for comment. During 1943 and the early part of 1944 the Commissionexperimentally applied
a similar set of definitions to all financial statements filed under Rule X-17A-5,
for the purpose of testing them in actual practice.
The final rule announced on
August ll, 1944
and the amendmentadopted on November8, 1944 3/ reflect consideration of the commentsfrom interested persons on the proposed definitions
and
of the results of the test applied to reports filed under Rule X-17.A.-5.

1:1"

3/

Exemption from the rule is given to brokers and dealers who do not extend credit
to customers and who hold the funds or securities of customers only temporarily as an
incident to the prompt consummationof cash transactions.
Exemption is also given to
the membersof eight national securities exchanges whose rules and settled practices
to impose requirements more comprehensive than those of
are deemed by the C01J!D1ission
the rule; however, suspension or withdrawal of the exemption as to the membersof any
of these exchanges may be effected on due notice if such action appears necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
The rule and
the amendmentbecame effective November9, 1944.
Amendmentsto Registr~tion

Farms

On April 9, 1945 the Commissionadopted several amendmentsto Form 3-M, one of
the forms on which applications are filed for broker-dealer registration
pursuant to
Section 15 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act, and an amendmentto Rule X-15B-2,
governing the filing of supplemental statements to such applications.

y

Before adoption of the new amendments, Form 3-Mhad required a disclosure of
certain relevant information concerning partners, officers, directors and branch office managers, including their buadness histories.
The effect of the new amendments
is to require similar information, under specific circumstances, with respect to
salesmen and other emplOYees.
Section 15 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act requires the Commissionto de~
or revoke the registration
of any broker or dealer if it finds (1) that such action
is in the public interest and !2) that such broker or dealer or any partner, officer, director, branch office manager, or any person controlling or controlled by
such broker or dealer, has been convicted within ten years of any felony or misdemeanor involving the purchase or sale of securities or arising out of the business
of a broker or dealer, or is enjoined from engaging in or continuing any acts or
practices involving the purchase or sale of securities,. or has wilfully violated any
provision of the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or
any rule thereunder.

him within the meaning of Section 15 (b), and the Commission has held that nen

The new disclosures, insofar as they relate to past business histories of salesmen and other employees, are designed both to give investors the benefit of such
disclosure and to facilitate enforcement of Section 15 (b). In announcing the rule
the Commission made it clear that the adoption of the new disclosure requirement does
not mark any departure from the Commission's policy of permitting persons who have
been convicted or enjoined, or are otherwise disqualified from registration as brokers
and dealers, to act as salesmen for other registered brokers and dealers under ap.
propriate safeguards and proper supervision. The Commission further stated that it
would continue to act on a case-by-case basis as it has in the past in determining
whether denial or revocation of registration of a broker or dealer who retains such
an employee would be in the public interest.

In those cases in which it does not appear necessary in the public interest to
require registrants to disclose publicly any part of the business record of a salesman or other employee, consideration of confidential treatment under appropriate
application will be given.
The anendmerrt to Rule X-15B-2 adds to the requirement that every registered
broker and dealer must keep current the information furnished in his application the
new requirement that, within ninety days after the effective date of any amendment
to Form 3-M which requires additional information, each registrant shall report such
additional information as a supplement to his application.
SUPERVISION OF NASD ACTIVITY
The NASD (National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.) continued to be the
only association registered with the Commission under Section 15A as a national
securities association. As of June 30, 1945 membership in the NASD stood at about
2,290, a gain of approximately 100 members during the year.
Disciplinary Proceedings
The NASD, in the year eIrling June 30, 1945, reported to the Commission final
action on 21 disciplinary cases against members. The decisions included: dismissal
or withdrawal of the complaint in 6 cases; acceptance of a statement pledging future
observance and compliance in 1 instance; penalty of censure in 3 cases; the imposition of fines in 9 instances, ranging from $50 to $500; and 2 expulsions. Of six
cases which the Commission referred to the NASD during the fiscal year, 3 had been
disposed of and 3 were still pending at the year-end;
Appeals to the Commission from NASD Disciplinary Action
On July 5, 1944 an NASD member appealed to the Commission for a review of a oneyear suspension imposed by the NASD. During the fiscal year hearings we'e held before
a trial examiner and oral argument was held before the Commission. At the year-end

Denial_of Membership
On November 1, 1944 the Commission after appropriate notice and hearing, denied
the application of J. A. Sisto & Co. for an order approving or directing its admission to the NASD. 31 A similar application for approval or direction had been denied
the same petitioner by the Commission on July 1, 1940. In its reconsideration, which
involved a review of the original application and of petitioner's conduct in the
intervening period, the Commission held that he b~d failed to establish any basis
which would warrant a change in the previous order.

The 5 Percent Mark-up Policy
On October 25, 1943 the Board of Governors of the NASD issued an interpretation
of Article III, Section 1, of the Rules of Fair Practice that:

"It shall be deemed conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles
of trade for a member to enter into any transaction with a customer in any
security at any price not reasonably related to the current market price of
the security. II l!
In connection with this action, the Board pointed out, for the guidance of members
and of the committees whose duty it is to enforce the rules, that of a large number
of transactions effected in 1943, 71 percent had been effected at a gross mark-up
over the current market of not over 5 percent.

The Commission was petitioned to set aside this action by the Board on the grounds
that the interpretation was in fact a rule and as such was a nullity since it had not
been s ubmi tted to the membership for approval as required by the NASD' s By-laws. Public hearings were held on the petitions. On November 25, 1944 the Commission

11 On

August 7, 1945 the Commission dismissed the review proceedings, finding that
the member had violated the Rules of Fair Practice designated and that his conduct was inconsistent l'Iithjust and equitable principles of trade. See Thomas
Arthur Stewart,

(1945), Securities Exchange Act Release No. 3720.

3/ A

controlling partner of the petitioner had been expelled from and by the New York
Stock Exchange on a finding that he had acted inconsistently with just and equitable principles of trade. That expulsion, by virtue of Section 15A (b) (4) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and of Article I, Section 2 of the By-laws of
the NASD, operates as a barrier to NASD membership on the part of any firm with
which such person is connected, unless the Commission finds it appropriate in the
public interest to approve or direct to the contrary. In denying the original
application the Commission held, on an independent review of the record of the
action by th~ Exchange and other evidence, that it was unable to find it appropriate
in the public interest to approve or direct the admission of the firm to membership
in the N!SD. See J. A. Sisto & Co., 7 S.E.C. 647, 1102 (1940).

The PSI Case
In a decision announced on June 11, 1945, 2/ the Commission, one Commissioner
concurring and one dissenting, held that the NASDcould not discipline its members
for failure to comply with the terms of price-maintenance provisions contained in
contracts used in the underwriting and distribution
of securities.

The result of the decision was to set aside fines levied by the NASDagainst
six of its memberswho, in the distribution
in late 1939 and early 1940 of
$38,000,000 First Mortgage Bonds issued by Public Service Companyof Indiana (PSI),
failed to comply with minimumprice and maximumdiscount provisions contained in
the syndicate agreements.
The under~Titers of the issue and the dealers in the selling group, all members
of the NASD,had entered into agreements which provided that the bonds were to be
sold to the public at 102 percent of principal amount and which allowed concessions
of not more than 2 percent to underwriters, 1 percent to dealers, and 1/4 of 1 percent to non-participating
NASD
members. In the course of the offering numerous sales
were made at less than the specified amounts and complaints were filed by the NASD
against over 100 undemriters and dealers on the allegation that these off-price
transactions were in violation of the NASD
rule providing that "a memberin the conduct of his business shall observe high standards of commercial honor and just and
equitable principles of trade.n
After hearings before various committees of the NASD,the Board of Governors
imposed fines of from $50 to $500 against 70 memberswho were found to have violated
the rule.
The Commissionthereupon called up for review six of the cases regarded
as typical of the various fact situations involved.
The anonymity of these six
memberswas preserved in the Commission's proceedings.
The decision involved a review of the practices followed in the distribution
of
securities,
particularly
price-maintenance agreements. While the proceedings before
the Commissionwere in progress, the Department of Justice intervened and argued
that the price-fixing
provisions of ~dicate
agreements violated the ShermanAct.
The legality of these agreements waS defended by the NASD.
The Commission's main opinion held that the pr ovisions of Section 15A (b) (7)
of the Securities Exchange Act specifically
limited the scope of the NASD'srules
so that they could not be used as a means of requiring membersto adhere to pricemaintenance contracts and that, consequently, the NASDcould not discipline its
membersunder the rules for failure to maintain the prd.ce" of the bonds during

Chairman Purcell and Commissioner Pike, while not deciding the point, expressed views to the effect that the price-maintenance contracts in question did
~ot violate the Sherman Act. Commissioner Healy expressed similar views and stated
he thought a deed sf.on en this queatd.on was necessary to a proper disposition of the
casco Commissioner McCo~~lghey agreed that the disciplinary actions co~ld not be
allowed to stand but expressed no view on the antitrust question, stating that it
was unnecessary to do so in deciding the case presented.
In his dissenting opinion, Commissioner Healy contended that the NASD was correct insofar as it held that an unexcused breach of the price-maintenance contract
involved was conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade, and
that there was nothing in Section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act which precluded
this interpretation. However, he disagreed wi~h the NASD's conclusion in three of
the six cases that the syndicate agreements had been breached, and in a fourth case
found that the dealer had been forced to sell by his bank and was thus not guilty
of conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade. He concluded
that the fines should be set aside in four cases and allowed to stand in two.

LITIGATION UNDER THE ACT

charged the defendants, inter alia, with failing to reveal to customers that it was
doing business While insolvent; wrongful hypothecation of customers' securities;
making purchases and sales at prices bearing no reasonable relationship to the prevailing market prices, withollt.disclosing to customers the prevailing market prices;
and making various false representations. To insure the reimbursem8nt of defrauded

- 33 Civil Ac~ions Instituted by the Commission
During the past year the need for more drastic action in dealing with violations
of Rule X-IOB-5 led the Commission to invoke the aid of the courts to protect sellers
of securities from misrepresen~~tion and nondisclosure of material facts by prospe~tive purchasers. The usual pattern of such cases involved the attempt by management
of an issuer to purchase its securities from investors without disclosin~ pertinent
information regarding the compa.ry ' s financial condition.
In S.E.Co v. H. P. 1~ueller, et al., 1/ the president and controlling stockholder of the corporation so~:h'~to purchase its common stock from investors at $2
per share. In making the offer he failed to disclose that the net current asset
coverage per share was in excess of $16, that the net earnings per share for the previous year had been $4 and that during the two-month period immediately preceding
the offer the corporation's sales had increased 70 percent. He also failed to disclose that the cUrrent over-the-counter price of the stock was between $7 and $10
per share and that he had refused to sell his controlling block of stock at less than
its book value of $40 per share. Information contained in an annual report which
accompanied the offer was inadequate to enable investors properly to determine the
value of their stock. After the Commission filed its complaint alleging violation
of the Act and Rule X-IOB-5, the defendants, by stipulation, consented to an injunction permanently restraining them from effectuating the transaction without disclosure of all material facts necessary in order to make the statements made, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

A similar but perhaps more subtle device attempted by the controlling CODh1l0n
stockholders of Oils and Industries, Inc., a registered investment company, took
the form of the proposed exchange of certain of the company's portfolio securities
having a market value of approximately $4.50 per share for its outstanding preferred
stock on a share for share basis. y Two officers and directors of Oils and Industries who controlled more than 50 percent of its common stock caused the company to
propose the exchange with a view to retirement of the preferred stock thus repurchased. In making the offer preferred stockholders were not informed that their
shares, which had a liquidating value of $12.50 per share, then had an asset coverage
of $17 and a redemption value of $13.50 per share. The company also failed to point
out that retirement of the preferred would cause an increase in the asset value of
"he common and that if all the preferred were thus retired, the value of the common
stock would increase approximately $5 per share. Upon the filing of a complaint by
the Commission seeking an injunction the defendants, by stipulation, agreed to
rescission of the proposal and the return of all preferred stock tendered for
exchange.

In S.E.C v , L. A. Y

authority under Section

with Section 16 (a) of the Act. In the same action, also for the first time, the
Commission enjoined controlling persons from violating Section 20 (c) of the Act.
In that case Young, his wife and a corporation controlled by Young, each had owned
more than 10 percent of the OUtstanding common stock of the L. A. Young Spring &
Wire Corporation, which was registered on both the New York and.Detroit Stock Exchanges. All three disposed of their holdings but failed to file the reports,

action.
In SoE.C v. Samuel akin, 11 the Commission for the first time sought and obtained an injunction Which restrained the use of proxies obtained by akin in violation of Section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Regulation X-14

akin's sole purpose in obtaining proxies was to elect himself a director of Electric

Okin's proxies represented such a small fraction of the voting shares that his votes
could not have effected his election and adjournment of the stockholders' meeting
would have caused undue hardship to the corporation and the majority of its stockholders. The corporation was not in any way responsible for solicitation of proxies
by akin. The court,hawever, in its opinion 5/, expressed concern at the disen'ranchisement of those common stockholders who had given proxies to akin and suggested that they be given an opportunity to exercise the right to vote their stock.

PART III
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE PUBLIC

JTILITY

HOLDING

CO~FANY

ACT OF 1935

The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 deals with holding companies having subsidiaries which are electric utility companies, or which are engaged in the
retail distribution of natural or manufactured gas. The Act was passed for the express purpose of eliminating certain evils and abuses which the Congress had found
to exist in connection with the activities of such companies, and was intended for
the protection of both investors and consumers. It provides for the registration of
holding companies (Sec. 5); regulation of security transactions of holding companies
and their subsidiaries (Sees. 6 and 7); regulation of acquisitions of securities and
utility assets by holding companies and their subsidiaries (Sees. 9 and 10); the
regulation of payment of dividends, solicitation of proxies, intercompany loans and
other intra-S"'Jstemtransactions (Sec. 12); the control of service, sales, and construction oontracts (Sec. 13); and the control of accounting practices (Seco 15)0
The key provisions of the Act, however, are contained in Section 11, which requires
the limitation of holding company systems to an integrated system or systems and
related other businesses and the corporate simplification and eqlitable distribution
of voting power of companies in holding company systems
0

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITOO
The principal regulatory activities of the Commission under this Act in the
past fiscal year continued to center around the administration of Section 11 and
the disposition of applications designed to give effect to the Commission1s orders
under that section. In addition, an important segment of the Commission's work related to passing upon applications and declarations under Sections 6 and 7 of the
Act for the issuance of securities, mainly by the subsidiaries of registered holding companies, in the aggregate amount of $1,308,642,000.
As of June 30, 1945, there were registered under the Act 54 public utility
holding company systems, the aggregate consolidated assets of which amounted to approximately $16,200,000,0000 These systems include 118 registered holding companies
and 943 electric, gas and non-utility subsidiary companieso
Further significant progress was made during the past fiscal year in effectuating the requirements of Section 11 relating to integration, corporate simplification,
and reor-ganfaataon,
At June 30, 1945, integration or simplification proceedings had
been instituted by the Commission in regard to practically all of the holding company sys'bems, Integration orders outstanding on June 30, 1945 require the divestment
of holding companies' nonretainable interests in 147 subsidiary compa...nies,
having
aggregate assets of $4,352,000,0000 11 This figure is exclusive of divestments
already effected, as listed in Appendix Table 20 and discussed later in this section.
Similarly, prior to the end of the past fiscal year the Commission had issued 46
orders involving simplification of corporate structures and equitable redistribution
of voting power and there were 47 such proceedings pending in various stages of
completion
0

In the year ended June 30, 1945 the Commission instituted 7 new proceedings to
require public utility holding comparri.es to comply with Section 110 A classification of the proceedings instituted by the Commission under Section 11 (b) (1)
LIntegratio!y and Section 11 (b) (2) [Corporate simplificatio!y which were pending
at the close of the fiscal year is as follows:

Under Section 11 (e) of the Act, the Commission is authorized to approve
voluntary plans of reorganization submitted by registered holding companies and
their subsidiaries, and to seek court er..forcementof such plans if they are necessary or appropriate to effectuate the geographic and corporate simplification requtr-ement s and are fair and equitable to the persons affected. :Many such plans for
complete or partial compliance with Section 11 have been approved by the Commission
and have been or are being consummated. Others have been filed and are currently
being considered by the Commission. Up to June 30, 1945, a total of 146 plans had
been filed with the Commission under Section 11 (e). The Commission approved 56
of these plans, frequently after securing necessary modifications; 23 were withdrawn
or dismissed; 3 1rere denied; and 64 were pending before the Commission in various
stages of completion. As stated in the Commission's Tenth Annual Report, the filing, approval, and consunnna.tionof these plans represent major achievements in the
financial and operating reorganization of the utility industry.
The Commission's experience in enforcing the Act shows that compliance with
Section 11 (b) does not mean dumping or forced sale of securities on the markets.
On the contrary, it is now clear that the favorable market reception of the portfolio utility stocks that have been sold has been an important factor in strengthening the market for utility equities. Moreover, in addition to sales, there have
been other methods of compliance, such as exchanges of underlying portfolio securities for holding company securities, the issuance of subscription warrants to purchase portfolio securities, the distribution of portfolio stocks as dividends, and
exchanges of securities of soundly reorganized compro!ies for the old securities.
A factor of importance in facilitating the divestment of nonretainable properties and the reorganization of holding company systems has been the growing
confidence of investors in the stability of operating utility common stock earnings,
resulting in part from the more conservative capital structures of the operating
companies. This has been reflected in the strong investment demand for portfolio
utility common stocks which have been sold by holding companies in complying with
Section 11 of the Holding Company Act. The supply of operating utility equities
available for investors is still limited, although it is increasing steadily as the
holding companies consummate their Section 11 programs. For many months the market
for utility common stocks has been active and has been advancing. The current
dividend yield on the common stock of most electric utilities at prevailing prices
in the fall of 1945 was less than 5 percent. Since many of the holding companies
have senior securities bearing interest or dividend rates of more than 5 percent,
they have a net advantage in retiring their high-co~t senior securities through the
sale of portfolio securities at prevailing prices.
During the past fiscal Y8ar registered holding companies disposed of their nonretainable interests in 86 electric, [as, and other subsidiary companies, with total

- 37 -

11

assets of approximately $575,000,000.
This includes 40 electric utility
companies, with assets o:f $384,000,000; 21 gas utility
companies, with assets of
$112,000,000; and 15 other companies, with assets o:f $79,000,000. In addition, 17
companies sold a part o:f their assets in the total amount of $33,000,000. Ths :following table, which was prepared from the detailed data contained in Appendix Table
20, gives a summaryo:f the total divestment program from December1, 1935 to June

Totals

More than half the properties which were sold to municipalities
and other public authorities
had total assets of less than a million dollars each. The largest
companythat was sold to a public authority was the Tennessee Electric Power Company with groBS book assets of $110,000,000.
Strictly
speaking, the sale of this
companyto the Tennessee Valley Authority,.in
1939, was not a Section 11 divestment
but was the culmination of a long period of negotiation for the purchase of this
and other properties in the Tennessee valley Authority area by the T.V.A. and its
wholesale distributors.
The sale, therefore,
liaS not effected
pursuant to a Section
11 order, nor in contemplation of the provisions of Section Tl., A similar statement may apply to certain other divestments where the decision to sell was reached
independently of Section 11 requirements.

In the Report of the COJlIIIIittee
on Progress in the Regulation of Public Utilities,
Proceedings of the National Association of Railroad and Utilities
Commissioners,
1945, the following statement was made concerning the trend to public ownershipl
"Wehave attempted to determine if there is any iJnportant trend toward public
ownership of utility
property, and almost without exception we find that the commissions do not feel that there is any substantial
change in this direction.~

- 39 Section 11 (b) (2) proceedings with respect to Bond and Share and certain of
In its Findings and Opinion of
its subsidiaries
were commencedon Yay 9, 1940.
August 23, 1941,
the Commissionordered National to dissolve since it served no
useful function and constituted an undue and unnecessary complexity in the system.
National's debt and preferred stock have been retired and its only outstanding
security is now commonstock.
Its principal remaining assets are the commonstocks
of BirminghamElectric Company,Carolina Power and Light Companyand Pennsylvania
Power and Light Compa.IJY".
National proposed in plans filed with the Commission
to
distribute
these stocks to its own commonstockholders, together with its holdings
in two minor subsidiaries.
The Commissionindicated to National that, prior to
distribution
or any other disposition of its holdings in its subsidiaries,
the accounts and corporate structures of such subsidiaries
should be conformed to the requirements of the Act with respect to distribution
of voting power and other
mattezos. y Plans to this end were filed by National and approved by this Commission with respect to Carolina Power and Light,
BirminghamElectric Company, 6/
and Pennsylvania Power and Light Company.
It may be noted that in each of these
cases, the State commission either alone or in conjunction with the Federal Power
Commission, ordered the elimination of certain write-ups (Account 107) and the
Freelimination or amortization of acquisition adjustment i tams (Account 100.5).
quently in such cases, the accounting and structural
reorganization of operating
utility
subsidiaries
of holding companies under the Holding CompanyAct is accompanied by or based upon accounting orders of the State commission, and frequently
also of the Federal Power Commission.

States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari,
which was granted on May 28, 19450
Arguments were concluded on Kovember16, 1945 but no decision has been rendered by
the court.

11 (b) of the Act, including therein a plan for the disposition of its interest
in American Gas. (Holding CompanyAct Release No. 5970).
On OCtober 10, 1945, the Ccmmrl.ssion

-42On October 26, 1944 American Foreign filed a plan of reorganization
under Section 11 (e) of the Act which was joined in by Bond and Share. Proceedings on the
plan were consolidated by the Commissionwith the proceedings directed to Bond am
Share and American Foreign under Section 11 (b) (2) of the Act.
Hearings on the
consolidated proceedings have been held and the matter is pending.

11

Proceedings pursuant to Section 11 (b) (1) directed to American Gas were instituted December 1, 1939. Proceedings on an application previously filed by
American Gas, requesting approval of the continuance of its Central System together
with continuance of alleged South Jersey and Northeast Pennsylvania systems, were
consolidated therewith.
Hearings were held from time to time in such consolidated
proceedings.
On February 6, 1945 this Commission issued its Statement of Tentative
Conclusions with respect to the properties of American Gas subsidiaries.
The
Commission tentatively
concluded that properties comprising the Central System could
be retained under commoncontrol under the standards of Section II (b) (1) of the
Act but that other properties must be divested if such Central System was to be retained.
Hearings to consider mether such tentative conclusions should be adopted
as the final conclusions of the Commissionhave been held and the decision was

Opinion and Order in
earlier tentative
con-

- 43 North American has continued its policy of p~ing commonstock dividends in
the stock of its subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and in addition has
sold 700,000 shares of Pacific commonstock in a public offering.
The cash so
realized and conserved has been used to retire North American's entire issue of
6% Series preferred stock aggregating $30,317,950, and to reduce its debt obligations.
North American sold its Pacific Gas stock on a 5.13 percent basis (on resale the yield was 5 percent) and used the proceeds to retire preferred stock on
which the dividend rate was 6 percent.
As a result of its disposition of holdings
in the Pacific Gas and Electric Company,the latter
companyhas been declared not to
be a statutory subsidiary in the North American system. On May4, 1945, the Commission approved a voluntary plan filed under Section 11 (e) for the simplification
of
the corporate structure of Union Electric Companyof Missouri,
subholding company
of North American, 1VherebytlVOof Union's subsidiaries were eliminated.

Y

On December30, 1941, the Commissionordered the dissolution
of North American
Light & Power Company,
a subsidiary of the North American Company,finding that
it constituted an undue and unnecessary complexity in the system and served no useful purpose. However, the determination of a fair and equitable plan of dissolution has been delayed pending the disposition of claims asserted by illinois
Power
Compa~, an indirect subsidiary of tight and Power. Ertensive hearings have been
held with respect to these clai:IDsbut have not yet been completed. Meanwhile,
Light & Power has retired $3,376,500 principal amount of its publicly held debentures without the payment of redemption premiums. This action was approved by the
Commissionand was appealed by the trustees under the indenture securing such debentures to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit Which
upheld the Commission

March 4, 1940. The United Gas ImprovementCompany(UGr) subsequently requested the
Commissionto state its views, whereupon the Commissionissued its tentative conclusions with respect to this system and defined its integrated system as the electric properties in the Permsylvania-Delaware-Maryland area.
Orders of divestment
were issued
on July 30, 1941 and May7, 1942 on the basis of this interpretation.

-44After argument before the court but prior to the issuance of its decision', UGI
and its subsidiary, Philadelphia Electric Company, filed voluntary plans under Section 11 (e) with a view to complying at least partially with the provisions of Section 11 (b). Briefly, the plan provided for the distribution to UGI stockholders
of $30,600,000 in cash and substantially all the stock holdings in two of its
subsidiaries, Philadelphia Electric Company and Public Service Corporation of New
Jersey. The plan was approved by the Commission on March 18, 1943 1/ and by the
common stockholders on April 19, 1943. In May 1944, UGI distributed to its stockholders its holdings of Delaware Power & Light Company and subsidiaries. During the
past fiscal year, UGr has disposed of its interests in three additional companies,
namely, Nashville Gas &' Heating Company, y Arizona Power Corporation V and
Manchester Gas Company.41 Subsequent to the close of the fiscal Year, UGI filed
another voluntary plan 51 under Section 11 (e), designed to effect further compliance with the requirements of Section 11. This plan provides for the voluntary
exchange of certain miscellaneous investments in public utility holding companies
having a present market value of approximately $25,000,000 for shares of UGI common stock. No decision has as yet been rendered by the Commission with respect to
this plan.

4. The Commonwealth & Southern Corporation
On March 6, 1940, Section 11 (b) (1) proceedings were begun with respect to
this system and on April 8, 1941 Section 11 (b) (2) proceedings were instituted and
consolidated with the former proceedings. In its order of April 9, 1942, Y the
Commission directed Commonwealth & Southern Corporation (Commonwealth) to reduce its
then outstanding preferred and common stock to a single class of new common stock.
The order was appealed by the company to the Cireuit Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit which affirmed the Commission's order on March 31, 1943. 7.1
On April 20, 1943, Commonwealth filed a plan of recapitalization providing for
the reclassification of its stock into a new class of common stock and a distribution of its holdings of all the common stock of Consumers Power Company to stockholders of Commonwealth. On February 26, 1944, the company filed an amended plan
proposing a change in the allocation between its preferred and common stockholders
and fUrther proposing the distribution of its stock holdings in its other Northern
subsidiaries in addition to Consumers Power Company.

Hearings on the amended plan were concluded on March 27, 1944 and the staff
filed its proposed findings on May 29, 1944 approving the basic features of the
amended plan but recommending that certain further amendments be made. Briefs were
filed and oral argument held on the issues involved by various stockholders participating in the proceedings. On May 31, 1945, the Commission issued its Findings and

which stated that if the plan were amended in several respects, the Commission would approve ito Connnonwealth filed the amendments requested and thereupon
the Commission on June 30, 1945 issued its order 31 approving the amended plan.
Among the provisions of this amended plan was one requiring that the plan receive
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of each class of stock of Commonwealth at a special meeting, before the Commission applied to an appropriate federal
district court for an order approving and enforcing the plan. A period of several
months thereafter elapsed without arrangements having been completed for conducting
the vote contemplated in the plan. No vote having been taken, the Commission> by
order dated November 1, 1945, 3/ modified its previous order so as to approve the
plan on condition that the comnany delete that portion of the plan requiring a stockholders vote. On November 9, 1945, Commonwealth filed modifications of its plan
stating that it would eliminate the provision for a stockholders vote if the Commission would approve an extensive amendment of the plan which essentially altered
it.

y

The Commission, in all these orders, has retained jurisdict~on to determine the
retainability of Commonwaal.th t s remaining subsidiaries and any of the utility operations and other businesses of the system under Section 11 (b) (1).
Commonwealth has continued to refinance and recast the security structure of
its utility subsidiaries and in the process has materially impro'Ved their financial
condition.
5. Cities Service Compagl
On May 5, 1944, the Commission issued its order in the Section 11 (b) (1) proceeding involving Cities Service Company (Cities), the top company in this system. ~
The order directed Cities to comply with Section 11 (b) (1) by reducing the operations of its system to certain gas distribution properties located in the MidContinent section, together with certain gas production and transmission properties.
The order, however, permitted the retention of the system1s nonutility properties
if Cities should choose to ccmply with Section 11 (b) (1) by disposing of all its
direct or indirect interests in utility companies. Cities elected to retain its
nonutility properties, whereupon the Commission, on October 12, 1944, entered a supplemental order
providing, in substance, that Cities might dispose of its interests in utility properties in lieu of complying with the provisions of the

- modifications of the plan did not have sufficient merit to warrant scheduling of
hearings thereon in view of their highly complicated and confusing nature, aside
from difficult questions of fairness. The Commission indicated that further
proceedings in this case would be withheld for a period of 30 days in order to
afford an opportunity to Commonwealth and to any person having a bona fide interest in the reorganization to file a plan for compliance with the Commission's
order of April 9, 1942 based upon the principle of retiring the preferred stock

subsidiaries l! and has consummated a program effectu~ting various intercorporate
transfers preparatory to a divestment of its interest in Cities Service Power &
Light Company.
The order of May 5, 1944 also directed Arkansas Natural Gas Corporation, a subsidiary holding company of Cities, to confine its operations to the natural gas
business and dispose of its interest in its nonutility subsidiaries. Arkansas
Natural Gas Corporation appealed the order of the Commission to the U. S. Circuit
Court for the Fifth Circuit, which court had arguments on the case but has not yet
rendered a decision.
On August 17, 1943, the Commission ordered 31 Cities Service Power & Light
Company (Power & Light), a holding company subsidiary of Cities Service Company, to
dispose of its interest in 43 companies, including Federal Light & Traction 'Company
(Federal) and its 14 subsidiaries. Since this order was issued, Power & Light, as
indicated above, has disposed of its interests in 30 companies. The order of August
17, 1943 required that Federal confine its operations to the electric utility business conducted by subsidiaries in the States of New Mexico and Colorado, jurisdiction
being reserved with respect to certain properties in New Mexico and Arizona. On
March 30, 1944, Y the Commission granted Federal an option to retain as its utility
system either the properties in New Mexico and Colorado or in Arizona. Federal applied for a year t s extension to comply with the Oommi.ss.tont s order of March 30, 1944,
which was granted, and Federal1s option to elect to retain one of the two integrated
systems was continued until March 30, 1946.

Associated Gas and Electric Company

In 1940, Associated Gas and Electric Company (Ageco) and its subsidiary holding
company, Associat6d Gas and Electric Corporation (Agecorp), filed petitions in the
U. S. District Court for reorganization under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act. Both
companies are registered holding companies. The Trustees of Agecorp (Denis J.
Driscoll and Willard L. Thorp) also registered as a holding company. On August 13,
1942, th3 Commission issued an order Y pursuant to Section 11 (b) (1) in which it
directed the trustees, among other things, to dispose of their interest in 115 companies, reserving for further consideration questions relating to the retainability
of certain other properties. At the end of the first year, the trustees reported
that they had disposed of their interest in 60 of these companies. During the next
succeeding year, disposition was made of an additional 22 companies and 14 others
were under contract for sale. Of the original 115 companies, the trustees retained,
as at the close of the fiscal year, an interest in only 16. On February 9, 1945,
upon application of the trustees, the Commission modified its order of August 13,
1942 by removing Manila Electric Company, its subsidiary, Associated utilities Investing Corporation (an inactive corporation which is the original obligor under the
mortgage on the bonds of Manila Electric Company), and Escudero Electric Service
Company from the list of companies required to be divested. Both Mam.La Electric
Company and Escudero Electric Service Company operate properties in the Philippine
Islands.

!I Of

these, 2 companies were direct subsidiaries and 30 companies were subsidiaries
of Cities Service Power & Light Company or of its subsidiary holding company:

-48On March 30, 1945, a plan of reorganization was filed by York Railways Company,
a debtor in possession under Section 778 of the Bankruptcy Act, in proceedings which
had been pending since November 30, 1937. 11 The plan provided for the raising of
sufficient cash to pay all public creditors and preferred stockholders the full
amount of their claims and for the liquidation of York Railways Company. Hearings
were held in May 1945 and the matter was pending at the end of the fiscal year. y
On September 30, 1941, the Commission instituted proceedings under Section 11
(b) (2) with respect to New England Gas and Electric Association (Negea), a registered holding company. After hearings were held but prior to the final order of the
Commission, the trustees of Ageco and Agecorp and a subsidiary company in the Associated system instituted proceedings in both a State and Federal Court asserting
claims against Negea arising from various transactions in the years 1930 and 1932.
It appeared to the Commission that before a determination could be made with respect
to the recapitalization of Negea, the validity and rank of the asserted claims would
have to be resolved. Therefore, on February 17, 1943, the Commission instituted
further proceedings with respect to these claims. 1/ On March 29, 1945, Negea filed
a plan ~ of recapitalization pursuant to the provisions of Section 11 (e). This
plan was based on the assumption that the aforementioned claims would be held not
valid. At the close of the fiscal year, the Commission had reached no decision with
respect to the claims but hearings were going forward in connection with the proposed plan on matters not related directly to the claims. 21

accordance with the views of the Commission. In August 1944, Standard Gas submitted
an amendedplan, which was approved by the Commissionon November15, 1944.

Y

On December20, 1944, the Commission, at the request of Standard Gas, applied
to the U. S. District Court for the District of Delaware for an order of enforcement
of the amendedplan.
On Mar-ch 2, 1945, the District
Court in an opinion stated that
the plan would not be approved as fair and equitable and appropriate to effectuate
compliance with the Act unless the note and debenture holders were paid off in cash,
although it would be approved as to stockholder participation.
The Commission,
Standard Gas, and several other parties to the proceedings, took an appeal from the
judgment of the District Court to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit.
After the end of the fiscal year, on September 14, 1945, the latter
Court rendered a decision reversing the judgment of the District Court and upholding
the opinion of the Commissionthat the amendedplan was fair and equitable to the
note and debenture holders.
Subsequently, Standard Gas filed a motion with the District Court requesting an
order of the court disapproving the amendedplan for recapitalization
as being unfair and inequitable because of changed conditions, and stating that it proposed to
borrow moneywith which, together with treasury cash, it would effectuate a call of
the notes and debentures and P8iYoff the bank notes then outstanding by the sale of
portfolio securities.
A decree of the U. S. District Court for the District of
Delaware, issued on December29, 1945 and amendedJanuary 9, 1946, held that
Standard Gas had the right to call the notes and debentures and provided that such
call should be madewithin thirty days or within such further time as the Securities
and Exchange Commissionmight grant.

stating that if an amendmentto the plan were made
in accordance with the views expressed therein, an appropriate order would be entered

the required amendmentwas filed.
The Commissionin a subsequent Memorandum

In 1942, the COIIIII1ission
instituted proceedings pursuant to Section 11 (b) (2)
with respect to Niagara HudsonPower Corporation (Niagara Hudson), Buffalo, Niagara
and Eastern Power Corporation (BNE), and their subsidiary companies. A public conference was also held to explore means of resumption of dividend p3jymentson preferred stock of the two holding companies. A plan, pursuant to Section 11 (e), was
filed in June 1943, providing for the consolidation of principal public utility

Federal Water and Gas Corporation

On December 31, 1942, proceedings were instituted by the Commission with respect to Federal Water and Gas Corporation (Federal) and its subsidiaries under
Section II (b) (1) and il (b) (:2). The Federal system at that time consisted of a
number of utility and non-utility companies conducting water, natural gas transmission and distribution, manufactured gas distribution, and electric operations in a
number of widely separated states. Federal's principal subsidiary was, and is,
Southern Natural Gas Company, a registered holding company controlling four gas
utility subsidiaries in Alabama and directly owning and operating a natural gas
pipeline extending from Texas into Georgia. On the same date, Federal and certain
of its subsidiaries filed a plan under Section 11 (e) which, among other things,
provided for the sale by Federal of its interests in Mississippi Public Service Company and Chattanooga Gas Company to Southern Natural, for the distribution of
Federal's interest in Southern Natural to Federal's stockholders, and for the
elimination of Federal as a separate corporation. The Commission reserved jurisdiction with respect to those provisions of the plan. The plan also provided for
the disposition by Federal of its interests in all its other subsidiary companies,
provided, however, that before disposing of its security holdings in Peoples water
and Gas Comparv, Scranton-Spring Brook Water Service Company and New York Water
Service Corporation, these companies be recapitalized. On February 10, 1943, the
Commission approved the latter provisions of Federal's plan and directed that steps
be taken to carry out those provisions. V In addition, Federal, Pennsylvania Water
Service Company, and ~cranton-Spring Brook were directed to cause the elimination of
Pennsylvania Water Service Company and the 63 inactive subsidiaries of ScrantonSpring Brook. Since the entry of the 1943 order, Federal has caused the elimination
of 62 inactive subsidiaries of Scranton-Spring Brook and has disposed of its interests in 15 companies and of the bulk of the properties of Alabama Water Service
Company. Extensive hearings have also been completed on Federal's plans for the
reorganization of Scranton-Spring Brook and New York Water, and these matters are
now pending before the Commission.

do not include outstanding issues whose rights were
altered under Sections 6 (a) (2) and 7 (e), nor do they include the
guarantee of other issues.

In the past year there was a continuance of the heavy refunding program that
has been in progress for the pastI ten years.
Because of the declining rate of interest, many companies which refunded their bonds several years ago were able to
effect further interest savings by a second refunding.
Tax:considerations facilitated this program since companies which were in the excess profits tax brackets
could reduce their excess profits taxable net income by the amount of unamortized
discount and expense and call premiums applicable to the refunded Lssue; In recent
months highest quality electric utility
bonds have been refunded at an effective
interest cost of between 2.69 percent and 2.75 percent.
Even the lowest bank
quality electric utility bonds are being consistent~
refunded on approximately
a 3.00 percent basis.

Y

At the beginning of tm fiscal year ended June 30, 1945, 43 applications and
declarations under Sections 6 and 7 were pending and 179 were .filed during the
year.
O.fthese, 124 were declared e.f.fective, 1 was withdrawn and 1 denied, leaving 96 pending at the close o.f the fiscal year.
O.f the 124 e.f.fective declarations
and applications,
93 pertained to security issuance, 30 to alteration
o.f rights
and 1 to assumption of liability.

- 61 An important development in the field of public utility
finance in the past
year has been the increasing number of preferred stock refinancing cases to take
advantage of the lower yields prevailing for preferred stocks.
As a result outstanding preferred stock issues bearing dividend rates of 5, 6 and 7 percent are
being refinanced on a 4 percen4 basis or lower. A variety of methods of refinancing preferred stocks has been used. In some cases the outstanding issue is called
at the contract redemption price and replaced by a new issue which, under the Holding CompanyAct, must be sold at competitive bidding.
A second method is a
direct exchange offer on a share for share basis without underwriting. 2/ Under
this method any stock not exchanged is retired at the call price from tile general
funds of the companyand without selling any of the unexchanged shares.
In cases of
this type it has been cus'tomary for the companyto fix the dividend rate on the new
stock high enough to make an even exchange on the basis of the call price of the
outstanding stock.
It is also the usual practice to engage the services of a securities dealer to assist the companyin carrying out the exchange plan and to manage
the dealer group organized to effect exchanges. A third'method, having some of the
characteristics
of each of the methods mentioned above, involves an exchange offer
and a sale of any unexchanged stock in a public offering through underwriters.
The
offering price and the choice of underwriters to solicit exchanges and underwrite
and sell the unexchanged stock are determined by competitive bidding. 3/ Still
There have been

further differences of detail with respect to such matters as premiums, cash differentials
and the like.
In its Findings and Opinion in a preferred stock refinancing case after the close of the fiscal year, the Commissioncommentedon the variety
of methods and problems presented in such cases as follows:

y

y

21

"Because of the large volume of preferred stock transactions which
have been proposed and the relative novelty of many of the problems presented, we have thought it appropriate to give reasonably wide latitude
to issuers in determining the precise form of their transactions,
so long
as no major difficulties
appeared under the standards of the Act. On the
basis of experience gathered through this policy we may well find it appropriate to limit more narrowly the methods of preferred refinancing to
be emplOYedin future-cases.
Thus our present decision and other decisions
relating to preferred stock refinancing in this period should not be taken
as establishing general precedents for the future. II
Further progress was made during the past fiscal year in strengthening the
financial structures of public utility
operating companies and their parent holding
companies. The manner in lfhich that has been accomplished in other years has been
3et forth in previous annual reports of the Commission(see, for example, the Tenth
Annual Report, pages 98-107).

- 62 Speaking generally, the improvement in public utility capital structures has
resulted from debt reduction, made either at the time a refunding took place, or,
where that was impracticable, by provision for the retirement of debt through sinking fund or serial debt retirement programs, from the elimination of write-ups,
from increased provision far depreciation both as to current accruals and reserves,
from improved mortgage indenture provisions, and from the inclusion in corporate
charters of improved protective provisions with respect to preferred stock. All
this has been accompanied bya subst~~tial decrease in the burden of interest on
funded debt and preferred stock dividend requirements.
Competitive Bidding
During the past fiscal year an additional $862,000,000 of securities were sold
at competitive bidding pursuant to Rule U-50, which prescribes public invitation of
sealed bids in connection with the sale of securities by registered public utility
holding companies and their subsidiaries. This brings to $1,856,000,000 the total
amount thus sold from May 7, 1941, the date on which the rule became effective, to
July 1, 1945. 11 The rule permits exemption from competitive bidding under specified
or appropriate circumstances. A number of such exemptions have been granted since
the rule was adopted.

COOPERATION BETWEEN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
AND STATE COMMISSIONS

It is the established policy of the Securities and Exchange Commission to
foster effective cooperation with the State commissions in all matters where their
respective jurisdictions complement each other ani in all additional matters where
such cooperation is desirable and appropriate in the case under consideration. The
purpose of the Holding Company Act is, in large part, to free operating companies
from the absentee control of holding companies, thus permitting them to be regulated
more effectively by the State. This fundamental purpose of the Holding Company Act
--the facilitating of State regulation--underlies the Commission's efforts to work
cooperatively with the various State commissions in the administration of the Act.
A program of cooperation on a two-way basis is greatly to be desired in the interest
of effective regulation and a mutual understanding of the respective regulatory
duties and responsibilities.
The protection of State regulation is specifically provided for in several
sections of the Act. For example, Section 6 (b) of the Act directs the Commission
to exempt from the requirements of Section 7 an issue and sale of securities which
has been expressly authorized by a State commission of the State in which the issuer
is both organized and doing business and where the securities are solely for the
purpose of financing the business of the issuer. These provisions limit the Commission's powers over security issues where a State commission has full authority
over the subject matter and where the other conditions for exemption are met. In
granting a Section 6 (b) exemption, however, the Commission is empowered to impose
such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors and consumers. The Commission usually consults with the
State cOlllDlission
with regard to the imposition of terms and conditions in Section
6 (b) cases. Certain security and utility asset acquisitions are likewise exempted
under Section 9 (b) from the provisions of Section 9 where they have been approved

11 For

details relating to the bids received :for each issue sold under Rule U-50 to
December 31, 1944, see table beginning at page 21 in the report of the Commission's Public Utilities Division entitled ~Security Issues of Electric and Gas
utilities, 1935 -
 1944."

- 63 by a State commission. Moreover, the Connnissionmay not authorize security issues
LSection 7 (g27 or the acquisition of assets /Section 10 (f27 unless applicable
State laws have been complied with. Section 8 prevents the o~mership of both electric and gas utility
properties in violation of State law, while Section 20 (b) requires that accounting standards established by the Commissionshall not be inconsistent with the provisions of applicable State law.
A number of specific sections of the Act reflect the Congressional intent that
the Commission's work should be coordinated with the work of State commissions.
Section 19 of the Act, for example, expressly provides that in any proceeding before
the Commission, the Commission, in accordance with such rules of practice as it may
prescribe, shall admit as a party any interested State, State commission, municipalitY" or any political
subdivision of the State.
Pursuant to this provision, the
CommissionunifaMmlynotifies interested State commissions of proceedings before it
1Vhichma:y affect the work of such commission. Many State commissions have taken
advantage of this provision and have intervened in proceedings before the Commission
and in these and other cases there has been an interchange of ideas and information
between the Securities and Exchange Commissionand the State commission concerned.
The Act contains other provisions which look toward action by the S.E.C. and
state commissions on a cooperative basis.
~s
Section 18 of the Act not only
authorizes the S.E.C. to make available to State commissions information obtained in
the course of its investigations under the Act ,LSection 18 (a)], but also makes
provision for~lacing
the investigatory power of the S.E.C. at the disposal of State
commissions LSection 18 (b)].
Further, the provisions of Section 13 of the Act, with
respect to the regulation by the S.E.C. of intrasystem service charges affords
significant assistance to state commissions in this field.
Section 13 (d) empowers
the Commission,upon the request of a state commission, to require, after notice
and opportunity for hearing, the revision or elimination of inequitable servicing
arrangements amongmembercompanies of a mutual service company. Section 13 (g)
and make
of the Act, which authorizes
the Commissionto conduct investigations
recommendationswith respect to service sales and construction contracts, directs
that such recommendations be made available to State commissions.
There are listed below some of the specific instances during the past year in
which there have been interchanges of ideas between the S.E.C. and State commissions
or membersof their respective staffs:

Proceedings under Sect~on 11 (e)
During the past fiscal year court decisions involving voluntary plans filed by
companies under Section II (e) of the Act have been of far-reaching
importance in
the determination of the relative rights of interested
security holderso
a.

Liquidation

preferences

and call

premiums

In the United Light & Power Companycase the Supreme Court for the .first time
had before it the question whether the nfair and equitable" standard of Section 11
(e) requires the Commission to treat a preferred stockholder's
liquidation
preference a~ though it ~re a claim matured by operation of Section llo 3/ The
majority opinion of the Supreme Court upheld the Commission's decision 4;-that a
preferred stockholder's
rights must be measured on a going-basis without regard to
the impact o.f Section 11, giving proper emphasis to immediately operative rights
(rights to current dividende) as against inchoate rights (liquidation
pre.ference~),

In other Section 11 (e) plans providing for the retirement of senior secur-Lt.Lee ,
the Lseue presented was whether voluntary call premiums are necelSsarily payable as
such in connection with retirement of senior securities.
The Commissionhas repeatedly held that the retirement of a senior :5ecurity compelled by the requirements

Discharge of debt securities

by payment in kind

In the case of a Section 11 (e) plan providng for the satisfaction
of a portion
of the claims of holding companydebenture holders with portfolio common:5tocks
ovmedby the applicant holding company, the U. S. District Court refused to enforce
the plan on the ground that there is no power under the Holding CompanyAct to require creditors of a solvent corporation to take eecur-Ltd.es in satisfaction
of their
claims and on the further ground that no such plan could be fair and equitable.
On appeal., the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.
The Circuit
Court held that the Holding CompanyAct permits a plan for satisfaction
of the
claims of a holding companycreditor with securities,
and further held that the
situation was
question whether such power.ought to be exercised in a particular
essentia1J..y for the Commission1s determination.

Fees and expenses

The Commissionhas held that its approval, of plans of reorganization and recapitalization
filed UIrler Section II (e), not providing for the payments of fees
and expenses incurred in connection with such proceedings, will be expressly conditioned upon an applicant companyundertaking to pay such fees and expenses as
are approved, allocated or awarded by the Commission. The only instance involving
litigation
in the matter of fees and expenses occurred in the Columbia Gas &
nectric
Corporation case where four applicants who opposed the plan filed by the
companyand whose requests for fees and expenses were disallowed by the Commission,
made motions to resubmit the disallowances to the Federal District Court of
Delaware. The court denied the motions to resubmit.

PART IV
PARTICIPATION
OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS
UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT, AS AMENDED
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended in 1938, affords appropriate machinerJ for the reorganization of corporations (other than railroads) in the Federal
courts. The Commission's duties under Chapter X are, first, at the request or with
the approval of the court to act as a participant in proceedings thereunder in order
to provide, for the court and investors, independent expert assistance on matters
arising in such proceedings, and, second, to prepare, for the benefit of the courts
and investors, formal advisory reports on plans of reorg~~ization submitted to it
by the courts in such proceedings. The ColJllllission
has no right of appeal in a:rrj
such proceeding, although it may participate in appeals taken by others.

PART V
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE TRUST

INDENTURE

ACT OF 1939

The standards of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 outlawed many provisions previously incorporated in trust indentures to exculpate the trustee. The Act is
designed to insure that the trustee will act in the interest of the bond or debenture owners and to insure his complete independence of the issuer and the underwriters. To secure its objects, the Act requires that bonds, notes, debentures, and
similar debt securities publicly offered for sale, sold, or delivered after sale
through the mails or in interstate commerce, except as specifically exempted by the
Act, be issued under an indenture which meets the requirements of the Act ~~d has
been duly qualified with the Commission. The provisions of the Securities Act of
1933 and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 are so integrated that registration pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 of such securities to be issued under a trust
indenture shall not be permitted to become effective unless the indenture conforms
to the requirements expressed in the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and such an
indenture is automatically "qualified" when registration becomes effective as to
the securities themselves. An application for qualification of an indenture covering securities not required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
which is filed with the Commission under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, must
expressly meet the same statutory requirements as though such application were a
registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933.
STATISTICS OF INDENTURES QUALIFIED
The number of indentures filed with the Commission during the year for
cation under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, together with the disposition
and the amounts of indenture securities involved, are shown in Tables I, II
below. It will be noted that Table III merely consolidates the figures set

PART VI
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE INVESTMENT

COMPANY ACT OF 1940

The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires the registration of and regulates
investment companies, that is, companies engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, and trading in securities. The Act requires, among other
things, disclosure of the finances and of the investment policies of these companies, to afford investors full and complete information with respect to their
activities; prohibits such companies from changing the nature of their business or
their investment policies without the approval of the stockholders; bars persons
guilty of security frauds from serving as officers and directors of such companies;
prevents underwriters, investment bankers, and brokers from constituting more than
a minority of the directors of such companies; requires management contracts in the
first instances to be submitted to security holders for their approval; prohibits
transactions between such companies and their officers and directors and other
insiders except on the approval of the Commission; forbids the issuance of senior
securities of such companies except in specified instances; and prohibits pyramiding of such companies and cross ownership of their securities. The Commission is
authorized to prepare advisory reports upon plans of reorganizations of registered
investment companies upon request of such companies or 25 percent of their stockholders and to institute proceedings to enjoin such plans if they are grossly unfair. The Act also requires face-amount certificate companies to maintain reserves
adequate to meet maturity payments upon their certificates.
S1J1EJffiY
OF ACTIVITIES
During the past year the Commission in its administration of the Act concerned
itself pri:marily l'liththe disposition of the applicationsfiled pursuant to various
provisions of the Act. There were 70 such applications pending at the beginning of
the year and 59 additional ones filed during the year; 59 were disposed of in the
course of the year, and 70 were pending at its close. These applications are
classified beLow, together with an indication of the disposition made of them. It
should be noted that the detailed figures in this summary are not totaled for the

securities
under the diversification
provisions of Section 5 of the Investment
CompaqyAct of 1940, designated as Rule N-5B-2.
Under Section 5 (b) of the Act an investment companyis considered a "diversified company" if at least 75 percent of its total assets is represented by cash,
Governmentsecuri tie s, eecuri ties of other investment companies and securities
limited in respect of a~ one issuer to not more than 5 percent of the total assets
of such investment companyand to not more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities
of such issuer.
Since the term "security" is defined under the Act
to include a guarantee of a security, the securities
of "any one issuer" dncLude
guarantees of securities
of other companies by such issuer.
This situation presents
dif!ieu1 t problems for the investment companyin the valuation of guarantees and
guaranteed securities
in detendn;ng whether its investments meet the diversification
standards of the Act. These problems are further complicated by multiple guarantees,
guarantees solely of principal,
or solely of interest,
and guarantees which may
expire prior to the maturity date of the guaranteed security.

- 75 The new rule adopted by the Commissionalleviates
these difficulties
while retaining the basic diversification
standards of the Act. The Fule provides, in
effect, that diversified
investment companies may invest in guaranteed securities
on the basis that the guarantor is not the issuer of the securities
provided that
the aggregate value of its investment in the direct issues of a company and the issues guaranteed by such companydoes not exceed 10 percent of the value of the
total assets of the investment company. The rule does not affect the 5 percent and
10 percent limitations
of Section 5 (b) as respects the direct obligations of
issuers.
The rule also provides that guarantees by a railroad. of terminal, warehouse, switching or bridge company securities
shall not be considered as securities
of the railroad if the guaranteed security is guaranteed by more than one railroad
no one of lfhich controls all of its co-guarantors.
The rule also makes clear that
a lease or similar arrange~nt
shall not be deemed in itself
a guarantee.

- 76 CIVIL ACTIONS llISTITUTED BY THE COMMISSION
The Commission during the past year made use of its authority to file injunctive actions to restrain violations of the Investment Comp~~y Act of 1940 in three
cases.
In two of them, the Courts, acting under Section 36 of the Act, enjoined
officers and directors of registered investment companies from further serving in
such capacities on the ground that they had been guilty or gross misconduct and
gross abuse of trust in connection with their management of the companies involved.
In the case against British Type Investors, Inc., after the defendants by stipulation agreed to a reorganization of the company and to make restitution of benefits
acquired by them aggregating over $1,000,000 in value, the Commission agreed to a
dismissal of its complaint. In the case against Aldred Investment Trust, the Commission sought and obtained the appointment of receivers to safeguard the interests
of investors. In the case against First Investment Compa~ or Concord, New
Hampshire, a liquidating agent was appointed to wind up the affairs of the company.

11

In the Aldred case, Gordon B. Hanlon, for less than $20,000, acquired a
majori ty of Aldred's common stock which had no asset value but gave him control of
approximately $2,500,000 in assets. Aldred had a runded debt of $5,900,000 and had
been insolvent since 1937. Absent a derault in interest, the shareholders were not
entit.Led to put an end to the Trust until 2002. Earnings were insufficient to meet
the Trust's interest requirements. To prevent default in interest and possible
termination of the Trust, a large proportion of interest was paid out of capital.
Various plans of reorganization proposed by Hanlon, giving him an equity position,
were never ef'f'ectuated because they were considered by the Commission to be unfair
to the debenture holders. Thereafter, without adequately infonning the Trust's
security holders, Hanlon radically changed Aldred's investment policy by selling
approximately one-third of the Trust's choicest securities to acquire majority control of Suffolk Downs Race Track. Arter an extended trial the District Court
entered a judgment permanently enjoining Hanlon and certain other defendants from
serving as ofricers and trustees of Aldred. The judgment also provided for the appointment or receivers with power either to reorganize or liquidate the Trust in
the interest of investors.
.

In S.E.C. v ; First Investment Company of Concord, New Hampshire, the CoIllIllissio
sought an injunction restraining Charles L. Jackman rrom serving or acting in the
capacity of ofrd.cer, director, member of the advisory board or investment adviser
of the company or any other registered investment company and permanently enjoining
all defendants from effectuating transactions in violation or Section 10 (b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule X-IOB-5 thereunder. The complaint alleged
that Jaclanan,while serving as president and director of the company, had been
guilty of gross misconduct and gross abuse of trust within the meaning of Section 36
of the Act. It was further alleged that Jackman operated and managed the company in
his own interest to the detrime~t of investors and caused First Investment's stockholders to sell their securities to his nominee under false and misleading information regarding the company's financial position. Jackman purchased the compa~'s

stockholders, however, that he was in fact the purchaser and that, at the time of
the offer, the stock had an asset coverage of from $18 to $20 per share.
In addition, stockholders were further misled by the company's failure to file with the
Commissionor to submit to its stockholders financial reports required by the Investment CompanyAct. The complete absence of financial information was of great as~istance to Jackmanin his stock acquisition program. It was further alleged that
Jackmancaused the companyto engage in numerousfinancial transactions with corporations controlled by him in violation of various sections of the Investment Company
Acto After the Commissioninstituted action, defendants consented to an injunction
under 1'ihich Jackmanwas permanently enjoined from further serving the companyor any
other registered investment companyin any capacity and defendants were permanently
restrained from engaging in any acts or practices in violation of Section 10 (b)
of the Securities ExchangeAct and Rule X-10B-5in connection with the transactions
involved. Jackmanalso agreed to makerestitution.
In ~.
v. otis, et al., the Commissionalleged that the officers and directors of British Type Investors, Inc., through control of Class B stock (which had
no asset value but carried all voting rights), engaged in a series of transactions,
the effect of which was to dilute the asset value of the Class A stock for their
own benefit.
Class A stockholders had no voice in the managementof the company,
although they had the only equity position.
It was alleged that Automatic Products,
Inc., an investment companycontrolled by British, had failed to register as an
investment companyin violation of the Act. After the Commissionfiled its complaint, defendants agreed to a reorganization of British to give its Class A stockholders the right to elect five of its seven directors, and to make restitution.
Automatic also filed notification
of registration.
Thereafter, the action was dismissed on stipulation.

-?SPART VII
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE INVESTMENT

ADVISERS

ACT OF 1940

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration of investment
advisers, that is, persons engaged for compensation in the business of advising
others with respect to securities. The Commission is empowered to deny or revoke
registration of such advisers if they have been convicted or enjoined because of
misconduct in respect of security transactions. The Act also makes it unlawfUl for
investment advisers to engage in practices which constitute fraud or deceit; requires investment advisers to disclose the nature of their interest in transactions
executed for their clients; prohibits profit-sharing arrangements; and, in effect,
prevents assignment of investment advisory contracts without the clientJs consent.

As was pointed out in the Tenth Annual Report, the Commission is granted
authority to make investigations when it appears that the provisions of the Act
have been or are about to be violated, and by the use of its subpoena power may obtain information concerning such violations. However, the protections afforded
under the Act are not so extensive as those afforded with respect to the activities
of brokers and dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, chiefly because
the Advisers Act does not grant power to the Commission to inspect books and
records as does Section 17 (a) of the Exchange Act. The absence of such power
limits the effectiveness of the Act with respect to protection of investors. To
remedy this signal weakness as well as other related weaknesses in the Act, the
Commission, on January 31, 1945, sent a report to the Congress recommending certain
amendments to the Act. On July 5, 1945 the Honorable Clarence F. Lea, Chairman of
the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, introduced H. R. 3691, which contains the amendments recommended by the Commission. This bill has been referred to
the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce.
To clarify the effect of Section 206 (3) of the Investment Advisers Act, as
well as the anti-fraud provisions of the 1933 and 1934 Acts, on transactions effected by investment advisers wi. th their own clients, the Commission, on February 5,
1945, made public an opinion by James A. Treanor, Jr., Director of its Trading and
Ex:change Division, to the effect that it is unlawful for an investment adviser
(whether or not registered under the Investment Advisers Act) to effect a transaction with or for a client, either as principal or as broker for another person,

- 79 unless he obtains the client's consent after having made full df.sc'Losur-e of any adverse interest he may have.
This disclosure, the opinion states, must include a
statement of the capacity in which the investment adviser proposes to act, the cost
of the security to the investment adviser where he proposes to sell, and the best
price at which the transaction could be effected by or for the client elsewhere if
such price is more advantageous to the client than the actual purchase or sale
price.
The opinion states further that (except where no advice is rendered as to
the particular transaction) the Investment Advisers Act requires, in the case of a
registered investment adviser, that the disclosure of capacity be given in writing
and the client's consent obtained before the completion of each transaction of the
types in question.

Y

CIVILACTIONS
INSTlTU'!'ED
BYTHECOMMISSION
During the fiscal period ending June 30, 1945 the Commissionfor the first
time
invoked the aid of a court of equity in restraining violation of Section 203 (a) of
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
That section prohibits any investment adviser from making use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate
commerceunless he is registered with the Commissionin accordance with the Act.
The Commission's complaint alleged that one Charles A. Crowder, on a weekly broadcast over a small radio station for a considerable period of time, gave advice to
his listeners regarding the value of oil securities.
At first his advice appeared
to be disinterested and. he built up a considerable following. He also solicited and
accepted moneyfrom his radio audience with which he purchased oil leases on their
behalf in which he retained interests in return for his advice and services.
Crowderwas not and had never been registered as an investment adviser under the Act.
Later Crowderwas approached by RoyE. Wilson, who at the time was engaged in an
oil promotion with one Jom W. Myers. Wilson and 1!yers employedCrowderto adver»
tise their venture on the radio and to influence his listeners to purchase interests
in the promotion. Crowderdid so without disclosing that he was in the employ of
Wilson and MYers. The complaint also alleged violations of Sections 5 (a) and 17
(a) and (b) of the Securities Act. All defendants consented to a permanent
injunction.

PART VIII
OTHER ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMMrSSION

UNDER THE VARIOUS

STATUTE'S

LITIGATION
Civil Proceedings
At the beginning of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1945, 30 civil proceedings
instituted by the Commissionwere pending; during the year, the Commissioninstituted
23 additional proceedings, including 14 injunctive actions brought against 45 persons to restrain them from fraudulent and otherwise illegal practices in the sale of
securities.
Of this total of 53 proceedings, 27 were disposed of during the fiscal
year, including 13 cases which resulted in the entry of injunctions against 32
defendants. Twenty-six civil proceedings were pending at the end of the year.
Since its inception, the Commissionhas instituted a total of 531 civil proceedings and disposed of 505. Permanent injunctions have been obtained against 1008
firms and individuals.
Data with respect to civil cases and appellate proceedings commencedor pending
during the fiscal year and their status at the close of the year, together wi. th all
criminal proceedings, are included in Appendix Tables 24 to 33. Someof the more
important of these .civil cases have been summarizedin the preceding parts of this
report.
Criminal Proceedings
The statutes which the Commissionadministers provide for the transmittal of
available evidence of statutory violations to the Attorney General who, in his discretion, may institute
appropriate criminal proceedings.
The Commission,largely
through its ten regional offices, thoroughly investigates all suspected violations
and, whenever grounds from criminal prosecution are disclosed, transmits detailed
reports of investigation to the Attorney General. If criminal proceedings are decided upon, the Commissionassigns such of its employees as have participated in
the investigation to assist in preparing the case for presentation to the Grand
Jury, in conducting the trial,
and in preparing briefs on appeal. Should the Commission's investigation disclose violations of statutes other than those which it
administers, the evidence is referred to an appropriate federal or state agency.
Up to June 30, 1945, a total of 365 criminal cases have been developed by the
Commissionand indictments against 2404 defendants have been obtained in these cases
by the Department of Justice.
Of these, 23 indictments were returned during the
past year against BBdefendants.
Convictions have been obtained against 1,173
defendants, 73 of lIhomwere convicted during the past year.

In the appeals decided during the past year, convictions were reversed as to
only 2. defendants.
Judgments of conviction were affirmed as to 22 defendants, ap-.peals were dismissed as to 4 defendants, and appeals voluntarily withdrawn by 2
others.

The status of all cases pending during the past fiscal year is set forth in
Appendix Table 27. As in previous years, the types of cases involved are varied.
'l'hua, they include frauds by and against broker-dealers; frauds in connection with
the sale of corporate securities,
the exploitation of natural resources, the promotion of inventions, new businesses, and fraternal organizations; failure to keep
books and records as prescribed by the statutes; and the filing of false financial
statements and annual reports with the Commission.

- 81 Charges of fraud on the part of broker-dealers figured prominently in the cases
prosecuted during the year. In U.S. v, Guaranty Underwriters, Inc., et ale (S.D.
Fla. ), criminal sanctions were imposed for the fraud involved in charging excessive
prices bearing no reasonable relation to prevailing market prices for securities
without appropriate disclosure to customers. This was the second successful prosecution based on this theory of fraud, the first being U.S. v , otto B. Dagg, et ala
(Dagg& Company,Inc.) (W.D.Wash.), convictions in lIhich were obtained in 1943. In
the Guraranty Underwriters case, defendants were also charged with numerousfalse
misrepresentations and the mak;ng of large secret profits on transactions in which
they represented investors in an agency capacity.
The eight major defendants either
pleaded guilty or nolo contendere and were sentenced for violations of the fraud
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, and other statutory offenses. y' Fraud
based upon the charging of excessive prices without adequate disclosure was also the
basis of the convictions in U.S. v. SamuelS. Alexander, et alo (S.D. N.Y.) where
fractional undivided trrtereste in oil, gas and other mineral rights in various
tracts of land were sold at prices ranging up to 328%of cost.
Defendants also made
numerousfraudulent misrepresentations in the sale of these securities.
Fraudulent conduct of business as a broker-dealer is also charged by the indictments pending in U.S. v, MaxwellGoldberg, et ala (Maxwell& Co., Inc ,') (D.
Mass.), U.S. v , EdwinP. Woodman,et ala (Woodman
& Coo) (D. Mass.), and UoS. v ,
W. R. HempsteadCo., et ale (D. R.I.).
In the first case, the indictment 'charges
such practices as the unauthorized pledging of eustamers' securities,
the fo~gery
of customers' checks, the forgery of signatures to assignments of customers'
securities,
and the printing and sale of spurious stock certificates
and debentures.
In the latter two cases, defendants are charged, inter alia, with practices such as
the acceptance of orders and deposits while insolvent and being unable to execute
customers' orders, the conversion of securities deposited by customers, the keeping
of false records, and the filing of false financial statements with the Securities
and ExchangeCommission.
other cases involving frauds by broker-dealers are U.S. v , Roy Eo Crummer,et
ale (The Brown-Crummer
Investment 0-0.) (D. Kan, ) where the pending indictment
charges fraud in the collection of customers' securities in a municipal refunding,
and U.S. v. SamuelSo Alexander (S.D. N.Y.) which marks the first conviction of a
registered securities dealer for failure to keep and preserve accounts, correspondence,books and other records as required by Section 17 (a) of the Securities
ExchangeAct of 1934 and Rules X-17A-3and X-17A-4prescribed by the Commissionas
necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors.

Y

U.S. v : Jom N. Landberg (E.D. Pa.) involved a conviction for frauds perpetrated
upon various securities brokers. Defendant would induce brokers to purchase securities for the account of his wife upon the false representation that other securities
of the latter would be deposited to secure payment. After the securities had been
purchased, defendant would refuse payment, and would direct that they be sold and
the profits turned over to hiln. If the newly purchased securities had declined in
value, he would then reveal his lack of authority to act for his wife.
Fraudulent misrepresentations in the sale of securities in connection with the
promotion of inventions or scientific discoveries were the basis for the convictions

11 The indictment

was nolle prossed as to three minor defendants.

31 A second indictment

against 13ubstantially the same defendants alleging similar
frauds in connection with another municipal refunding was dismissed by the
District Court for vagueness and insufficiency to apprise defendants of the
nature of the charges. An appeal by the government is pending.

A substantial number of the cases active during the past fiscal year involved
charges of fraudulent mining promotions and frauds in which oil and gas properties
were the underlying basis for investment. The oil and gas cases are U.S. v , Samuel

stock were obtained in U.S. v. George Howell, et ale (S.D. Tex.) (Texas National
Life Insurance Company),and in U.S. v , Wi1lllingtollFire Insurance Co., et ale (D.
Del.) •
Fraudulent sales of securities of an alleged fraternal and educational association formed the basis of the conviction of the principal defendant in U.S. v , Hugh
G. Carruthers, et ale (N.D. rri.), According to the indictment, Carruthers
organized the Neological Foundation in 1936, purportedly for the spiritual improvement and economic self-betterment of its members. Its membershipconsisted chiefly
of persons whoby reason of distress could be persuaded that solace 'and selfbetterment would be obtained by joining the Foundation and adhering to its so-called
"neological" course of training.
Thereafter, Carruthers obtained loans from members
for the alleged purpose of expanding the association's activities,
furthering its
policies, and carrying on various business enterprises "to be operated by the Foundation including the manufacture and sale of hair shampoo, a tonic laxative, a course
of instruction in personal development, and a daily newspaper. Memberinvestors
were promised 6% interest plus a bonus of 4% with a dividend of 50% of principal at
the end of three years.
Instead, Carruthers allegedly diverted substantial amounts
of the funds obtained for his own use and benefit.
Verdicts of not guilty were
directed by the court as to two minor defendants. Carruthers appealed to the
Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals which, on December27, 1945, affirmed the judgment
of conviction.
A "front money"schemefor the defrauding of persons desirous of obtaining
capital for the financing of new businesses or the expanding of established ones
was involved in U.S. v ; Amster Leonard, et ale (E.D. Mich), in which both defendants
were convicted. Defendants would contact persons seeking capital and offer aid in
the raising of the necess~
capital through their so-called "Founders Syndicate
Plan" and the sale of pre-organization certificates
through 260 "key men". Victims
were induced to part with "advance fees" or "front money"under the representation
that defendants would obtain the desired capital although the latter knew that they
could not and did not intend to raise new capital through the "Planll•

The making of false and misleading statements in reports required to be filed
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is charged by the indictment pending in
~.
v. Liggett & Myers Tobacco C003 et ale (E.D. Pa.). According to the indictment, defendants conspired to conceal the existence of a profit-sharing plan, known
as the B Fund Bonus3 providing for the payment of a portion of designated net profits of the company to certain officers and employees other than th~ president and
vice-presidents. It is alleged that in filing application for registration pursuant to Section 12 of the Act, defendants set forth only one bonus plan-that provided by the company's by-laws affecting the president and vice-presidents--but
failed to disclose the B Fund Bonus plan. Moreover, in the companyt s Form 10-K
annual reports for the years 1935-1942, inclusive, defendants wou~d state "none" or
"no changes" in answering questions concerning bonus plans not previously reported
and would thereby fail to reveal the existence of this B Fund Bonus plan.
Of the criminal appeals decided during the past fiscal year, several are
worthy of mention. In U.S. v , H. B. Monjar? et al. (The Mantle Club), 147 'F. 2d
916 (C.C.A. 3, 1944), cert. den., 65 Sup. Ct. 1191 (1945), the court sustained the
convictions of 12 defendants on charges of defrauding members of a fraternal
organization in obtaining personal loans and the sale of investment contracts. The
Supreme Court denied certiorari in U.S. v. Minuse, et al., 323 U.S. 716 (1944),
where the Second Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld convictions for a stock "jiggle"
in the Class A capital stock of Tastyeast3 Iric , , a security listed on the New York
Curb Exchange [f.42 F. 2d 388 (1944)]. In U.S. v ; Edmond B. Bronson, et al. (Bagdad

- S5 COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission received during the year approximately S,000 items of mail concerned with alleged securities violations which is classified administratively as
"complaint enforcement" correspondence. This material constitutes one of the Commission's chief sources of information concerning possible securities violations,
while investigations made by the Commission I s staff and contacts maintained with
other governmental (Federal, State, and local) or private agencies provide additional sources of such information. Where it appears on the basis of any such data that
any such violation may have occurred, the Commission conducts appropriate investigations by means of correspondence or the assignment of cases to field investigators
to ascertain the facts of the particular case. The extent of these investigatory
activities of the Commission during the past year, under the Securities Act of 1933,
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 12 (e) and (h) of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, is reflected in the following table:

A list of the civil, criminal, and other actions resulting from certain of these
investigations is set forth in Appendix Tables 24 -
 27, inclusive.
To assist its continuing enforcement and registration activities, and to provide a further means of preventing fraud in the purchase and sale of securities, the
Commission has established what is called for convenience a Securities Violations
File, consisting of a clearing house of information concerning persons who have been
charged with violations of various Federal and State securities statutes. This
clearing house has been kept up-to-date during the past year as in previous years
through the cooperation of the United states Post Office Department, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, parole and probation officials, State securities commissions,
Federal and State prosecuting attorneys, police officials and other public agencies,
members of the National Association of Better Business Bureaus Inc ,, and members of
the United States Chamber of Commerce. By the end of the past fiscal year the Co~
mission had assembled in these files data concerning an aggregate of 45,77S persons
against whom Federal or State action had been taken in connection with securities
violations. During the past year alone additional items of information relating to
3505 such persons were added to these files, including information concerning 1459
persons not previously identified therein.

11 These

investigations of securities violations include the oil and gas investigations lfhich are separately tabulated and discussed in Part I of this report.

y

Investigations carried on through correspondence and limited field work.

assigned to field investigators.

- 86 The extensive use made of this clearing house of information is suggested by
the fact that during the past year the Commissionreceived in connection with its
maintenance approximately 2,500 ftsecurities violations"
letters
or reports (apart
from those mentioned above which are classified
as t1complaint enforcement") and
dispatched about 3,000 communications in turn to cooperating agencies.
ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMMISSION IN THE FIELD OF ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

Effect of the War and the Pro~pect of Reconversion
The difficul tie s and uncertainties
inlrerent in wartime accounting have been
commentedon in previous Annual Reports. During the past year, the major problem in
this area has been the application of procedures developed in prior years to the
special circumstances presented in individual registration
statements and reports.
At the same time the rapid pIlogress of the war necessitated extensive consideration of the accounting and disclosure problems that would arise when war business
was cut back or terminated and the process of reconversion to peacetime operations
and markets began. As one step toward dealing with these problems, efforts were
begun in the fall of 1944 to provide for a system of current reporting which would,
first,
enable investors to determine the extent to which cut-backs and terminations
consequent upon the approaching end of the war affected particular
companies; and
second, furnish them with some indication of the speed with which particular
companies were able to reconvert to peacetime production and to reenter the civilian
markets. Such financial information, by companies, seemed essential since general
announcements as to cut-backs and terminations rarely disclosed their effect on
particular
companies and it was clear, in any event, that the end of war operations
would come at different times and in different degrees so far as any individual
companywas concerned. Discussions were first had with the appropriate Federal
agencies to determine whether such modification of censorship and'secrecy restrictions as would be necessary to permit general publication of pertinent data could
be made without detriment to the war effort.
At the same time, extended discussions
were undertaken with interested registrants,
technical associations and others to
determine the most useful and practicable form for such current reports.
As
amount
finally developed, the program applies to all companies having a substantial
of war business and calls essentially
for quarterly reports as to war and non-war
sales and as to war orders, beginning with the most recently ended fiscal year of
the company. In addition, an immediate report is obtained whenever a particular
termination cancelled a war contract the uncompleted portion of which amounted to
over 20%of the registrant's
total sales for the previous fiscal yearo ~
A second important problem in this field was the treatment to be accorded
terminated war contracts in financial statements issued prior to the date of final
settlement.
Fortunately, the development of Uniform Termination Procedures under
the Contract Settlement Act of 1944 so clarified
the problem that it was possible,
well before volume termination of war contracts began, to reach general agreement,
both within the Commissionand amongaccountants and companies, as to how such
claims were to be reflected in financial statements.

During the war period, manycompanies established reserves as a protection against losses or expenses which registrants anticipated would be encountered
after the war ended but which they felt should be attributed to war operations.
The
exact amounts of many such losses and expenses cannot, of course, be determined until
after cessation of war operations, and,in some instances, many months thereafter.
However, it is essential that definite criteria be established to assure that only
true war expenses be charged against such reserves, either directly or indirectly.
If especial care is not exercised in this regard, the operations of post-war years
may be relieved of charges and costs applicable to such operations with a conseqUent
inflation of reported net income. In view of its importance, this problem is being
given extensive consideration, and discussions have been had with respresentatives
of accounting societies and other interested persons, with a view to arriving at a
practicable solution.
war reserves.

Accounting and Auditing
During the past year the Commissionissued a number of decisions or opinions
dealing with accounting or auditing matters.
In the Leedy, Wheeler & Company
case
the respondent, a registered broker-dealer, had employeda pro-forma balance
sheet in selling securities to the public but had not disclosed the nature of the
assumed transactions that had been reflected therein.
Moreover, the assumptions
made in preparing the pro-forma statement were of questionable validity.
Finally,
the balance sheet concealed an operating deficit by netting it against capital stock
accounts without disclosure.
The Co1llIl1ission,
after discussing the proper functions
and uses of pro-forma statements, found that the pro-forma balance sheet in question
was misleading and deceptive

In its findings and order in the Suburban Electric Securities Company case
the Commissionpointed out a number of improper accounting practices followed by the
registrant,
including its failure to recognize an apparently permanent impairment
in the value of its investments in certain subsidiary companies and its failure to
provide for depreciation on depreciable assets of a subsidiary.
However, since just
prior to the conclusion of the hearings in the matter the registrant amendedits
financial statements to cure these improprieties the Commissiondetermined that it
was not necessary to suspend or withdraw the registration of the registrant!s
securities under the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934.

Several other accounting questions were dealt with in opanaons of the Chief
Accountant issued during the past year as part of the Commission
I s Accounting Series
releases.
Release Noo 50 in this series concerned the practice of writing downor
writing off good1rlll by charges to capital surplus and served to draw attention to

- ssas it circumvented the charging to income or earned surplus of items which were
properly chargeable thereagainst, with a resulting overstatement of income and
earned surp'lus and an understatement of capital.
The charge to capital surplus in
such circumstances, the release points out, is in violation of the fundamental accounting principle that a distinction
should be maintained between capital and
income. Accounting Series Release No. 52 discussed certain problems relating to the
presentation in financial statements of Federal income and excess profits taxes in
cases where a company, for which individual financial statements are filed, pays
its tax as a memberof a consolidated group of coepantes ,
During the period of high, wartime rates of corporate income taxes, some companies and accountants have sought to reflect in the income statement not only
charges for the income taxes estimated to be actually payable but also additional
amounts representing so-called "tax-savingsH or "tax reductions" caused by
difrerences in the accounting treatment afforded certain items for tax purposes
and ror financial reporting purposes.
This practice, the propriety of which is
supported or condoned by some public accountants and objected to by others, has
and representatives
been the subject of extended discussion between the CollDllission
or various professional accounting societies and other interested persons.
These
discussions have indicated a reeling, both within and without the Commission, that
financial statements in 1¥hichthis practice is followed are frequently unsatisfacIt is expected that upon comtory, if not actually misleading, to the investor.
pletion of these discussions the Commissionwill promulgate an opinion concerning
the marmer in which these Jttax-savingsJ1 or "tax reductions" should be dealt with in
financial statements filed with the Commission.

11

One of the most perplexing of the accounting problems now facing the Commission is the question of whether there are circumstances under which certain items
of income, expense or loss may justifiably
be excluded from the computation of net
Lncoae as shown by the profit and loss statement and carried directly to earned
surplus.
Over the years, a great many cases involving this question have cometo
the attention of the Commission. A staff study of an extensive sample of such cases
discloses a very great disparity in treatment of items wholly similar in nature.
HeterogeneouBtreatment of such items obviously increases the difficulty
of C'omparing income statements as between years and particularly
as between competiti ve
companies. Accordingly, certain tentative changes in the Commission's regulations
have been prepared with a view to securing more uniform and intelligible
income
statements through a requirement that, in the absence of very exceptional cf.rcumstances, all items of loss, expense and income shall be reflected in the income account. These proposed amendmentshave been sent for commentto many companies having financial statements on file with the Commission, to the various professional
accounting societies,
and to other interested persons.
While the responses received
it appears
indicated,. a general agreement with the proposed amendmentsin principle,
necesB~ to establish reasonably clear-cut and objective criteria for determining
when, if at all, certain items may be considered to be so extraordinary in nature
as to permit their exclusion from the computation of net income. The problem is
now undergoing f'urther study in light of' the suggestions received.
Additional staff consideration has been given during the past year to proposals
for a comprehensive revision of' the accounting requirements applicable to investment
companies under the 1940 Act. The proposed revision has been discussed in detail
with representatives
of the industry, practicing accountants, and other interested
persons, but bas not yet been finally acted upon by the Commission.
The Commissionhas continued to give carefUl attention to its overall requirements as to financial statements with a view to their silJlplification and integration

-89with the requirements of other agencies, wherever practicable and feasible.
During
the past year, for example, the staff has worked closely with another governmental
agency on a program for integrating the respective reports required of companies
subject to their commonjurisdiction.
Cooperation with

Professional

Societies

and Others

As in previous years, the Commissionhas sought to add its full influence to
that of the professional accounting societies and others interested in maintaining
accounting and auditing standards at a high level.
As in the past, the Commission
has, wherever practicable,
invited professional accounting societies,
Federal and
State agencies, and many other interested persons to review and commentupon proposed
rules and regulations pertaining to accounting matters.
In appropriate cases conferences of such persons with the Commissionor the staff have been arranged.
Reciprocally, the Commissioninformally has accepted the invitation of professional
accounting societies to make suggestions or commentsas to proposed actions or
bulletins of such organizations.
Substantial benefits, Whichare reflected in all
types of financial statements whether comingunder the jurisdiction
of the Commission
or not, have resulted from these activities.
Professional

Conduct

Certification
of financial statements, if it is to operate as an added protection to investors, must be based on an impartial and expert review of the financial
aff"airs of the company. Disregard of professional standards of conduct applicable
to such revievmfurnishes grounds for disbarring an accountant from fUrther practice
before the Commissionpursuant to Rule II (e) of the Rules of Practice.
During the
past year the Commissioninstituted proceedings under this rule against an accountant who had certified financial statements filed with the CoIlDDission
by a securities broker-dealer.
Investigation disclosed that the accountant in question had
knowingly violated the Commission's accounting and auditing rules, had failed to
make an appropriate audit of the broker-dealer's
accounts, and bad unqualifiedly
certified to financial statements that were grossly misleading.
On the other hand,
the failure of the certified public accountant to perform a satisfactory
audit did
not appear, in this instance, to have contributed to the fraud perpetrated by the
broker-dea1.er involved, nor did his extreme laxity appear to have occasioned losses
to investors of the brokerage firm. Under these circumstances the Commissiondiscontinued its proceedings upon receipt of a stipulation that the accountant would
never again practice before this Commission. In order to emphasize the importance
of the requirelllents for certification
of broker-dealer financial statements, the Commission published Accounting Series Release No. 51 summarizing the facts of this
case.
Informal Consideration of A.ccountingProblems Raised in the Case of Individual
Registrants
The examitlation of rinancial statements riled by registrants pursuant to the
various Acts administered by the Commissionhas always accounted for a large part
of the Commission's activities
with respect to accounting and auditing matters.

STATISTICS AND SPECIAL STUDIES
Capital Markets Statistics
The Commission in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1945 continued to compile and
analyze statistics on the volume and characteristics of offerings and retirements of
securities; the distribution of and the changes in ownership of securities between
different groups of institutional, corporate, and individual holders; and various
other aspects of capital markets statistics. Figures were released monthly showing
the volume of all new issues of securities known to have been offered within the
United States for cash sale in amounts of more than $100,000, together with breakdowns comparing the amounts of: public offerings and private placements; bonds,
preferred stocks, and common stocks; corporate and non-corporate issues; and the net
proceeds intended for refunding and for expansion of plant and equipment and working
capital of each principal industrial group.
It was possible to release regularly additional breakdowns of the dollar volume
of securities registered under the Securities Act to show: the amounts registered
for exchange, conversion, etc., as well as for cash sale; the volume of secondary
as well as prim~
distributions; the amounts offered through investment bankers and
directly by the issuers; the volumes expected to be absorbed primarily by the general
public, by security holders, and by other special groups; and the distribution by
investment banking firms of underwriting commitments and syndicate management
activities. A special study of the cost of flotation of stocks registered for sale
under the Securities Act by small companies was published during the Year, and data
were gathered for future analysis on the success of flotation of small nonunder-written issues. In addition to information published on the capital markets, many
special adaptations of the basic data were made to problems met in the day-to-day
operations of the Commission and to questions raised by other governmental agencies
and by members of Congress.
Saving study
The Commission continued its series of quarterly releases on the volume and
composition of saving by individuals in the United States. These releases show the
aggregate volume of individuals' saving, that is, the increase in their assets less
the increase in their liabilities, exclusive of gains or losses from revaluation of
assets. The figures also show the components contributing to this total, such as
changes in securities, cash, insurance, consumers' indebtedness, and consumers'
durable goods.
Financial Position of U.S. COrporations
The series of quarterly releases on the working capital position of all United
States corporations , exclusive of banks and insurance companies, 1'laS continued.
These releases show the principal components of current assets and current liabilities and an abbreviated analysis of the sources and uses of corporate funds. In
addition, a series of supplementary tables was inaugurated in July 1944 showing a
detailed breakdown of current assets and liabilities for various industry and size
groups of corporations registered with the Commission. It is intended in subsequent
reports to present more detailed data on the sources and uses of corporate funds,
thus giving a complete pictUre of the volume and composition of corporate saving as
well as an up-to-date analysis of the financial condition of corporations.

- 91 Shortly after the close of the fiscal year the Connnission, together with the
Department of Commerce,initiated a regular quarterly survey of private plant and
equipment expenditures by U. S. business other than agriculture.
It is planned to
publish shortly after the end. of each quarter industry totals on the actual capital
expenditures of that quarter and anticipated expenditures f'or the next two quarters.
These data should provide a useful index of present and future activity in the
capital goods industries and capital markets and a valuable barometer of business
activity in general.
Survey of American Listed Cory orations
During the past fiscal year, the Commissionagain released for public and
government use statistical
data filed with the Commissionby registrants under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933. These data are
summarized in a series of reports knownas the "Survey of AmericanListed Corporations" showing individual data for each companyas well as industry totals for
registered companies. Two series of reports 'were completed in the past fiscal year,
one covering "Data on Profits and Operations, 1942-1943" ani another "Balance Sheet
Data, 1939-1943". Principal items furnished in the reports on profits and operations are data on sales, costs and/or operating expenses, operating profits, net
profit before and after income taxes, depreciation, depletion, etc., maintenance
and repairs, selling, general and administrative expenses, and return on net worth
Each of these companies' reports also shows data before and
before and after taxes.
after renegotiations of all contracts, the amounts and ef'fects of "c~-backsft
of
taxes and data on tennination of contracts whenever reported.
"Balance Sheet Data,
1939-1943" contains detailed balance sheets for the same industry groups which were
included in the reports on profits and operations nth condensed statements for each
of the individual companies. Covering five years, the principal items in the report
are current assets ani current liabilities,
investments, land, buildings and equipment and applicable reserves, post-war refunds of excess-profits taxes, capital
surplus, earned surplus, total assets, total liabilities
and net worth, and in
addition to these bal.ance sheet items preferred. and cODllllOn
dividends paid.
InvestDlent

Company Data

Data for closed-end. and. open-end managementinvestment companies were compiled
and released quarterly showing purchases and sales of their 01Il1 stocks and bonds and
changes in their portfolios and in their principal asset items.
Stock Market Statistics
The Commissioncontinued to publish indexes of weekly closing prices of common
stocks on the NewYork Stock Exchange, the monthly market value and volume of sales
on registered and exempted securities exchanges, daily and weekly round-lot stock
sales on the two NewYork Exchanges, weekly r-ound-Lot, stock transactions on the New
York Stock Exchange for accounts of membersard nonmembers,weekly round-lot and
odd-Lob transactions on the NewYork Curb Exchange for accounts of membersand nonmembers, and da~
odd-lot stock transactions on the NewYork Stock Exchange for
odd-lot accounts of odd-lot dealers and specialists.
Special Studies
The Commission's staff continued its studies on various aspects of trading in
securities,
including a report on floor trading, an analysis of broker and dealer
trading, and a study of' the financial condition of brokers.
other studies were conducted during the year on the methods of compensating customers' men, the division

- 92 of brokerage fees in special offerings, trading in certain foreign securities,
trading practices on two of the national securities exchanges, the volume of purchases and sales of security options, and general research on exchange rules and
practices.
War Activities

several membersof the staff
were loaned to various war agencies and committees for special economic investigations in Germany.
