Respondents.

On April 23, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) published
a Notice of Proposed Plan of Distribution and Opportunity for Comment (“Plan”) by the
Division of Enforcement in connection with this proceeding (Exchange Act Rel. No. 69437). The
Commission received no comments and on August 9, 2013, the Plan was approved (Exchange Act
Rel. No. 70151).
The Plan provides that a Fair Fund consisting of $50,000,000 in disgorgement and civil
penalties, plus accrued interest, be transferred to Deutsche Bank to be distributed by the Fund
Administrator to injured investors according to the methodology set forth in the Plan. The Plan
provides that the Commission will arrange for distribution of the Fair Fund when a validated list of
payees and amounts has been submitted to Commission staff. The validated list of payees and
amounts, which is in the amount of $52,332,274.34, has been received and accepted.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Commission staff shall transfer $52,332,274.34 of
the Fair Fund to Deutsche Bank and the Fund Administrator shall distribute such monies to
investors, as provided for in the Plan.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
