In the Matter of
DAVID S. HALL, P.C.
ORDER POSTPONING HEARING AND
d/b/a THE HALL GROUP CPAs,
SCHEDULING PREHEARING
DAVID S. HALL, CPA,
CONFERENCE
MICHELLE L. HELTERBRAN COCHRAN, CPA,
and SUSAN A. CISNEROS

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
in this matter on April 26, 2016. Based on U.S. Postal Service confirmation of receipt, all
Respondents except Susan A. Cisneros were served with the OIP on May 2, 2016. See 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.141(a)(2)(i)-(ii). As service was accomplished by mail, their answers are due by May 25,
2016. See OIP at 10; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(b), .220(b).
It is ORDERED that the hearing currently scheduled for May 31, 2016, is POSTPONED
sine die, and a prehearing conference is scheduled for 2:00 p.m. Eastern on May 25, 2016. At
the conference, the parties should be prepared to discuss each numbered item in Rule of Practice
221(c), 17 C.F.R. § 201.221(c), and propose dates by which those items will be accomplished,
where applicable.1 As the Commission directed that I issue an initial decision within 300 days
from the date of service of the OIP, the parties should be prepared to agree to a hearing date
roughly four months after the last Respondent is served with the OIP. See OIP at 11; 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.360(a)(2). Unless Respondents indicate otherwise, I construe their consent to the hearing
date’s postponement as a waiver of their right to a hearing within thirty to sixty days of service
of the OIP. See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-3(b); OIP at 10.
In advance of the prehearing conference, the Division shall file a declaration regarding
status of service of the OIP on Cisneros, and counsel for any Respondent shall file a notice of
appearance. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(d)(2), .141(a)(2)(i). The parties are asked to e-mail PDF
