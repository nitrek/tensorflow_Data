listed as Davie, Florida with stock quoted on OTC Link (previously, “Pink Sheets”)
operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. (“OTC Link”) under the ticker symbol COYR,
because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended June 30, 2013. On

30, 2013. On July 31, 2015, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation
Finance to Harbor Island Development Corp. requesting compliance with its periodic
filing obligations, but it did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to

business listed as West Palm Beach, Florida with stock quoted on OTC Link under the
ticker symbol MMAM, because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period

current and accurate information concerning the securities of Shades Holdings, Inc. (CIK

Aventura, Florida with stock quoted on OTC Link under the ticker symbol SHDH,
because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended June 30, 2013. On
August 19, 2015, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation Finance to

Shades Holdings, Inc. requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations, but it did

the Commission as required by Commission rules (Rule 301 of Regulation S-T, 17 CFR
232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual).
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of
