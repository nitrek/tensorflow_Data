COMPLAINT

STRICT OFCAUFORNIA
DEPIJTY

1
2

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) alleges as
follows:
SUMMARY

3
4

1.

This matter involves a fraud committed by Defendants in connection

5

with the offer and sale of tax increment municipal bonds issued from 2006 to 2008

6

by one of the Defendants, the Southern California Logistics Airport Authority (the

7

“Authority”), which is an agency with redevelopment powers controlled by its co-

8

Defendant, the City of Victorville (the “City”). The Authority was created to

9

redevelop a 132-square mile area in and around a former Air Force base in San

10

Bernardino County, California. It conducted several tax increment bond offerings

11

in connection with this redevelopment. Defendant Kinsell, Newcomb & DeDios,

12

Inc. (“KND”) was the sole underwriter for these bond offerings.

13

2.

Tax increment bonds are secured solely by and repaid solely from

14

increases in property tax revenues attributable to increases in the total assessed

15

value of the property located in the redevelopment project area. This means that

16

the “tax increment” – that is, the increase in tax revenue from increases in property

17

value – is critical to the security of the tax increment bonds. Equally important is

18

the metric called the “debt service ratio,” which compares the annual tax increment

19

revenue available to pay the outstanding bonds to the annual debt service on those

20

bonds.

21

3.

The Authority used tax increment bond offerings to finance a number

22

of ill-conceived redevelopment projects, including the construction of a power

23

plant and four new airplane hangars (“Hangars”) on the former Air Force base. By

24

late 2007, it needed $50 million to pay a deposit on a turbine for the power plant,

25

and planned to finance that payment with a new $68 million tax increment bond

26

offering. However, given the tightening credit market and the subordinate nature

27

of the bonds, prospective bond purchasers demanded that the debt service ratio for

28

this offering be increased to 1.25 (from the 1.10 ratio governing prior bond
1


1

offerings). As a result, the Authority was forced to downsize its December 2007

2

bond offering from $68 million to $42 million. This left the Authority with few

3

resources to continue its redevelopment activities. Indeed, by this time, nearly all

4

of the tax increment available to the Authority had been used to secure its prior

5

bond issuances.

6

4.

In February 2008, in an effort to escape from this financial constraint,

7

the Authority borrowed $35 million in short-term financing. It then publicly

8

offered $13.3 million of subordinate tax increment bonds in April 2008 to repay

9

part of that short-term debt. This April 2008 financing was premised, in part, on

10

an assessed value of $65 million for the four Hangars. This $65 million valuation

11

was used to determine the all-important tax increment for the April 2008 bond

12

offering, and allowed the Authority to satisfy the minimum 1.25 annual debt

13

service ratio for the offering.

14

5.

However, the Hangars’ $65 million assessed value was vastly inflated,

15

resulting in the disclosure of false tax increment and debt service ratios in the

16

Official Statement provided to investors in the April 2008 bond offering.

17

Defendant Keith Metzler (“Metzler”), the Director of Economic Development for

18

the City and an agent for the Authority, and the two KND investment bankers—

19

Defendant Jeffrey Kinsell (“Kinsell”), the owner of KND, and Defendant Janees

20

Williams—all knew that the assessed value of the Hangars was inflated, and, as a

21

result, that the tax increment and debt service ratios disclosed to investors were

22

false. Yet they each withheld this information, resulting in materially misleading

23

disclosures and a substantially oversized bond offering.

24

6.

Kinsell and KND also engaged in an additional fraudulent scheme to

25

take undisclosed construction and management fees collected on the airport hangar

26

project. In 2006, the Authority retained Defendant KND Affiliates, LLC

27

(“Affiliates”), an entity partially-owned by Kinsell, to manage this project. The

28

Authority agreed to compensate Affiliates and its contractor under a “cost plus
2


1

10% construction management fee” contract. However, Affiliates exploited this

2

fee arrangement by paying itself at least $450,000 more in fees than it was owed.

3

7.

Affiliates further misappropriated $2.3 million of bond proceeds

4

through a fictitious 15% monthly “property management fee.” Affiliates

5

transferred over $1 million of unauthorized property management fees to Relief

6

Defendant KND Holdings (“Holdings”), the parent of KND. KND then used the

7

majority of these fees to finance KND’s operating expenses, including payroll.

8

The Authority never authorized Affiliates to collect these excessive fees, which

9

Affiliates took from bond proceeds intended to complete construction of the

10

Hangars. As a result of the unauthorized construction management fees and

11

property management fees, Affiliates misappropriated a total of approximately

12

$2.7 million in bond proceeds.

13

8.

By engaging in this conduct, the Authority, KND, Affiliates and

14

Kinsell violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the

15

“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities

16

Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), and the City, Metzler, KND, Kinsell and

17

Williams aided and abetted violations of these antifraud provisions of the federal

18

securities laws. Moreover, KND violated Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act

19

and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Rules G-17, G-27 and G-

20

32(a)(iii)(A)(2), Kinsell aided and abetted each of these violations, and Williams

21

aided and abetted KND’s violations of Section 15B(c)(1) and Rule G-17.

22

Therefore, with this action, the SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement

23

with prejudgment interest and civil penalties against Defendants.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

24
25
26

A.

The City and the Authority
20.

Formerly a small town on the edge of the Mojave Desert, during the

27

2000s, the City became an “ex-urb” of Los Angeles, and saw its population jump

28

from 40,000 in 1990 to 115,000 in 2012, making it one of the fastest growing cities
5


1

in the nation. The City sought to use its expanding property tax base to establish

2

local industries and create jobs, particularly after the 1992 closure of one of its

3

largest employers, George Air Force Base, located within the City.
21.

4

Working in conjunction with the County of San Bernardino and other

5

local communities, the City created the Authority. The Authority adopted a plan

6

under California’s redevelopment law to redevelop a 132-square mile project area

7

in and around the former George Air Force Base now known as the Southern

8

California Logistics Airport (the “Airport”). Much of the work on the

9

redevelopment plan was conducted under the auspices of the Authority’s

10

predecessor, the Victor Valley Economic Development Authority, which delegated

11

all of its redevelopment powers to the Authority.

12

B.

13

Tax Allocation, or Tax Increment, Financing
22.

Municipalities often raise funds through “general obligation bonds,”

14

which, in general, are secured and their debt service paid by a municipality’s its

15

ability to raise revenue through the imposition of taxes.

16

23.

However, the Authority does not have the power to levy property

17

taxes. Therefore, instead of general obligation bonds, it relied on “tax allocation”

18

bonds, also known as “tax increment” bonds, to finance the capital projects for the

19

redevelopment of the Airport area.

20

24.

Although fairly common in California, tax increment bonds are

21

structured very differently than the more familiar general obligation bonds. Unlike

22

general obligation bonds, tax increment bonds cannot rely on a municipality’s

23

general taxing authority to secure and pay the obligation of the bonds. Instead, tax

24

increment bonds are only secured, and their obligations can only be paid, by the

25

“incremental” increase in property tax revenues resulting from an increase in the

26

aggregate assessed value of the property within the relevant redevelopment area.

27

The increased assessed value can result from appreciation in existing properties or

28

new construction.
6


1

25.

Consequently, the amount of tax increment bonds that a

2

redevelopment agency like the Authority can issue is limited to the increase in the

3

aggregate assessed value of the property in the redevelopment area.

4

26.

To calculate the amount of the property tax increment available to

5

secure and pay the debt service of tax increment bonds, the assessed value of

6

property in a redevelopment area is first determined for a particular “base” year,

7

typically the year immediately before the redevelopment plan was adopted. The

8

annual tax revenue collected from the property in the area is then divided among

9

the local taxing agencies within the redevelopment project area and the

10

redevelopment agency. Generally, the tax agencies receive the taxes that are

11

generated from the base year valuation of that property, while, subject to various

12

exceptions and carve-outs, the redevelopment agency receives the remainder—that

13

is, the “tax increment”—which is the tax revenue collected on any increase in the

14

assessed value of the project area over the base year valuation of that property.

15

The redevelopment agency may then pledge this tax increment revenue to repay

16

tax increment bonds used to finance or refinance redevelopment projects.

17

27.

A redevelopment agency does not typically pledge tax increment to

18

repay a specific bond issuance by that agency. Instead, the aggregate amount of

19

the tax increment in a project area is often “pooled” and pledged to repay all of the

20

associated tax increment bonds issued by the agency. Nevertheless, specific tax

21

increment bonds may have a senior or subordinated claim to the aggregate tax

22

increment pledged by a redevelopment agency. Generally, investors holding

23

subordinate bonds, like the April 2008 bonds that are at the heart of this action, are

24

more sensitive to any changes in the tax increment than those holding senior lien

25

bonds.

26

28.

Because the obligations under tax increment bonds are secured by and

27

paid from the incremental increase in property tax revenues, the amount of the

28

increase in the aggregate assessed value of the redevelopment area is material
7


1

information for the bond investors, especially those holding subordinate bonds.

2

For the same reason, the ability of the agency issuing the bonds to pay the debt

3

service is material information for bond investors, and even more so for

4

subordinated bondholders. One common measure of this ability is the “debt

5

service ratio,” which compares the annual tax increment revenue available to repay

6

bonds to the annual debt service payments on all outstanding bonds. The ratio

7

shows how much the Authority and bondholders would be protected in the event

8

assessed property values in the project area dropped. For example, a debt service

9

ratio of 1.25 means that the tax increment has a 25% cushion above the amount

10

owed on all outstanding bonds. As a result, the debt service ratio was material

11

information to bond investors.

12

C.

The Authority’s Tax Increment Bond Offerings

13

1.

The Offerings, KND and the Official Statements

14

29.

Between 2006 and 2008, the Authority offered and sold at least four

15

tax increment financings relevant to this action: (1) a $34,980,000 tax allocation

16

revenue parity bond offering dated November 1, 2006 (the “November 2006 Parity

17

Bonds”); (2) a $64,165,000 subordinate tax allocation revenue bond offering dated

18

November 21, 2006 (the “November 2006 Revenue Bonds”); (3) a $42 million

19

subordinate tax allocation bond offering dated December 5, 2007 (the “December

20

2007 Bonds”); and (4) a $13,334,924.85 subordinate tax allocation bond offering

21

dated April 30, 2008 (the “April 2008 Bonds”).

22

30.

For each of the four tax increment bond offerings by the Authority,

23

investors were provided with an “Official Statement” describing the terms and

24

conditions of each bond.

25

31.

KND was the underwriter for each of these four tax increment bond

26

offerings. KND was first engaged as the underwriter for the City in 1997, and by

27

2001, it began serving as the sole underwriter for the Authority. Between 2001

28
8


1

and 2008, KND earned over $5.1 million in underwriter fees for bonds issued by

2

the Authority and sold by KND to investors.

3

2.

The Tax Increment for the Bonds

4

32.

The assessed valuation of the Airport project area for its 1997-1998

5

base year was $1.8 billion. Any increase in this assessed valuation, and the

6

resulting tax revenue, subject to various exceptions and carve-outs, represented the

7

tax increment available to the Authority for securing and paying the obligations of

8

its tax increment bonds. However, as discussed below, by the end of 2007, the

9

Authority’s total outstanding debt from its previously-issued tax increment bonds

10

was so large that the Authority could not issue any additional tax increment bonds

11

unless the property value in the area increased or there was new development in

12

the area.

13

33.

For each offering, the Authority hired a fiscal consultant (the

14

“Consultant”) to determine the additional tax increment revenue available to secure

15

the repayment of any new bond issue, and to prepare a report included as an

16

appendix to the Official Statements for the bond offerings.

17

34.

In calculating projected tax increment revenues, the Consultant first

18

looked to the county assessor’s most recent property rolls to determine the assessed

19

value of property in the area. The county assessor is the municipal official

20

responsible for determining the value of property in the county for tax purposes.

21

35.

The assessor’s office revises the property tax rolls only once a year,

22

creating a lag time before the current assessed values of properties resulting from

23

new sales or construction appear on the property tax rolls. As a result, the

24

Consultant could not simply compare the county assessor’s most recent annual

25

property roll to that for the 1997-1998 base year.

26

36.

Rather, the Consultant had to add the new assessed values due to new

27

construction, which had not yet been incorporated onto the annual property roll, to

28

the assessed values reflected on the last annual property roll. The Consultant
9


1

typically received the increased assessed values regarding new construction for the

2

project area from Metzler’s office.
37.

3

The Authority’s Official Statements referenced the Consultant’s

4

reports, which discussed among other things, the current status of development in

5

the project area and the resulting tax increment revenue available to serve as

6

security for the bonds. The Official Statements also attached the Consultant’s

7

reports as an appendix. As such, the Consultant’s reports were also provided to

8

bond investors.

9

D.

The Fraudulent Official Statement for the April 2008 Bond Offering

10

1.

The Hangars and the November 2006 Bond Offerings

11

38.

The Authority undertook a variety of ill-conceived projects in

12

connection with its efforts to develop the Airport area. These included the

13

construction of a proposed power plant known as “Victorville 2,” an inter-modal

14

rail facility and, at the crux of this action, the Hangars.

15

39.

In 2005 and 2006, the Authority issued bonds underwritten by KND

16

in order to build the Hangars, including the November 2006 Parity Bonds and the

17

November 2006 Revenue Bonds. The Authority initially hired an outside

18

developer to develop the Hangars. As discussed in more detail below, however,

19

the Authority eventually hired Affiliates to take over the project.

20

2.

The Downsized December 2007 Bond Offering

21

40.

The Authority initially planned to issue approximately $68 million of

22

tax increment bonds in late 2007 to finance an initial deposit for an electric turbine

23

for the “Victorville 2” power plant. Ultimately, by the time it issued the December

24

2007 Bonds, the Authority was only able to offer $42 million in bonds, and netted

25

just $37 million from the offering.

26

41.

The Authority was forced to downsize the December 2007 Bond

27

offering because prospective bond purchasers demanded that the Authority

28

increase the debt service ratio. Bond investors had previously accepted a debt
10 


1

service ratio of 1.10. However, due to the tightening credit market at the time and

2

the subordinate nature of the bonds, prospective bond purchasers demanded a

3

significant increase in the annual debt service ratio to 1.25.

4

42.

The debt service ratio is determined by taking the projected annual tax

5

increment revenue available to repay all tax increment bonds and dividing that

6

number by the annual debt service payments on all outstanding tax increment

7

bonds. The debt service ratio was determined from data provided by the consultant

8

and KND. Specifically, the projected annual tax increment revenue available to

9

repay all tax increment bonds was calculated by the Consultant and set forth in the

10

report it issued for the December 2007 Bonds (the “December 2007 Report”). The

11

annual debt service payments on all outstanding tax increment bonds was

12

calculated by KND.

13

43.

Although the aggregate tax increment revenue available to pay debt

14

service was substantial, by December 2007, the Authority had already consumed

15

all but a small portion of that amount to service its prior bond issues. Therefore,

16

under the increased debt service ratio of 1.25 required by prospective investors, the

17

Authority was no longer able to service $68 million in debt. Therefore, it

18

downsized the bond issuance from $68 million to $42 million.

19

44.

Prospective investors also demanded that, for all of the Authority’s

20

future tax increment bond issuances, the annual debt service ratio for each year all

21

of the bonds are outstanding must be at least 1.25 to comply with the 1.25 annual

22

debt service ratio. This requirement was incorporated in the “additional bonds”

23

covenant under the governing indenture, which generally set limitations on the

24

Authority’s ability to issue new bonds.

25

3.

The Private Placement in February 2008

26

45.

The downsizing of the December 2007 bond issuance from $68

27

million to $42 million left the Authority with few resources to continue its

28

redevelopment activities. Indeed, the Authority needed to apply all of the net
11 


1

proceeds of the December 2007 Bonds to make the initial deposit on the

2

“Victorville 2” electric turbine.

3

46.

In late November 2007, Kinsell recognized the Authority’s difficult

4

financial situation. He wrote emails stating that the Authority had essentially “put

5

themselves out of the redevelopment business and have few resources to do

6

anything else.” Kinsell also described the Authority as being “panicked” at this

7

time and believed it “needed money right away.” He noted that a third party could

8

emerge to help the Authority obtain funds for other projects.

9

47.

Third-party financing is the option the Authority ultimately pursued.

10

In particular, the Authority borrowed $35 million in a private placement offering of

11

Subordinate Tax Allocation Revenue Notes to a major commercial bank (the

12

“Bank”), on February 29, 2008.

13

48.

As part of this private placement, the Bank required the Authority to

14

enter into a forward bond purchase agreement that, in essence, obligated the

15

Authority to issue publicly offered “forward” tax increment bonds, at the time of

16

the Bank’s choosing, for the purpose of repaying, in whole or in part, the $35

17

million invested by the Bank. The Bank was not obligated to purchase any of

18

those forward bonds, and the Authority’s obligation was dependent on the

19

existence of sufficient tax increment to secure such bonds.

20

4.

The Hangars’ Assessed Value for the Private Placement

21

49.

The Authority needed sufficient tax increment revenue to repay the

22

$35 million in Subordinate Tax Allocation Revenue Notes held by the Bank.

23

Therefore, during the private placement negotiations, the Bank focused on the

24

estimated additional assessed value and resulting tax increment from any new

25

construction that had not been used to secure the December 2007 Bonds.

26

50.

On December 17, 2007, just two days after the December 2007 Bonds

27

closed, the Bank held a conference call with Williams, Metzler and the Consultant

28

to discuss the timing and amount of any new assessments, and, by virtue of being a
12 


1

factor in determining the amount of any new assessed value, the cost of any new

2

development at the Airport. As conditions for closing the private placement, the

3

Bank required, among other things, that: (1) the Consultant certify the estimated

4

tax increment revenues and compliance with the additional bonds test; and (2)

5

Metzler provide an affidavit, attached to his estimates of assessed valuations,

6

certifying that the estimates were correct to the best of his knowledge.

7

51.

Metzler prepared a spreadsheet for the Bank that, among other things,

8

set forth the estimated additional assessed values for projects not reflected in the

9

December 2007 Bonds (the “Metzler Spreadsheet”). These projects included the

10

four Hangars, as well as the expansion of a cement factory by one of the largest

11

taxpayers in the project area. The assessed value of these projects was critically

12

important to the Authority’s ability to close the private placement with the Bank.

13

52.

On January 17, 2008, Metzler reported to the Bank, Kinsell and

14

Williams that the assessor’s office informed him the cement factory’s additional

15

assessed value was just $41 million. This was tens of millions less than the

16

anticipated range of $91 million to $141 million in additional assessed value from

17

the cement factory expansion.

18

53.

That same day, Williams wrote to Kinsell that the Bank was

19

concerned about the unexpectedly low assessed valuation increase. Williams also

20

called Metzler on or about January 17, 2008 to discuss the situation, and cautioned

21

him that his assumptions need to be correct because they related to tax increment.

22

Around this time, Kinsell also expressed concern about the unexpectedly low

23

assessed value of the cement factory.

24

54.

Although the increase in the assessed value for the cement factory

25

dropped significantly from the earlier estimates, the estimated assessed value of all

26

four Hangars never changed. On January 17, 2008, Williams told the Bank that the

27

total value of the four Hangars would be $65 million. This figure had been

28
13 


1

provided by Affiliates, and was purportedly based on the Hangars’ construction

2

costs.

3

55.

On January 18, 2008, Metzler forwarded an email he received from

4

the assessor’s office to Williams showing it had assessed the values of Hangar

5

Nos. 1 and 2 at an aggregate value of only $8,779,000 for the 2007-2008 fiscal

6

year, and $8,955,000 for the 2008-2009 fiscal year. The assessor’s office also

7

informed Williams that it had not yet assessed the value of Hangar Nos. 3 and 4.

8
9

56.

These assessment figures undermined the $65 million estimate for all

four Hangars. Under this assessment, the remaining two Hangars (Nos. 3 and 4)

10

would have to be valued at approximately $56 million alone for the previously

11

provided estimate for all four Hangars of $65 million to have any validity. But the

12

remaining two Hangars could not be assessed at over $56 million. The four

13

Hangars were too similar for such a disparate valuation to be possible.

14

57.

Nevertheless, Williams and Metzler used the $65 million assessed

15

value for all four Hangars. Metzler included the $65 million value in a draft of the

16

Metzler Spreadsheet he prepared in advance of a conference call with the Bank,

17

Williams, the Authority’s counsel (“Disclosure Counsel”) and others. Williams

18

emailed the Metzler Spreadsheet to the meeting participants, as well as to Kinsell.

19

The Metzler Spreadsheet reflected: (1) the estimated $65 million assessed value

20

for all four Hangars for the 2008-2009 fiscal year; and (2) the $56,221,000 Hangar

21

valuation available for bonding in 2008-2009 (i.e., the $65 million estimated

22

assessed value for the Hangars in 2008-2009 minus the $8.779 million assessed

23

value for Hangars No. 1 and 2 in 2007-2008 ).

24

58.

The Consultant relied on the $65 million estimated assessed value

25

Metzler provided for the Hangars when it conducted its tax increment analysis.

26

The Consultant prepared a spreadsheet (the “Consultant Spreadsheet”) showing the

27

total value of new development at the Airport was $111,309,322, and that the

28

Hangars constituted $56,221,000, or over half, of that amount. The Consultant
14 


1

noted in its spreadsheet that the $56,221,000 valuation was based on “Data

2

Provided By Keith [Metzler].” On February 11, 2008, Williams emailed the

3

Consultant Spreadsheet to the Bank, Kinsell and Metzler. As alleged below, the

4

Consultant used the $111,309,322 value of the new development at the Airport,

5

which included the inflated $65 million value of the four Hangars, to determine the

6

tax increment revenue for the April 2008 Bonds.

7

59.

On February 19, 2008, the Consultant sent a letter to Metzler,

8

Williams and Disclosure Counsel setting forth the methodology it used to

9

determine its tax increment revenue projection of $22,606,356. That letter noted

10

that the assessed values in the Airport’s portion of the project area increased by

11

$111,309,322 due to new construction.

12

60.

Metzler and Williams were concerned that the assessor’s office would

13

provide assessed values for Hangar Nos. 3 and 4 that, when added to the assessed

14

values of Hangar Nos. 1 and 2, would reduce the total assessed value of the four

15

Hangars to less than $65 million. On February 19, 2008, Metzler received an

16

email that attached a voicemail from the assessor’s office alerting him that it had

17

not received construction cost information for Hangar Nos. 3 and 4. Metzler

18

forwarded the email and attached voicemail to Williams that same day and wrote:

19

“Can you follow up and make sure this happens…. My concern is without the

20

construction numbers, they will value the hangars low as the leases are not

21

commensurate with the construction costs.” Williams forwarded the email to

22

Kinsell that same day.

23

61.

As part of the closing documents for the private placement on

24

February 29, 2008, Metzler provided the final version of the Metzler Spreadsheet

25

and attached it to a signed certification stating that his estimates were true and

26

accurate based on his personal knowledge and communications with the assessor’s

27

office and the Airport’s master developer. In his certification to the Bank, Metzler

28

noted that: (1) the $65 million estimate for the Hangars was based on an estimate
15 


1

provided by Affiliates; and (2) it was possible the value could change because the

2

assessor’s office had yet to complete its valuation of the Hangars. Notably,

3

Metzler did not make a similar disclosure in connection with the April 2008 Bonds

4

sold to the public.

5

5.

The April 2008 Bond Offering

6

62.

In April 2008, the Bank exercised its option to require the Authority

7

to issue publicly offered bonds to repay part of the $35 million note.

8

Approximately $13.335 million in subordinate tax increment bonds were offered

9

on April 30, 2008 to repay part of this debt (the “April 2008 Bonds”).

10

63.

The April 2008 Bonds are at the crux of this action. The April 2008

11

Bonds were the only forward bonds the Authority was ever able to issue pursuant

12

to its forward bond purchase agreement with the Bank.

13

6.

The Hangars’ Assessed Value for the April 2008 Bond Offering

14

64.

When the Authority began preparing for the April 2008 Bond offering

15

to make the required payment to the Bank, the Consultant needed to revisit the

16

amount of available tax increment. For the April 2008 Bonds, the Consultant

17

prepared a supplement to its December 2007 Report (the “April 2008

18

Supplement”) that “contain[s] tax increment projections that supplement

19

information contained in” the December 2007 Report. The December 2007 Report

20

and the April 2008 Supplement (collectively, the April 2008 Report”) were

21

attached as Appendix D to the Official Statement for the April 2008 Bonds (the

22

“April 2008 Official Statement”). The April 2008 Official Statement also

23

references the April 2008 Report at page 23. The April 2008 Official Statement

24

and the April 2008 Report contained material information for bond investors

25

related to the bonds’ tax increment and debt service ratio.

26

65.

Like the Consultant’s spreadsheet prepared for the February 2008

27

private placement, the April 2008 Supplement included assessed values and

28

resulting increased tax increment derived from new, finalized construction and
16 


1

sales not included in the December 2007 Report. The April 2008 Supplement, at

2

Exhibit 10C on page 4, provided that the increased assessed value due to new

3

development at the Airport was $111,309,322, the same amount used in the

4

Consultant Spreadsheet prepared for the private placement.

5

66.

This $111,309,322 valuation of new development at the Airport

6

included Williams’s and Metzler’s inflated $65 million estimated value for all four

7

Hangars. The Consultant used this $111,309,322 valuation of new development at

8

the Airport to determine the tax increment revenue for the April 2008 Bonds.

9

67.

By April 2008 though, Metzler, Williams and Kinsell knew that the

10

Hangars’ $65 million estimated assessed value was no longer valid. On March 10,

11

2008, Metzler received an email from the assessor’s office informing him that

12

Hangar No. 3’s 2008-2009 assessed value was only $9,483,260. The assessor’s

13

office also informed Metzler that it had not heard from Affiliates regarding the

14

construction cost of Hangar No. 4. It further noted that if it did not hear from

15

Affiliates, the assessor’s office would assess Hangar No. 4 at the same value as

16

Hangar No. 3 because “[b]oth hangars are identical.” Metzler directed his assistant

17

to forward the assessor’s office’s email to Williams with the dictated message:

18

“FYI…lower than we expected.” Williams forwarded that email the same day,

19

copying Kinsell, and wrote that “we need to get this done ASAP this week.”

20

68.

Also on March 10, 2008, Metzler’s assistant replied to the assessor’s

21

office’s email, asking if the assessor’s office could re-send the assessed valuations

22

for Hangar Nos. 1 and 2. The assessor’s office provided those assessed values to

23

Metzler’s assistant that night. Metzler’s assistant printed out her March 10, 2008

24

email correspondence with the assessor’s office showing the assessed values for

25

Hangar Nos. 1, 2 and 3, as well as the likely assessed value for Hangar No. 4, and

26

gave it to Metzler on or about March 10, 2008.

27
28

69.

On April 16, 2008, Williams sent an email to Metzler asking him to

confirm various facts for proposed buyers of the April 2008 Bonds. Among the
17 


1

items she asked Metzler to confirm was “4 Hangars approximately $65,000,000

2

based on construction value.” Metzler’s assistant responded at his direction to

3

Williams the same day by email, attaching the assessor’s office’s March 10, 2008

4

emails containing the assessed valuations for Hangar Nos. 1, 2 and 3, and the likely

5

assessed valuation for Hangar No. 4. That same day, Williams forwarded the

6

email, along with the attached assessor’s office’s email, to Kinsell.

7

70.

Assuming Hangar No. 4 would be assessed at the same value as

8

Hangar No. 3, the total assessed values of the four Hangars would have been $27.7

9

million for 2007-2008 and $27.9 million for 2008-2009. In either case, this

10

valuation is less than half the estimated value of $65 million that was used in the

11

April 2008 Supplement, referenced in and attached to the Official Statement.

12

71.

The minimum 1.25 annual debt service ratio for the April 2008 Bond

13

offering was only achieved because the approximate $111.3 million valuation of

14

new development at the Airport included the inflated $65 million valuation of the

15

four Hangars.

16

7.

The False and Misleading April 2008 Official Statement

17

72.

Page 24 of the April 2008 Official Statement contained a debt service

18

schedule listing the annual tax increment and debt service ratios for the April 2008

19

Bonds (the “Debt Service Schedule”). One column on that schedule listed the tax

20

increment for every bond year (the “Total Non-Housing Increment”); another

21

column showed an “all-in,” “no growth” debt service ratio of 1.26 for 2008

22

(representing tax increment revenues of $22,606,356 and total debt service of

23

$17,825,734), and 1.25 for every bond year thereafter.

24

73.

KND, which through Williams and Kinsell knew that the estimated

25

assessed value of the Hangars was inflated, prepared the Debt Service Schedule.

26

The figures KND used in the Total Non-Housing Increment column of the Debt

27

Service Schedule relied on the inflated value of the Hangars, and came from the

28
18 


1

“Total Pledge Revenue” column of Exhibit 10A on page 2 of the Consultant’s

2

April 2008 Supplement, which was attached to the April 2008 Official Statement.

3

74.

The statements regarding the tax increment and the debt service ratios

4

in the April 2008 Official Statement and the attached April 2008 Supplement were

5

false and misleading.

6

75.

Neither the Consultant nor Disclosure Counsel knew that the tax

7

increment analysis in the April 2008 Report relied on false and inflated Hangar

8

values overstating the tax increment revenue. Williams, Kinsell and Metzler each

9

failed to inform Disclosure Counsel that the $65 million estimated assessed value

10

of the Hangars was wrong. As a result, the Debt Service Schedule in the April

11

2008 Official Statement and Exhibits 10A and 10C of the April 2008 Supplement

12

overstated the tax increment available to secure those bonds and to repay investors.

13

76.

The Debt Service Schedule also overstated the debt service ratio for

14

the offering. The Authority only met the required 1.25 minimum annual debt

15

service ratio because it used the overstated Hangar valuation. Therefore, the Debt

16

Service Schedule failed to disclose a debt service ratio based on an accurate

17

valuation of the four Hangars. Had the Authority used the accurate valuation, it

18

would have failed to meet the minimum 1.25 ratio in every bond year after 2008.

19

77.

Moreover, because of the overstated values of the Hangars and

20

resulting false disclosure of the tax increment and annual debt service ratio, the

21

April 2008 Bonds were substantially oversized.

22

78.

The tax increment and debt service ratio misrepresentations and

23

omissions in the April 2008 Official Statement and the April 2008 Supplement

24

were material. The tax increment securing the April 2008 Bonds and the annual

25

debt ratios disclosed in the Debt Service Schedule were critical factors investors

26

used to determine how they would be repaid. Moreover, the market required the

27

1.25 debt service ratio, which ensured that the Authority’s total projected annual

28

tax increment revenue would be 25% greater than the total annual debt service
19 


1

payments for each year bonds would be outstanding, thereby providing a safety net

2

in the event assessed property values in the project area suffered unexpected losses.

3

Meeting the annual debt service ratio of 1.25 was also a prerequisite to the issuance

4

of the bonds under the indenture. Moreover, the credit rating agencies focused on

5

the debt service ratio, and a ratio below 1.25 would have affected the credit quality

6

of the April 2008 Bonds.

default, and as of April 2013 were trading at roughly forty-five cents on the dollar.

The Defendants’ Roles in the April 2008 Official Statement
a.

10
11

The December 2007 Bonds and April 2008 Bonds are currently in

80.

The Authority, the City and Metzler

As the issuer, the Authority had ultimate authority over all of the

12

contents of the Official Statements and the attached Consultant reports, including

13

the April 2008 Official Statement and the attached April 2008 Supplement.

14

81.

Metzler played a significant role in connection with the Authority’s

15

tax increment bond offerings, including the April 2008 Bonds. He had intimate

16

knowledge of the projects at the Airport, and understood tax increment financing

17

and how annual debt service ratios are calculated.

18

82.

Although the Authority’s Official Statements were drafted initially by

19

Disclosure Counsel, these drafts were circulated to an unofficial disclosure

20

committee for comments. Metzler was a member of this committee. Working at

21

the direction of the City Manager, who also served as the Executive Director of the

22

Authority, Metzler worked with the Disclosure Counsel and the underwriters at

23

KND to draft sections of the Official Statements. He took the lead in drafting

24

some of the disclosure language concerning the Authority’s redevelopment

25

projects.

26

83.

Metzler was the Authority’s “point person” concerning its Official

27

Statements for all of the bond issuances, including the April 2008 Official

28

Statement. He communicated with the ratings agencies, gave presentations to
20 


1

potential investors and transmitted the county assessor’s most recent assessed

2

value figures to the Consultant. The Executive Director specifically tasked

3

Metzler with obtaining and providing the taxable assessed valuation data to the

4

Consultant, and with reviewing the Official Statements to ensure they were

5

accurate. In signing the April 2008 Official Statement, the Executive Director

6

relied on Metzler’s work and due diligence. Disclosure Counsel and the

7

underwriter looked to Metzler as the Authority’s representative to approve the

8

Official Statements. As such, Metzler and his employer, the City, substantially

9

assisted in the making of the misstatements and omissions in the April 2008

10
11

Official Statement regarding the inflated tax increment and debt service ratios.
84.

Metzler knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the April 2008

12

Official Statement materially misstated the tax increment and debt service ratio for

13

the April 2008 Bonds. Because he was an employee of the City, and reported to

14

the City Manager, the City had actual knowledge of, or was reckless in not

15

knowing, the falsity and misleading nature of these misstatements.

16

85.

Moreover, Metzler was the agent for the Authority with regard to

17

content in the Authority’s Official Statements. The Authority authorized him to

18

perform acts and communicate on its behalf in connection with the Authority’s

19

bond offerings. Therefore, the Authority had actual knowledge of, or was reckless

20

in not knowing, the falsity and misleading nature of the misstatements concerning

21

the tax increments and the debt service ratio.
b.

22
23

86.

KND, Kinsell and Williams

KND, as the underwriter, had ultimate authority over the portions of

24

the Official Statements it prepared, including the false and misleading Debt

25

Service Schedule in the April 2008 Official Statement. KND’s name was also

26

prominently featured on the first page of the Official Statement for each bond

27

offering that it underwrote for the Authority.

28
21 


87.

1

Kinsell and Williams knew that the April 2008 Official Statement

2

materially misstated the tax increment and debt service ratio for the bonds.

3

Williams was a member of the informal disclosure committee for the Official

4

Statement, and both Kinsell and Williams reviewed and commented on draft

5

official statements, the April 2008 Supplement and other documents related to the

6

April 2008 Bonds. Despite knowing that the $65 million estimated assessed value

7

of the Hangars was wrong, Williams nonetheless used the April 2008 Supplement

8

to determine the size of the April 2008 Bonds and to generate the false Debt

9

Service Schedule in the April 2008 Official Statement. The annual debt service

10

ratios were critical to Williams’s sizing calculation because they limited the

11

principal amount of the bond offering. As such, Kinsell and Williams, along with

12

KND, substantially assisted the Authority in making that false and misleading

13

April 2008 Official Statement. Moreover, Kinsell and Williams substantially

14

assisted KND in making the false and misleading Official Statement.
88.

15

Because Williams and Kinsell were employees of KND, KND had

16

actual knowledge that the April 2008 Official Statement, the April 2008

17

Supplement attached as an appendix and the Debt Service Schedule were false and

18

misleading.

19

E.

20

Kinsell, Affiliates and KND’s Scheme to Misappropriate Bond Proceeds
89.

Kinsell, Affiliates and KND, which underwrote the Authority’s bond

21

offerings from November 2006 through 2008, misappropriated over $2.7 million of

22

bond proceeds from the Authority and bondholders in connection with the project

23

to construct the four Hangars.

24

1.

The Unauthorized Construction Management Fees

25

90.

Affiliates misappropriated bond proceeds of at least $450,534 from

26

the Authority and the bondholders in the form of unauthorized and excessive

27

construction management fees.

28
22 


1

91.

By mid-2006, the Authority and Kinsell learned of allegations that the

2

developer for the Hangars project had not been paying the subcontractors and that

3

the developer’s principal had likely diverted some of the bond proceeds from the

4

project for his own personal use.

5

92.

Kinsell reached a “handshake deal” in June or July 2006 with the

6

Executive Director of the Authority whereby Kinsell, through Affiliates, would

7

oversee the project. Although formed earlier in 2002, the sole purpose of Affiliates

8

after June 2006 was to develop the Hangars. Kinsell is one of two managing

9

members of Affiliates, each of whom holds a 50% interest in the company. Kinsell

10

had no construction experience but retained a longtime friend as the new contractor

11

to complete construction of the Hangars.

12

93.

Although that “handshake deal” was never reduced to a written

13

contract, all of the parties understood that it was a “cost plus 10% construction

14

management fee” arrangement. In a memorandum Kinsell sent on October 18,

15

2006 to Disclosure Counsel and to Authority representatives, Kinsell confirmed

16

that a 10% construction management fee would be charged “where necessary for a

17

general contractor to be involved.” He also explained that he was “dividing these

18

monies by eight (8%) to [the new contractor] and two percent (2%) to Affiliates for

19

the overall project coordination.” Thus, although Affiliates was not actually

20

building the Hangars, it would be paid this 2% to oversee the use of the funds and

21

to perform “fund control.”

22

94.

In July 2006, the Authority approved Affiliates’s new role, and, over

23

the next two years, made five separate loans totaling $60.38 million to Affiliates.

24

These loans included $22.2 million lent in August 2006, which was used: (1) to

25

immediately pay over $12 million to disgruntled subcontractors and $6 million to

26

the original developer to resolve various claims; and (2) to pay a portion of the

27

remaining costs necessary to complete the Hangars.

28
23 


1

95.

All of the loans made to Affiliates were funded from the proceeds of

2

bonds or notes issued by the Authority and underwritten or placed by KND.

3

Affiliates placed these lump sum amounts into bank accounts in its name, and there

4

was little, if any, oversight regarding how Affiliates spent these bond funds.

5

96.

Periodically throughout the construction of the Hangars, Affiliates

6

paid the new contractor the 10% construction management fee that had been

7

earned as of that date. The contractor retained its 8% share of the fee and

8

“rebated” back to Affiliates the 2% fee owed to Affiliates, totaling not more than

9

$865,990 from October 2006 through October 2010.

10

97.

However, Affiliates actually took at least $1,316,524 as the 2%

11

construction management fee, or at least $450,534 more than the amount that was

12

“rebated” back to it by the contractor. Affiliates simply took this excess – and

13

unauthorized – construction management fee directly from the bond proceeds the

14

Authority loaned Affiliates to construct the Hangars.

15

98.

Affiliates collected the unauthorized 2% construction management fee

16

based on expenses incurred in August 2006 that had nothing to do with the

17

remaining costs of construction, such as the payments to subcontractors for prior

18

work and the payment to the original developer to settle claims. Thus, before

19

KND underwrote bonds for the Authority in November 2006, Kinsell and KND

20

knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Affiliates planned to charge more than

21

the authorized 2% construction management fee and did not disclose this

22

information to investors.

23

2.

The Unauthorized “Property Management” Fees

24

99.

Affiliates also charged the Authority a fictitious and unauthorized

25

15% “property management fee” to misappropriate an additional $2.3 million –

26

purportedly to “manage” the Hangars for the Authority.

100. Kinsell told Affiliates’s CFO in August 2006 that Affiliates was
earning the property management fee as a result of Kinsell’s discussion with the
24 


1

Executive Director of the Authority. This was false. Kinsell never told the

2

Executive Director about the property management fees, and the Authority never

3

authorized or agreed to pay the purported property management fee taken by

4

Affiliates. In addition to the absence of any document confirming the property

5

management fee agreement, the Executive Director lacked the authority to enter

6

into any verbal agreement above $1,500 and any written agreement exceeding

7

$125,000 per year, limitations that Kinsell generally understood.

8
9

101. To keep track of the property management fees, Kinsell directed
Affiliates’s CFO to begin accruing the 15% property management fee based on

10

what Kinsell claimed were the “market rates” for the Hangar rents, as opposed to

11

the actual rents collected, which were much lower. Affiliates’s CFO prepared an

12

internal spreadsheet showing that Affiliates was purportedly accruing the fees as

13

early as March 2006, several months before KND underwrote the November 2006

14

Parity and Revenue Bonds. The Official Statements for these bonds did not

15

disclose this property management fee or the resulting conflict of interest.

16

102. Although Affiliates began accruing these fees as early as March 2006,

17

it did not take any of the property fees until much of the Hangars project was

18

complete. Specifically, the CFO’s spreadsheet shows that Affiliates accrued

19

property management fees of $3,657,540 from March 2006 until June 2011, when

20

the Hangars were finally returned to the Authority. But Affiliates only

21

misappropriated $2,295,322 of these accrued fees because, as Kinsell explained, by

22

2009 or 2010 “the money ran out.” Indeed, Affiliates’s bank records confirm that

23

only $32,187 remained in its accounts as of December 2009.

24

103. Kinsell used a significant portion of the unauthorized property

25

management fees collected by Affiliates to pay the expenses of KND and its parent

26

company, Holdings. In October 2007 Affiliates transferred $25,000 to Holdings

27

with the notation “payroll” and, just a day before the April 2008 Bonds were

28

issued, Affiliates lent Holdings $100,000. In July 2008, KND agreed to
25 


1

immediately pay $4 million to the U.S. Treasury to settle unrelated I.R.S. claims

2

involving advance refunding municipal bonds underwritten by KND between 1993

3

and 2003. Beginning at that time and continuing through at least June 2011,

4

Affiliates transferred over $1 million in unauthorized property management fees to

5

Holdings. Without the funds from Affiliates, it would have been difficult for KND

6

to pay its employees.

7
8

3.	

Kinsell, KND and Affiliates’s Lulling and Concealment of the
Property Management Fees from the Authority

9

104. Throughout the scheme, Kinsell and Affiliates misled Authority

10

representatives and hid the fact that Affiliates was earning a property management

11

fee. For example, in an October 18, 2006 memorandum to the Authority, Kinsell

12

wrote that “KND Affiliates will provide a full accounting to-date of the

13

Authority’s loan proceeds and then on a monthly basis,” but Kinsell never did so.

14

Moreover, on November 2, 2007, Affiliates’s CFO provided the Deputy City

15

Attorney with a spreadsheet showing the operating expenses of each Hangar, but it

16

did not include the 15% monthly property management fee. Further, on May 16,

17

2008, Affiliates’s CFO provided the Authority’s Director of Finance with an

18

“operating expenses spreadsheet,” but it did not include any reference to the

19

property management fee.

20

105. In March 2008, the City hired an independent audit firm to review

21

Affiliates’s books and records and identify all related party transactions.

22

Affiliates’s CFO disclosed the 2% construction management fee to the auditors,

23

but not the property management fee. Around the same time, in February 2008,

24

the Director of Finance personally visited Affiliates’s office to review its books

25

and did not see any indication that Affiliates was earning a property management

26

fee. Kinsell failed to tell the auditors or the Director of Finance about the property

27

management fees.

28
26 


1

106. Kinsell and Affiliates waited until late 2008, after the auditors and the

2

Director of Finance had completed their on-site review of Affiliates’s books and

3

records, to begin transferring the unauthorized property management fees out of

4

Affiliates’s bank account.

5

107. On October 15, 2008, the Director of Finance emailed Kinsell about

6

transferring the Hangars back to the Authority and confirmed that any unused loan

7

proceeds would revert back to the City, to which Kinsell agreed. In November

8

2008 and September 2009, the contractor hired by Kinsell to construct the

9

Hangars, acting at the direction of Affiliates, provided detailed accountings to the

10

Director of Finance. On November 10, 2008, the contractor provided the Director

11

of Finance with a detailed accounting that stated that Affiliates held excess funds

12

and contingency funds totaling over $2 million. The September 2009 accounting

13

showed that Affiliates held at least $1.5 million in excess funds and contingency

14

funds. These accountings, however, were false. As of September 2009, only

15

$644,391 remained in Affiliates’s bank accounts. Kinsell reviewed both

16

accountings but never told the contractor or the Authority that the majority of the

17

excess bond proceeds had already been taken by Affiliates, allegedly as property

18

management fees.

19

108. From 2010 through June 2011, after many key individuals initially

20

involved with the Hangars had left the Authority, Kinsell continued to conceal the

21

property management fees as new Authority representatives negotiated the transfer

22

of the Hangars back to the Authority. Kinsell misled these representatives by

23

repeatedly characterizing himself as the “good guy” and “white knight” who had

24

“bailed the City out of the mess that they were in.” He further represented to the

25

new City Manager that he had not made any money on the Hangar transaction. As

26

of February 2010, Kinsell claimed that there were no construction funds left.

27

109. In September 2010, when the new City Manager asked questions

28

about the Hangars, Kinsell told him to look at the report from the independent
27 


1

audit firm that reviewed Affiliates’s books and records. Kinsell claimed the report

2

set forth “the fees being charged by KND Affiliates for management services,” but

3

Kinsell did not tell him that the report excluded any reference to the property

4

management fees collected by Affiliates because Kinsell had concealed those fees

5

from the auditors.

6

110. After many months of negotiations, the Authority voted and approved

7

paying Kinsell and Affiliates an additional $40,000 for anticipated tax liabilities

8

Kinsell claimed he would personally incur when the Hangars were transferred back

9

to the Authority.

10

4.

KND and Williams’s Lack of Disclosure of the Fees

11

111. None of the Official Statements for the bonds the Authority issued

12

between November 2006 and April 2008 disclosed to investors that Affiliates

13

received more than the agreed upon 2% construction management fee or that

14

Affiliates, an entity related to Kinsell and KND, was accruing an unauthorized

15

property management fee.

16

112. Affiliates received $9.9 million of proceeds from the November 2006

17

Parity Bonds, which, for a fee of $437,250, had been underwritten by KND. The

18

Official Statement for the November 2006 Parity Bonds did not disclose that: (1)

19

Affiliates was acting as construction manager of the Hangars and was receiving a

20

2% construction management fee; (2) Affiliates had already received $22,200,000

21

in bond proceeds from the Authority; or (3) Affiliates was accruing an

22

unauthorized property management fee.

23

113. On November 21, 2006, the Authority issued the November 2006

24

Revenue Bonds, which KND underwrote for a fee of $802,000. Affiliates received

25

$13.6 million of the proceeds from that offering. The Official Statement disclosed

26

that Affiliates had taken over the Hangars from the prior developer and that “[f]or

27

its efforts in overseeing the completion of the Hangar-Facilities, KND Affiliates is

28

in negotiations with the Authority to receive a construction management fee in an
28 


1

amount no greater than 2% of the remaining costs to complete the Hangar

2

Facilities . . .” Although this Official Statement disclosed Affiliates’s anticipated

3

role as construction manager and its 2% fee, KND and Kinsell concealed from

4

investors that Affiliates also charged a 2% fee for costs that were unrelated to the

5

remaining construction and that Affiliates was also accruing an unauthorized 15%

6

monthly property management fee.

7

114. On February 29, 2008, the Authority issued the $35 million in

8

Subordinate Tax Allocation Revenue Notes in the private placement with the

9

Bank. KND received a fee of $262,500 as the placement agent. That same date,

10

Affiliates received $10.4 million of the proceeds from this private placement to

11

build the Hangars.

12

115. During this 2007-2008 time period, KND underwrote other bonds

13

issued by the Authority. Although none of the proceeds of these issuances went to

14

Affiliates, it was not disclosed to investors that Affiliates was taking unauthorized

15

property management and excess construction management fees that came from

16

prior bonds issued by the Authority and underwritten by KND. These include the

17

following bonds: (1) Taxable Housing Set-Aside Revenue Parity Bonds in March

18

2007 in the amount of $41,460,000 for which KND received an underwriter’s fee

19

of $518,250; (2) the December 2007 Bonds for which KND received an

20

underwriter’s fee of $735,000; and (3) the April 2008 Bonds for which KND

21

received an underwriter’s fee of $133,349.

22

116. The misstatements and omissions in the Official Statements for the

23

Authority’s bonds from November 2006 through April 2008 were material because

24

a reasonable investor would want to know about an undisclosed financial

25

arrangement such as here, where an entity related to the underwriter, like

26

Affiliates, received unauthorized proceeds from bonds underwritten by KND.

27

These misstatements and omissions were also material to the Authority because

28

such fees increased the costs of issuing the bonds.
29 


1
2

F.

KND’s, Kinsell’s and Williams’s Due Diligence Failures
117. KND, through Williams and Kinsell, served as the underwriter in

3

negotiated offerings with the Authority and therefore substantially participated in

4

the preparation of the Authority’s Official Statements for the bonds. KND’s name

5

appeared prominently on the first page of each Official Statement. KND also

6

recommended and sold the Authority’s municipal securities to investors. In so

7

doing, KND made an implied representation it had reviewed the accuracy of the

8

Authority’s Official Statements and formed a reasonable basis for belief in the

9

truthfulness and completeness of the key representations made therein.

10

118. Kinsell and Williams worked on behalf of KND to underwrite the

11

bonds. In that regard, each reviewed and commented on draft Official Statements,

12

the Consultant Reports, indentures and other bond documents. Both Kinsell and

13

Williams had authority to sign the bond purchase agreements. Although Williams

14

was responsible on a day-to-day basis, she made sure to copy Kinsell on emails

15

and to talk to him daily about the bonds. Indeed, the Authority was Kinsell’s client

16

and he had hands-on involvement with regard to the Authority’s bond offerings.

17

119. Notwithstanding its obligation as an underwriter, KND’s implicit

18

representations regarding its due diligence were false. First, as alleged above, the

19

April 2008 Official Statement, the Debt Service Schedule and the April 2008

20

Supplement misstated the tax increment and debt service ratios based on inflated

21

assessed values of the Hangars. Kinsell and Williams substantially assisted in

22

preparing the Official Statement, and each knew the April 2008 Supplement relied

23

on the inflated $65 million estimated assessed value of the Hangars, but omitted to

24

disclose the estimate was no longer valid. As set forth above, on two separate

25

occasions before the April 2008 Bonds were issued, Williams and Kinsell received

26

emails from the assessor’s offices showing that the Hangars’ $65 million estimated

27

assessed value was inflated by more than 100%.

28
30 


120. Second, KND’s lack of disclosure regarding the construction and

1
2

property management fees paid to Affiliates in connection with the Authority’s

3

bonds from November 2006 through April 2008 was misleading. Kinsell

4

substantially assisted in preparing the Official Statements, and knew that these fees

5

were being accrued by Affiliates. Despite this knowledge, none of the Official

6

Statements for those bonds disclosed to investors that Affiliates received more than

7

the agreed upon 2% construction management fee or that Affiliates, an entity

8

related to Kinsell and KND, was accruing an unauthorized property management

9

fee.

10

121. Following the April 2008 Bond offering, Kinsell decided to transition

11

from investment banker to financial advisor for the City in order to assist the City

12

with a power plant project. Kinsell expressly acknowledged that in his new role as

13

financial advisor, he was a fiduciary to the City, yet he never disclosed that

14

Affiliates was taking unauthorized management fees from bond proceeds issued by

15

the Authority.
