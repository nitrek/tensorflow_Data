REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

In the Matter of
STALIN ANTONIO ASENJO,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to
Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against Stalin Antonio
Asenjo (“Asenjo” or “Respondent”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent admits the Commission’s
jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, and the findings contained in
Sections III.B.1. below, and consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative
Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings,
and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:

A.

RESPONDENT

1.
Respondent acted as a stock promoter for various microcap issuers and
participated in an offering of Blackbird International Corporation (“BBRD”) stock, which is a
penny stock. BBRD had retained Asenjo’s services as a promoter. Respondent, 42 years old, is a
resident of Winter Park, Florida.
B.

RESPONDENT’S CRIMINAL CONVICTION

1.
In mid-June 2015, Asenjo pleaded guilty plea to one count of wire fraud in
violation of Title 18 United States Code, Section 1343 before the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Florida. United States v. Stalin Antonio Asenjo, Case No. 15-60112-CRZLOCH/HUNT. On August 31, 2015, a judgment in the criminal case was entered against Asenjo.
He was sentenced to three years of probation.
2.
As part of his guilty plea, Respondent stipulated that from February 27,
2012 through June 22, 2012, he engaged in a scheme to fraudulently manipulate the stock of BBRD
by artificially inflating its trading volume and share price through contrived purchases. The
misconduct underlying the criminal charges occurred during the period in which Asenjo was
participating in a penny stock offering.

IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act,
that Respondent be, and hereby is, barred from participating in any offering of a penny stock,
including: acting as a promoter, finder, consultant, agent or other person who engages in activities
with a broker, dealer or issuer for purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny stock, or
inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
