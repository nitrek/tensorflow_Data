In the Matter of
MASSACHUSETTS FINANCIAL
SERVICES COMPANY, JOHN W.
BALLEN AND KEVIN R. PARKE

ORDER MODIFYING
DISTRIBUTION PLAN AND
DIRECTING DISBURSEMENT

Respondents.

On July 19, 2006, the Commission published a notice of the proposed Plan of
Distribution proposed by the Division of Enforcement in connection with this proceeding
(Exchange Act Release No. 54175). The Commission received comments and, on July
24, 2007, the Plan of Distribution was approved after certain clarifying modifications
were made. See Exchange Act Release No. 56122 (July 24, 2007) (Order Approving
Modified Distribution Plan). The Order approving the Modified Plan of Distribution was
subsequently revised. See Exchange Act Release No. 56527 (September 25, 2007)
(Revised Order Approving Modified Distribution Plan).
The Modified Plan of Distribution (“Plan”) provides that a Fair Fund consisting of
disgorgement and civil penalties, plus amounts from third parties and any accrued
interest, be transferred in portions to Deutsche Bank to be distributed by the Fund
Administrator to injured investors according to the methodology set forth in the Plan.
Pursuant to the Plan, and following a series of Orders Directing Disbursement, the
Independent Distribution Consultant (“IDC”) and the Fund Administrator, in a series of

1 


thirteen tranches, distributed $312,042,489.07 to injured investors.1 There is a significant
amount remaining in the Fair Fund after those amounts were distributed, which is
considered Residual Distributions pursuant to the Plan. Paragraph 20 of the Plan
provides that any Residual Distributions shall be distributed pro rata to the MFS Funds,
based on each Fund’s percentage of Losses estimated from all Funds during the Period to
which this matter relates.
A significant portion of the Residual Distributions is comprised of amounts that
were distributed but which were not claimed (i.e. checks that were not presented for
payment within the time period prescribed by the Plan and checks that were returned to
the Fund Administrator as undeliverable). Consistent with the Plan’s primary objective
to distribute funds directly to affected investors at the time of the misconduct and with
the concurrence of the IDC and MFS, the Plan is modified in the following respects:
A.
Additional Steps: The IDC and the Fund Administrator will take the
following additional steps (“Additional Steps”) relating to the distribution: (1)
make further commercially reasonable efforts to locate investors who are entitled
to a check in the amount of $5,000 or more and whose original check was
returned as undeliverable; (2) reissue and mail checks to any investors located as
a result of the efforts described in (1) above; (3) reissue and mail all checks in the
amount of $100 or more to investors who failed to present those checks for
payment within the time prescribed by the Plan and whose check was not
otherwise previously reissued; (4) reissue checks totaling $82,510.02 to certain
Southwest Securities, Inc. accountholders whose accounts were
undercompensated as a result of administrative error.
B.
Stale Dates for Reissued Checks: Checks reissued as a result of the
Additional Steps shall have a stale date of 60 days after issuance. The IDC may,
in his discretion, reissue a check which was issued pursuant to the Additional
Steps (to replace a lost or damaged check, for example), but only if the request for
reissuance is made before the stale date of the original reissued check (i.e. within
60 days after original reissuance). Any check so reissued will have a stale date no
later than 30 days after the stale date of the original reissued check. Except as
provided in this paragraph, the IDC will not reissue any other checks. The
procedures in Paragraph 11 of the Plan which provide for Proof of Possible
Entitlement and Dispute Forms shall not be applicable to any reissued check.

C.
Remaining Uncashed Checks to be Returned to Residual: Any checks
issued pursuant to the Additional Steps which remain uncashed after their stale
date or which are returned as undeliverable, shall be cancelled and returned to the
Qualified Settlement Fund as Residual Distributions to be distributed as part of
the Second Residual Distribution, described in Paragraph G, below.
D.
Costs of Additional Steps: MFS will pay, but shall be reimbursed from the
Fair Fund for actual costs attributable to the Additional Steps which are found not
to be unreasonable by the IDC, including without limitation, costs and fees of the
Fund Administrator. MFS will pay, but shall be reimbursed from the Fair Fund
for the Fees and Expenses of the IDC which are attributable to the Additional
Steps which are found not to be unreasonable by the Commission staff. Such
reimbursable costs, however are not to exceed $475,000 (“Total Reimbursable
Amount”). Costs incurred by the Fund Administrator which are not attributable
to the Additional Steps, as determined by the IDC, shall be borne by MFS in
accordance with Paragraph 2(b) of the Plan and shall not be reimbursed from the
Qualified Settlement Fund. Fees and expenses of the IDC which are not
attributable to the Additional Steps, as determined by the staff of the Commission,
shall be borne by MFS in accordance with the Order Instituting Administrative
and Cease and Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 203(e), 203(f) and 203(k)
of the Advisers Act of 1940 and Section 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company
Act of 1940 and Making Findings and imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease
and Desist Order, dated February 5, 2004, (“February 2004 Order”) and shall not
be reimbursed from the Qualified Settlement Fund. Costs attributable to the
Additional Steps but which exceed the Total Reimbursable Amount shall not be
reimbursed.
E.
Amount to be Reserved From Residual: The amount of $35,657,789 will
be reserved from the Fair Fund (“Reserved Amount”) to pay (1) any reissues
which result from the Additional Steps; (2) the reimbursable costs of the
Additional Steps as described above; and (3) estimated tax liabilities of the Fund.
F.
First Residual Distribution: The current balance of the Qualified
Settlement Fund less the Reserved Amount shall be considered Residual
Distributions and shall be distributed to the affected MFS Funds in accordance
with the Plan. Those Residual Distributions may be made while the Additional
Steps are being taken.
G.
Second Residual Distribution: After the stale date for all checks reissued
as a result of the Additional Steps, any funds from the Reserved Amount
remaining in the Qualified Settlement Fund, shall be considered Residual
Distributions. Upon certification that a validated payment file has been received
by Commission staff and the distribution information has also been received by
the affected mutual funds, the Secretary shall issue an Order to Disburse those
Residual Distributions pursuant to the Plan.
