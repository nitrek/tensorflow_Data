ORDER APPROVING
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

Respondents.

On September 13, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”)
issued an Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings pursuant to Section 15(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 203(e), 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Making Findings, and
Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) against Sarkauskas and
Associates and James M. Sarkauskas (collectively, “Respondents”).1 The Order found, among
other things, that Respondents purchased for their clients unit investment trust (“UIT”) units that
included transactional sales charges without disclosing that identical UIT units with no
transactional sales charges could be purchased. Respondents’ failure to disclose this information
resulted in their substantially increasing their compensation at the expense of their clients, which
created a conflict of interest. The Order required Respondents to pay disgorgement
($331,433.98), prejudgment interest ($18,403.22) and a civil monetary penalty ($100,000). In
accordance with the Order, Respondents paid a total of $449,837.20 in disgorgement,
prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties to the Commission.
The Order created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, as amended, for the funds paid by the Respondents (the “Fair Fund”). The Fair Fund is

subject to the continuing jurisdiction and control of the Commission and the Fair Fund is
currently on deposit in a Commission designated interest-bearing account at the United States
Department of the Treasury.
On December 24, 2015, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution and Opportunity for Comment2 (“Notice”) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans. 3 The Notice advised interested
parties that they could obtain a copy of the proposed Plan of Distribution (“Plan”) from the
Commission’s public website at http://www.sec.gov/litigation/fairfundlist.htm or by submitting a
written request to Michael S. Lim, United States Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F
Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549-5631.
The Notice also advised that all persons desiring to comment on the Plan could submit
their comments, in writing, no later than thirty (30) days from the publication of the Notice (1) to
the Office of the Secretary, United States Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street,
NE, Washington, DC 20549-1090; (2) by using the Commission’s Internet comment form
(http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin.shtml); or (3) by sending an e-mail to rulecomments@sec.gov. The Commission received no comments on the Plan.
The Fair Fund is comprised of the amounts of disgorgement ($331,433.98), prejudgment
interest ($18,403.22) and a civil monetary penalty ($100,000). As set forth in the Plan, the
proposed methodology allocates the Fair Fund by calculating the Total Overage plus Lost
Interest Earnings to calculate the Total Present Value Harm suffered for each Eligible Investor.
If the Net Fair Fund is less than the Total Present Value Harm, Eligible Investor’s will receive
their Pro Rata share of the Net Fair Fund.
The Division of Enforcement now requests that the Commission approve the Plan.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 1104 of the Commission’s Rules
on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans,4 that the Plan is approved.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Secretary
