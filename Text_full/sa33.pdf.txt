known as a ‘‘security’’, or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any
of the foregoing.
(2) The term ‘‘person’’ means an individual, a corporation,
a partnership, an association, a joint-stock company, a trust,
any unincorporated organization, or a government or political

shall include only a trust where the interest or interests of the
beneficiary or beneficiaries are evidenced by a security.
(3) The term ‘‘sale’’ or ‘‘sell’’ shall include every contract of
sale or disposition of a security or interest in a security, for
value. The term ‘‘offer to sell’’, ‘‘offer for sale’’, or ‘‘offer’’ shall
include every attempt or offer to dispose of, or solicitation of

The terms defined in this paragraph and the term ‘‘offer to

directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by an issuer, or
under direct or indirect common control with an issuer). Any
security given or delivered with, or as a bonus on account of,
any purchase of securities or any other thing, shall be conclusively presumed to constitute a part of the subject of such purchase and to have been offered and sold for value. The issue

of such right of conversion or subscription shall be deemed a
sale of such other security. Any offer or sale of a security futures product by or on behalf of the issuer of the securities underlying the security futures product, an affiliate of the issuer,

government, or political subdivision thereof, it need be signed only
by the underwriter of such security. Signatures of all such persons
when written on the said registration statements shall be presumed to have been so written by authority of the person whose
signature is so affixed and the burden of proof, in the event such
authority shall be denied, shall be upon the party denying the
same. The affixing of any signature without the authority of the

succeeding fiscal year such fee shall be adjusted pursuant to
paragraph (2).
(2) ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT.—For each fiscal year, the Commission shall by order adjust the rate required by paragraph

collections under this subsection that are equal to the target
fee collection amount for such fiscal year.
(3) PRO RATA APPLICATION.—The rates per $1,000,000 required by this subsection shall be applied pro rata to amounts
and balances of less than $1,000,000.
(4) REVIEW AND EFFECTIVE DATE.—In exercising its authority under this subsection, the Commission shall not be required
to comply with the provisions of section 553 of title 5, United
States Code. An adjusted rate prescribed under paragraph (2)
and published under paragraph (5) shall not be subject to judicial review. An adjusted rate prescribed under paragraph (2)
shall take effect on the first day of the fiscal year to which
such rate applies.
(5) PUBLICATION.—The Commission shall publish in the
Federal Register notices of the rate applicable under this subsection and under sections 13(e) and 14(g) for each fiscal year
not later than August 31 of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
year to which such rate applies, together with any estimates
or projections on which such rate is based.
(6) DEFINITIONS.—For purposes of this subsection:
(A) TARGET OFFSETTING [9] COLLECTION AMOUNT.—The
target fee collection amount for each fiscal year is determined

estimate of the aggregate maximum offering price at which
securities are proposed to be offered pursuant to registration statements filed with the Commission during such fiscal year as determined by the Commission, after consultation with the Congressional Budget Office and the Office
of Management and Budget, using the methodology required for projections pursuant to section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.
(c) The filing with the Commission of a registration statement,
or of an amendment to a registration statement, shall be deemed
to have taken place upon the receipt thereof, but the filing of a registration statement shall not be deemed to have taken place unless

statement shall be made available to the public under such regulations as the Commission may prescribe, and copies thereof, photostatic or otherwise, shall be furnished to every applicant at such

amendments thereto shall be publicly filed with the Commission not later than 21 days before the date on which the issuer
conducts a road show, as such term is defined in section

Schedule A, and when relating to a security issued by a foreign
government, or political subdivision thereof, shall contain the
information, and be accompanied by the documents, specified

having prepared or certified any part of the registration statement, or is named as having prepared or certified a report or
valuation for use in connection with the registration statement,
the written consent of such person shall be filed with the registration statement. If any such person is named as having
prepared or certified a report or valuation (other than a public
official document or statement) which is used in connection
with the registration statement, but is not named as having
prepared or certified such report or valuation for use in connection with the registration statement, the written consent of
such person shall be filed with the registration statement unless the Commission dispenses with such filing as impracticable or as involving undue hardship on the person filing the

other documents, as the Commission may by rules or regulations require as being necessary or appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of investors.

any period prior to the earliest audited period presented in

company that is not an issuer (as defined under section
2(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7201(a)))
is required to comply with such new or revised accounting
standard, if such standard applies to companies that are
not issuers.
(b)(1) The Commission shall prescribe special rules with respect to registration statements filed by any issuer that is a blank
check company. Such rules may, as the Commission determines
necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection
of investors—
(A) require such issuers to provide timely disclosure, prior

of (i) information regarding the company to be acquired and
the specific application of the proceeds of the offering, or (ii)
additional information necessary to prevent such statement
from being misleading;
(B) place limitations on the use of such proceeds and the
distribution of securities by such issuer until the disclosures
required under subparagraph (A) have been made; and

37

(A) has no specific business plan or purpose; or
(B) has indicated that its business plan is to merge with
an unidentified company or companies.

(1) IN GENERAL.—The Commission shall adopt regulations
under this subsection requiring each issuer of an asset-backed
security to disclose, for each tranche or class of security, information regarding the assets backing that security.
(2) CONTENT OF REGULATIONS.—In adopting regulations
under this subsection, the Commission shall—
(A) set standards for the format of the data provided
by issuers of an asset-backed security, which shall, to the
extent feasible, facilitate comparison of such data across
securities in similar types of asset classes; and
(B) require issuers of asset-backed securities, at a minimum, to disclose asset-level or loan-level data, if such
data are necessary for investors to independently perform
due diligence, including—
(i) data having unique identifiers relating to loan
brokers or originators;
(ii) the nature and extent of the compensation of
the broker or originator of the assets backing the security; and
(iii) the amount of risk retention by the originator
and the securitizer of such assets.
(d) REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this
subsection, the Commission shall issue rules relating to the registration statement required to be filed by any issuer of an assetbacked security (as that term is defined in section 3(a)(77) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that require any issuer of an
asset-backed security—

thereof can be understood, and to the public interest and the protection of investors. If any amendment to any such statement is
filed prior to the effective date of such statement, the registration
statement shall be deemed to have been filed when such amend-

39

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

Sec. 8

ment was filed; except that an amendment filed with the consent
of the Commission, prior to the effective date of the registration
statement, or filed pursuant to an order of the Commission, shall
be treated as a part of the registration statement.
(b) If it appears to the Commission that a registration statement is on its face incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, the Commission may, after notice by personal service or the
sending of confirmed telegraphic notice not later than ten days
after the filing of the registration statement, and opportunity for
hearing (at a time fixed by the Commission) within ten days after
such notice by personal service or the sending of such telegraphic
notice, issue an order prior to the effective date of registration refusing to permit such statement to become effective until it has
been amended in accordance with such order. When such statement has been amended in accordance with such order the Commission shall so declare and the registration shall become effective
at the time provided in subsection (a) or upon the date of such declaration, whichever date is the later.
(c) An amendment filed after the effective date of the registration statement, if such amendment, upon its face, appears to the
Commission not to be incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, shall become effective on such date as the Commission may
determine, having due regard to the public interest and the protection of investors.
(d) If it appears to the Commission at any time that the registration statement includes any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the
Commission may, after notice by personal service or the sending of
confirmed telegraphic notice, and after opportunity for hearing (at
a time fixed by the Commission) within fifteen days after such notice by personal service or the sending of such telegraphic notice,
issue a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration
statement. When such statement has been amended in accordance
with such stop order the Commission shall so declare and thereupon the stop order shall cease to be effective.
(e) The Commission is hereby empowered to make an examination in any case in order to determine whether a stop order should
issue under subsection (d). In making such examination the Commission or any officer or officers designated by it shall have access
to and may demand the production of any books and papers of, and
may administer oaths and affirmations to and examine, the issuer,
underwriter, or any other person, in respect of any matter relevant
to the examination, and may, in its discretion, require the production of a balance sheet exhibiting the assets and liabilities of the
issuer, or its income statement, or both, to be certified to by a public or certified accountant approved by the Commission. If the
issuer or underwriter shall fail to cooperate, or shall obstruct or
refuse to permit the making of an examination, such conduct shall
be proper ground for the issuance of a stop order.
(f) Any notice required under this section shall be sent to or
served on the issuer, or, in case of a foreign government or political
subdivision thereof, to or on the underwriter, or, in the case of a
foreign or Territorial person, to or on its duly authorized represent-

TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS

For transfer of functions of Securities and Exchange Commission, with certain exceptions, to Chairman of such Commission, see Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, Sec. 1, 2, eff. May 24,
1950, 15 F.R. 3175, 64 Stat. 1265.
CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS

SEC. 8A. (a) AUTHORITY OF THE COMMISSION.—If the Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that any person
is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision of this
title, or any rule or regulation thereunder, the Commission may
publish its findings and enter an order requiring such person, and
any other person that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation,
due to an act or omission the person knew or should have known
would contribute to such violation, to cease and desist from committing or causing such violation and any future violation of the
same provision, rule, or regulation. Such order may, in addition to
requiring a person to cease and desist from committing or causing
a violation, require such person to comply, or to take steps to effect
compliance, with such provision, rule, or regulation, upon such
terms and conditions and within such time as the Commission may
specify in such order. Any such order may, as the Commission
deems appropriate, require future compliance or steps to effect future compliance, either permanently or for such period of time as
the Commission may specify, with such provision, rule, or regulation with respect to any security, any issuer, or any other person.
(b) HEARING.—The notice instituting proceedings pursuant to
subsection (a) shall fix a hearing date not earlier than 30 days nor
later than 60 days after service of the notice unless an earlier or
a later date is set by the Commission with the consent of any respondent so served.
(c) TEMPORARY ORDER.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Whenever the Commission determines
that the alleged violation or threatened violation specified in
the notice instituting proceedings pursuant to subsection (a), or
the continuation thereof, is likely to result in significant dissipation or conversion of assets, significant harm to investors,
or substantial harm to the public interest, including, but not
limited to, losses to the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, prior to the completion of the proceedings, the Commission may enter a temporary order requiring the respondent to

41

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

Sec. 8A

cease and desist from the violation or threatened violation and
to take such action to prevent the violation or threatened violation and to prevent dissipation or conversion of assets, significant harm to investors, or substantial harm to the public interest as the Commission deems appropriate pending completion
of such proceeding. Such an order shall be entered only after
notice and opportunity for a hearing, unless the Commission
determines that notice and hearing prior to entry would be impracticable or contrary to the public interest. A temporary
order shall become effective upon service upon the respondent
and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commission
or a court of competent jurisdiction, shall remain effective and
enforceable pending the completion of the proceedings.
(2) APPLICABILITY.—This subsection shall apply only to a
respondent that acts, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct
acted, as a broker, dealer, investment adviser, investment company, municipal securities dealer, government securities
broker, government securities dealer, or transfer agent, or is,
or was at the time of the alleged misconduct, an associated
person of, or a person seeking to become associated with, any
of the foregoing.
(d) REVIEW OF TEMPORARY ORDERS.—
(1) COMMISSION REVIEW.—At any time after the respondent has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order
pursuant to subsection (c), the respondent may apply to the
Commission to have the order set aside, limited, or suspended.
If the respondent has been served with a temporary cease-anddesist order entered without a prior Commission hearing, the
respondent may, within 10 days after the date on which the
order was served, request a hearing on such application and
the Commission shall hold a hearing and render a decision on
such application at the earliest possible time.
(2) JUDICIAL REVIEW.—Within—
(A) 10 days after the date the respondent was served
with a temporary cease-and-desist order entered with a
prior Commission hearing, or
(B) 10 days after the Commission renders a decision
on an application and hearing under paragraph (1), with
respect to any temporary cease- and-desist order entered
without a prior Commission hearing,
the respondent may apply to the United States district court
for the district in which the respondent resides or has its principal place of business, or for the District of Columbia, for an
order setting aside, limiting, or suspending the effectiveness or
enforcement of the order, and the court shall have jurisdiction
to enter such an order. A respondent served with a temporary
cease-and- desist order entered without a prior Commission
hearing may not apply to the court except after hearing and
decision by the Commission on the respondent’s application
under paragraph (1) of this subsection.
(3) NO AUTOMATIC STAY OF TEMPORARY ORDER.—The commencement of proceedings under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the Commission’s order.

42

(4) EXCLUSIVE REVIEW.—Section 9(a) of this title shall not
apply to a temporary order entered pursuant to this section.
(e) AUTHORITY TO ENTER AN ORDER REQUIRING AN ACCOUNTING AND DISGORGEMENT.—In any cease-and-desist proceeding
under subsection (a), the Commission may enter an order requiring
accounting and disgorgement, including reasonable interest. The
Commission is authorized to adopt rules, regulations, and orders
concerning payments to investors, rates of interest, periods of accrual, and such other matters as it deems appropriate to implement this subsection.
(f) AUTHORITY OF THE COMMISSION TO PROHIBIT PERSONS FROM
SERVING AS OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS.—In any cease-and-desist proceeding under subsection (a), the Commission may issue an order
to prohibit, conditionally or unconditionally, and permanently or
for such period of time as it shall determine, any person who has
violated section 17(a)(1) or the rules or regulations thereunder,
from acting as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class
of securities registered pursuant to section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or that is required to file reports pursuant to
section 15(d) of that Act, if the conduct of that person demonstrates
unfitness to serve as an officer or director of any such issuer.
(g) AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE MONEY PENALTIES.—
(1) GROUNDS.—In any cease-and-desist proceeding under
subsection (a), the Commission may impose a civil penalty on
a person if the Commission finds, on the record, after notice
and opportunity for hearing, that—
(A) such person—
(i) is violating or has violated any provision of this
title, or any rule or regulation issued under this title;
or
(ii) is or was a cause of the violation of any provision of this title, or any rule or regulation thereunder;
and
(B) such penalty is in the public interest.
(2) MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF PENALTY.—
(A) FIRST TIER.—The maximum amount of a penalty
for each act or omission described in paragraph (1) shall
be $7,500 for a natural person or $75,000 for any other
person.
(B) SECOND TIER.—Notwithstanding subparagraph (A),
the maximum amount of penalty for each such act or omission shall be $75,000 for a natural person or $375,000 for
any other person, if the act or omission described in paragraph (1) involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement.
(C) THIRD TIER.—Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A)
and (B), the maximum amount of penalty for each such act
or omission shall be $150,000 for a natural person or
$725,000 for any other person, if—
(i) the act or omission described in paragraph (1)
involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or
reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement; and
(ii) such act or omission directly or indirectly resulted in—

43

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

Sec. 9

(I) substantial losses or created a significant
risk of substantial losses to other persons; or
(II) substantial pecuniary gain to the person
who committed the act or omission.
(3) EVIDENCE CONCERNING ABILITY TO PAY.—In any proceeding in which the Commission may impose a penalty under
this section, a respondent may present evidence of the ability
of the respondent to pay such penalty. The Commission may,
in its discretion, consider such evidence in determining whether such penalty is in the public interest. Such evidence may relate to the extent of the ability of the respondent to continue
in business and the collectability of a penalty, taking into account any other claims of the United States or third parties
upon the assets of the respondent and the amount of the assets
of the respondent.

COURT REVIEW OF ORDERS

SEC. 9. (a) Any person aggrieved by an order of the Commission may obtain a review of such order in the court of appeals of
the United States, within any circuit wherein such person resides
or has his principal place of business, or in the United States Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia, by filing in such Court;
within sixty days after the entry of such order, a written petition
praying that the order of the Commission be modified or be set
aside in whole or in part. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith
transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Commission, and thereupon the Commission shall file in the court the record upon which
the order complained of was entered, as provided in section 2112

Sec. 9

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

of title 28, United States Code. No objection to the order of the
Commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection
shall have been urged before the Commission. The finding of the
Commission as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive. If either party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce
additional evidence, and shall show to the satisfaction of the court
that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing
before the Commission, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Commission and to be adduced upon
the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions
as to the court may seem proper. The Commission may modify its
findings as to the facts, by reason of the additional evidence so
taken, and it shall file such modified or new findings, which, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive, and its recommendation, if
any, for the modification or setting aside of the original order. The
jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment and decree, affirming, modifying, or setting aside, in whole or in part, any
order of the Commission, shall be final, subject to review by the
Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification
as provided in section 1254 of title 28, United States Code.
(b) The commencement of proceedings under subsection (a)
shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay
of the Commission’s order.

INFORMATION REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS

SEC. 10. (a) Except to the extent otherwise permitted or required pursuant to this subsection or subsections (c), (d), or (e)—
(1) a prospectus relating to a security other than a security
issued by a foreign government or political subdivision thereof,
shall contain the information contained in the registration
statement, but it need not include the documents referred to
in paragraphs (28) to (32), inclusive, of schedule A;
(2) a prospectus relating to a security issued by a foreign
government or political subdivision thereof shall contain the
information contained in the registration statement, but it
need not include the documents referred to in paragraphs (13)
and (14) of schedule B;
(3) notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) and
(2) of this subsection (a) when a prospectus is used more than
nine months after the effective date of the registration statement, the information contained therein shall be as of a date
not more than sixteen months prior to such use, so far as such
information is known to the user of such prospectus or can be
furnished by such user without unreasonable effort or expense;
(4) there may be omitted from any prospectus any of the
information required under this subsection (a) which the Commission may by rules or regulations designate as not being
necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
(b) In addition to the prospectus permitted or required in subsection (a), the Commission shall by rules or regulations deemed
necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection
of investors permit the use of a prospectus for the purposes of subsection (b)(1) of section 5 which omits in part or summarizes information in the prospectus specified in subsection (a). A prospectus
permitted under this subsection shall, except to the extent the
Commission by rules or regulations deemed necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors otherwise provides, be filed as part of the registration statement but
shall not be deemed a part of such registration statement for the
purposes of section 11. The Commission may at any time issue an
order preventing or suspending the use of a prospectus permitted
under this subsection (b), if it has reason to believe that such prospectus has not been filed (if required to be filed as part of the registration statement) or includes any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which such prospectus is or is to be used, not
misleading. Upon issuance of an order under this subsection, the
Commission shall give notice of the issuance of such order and opportunity for hearing by personal service or the sending of confirmed telegraphic notice. The Commission shall vacate or modify
the order at any time for good cause or if such prospectus has been
filed or amended in accordance with such order.
(c) Any prospectus shall contain such other information as the
Commission may by rules or regulations require as being necessary

Sec. 11

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

46

or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
(d) In the exercise of its powers under subsections (a), (b), or
(c), the Commission shall have authority to classify prospectuses
according to the nature and circumstances of their use or the nature of the security, issue, issuer, or otherwise, and, by rules and
regulations and subject to such terms and conditions as it shall
specify therein, to prescribe as to each class the form and contents
which it may find appropriate and consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.
(e) The statements or information required to be included in a
prospectus by or under authority of subsections (a), (b), (c), or (d),
when written, shall be placed in a conspicuous part of the prospectus and, except as otherwise permitted by rules or regulations,
in type as large as that used generally in the body of the prospectus.
(f) In any case where a prospectus consists of a radio or television broadcast, copies thereof shall be filed with the Commission
under such rules and regulations as it shall prescribe. The Commission may by rules and regulations require the filing with it of
forms and prospectuses used in connection with the offer or sale of
securities registered under this title.

CIVIL LIABILITIES ON ACCOUNT OF FALSE REGISTRATION STATEMENT

SEC. 11. (a) In case any part of the registration statement,
when such part became effective, contained an untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not

47

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

Sec. 11

misleading, any person acquiring such security (unless it is proved
that at the time of such acquisition he knew of such untruth or
omission) may, either at law or in equity, in any court of competent
jurisdiction, sue—
(1) every person who signed the registration statement;
(2) every person who was a director of (or person performing similar functions) or partner in, the issuer at the time
of the filing of the part of the registration statement with respect to which his liability is asserted;
(3) every person who, with his consent, is named in the
registration statement as being or about to become a director,
person performing similar functions or partner;
(4) every accountant, engineer, or appraiser, or any person
whose profession gives authority to a statement made by him,
who has with his consent been named as having prepared or
certified any part of the registration statement, or as having
prepared or certified any report or valuation which is used in
connection with the registration statement, with respect to the
statement in such registration statement, report, or valuation,
which purports to have been prepared or certified by him;
(5) every underwriter with respect to such security.
If such person acquired the security after the issuer has made generally available to its security holders an earning statement covering a period of at least twelve months beginning after the effective date of the registration statement, then the right of recovery
under this subsection shall be conditioned on proof that such person acquired the security relying upon such untrue statement in
the registration statement or relying upon the registration statement and not knowing of such omission, but such reliance may be
established without proof of the reading of the registration statement by such person.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) no person,
other than the issuer, shall be liable as provided therein who shall
sustain the burden of proof—
(1) that before the effective date of the part of the registration statement with respect to which his liability is asserted
(A) he had resigned from or had taken such steps as are permitted by law to resign from, or ceased or refused to act in,
every office, capacity, or relationship in which he was described
in the registration statement as acting or agreeing to act, and
(B) he had advised the Commission and the issuer in writing
that he had taken such action and that he would not be responsible for such part of the registration statement; or
(2) that if such part of the registration statement became
effective without his knowledge, upon becoming aware of such
fact he forthwith acted and advised the Commission, in accordance with paragraph (1), and, in addition, gave reasonable public notice that such part of the registration statement had become effective without his knowledge; or
(3) that (A) as regards any part of the registration statement not purporting to be made on the authority of an expert,
and not purporting to be a copy of or extract from a report or
valuation of an expert, and not purporting to be made on the
authority of a public official document or statement, he had,

Sec. 11

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

48

after reasonable investigation, reasonable ground to believe
and did believe, at the time such part of the registration statement became effective, that the statements therein were true
and that there was no omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and (B) as regards any part of
the registration statement purporting to be made upon his authority as an expert or purporting to be a copy of or extract
from a report or valuation of himself as an expert, (i) he had,
after reasonable investigation, reasonable ground to believe
and did believe, at the time such part of the registration statement became effective, that the statements therein were true
and that there was no omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) such part of the registration statement did not fairly represent his statement as an expert or was not a fair copy of or extract from his report or valuation as an expert; and (C) as regards any part of the registration statement purporting to be made on the authority of an
expert (other than himself) or purporting to be a copy of or extract from a report or valuation of an expert (other than himself), he had no reasonable ground to believe and did not believe, at the time such part of the registration statement became effective, that the statements therein were untrue or that
there was an omission to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, or that such part of the registration statement did
not fairly represent the statement of the expert or was not a
fair copy of or extract from the report or valuation of the expert; and (D) as regards any part of the registration statement
purporting to be a statement made by an official person or purporting to be a copy of or extract from a public official document, he had no reasonable ground to believe and did not believe, at the time such part of the registration statement became effective, that the statements therein were untrue, or
that there was an ommission to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that such part of the registration statement did not fairly represent the statement made by the official person or was not a fair copy of or extract from the public
official document.
(c) In determining, for the purpose of paragraph (3) of subsection (b) of this section, what constitutes reasonable investigation
and reasonable ground for belief, the standard of reasonableness
shall be that required of a prudent man in the management of his
own property.
(d) If any person becomes an underwriter with respect to the
security after the part of the registration statement with respect to
which his liability is asserted has become effective, then for the
purposes of paragraph (3) of subsection (b) of this section such part
of the registration statement shall be considered as having become
effective with respect to such person as of the time when he became an underwriter.

49

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

Sec. 11

(e) The suit authorized under subsection (a) may be to recover
such damages as shall represent the difference between the
amount paid for the security (not exceeding the price at which the
security was offered to the public) and (1) the value thereof as of
the time such suit was brought, or (2) the price at which such security shall have been disposed of in the market before suit, or (3)
the price at which such security shall have been disposed of after
suit but before judgment if such damages shall be less than the
damages representing the difference between the amount paid for
the security (not exceeding the price at which the security was offered to the public) and the value thereof as of the time such suit
was brought: Provided, That if the defendant proves that any portion or all of such damages represents other than the depreciation
in value of such security resulting from such part of the registration statement, with respect to which his liability is asserted, not
being true or omitting to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, such portion of or all such damages shall not be recoverable. In no event shall any underwriter (unless such underwriter
shall have knowingly received from the issuer for acting as an underwriter some benefit, directly or indirectly, in which all other underwriters similarly situated did not share in proportion to their
respective interests in the underwriting) be liable in any suit or as
a consequence of suits authorized under subsection (a) for damages
in excess of the total price at which the securities underwritten by
him and distributed to the public were offered to the public. In any
suit under this or any other section of this title the court may, in
its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs
of such suit, including reasonable attorney’s fees, and if judgment
shall be rendered against a party litigant, upon the motion of the
other party litigant, such costs may be assessed in favor of such
party litigant (whether or not such undertaking has been required)
if the court believes the suit or the defense to have been without
merit, in an amount sufficient to reimburse him for the reasonable
expenses incurred by him, in connection with such suit, such costs

SPECIAL POWERS OF COMMISSION

SEC. 19. (a) The Commission shall have authority from time to
time to make, amend, and rescind such rules and regulations as
may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this title, including
rules and regulations governing registration statements and
prospectuses for various classes of securities and issuers, and defining accounting, technical and trade terms used in this title. Among
other things, the Commission shall have authority, for the purposes
of this title, to prescribe the form or forms in which required information shall be set forth, the items or details to be shown in the
balance sheet and earning statement, and the methods to be followed in the preparation of accounts, in the appraisal or valuation
of assets and liabilities, in the determination of depreciation and
depletion, in the differentiation of recurring and non-recurring income, in the differentiation of investment and operating income,
and in the preparation, where the Commission deems it necessary
or desirable, of consolidated balance sheets or income accounts of
any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by the
issuer, or any person under direct or indirect common control with
the issuer. The rules and regulations of the Commission shall be
effective upon publication in the manner which the Commission
shall prescribe. No provision of this title imposing any liability
shall apply to any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity
with any rule or regulation of the Commission, notwithstanding
that such rule or regulation may, after such act or omission, be
amended or rescinded or be determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.
(b) RECOGNITION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—In carrying out its authority under subsection (a) and under section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, the Commission may recognize, as ‘‘generally accepted’’ for purposes of the securities laws, any accounting
principles established by a standard setting body—
(A) that—
(i) is organized as a private entity;
(ii) has, for administrative and operational purposes, a board of trustees (or equivalent body) serving
in the public interest, the majority of whom are not,
concurrent with their service on such board, and have
not been during the 2-year period preceding such service, associated persons of any registered public accounting firm;
(iii) is funded as provided in section 109 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
(iv) has adopted procedures to ensure prompt consideration, by majority vote of its members, of changes
to accounting principles necessary to reflect emerging

Sec. 19

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

64

accounting issues and changing business practices;
and
(v) considers, in adopting accounting principles,
the need to keep standards current in order to reflect
changes in the business environment, the extent to
which international convergence on high quality accounting standards is necessary or appropriate in the
public interest and for the protection of investors; and
(B) that the Commission determines has the capacity
to assist the Commission in fulfilling the requirements of
subsection (a) and section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, because, at a minimum, the standard setting
body is capable of improving the accuracy and effectiveness of financial reporting and the protection of investors
under the securities laws.
(2) ANNUAL REPORT.—A standard setting body described in
paragraph (1) shall submit an annual report to the Commission and the public, containing audited financial statements of
that standard setting body.
(c) For the purpose of all investigations which, in the opinion
of the Commission, are necessary and proper for the enforcement
of this title, any member of the Commission or any officer or officers designated by it are empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, or other documents which the Commission deems relevant or material to the inquiry. Such attendance of
witnesses and the production of such documentary evidence may be
required from any place in the United States or any Territory at
any designated place of hearing.
(d)(1) The Commission is authorized to cooperate with any association composed of duly constituted representatives of State governments whose primary assignment is the regulation of the securities business within those States, and which, in the judgment of
the Commission, could assist in effectuating greater uniformity in
Federal-State securities matters. The Commission shall, at its discretion, cooperate, coordinate, and share information with such an
association for the purposes of carrying out the policies and
projects set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3).
(2) It is the declared policy of this subsection that there should
be greater Federal and State cooperation in securities matters, including—
(A) maximum effectiveness of regulation,
(B) maximum uniformity in Federal and State regulatory
standards,
(C) minimum interference with the business of capital formation, and
(D) a substantial reduction in costs and paperwork to diminish the burdens of raising investment capital (particularly
by small business) and to diminish the costs of the administration of the Government programs involved.
(3) The purpose of this subsection is to engender cooperation
between the Commission, any such association of State securities
officials, and other duly constituted securities associations in the
following areas:

65

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

Sec. 19

(A) the sharing of information regarding the registration or
exemption of securities issues applied for in the various States;
(B) the development and maintenance of uniform securities
forms and procedures; and
(C) the development of a uniform exemption from registration for small issuers which can be agreed upon among several
States or between the States and the Federal Government. The
Commission shall have the authority to adopt such an exemption as agreed upon for Federal purposes. Nothing in this Act
shall be construed as authorizing preemption of State law.
(4) In order to carry out these policies and purposes, the Commission shall conduct an annual conference as well as such other
meetings as are deemed necessary, to which representatives from
such securities associations, securities self-regulatory organizations, agencies, and private organizations involved in capital formation shall be invited to participate.
(5) For fiscal year 1982, and for each of the three succeeding
fiscal years, there are authorized to be appropriated such amounts
as may be necessary and appropriate to carry out the policies, provisions, and purposes of this subsection. Any sums so appropriated
shall remain available until expended.
(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, neither the
Commission nor any other person shall be required to establish any
procedures not specifically required by the securities laws, as that
term is defined in section 3(a)(47) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, or by chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, in connection with cooperation, coordination, or consultation with—
(A) any association referred to in paragraph (1) or (3)
or any conference or meeting referred to in paragraph (4),
while such association, conference, or meeting is carrying
out
activities in furtherance of the provisions of this subsection; or
(B) any forum, agency or organization, or group referred to
in section 503 of the Small Business Investment Incentive Act
of 1980, while such forum, agency, organization, or group is
carrying out activities in furtherance of the provisions of such
section 503.
As used in this paragraph, the terms ‘‘association’’, ‘‘conference’’,
‘‘meeting’’, ‘‘forum’’, ‘‘agency’’, ‘‘organization’’, and ‘‘group’’ include
any committee, subgroup, or representative of such entities.
(e) EVALUATION OF RULES OR PROGRAMS.—For the purpose of
evaluating any rule or program of the Commission issued or carried out under any provision of the securities laws, as defined in
section 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c),
and the purposes of considering, proposing, adopting, or engaging
in any such rule or program or developing new rules or programs,
the Commission may—
(1) gather information from and communicate with investors or other members of the public;
(2) engage in such temporary investor testing programs as
the Commission determines are in the public interest or would
protect investors; and

Sec. 19

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

66

(3) consult with academics and consultants, as necessary
to carry out this subsection.
(f) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—For purposes of the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), any action taken under subsection (e) shall not be construed to be a collection of information.
(g) FUNDING FOR THE GASB.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Commission may, subject to the limitations imposed by section 15B of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-4), require a national securities association registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to
establish—
(A) a reasonable annual accounting support fee to adequately fund the annual budget of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (referred to in this subsection as
the ‘‘GASB’’); and
(B) rules and procedures, in consultation with the
principal organizations representing State governors, legislators, local elected officials, and State and local finance officers, to provide for the equitable allocation, assessment,
and collection of the accounting support fee established
under subparagraph (A) from the members of the association, and the remittance of all such accounting support
fees to the Financial Accounting Foundation.
(2) ANNUAL BUDGET.—For purposes of this subsection, the
annual budget of the GASB is the annual budget reviewed and
approved according to the internal procedures of the Financial
Accounting Foundation.
(3) USE OF FUNDS.—Any fees or funds collected under this
subsection shall be used to support the efforts of the GASB to
establish standards of financial accounting and reporting recognized as generally accepted accounting principles applicable
to State and local governments of the United States.
(4) LIMITATION ON FEE.—The annual accounting support
fees collected under this subsection for a fiscal year shall not
exceed the recoverable annual budgeted expenses of the GASB
(which may include operating expenses, capital, and accrued
items).
(5) RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.—
(A) FEES NOT PUBLIC MONIES.—Accounting support
fees collected under this subsection and other receipts of
the GASB shall not be considered public monies of the
United States.
(B) LIMITATION ON AUTHORITY OF THE COMMISSION.—
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to—
(i) provide the Commission or any national securities association direct or indirect oversight of the
budget or technical agenda of the GASB; or
(ii) affect the setting of generally accepted accounting principles by the GASB.
(C) NONINTERFERENCE WITH STATES.—Nothing in this
subsection shall be construed to impair or limit the authority of a State or local government to establish accounting
and financial reporting standards.

representative party on behalf of a class shall provide a

Sec. 27

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

76

security that is the subject of the complaint at the direction of plaintiff’s counsel or in order to participate

(iii) states that the plaintiff is willing to serve as
a representative party on behalf of a class, including
providing testimony at deposition and trial, if necessary;
(iv) sets forth all of the transactions of the plaintiff in the security that is the subject of the complaint
during the class period specified in the complaint;
(v) identifies any other action under this title,
filed during the 3-year period preceding the date on
which the certification is signed by the plaintiff, in
which the plaintiff has sought to serve, or served, as
a representative party on behalf of a class; and
(vi) states that the plaintiff will not accept any
payment for serving as a representative party on behalf of a class beyond the plaintiff’s pro rata share of
any recovery, except as ordered or approved by the
court in accordance with paragraph (4).

date on which the complaint is filed, the plaintiff or
plaintiffs shall cause to be published, in a widely circulated national business-oriented publication or wire
service, a notice advising members of the purported
plaintiff class—
(I) of the pendency of the action, the claims
asserted therein, and the purported class period;
and
(II) that, not later than 60 days after the date
on which the notice is published, any member of
the purported class may move the court to serve
as lead plaintiff of the purported class.
(ii) MULTIPLE ACTIONS.—If more than one action
on behalf of a class asserting substantially the same
claim or claims arising under this title is filed, only
the plaintiff or plaintiffs in the first filed action shall

by a purported class member in response to the notice,
including any motion by a class member who is not individually named as a plaintiff in the complaint or
complaints, and shall appoint as lead plaintiff the
member or members of the purported plaintiff class
that the court determines to be most capable of adequately representing the interests of class members
(hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the ‘‘most
adequate plaintiff’’) in accordance with this subparagraph.
(ii) CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS.—If more than one action on behalf of a class asserting substantially the
same claim or claims arising under this title has been
filed, and any party has sought to consolidate those
actions for pretrial purposes or for trial, the court
shall not make the determination required by clause
(i) until after the decision on the motion to consolidate
is rendered. As soon as practicable after such decision
is rendered, the court shall appoint the most adequate
plaintiff as lead plaintiff for the consolidated actions
in accordance with this subparagraph.
(iii) REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION.—
(I) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subclause (II), for
purposes of clause (i), the court shall adopt a presumption that the most adequate plaintiff in any
private action arising under this title is the person or group of persons that—
(aa) has either filed the complaint or
made a motion in response to a notice under
subparagraph (A)(i);
(bb) in the determination of the court, has
the largest financial interest in the relief
sought by the class; and
(cc) otherwise satisfies the requirements
of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
(II) REBUTTAL EVIDENCE.—The presumption
described in subclause (I) may be rebutted only
upon proof by a member of the purported plaintiff
class that the presumptively most adequate plaintiff—
(aa) will not fairly and adequately protect
the interests of the class; or
(bb) is subject to unique defenses that
render such plaintiff incapable of adequately
representing the class.
(iv) DISCOVERY.—For purposes of this subparagraph, discovery relating to whether a member or
members of the purported plaintiff class is the most
adequate plaintiff may be conducted by a plaintiff only
if the plaintiff first demonstrates a reasonable basis
for a finding that the presumptively most adequate

Sec. 27

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

78

plaintiff is incapable of adequately representing the
class.
(v) SELECTION OF LEAD COUNSEL.—The most adequate plaintiff shall, subject to the approval of the
court, select and retain counsel to represent the class.
(vi) RESTRICTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL PLAINTIFFS.—
Except as the court may otherwise permit, consistent
with the purposes of this section, a person may be a
lead plaintiff, or an officer, director, or fiduciary of a
lead plaintiff, in no more than 5 securities class actions brought as plaintiff class actions pursuant to the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure during any 3-year period.
(4) RECOVERY BY PLAINTIFFS.—The share of any final judgment or of any settlement that is awarded to a representative
party serving on behalf of a class shall be equal, on a per share
basis, to the portion of the final judgment or settlement awarded to all other members of the class. Nothing in this paragraph
shall be construed to limit the award of reasonable costs and
expenses (including lost wages) directly relating to the representation of the class to any representative party serving on
behalf of the class.
(5) RESTRICTIONS ON SETTLEMENTS UNDER SEAL.—The
terms and provisions of any settlement agreement of a class
action shall not be filed under seal, except that on motion of
any party to the settlement, the court may order filing under
seal for those portions of a settlement agreement as to which
good cause is shown for such filing under seal. For purposes of
this paragraph, good cause shall exist only if publication of a
term or provision of a settlement agreement would cause direct
and substantial harm to any party.
(6) RESTRICTIONS ON PAYMENT OF ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND
EXPENSES.—Total attorneys’ fees and expenses awarded by the
court to counsel for the plaintiff class shall not exceed a reasonable percentage of the amount of any damages and prejudgment interest actually paid to the class.
(7) DISCLOSURE OF SETTLEMENT TERMS TO CLASS MEMBERS.—Any proposed or final settlement agreement that is
published or otherwise disseminated to the class shall include
each of the following statements, along with a cover page summarizing the information contained in such statements:
(A) STATEMENT OF PLAINTIFF RECOVERY.—The amount
of the settlement proposed to be distributed to the parties
to the action, determined in the aggregate and on an average per share basis.
(B) STATEMENT OF POTENTIAL OUTCOME OF CASE.—
(i) AGREEMENT ON AMOUNT OF DAMAGES.—If the
settling parties agree on the average amount of damages per share that would be recoverable if the plaintiff prevailed on each claim alleged under this title, a
statement concerning the average amount of such potential damages per share.
(ii) DISAGREEMENT ON AMOUNT OF DAMAGES.—If
the parties do not agree on the average amount of

79

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

Sec. 27

damages per share that would be recoverable if the
plaintiff prevailed on each claim alleged under this
title, a statement from each settling party concerning
the issue or issues on which the parties disagree.
(iii) INADMISSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES.—A
statement made in accordance with clause (i) or (ii)
concerning the amount of damages shall not be admissible in any Federal or State judicial action or administrative proceeding, other than an action or proceeding arising out of such statement.
(C) STATEMENT OF ATTORNEYS’ FEES OR COSTS
SOUGHT.—If any of the settling parties or their counsel intend to apply to the court for an award of attorneys’ fees
or costs from any fund established as part of the settlement, a statement indicating which parties or counsel intend to make such an application, the amount of fees and
costs that will be sought (including the amount of such
fees and costs determined on an average per share basis),
and a brief explanation supporting the fees and costs
sought.
(D) IDENTIFICATION OF LAWYERS’ REPRESENTATIVES.—
The name, telephone number, and address of one or more
representatives of counsel for the plaintiff class who will
be reasonably available to answer questions from class
members concerning any matter contained in any notice of
settlement published or otherwise disseminated to the
class.
(E) REASONS FOR SETTLEMENT.—A brief statement explaining the reasons why the parties are proposing the settlement.
(F) OTHER INFORMATION.—Such other information as
may be required by the court.
(8) ATTORNEY CONFLICT OF INTEREST.—If a plaintiff class
is represented by an attorney who directly owns or otherwise
has a beneficial interest in the securities that are the subject
of the litigation, the court shall make a determination of
whether such ownership or other interest constitutes a conflict
of interest sufficient to disqualify the attorney from representing the plaintiff class.
(b) STAY OF DISCOVERY; PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—In any private action arising under this
title, all discovery and other proceedings shall be stayed during
the pendency of any motion to dismiss, unless the court finds,
upon the motion of any party, that particularized discovery is
necessary to preserve evidence or to prevent undue prejudice
to that party.
(2) PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE.—During the pendency of
any stay of discovery pursuant to this subsection, unless otherwise ordered by the court, any party to the action with actual
notice of the allegations contained in the complaint shall treat
all documents, data compilations (including electronically recorded or stored data), and tangible objects that are in the custody or control of such person and that are relevant to the allegations, as if they were the subject of a continuing request for

Sec. 27

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

80

production of documents from an opposing party under the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
(3) SANCTION FOR WILLFUL VIOLATION.—A party aggrieved
by the willful failure of an opposing party to comply with paragraph (2) may apply to the court for an order awarding appropriate sanctions.
(4) CIRCUMVENTION OF STAY OF DISCOVERY.—Upon a proper showing, a court may stay discovery proceedings in any private action in a State court as necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments, in an action subject to a stay of discovery pursuant to this subsection.
(c) SANCTIONS FOR ABUSIVE LITIGATION.—
(1) MANDATORY REVIEW BY COURT.—In any private action
arising under this title, upon final adjudication of the action,
the court shall include in the record specific findings regarding
compliance by each party and each attorney representing any
party with each requirement of Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure as to any complaint, responsive pleading, or
dispositive motion.
(2) MANDATORY SANCTIONS.—If the court makes a finding
under paragraph (1) that a party or attorney violated any requirement of Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
as to any complaint, responsive pleading, or dispositive motion,
the court shall impose sanctions on such party or attorney in
accordance with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Prior to making a finding that any party or attorney has
violated Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the
court shall give such party or attorney notice and an opportunity to respond.
(3) PRESUMPTION IN FAVOR OF ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND
COSTS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subparagraphs (B) and
(C), for purposes of paragraph (2), the court shall adopt a
presumption that the appropriate sanction—

in subparagraph (A) may be rebutted only upon proof by
the party or attorney against whom sanctions are to be imposed that—

such an award would not impose a greater burden on

81

the party in whose favor sanctions are to be imposed;
or
(ii) the violation of Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules

the court deems appropriate pursuant to Rule 11 of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

any private action arising under this title in which the plaintiff
