RESPONDENT

1.
Watson operated Watson & Associates Business Services, Inc., a tax
preparation business in Miami, Florida and was formerly licensed as a certified public accountant
in the state of Florida. From June 2003 through November 2012, Watson was associated with
AXA Advisors, LLC, a broker-dealer and investment adviser registered with the Commission.

RESPONDENT’S CRIMINAL CONVICTION

2.
On September 25, 2015, Watson pleaded guilty plea to one count of wire
fraud in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343, before the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Florida. United States v. Pamella Watson, Case No. 15-60106CR-COHN (S.D. Fla). On December 4, 2015, a judgment in the criminal case was entered against
Watson. She was sentenced to a prison term of 78 months followed by three years of supervised
release and was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of over $3.6 million.

The count of the criminal Indictment to which Watson pleaded guilty
alleged, among other things, that Watson used various methods to fraudulently file federal income
tax returns and receive unauthorized tax refunds on behalf of her clients. According to the
Indictment, between approximately January 2011 and September 2014, Watson diverted over $3.4
million of the fraudulently obtained client tax refunds into bank accounts she controlled. She also
diverted client checks made out to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) totaling almost $223,000
to pay her own personal IRS tax bill.
