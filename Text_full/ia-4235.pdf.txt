In the Matter of
EVELYN LITWOK,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to
Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”), against Evelyn Litwok
(“Respondent” or “Litwok”).
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
A.

RESPONDENT

1.
Litwok was an unregistered investment adviser, from approximately June
1994 through approximately October 1997, residing and operating investment funds in East
Hampton, New York. Litwok was the principal of several corporations, also unregistered
investment advisers, through which she conducted her investment advisory business, including
Kohn Investment Management, Inc., Kohn Capital Management, Inc. 33 and Kohn Investment
Management II, Inc. From 1984 to March 1994, Litwok was associated with various broker-

dealers as a registered representative, and held Series 7, Series 63 and Series 15 licenses. Litwok,
64 years old, is currently a resident of the Bronx, New York.
B.

RESPONDENT’S CRIMINAL CONVICTION

2.
On January 18, 2013, a federal jury convicted Litwok of one count of tax
evasion in violation of Title 26 United States Code, Section 7201, in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of New York (United States v. Evelyn Litwok, 2:02 CR-0427001(LDW)(E.D.N.Y.)). On August 8, 2013, the District Court sentenced Litwok to a prison term
of 24 months followed by three years of supervised release and ordered her to pay restitution in the
amount of $1,097,534. The Second Circuit affirmed the conviction on April 28, 2015.
3.
The count of the criminal information of which Litwok was convicted
alleged, among other things, that Litwok knowingly and willfully attempted to evade income tax
due and owing by her to the United States of America for the 1995 calendar year. The misconduct
occurred during the period in which Litwok was associated with an investment adviser.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it
necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be instituted
to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations; and
B.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent
pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act.
IV.
IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and before an
Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the
Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.110.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.
If Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly
notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined against
her upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as provided
by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. §§
201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310.

This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent personally or by certified mail.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 210 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged
in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related
proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness
or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within
the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the
provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action.
By the Commission.
