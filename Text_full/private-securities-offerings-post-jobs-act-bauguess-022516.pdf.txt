Access to capital by small businesses
• While some small firms raise capital through exempt offerings
and others undertake registered securities offerings, many small
businesses do not raise capital through either method
• Financed by founders, friends and family, bank loans, alternative
lenders etc.
• In 2013, there were more than 5 million firms with fewer than
500 paid employees, according to the latest data from U.S.
Census (2013 Business Dynamics Statistics)

Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA)

Impact of JOBS Act on Capital Formation
Two potential effects of JOBS Act rules on capital formation
• Improve the efficiency with which capital can be raised
 If offerings in reliance on the JOBS Act rules attract issuers that are
otherwise able to raise capital through existing exempt offering
methods, this will result in redistribution of capital flow, which may
enhance efficiency but have a limited impact on the aggregate
level of capital formation.

• Increase overall levels of capital formation in the economy
 If the JOBS Act rules enable entrepreneurs and small business to
raise capital not previously available to them, then the level of
capital formation will be enhanced.

Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA)

Emerging Growth Companies (EGCs)
• Title I introduced a scaled disclosure regime for EGCs - a new
category of IPO issuers
 Based on 10-K filings made in 2014, there are approximately 928
EGCs (12% of reporting companies that filed 10-Ks)
 Between April 2012 and the end of 2014, close to 85% IPOs have
been undertaken by EGCs

• Recent research have shown that eligible issuers are frequently
relying on EGC accommodations
• EGC provisions affect capital raising by the largest small firms
 for many smaller firms, an IPO would still be too costly

General Solicitation and Rule 506(c)
What we said in the economic analysis of the final rule (July 2013)
 Intended to facilitate capital formation, especially for early stage
firms
 Would lower search cost of issuers finding accredited investors,
and provide accredited investors with a greater number of
investment opportunities.


Decrease the cost of raising capital; could replace other offering
methods

 Reduce uncertainty for issuers as to whether a Rule 506 offering
can be completed (e.g., inadvertent release of information).
 Could increase the incidence of fraud; erode investor participation
in private offering markets
Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA)

General Solicitation and Rule 506(c)
What we have observed since enactment
 No measured increase in the incidence of fraud in new Rule 506(c)
market
 Rule 506(c) market remains much smaller then the traditional Rule
506(b) market


Market may still be learning about what constitutes general
solicitation, appropriate verification methods



Potential uncertainty about pending regulation



Delay in amending regulations by other agencies that restricted
use of general solicitation (e.g. CFTC for commodity funds)

Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA)

General Solicitation and Rule 506(c)
 Used more by operating companies than funds


Average age and size of operating companies raising capital
through Rule 506(c) is smaller (intention of JOBS Act)



Operating companies use intermediaries to a greater extent in
Rule 506(c) offerings



Intermediation costs reported to be higher under new Rule 506
market than traditional Rule 506(b) market

 Median offer size larger, but median amount raised lower, in 506(c)
offerings


issuers that anticipate difficulty raising capital may be selfselecting into advertised offerings

Exempt Offerings: Regulation A+
• Regulation A has been utilized infrequently in the prior years
and amendments were adopted on March 25, 2015 and became
effective on June 19, 2015
• The market continues to evolve but the sample is still relatively
small
 Only a subset of filings has been qualified and very few
reports of sales have been filed, so it remains to be seen how
much capital will be raised through these offerings in the
future
 Between June 19, 2015 and February 15, 2016, about 68
filings made on Form 1-A, 19 qualified, and 3 reports of sales
filed for offerings qualified
Source: Staff analysis of filings on EDGAR

Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA)

Exempt Offerings: Regulation A+
What we said in the economic analysis of the final rule (March
2015)
 Potential use of Reg A (Tier 1 v. Tier 2) offerings will depend on
how issuers perceive the trade-off between:


the costs of qualification and ongoing disclosure requirements



The benefits from access to a broad investor base and preemption
of state securities law registration requirements

 will also depend on ability of issuers to use other exemptions


e.g., general solicitation permissible under rule 506(c) of Reg D

 and the need for secondary market liquidity


Which would require Exchange Act reporting if listed on a national
market exchange (i.e., is reg A a viable alternative to an IPO?)

Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA)

Exempt Offerings: Regulation A+
• Total capital sought: $1.3 billion ($290 million across qualified
filings)


Tier 1 and Tier 2: 46% vs. 54% (53% vs. 47% across qualified filings)
 Tier 1: Median amount sought per filing: $13 million ($7.5 million qualified)
 Tier 2: Median amount sought per filing $24 million ($23 million per
qualified filing)

• Most filers are pre-revenue firms, with variation in issuer size,
amounts sought, industry, location, and profitability


Median assets: $0.1 million ($0.5 million qualified offerings)
 Issuer assets < $1 million in 72% of filings (58% qualified filings)
 Issuer assets <$100 million in 95% filings (85% qualified filings)



Issuer in a median filing / qualified filing had no revenues, net income, or
long-term debt, and no / low cash and PP&E

Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA)

Exempt Offerings: Regulation A+
• Limited underwriter involvement
 90% of all / qualified filings were on a “best efforts” basis
 80% of all and of qualified filings were equity offerings

• Industry
 >50% filings by issuers in business services, real estate, and credit
industries

• Geography
 >50% filings by issuers incorporated in DE or NV
 Close to 1/3 filings by issuers with a business location in CA
 Nationwide solicitation more common with Tier 2: Median filer
solicited in 50 states, compared to 3 (9) states for the median
(qualified) Tier 1 filing
Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA)

Regulation Crowdfunding
• The final rules implementing Title III were adopted on October
30, 2015 and will be effective May 16, 2016
• Establish a framework for the federal securities-based
crowdfunding market
• Intended to help provide small businesses with capital through
relatively low dollar investments by the “crowd” of retail
investors

Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA)

Regulation Crowdfunding
• How costly will it be for issuers?
 Issuers will have to use an intermediary and provide offering and
periodic disclosure; could be required to provide audited financials

• What will investors’ exit options be?
 What types of securities will be used? Will secondary markets
develop?
 The survival rates of CF issuers are expected to be low, may face
expropriation risk

• Will CF increase fraud?
 Limits on capital to be raised, investor limits, disclosure, ability of
intermediaries to limit issuers’ access to portals
