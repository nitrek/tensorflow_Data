ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-16801

In the Matter of
BENNETT GROUP FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC, and
DAWN J. BENNETT

ORDER ON WITNESS LIST

The hearing in this matter is scheduled to begin on January 25, 2016. On January 13,
2016, the Division of Enforcement filed its witness list.
In its filing, the Division explains that because its experts will not be cross-examined,
neither expert will be present during the hearing. List at 6. The Division’s experts need not be
physically present during the hearing. Because I anticipate the need to briefly question them,
however, the Division should arrange a convenient time for its experts to be available during the
hearing to provide telephonic testimony.
The Division also anticipates that in some instances it will offer “prior investigative
testimony, deposition testimony, or a declaration or affidavit in lieu of testimony at the hearing.”
List at 7. In the event the Division offers prior sworn testimony into evidence, it should be
prepared to address how admission of such prior sworn testimony is consistent with Commission
Rule of Practice 235. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.235.
