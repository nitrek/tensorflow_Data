SUMMARY

9
10

4.

This action concerns the defendants’ fraudulent “shell factory”

11

enterprise—a scheme to create and sell public “shell” companies to people who,

12

for whatever reason, need publicly-traded companies that have no real business or

13

purpose. The scheme was carried out by defendant Imran Husain (“Husain”), an

14

undisclosed control person and promoter based in Los Angeles, and defendant

15

Gregg Evan Jaclin (“Jaclin”), a corporate attorney who made his living

16

representing entities like the ones created and sold in the shell factory. From 2006

17

to 2013, Husain and Jaclin created nine shell companies, seven of whose stock was

18

subsequently sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars in sale proceeds and

19

attorney fees as a result of their scheme.

20

5.

The defendants’ shell factory scheme followed a routine pattern.

21

Husain created a “business plan” and convinced a friend, friend of a friend, relative

22

or acquaintance to be a puppet CEO. Husain and Jaclin then incorporated a

23

company, and Husain orchestrated a sham private placement offering of the

24

company’s shares to approximately 35 purchasers (the “Straw Shareholders”).

25

These Straw Shareholders either did not exist, or they used cash supplied by

26

Husain to “buy” the shares. Although this made it appear as if the company was

27

owned by third parties, Husain and Jaclin maintained control of the company and

28
2

Case 2:16-cv-03250 Document 1 Filed 05/12/16 Page 3 of 45 Page ID #:3

1

its shares.
6.

2

Once the company was established and its shares had been “sold” to

3

the Straw Shareholders, Husain worked with Jaclin to file a Form S-1 registration

4

statement with the SEC, registering a public offering of the company’s shares held

5

by the Straw Shareholders. The registration statements made materially false and

6

misleading statements concerning the companies’ management, business plan, and

7

Straw Shareholders.
7.

8

After the registration statement became effective, Husain and Jaclin

9

filed periodic reports with the SEC that repeated many of the same false and

10

misleading statements. Husain and Jaclin also provided materially false and

11

misleading information to market makers, to obtain clearance to enter quotes for

12

the company’s shares on the over-the-counter (“OTC”) Bulletin Board or the OTC

13

Link.

14

8.

Once the shell company was established as a publicly-traded

15

company, Husain and Jaclin would try and sell it. Ultimately, they sold seven of

16

the nine public shell companies they created, reaping $215,000 to $425,000 of sale

17

proceeds for each shell they sold. In total, Husain obtained about $2.25 million in

18

sale proceeds, and Jaclin and his firm received nearly $225,000 for their legal

19

services.

20

9.

For two of the shells, Husain and Jaclin also filed a post-effective

21

amendment to the registration statement or a Form 10-K shortly in advance of the

22

sale. These filings repeated many of the false and misleading statements and also

23

falsely claimed that neither company had any plans or understandings to engage in

24

a merger.

25

10.

26
27

By this conduct:
(a)

Husain and Jaclin have violated the registration provisions of

Section 5(a) and 5(c) and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities

12

reporting provisions of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78o(d), and Rules 12b-20,

13

15d-1 and 15d-13 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.12b-20, 240.15d-1, and 240.15d-

14

13;

15

Jaclin has aided and abetted Husain’s violations of Section

16

17(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a), and Section 10(b) of the

17

Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) 78o(d), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §

18

240.10b-5; and

19

(f)

Husain and Jaclin have aided and abetted the shell company

20

purchasers’ violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§

21

77(e)(a), 77(e)(c).

22

11.

The SEC seeks disgorgement of defendants’ ill-gotten gains,

23

prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and penny stock bars, and, against Husain,

24

seeks an officer and director bar.

THE FRAUDULENT SCHEME

26
27

24.

From 2006 to 2013, Husain and Jaclin ran a shell factory where they

28
12

Case 2:16-cv-03250 Document 1 Filed 05/12/16 Page 13 of 45 Page ID #:13

1

manufactured nine shell companies, subsequently selling seven of them in

2

fraudulent unregistered public offerings.
25.

3

The factory included a typical pattern of conduct repeated by Husain

4

and Jaclin for each shell company, as alleged below.

5

A.

6

Jaclin’s “Self-Filing Model”
26.

In or about 2004, Jaclin met Husain, who sought advice about how to

7

take a company public. Jaclin introduced Husain to what Jaclin termed his “self-

8

filing model.”

9

27.

Under this self-filing model, a company first is incorporated and

10

conducts a private placement offering of its stock to a limited number of investors,

11

such as friends and family. Then, the company files a Form S-1 registration

12

statement with the SEC to register a public offering of the private placement

13

investors’ stock.

14

28.

15
16

Once the registration statement becomes effective, the company files

periodic reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q in accordance with SEC regulations.
29.

The company then works with a market maker to obtain clearance

17

from FINRA to publish stock price quotations on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTC

18

Link. Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11, 17 C.F.R. § 240.15c2-11, requires a broker or

19

dealer to obtain reasonably current information concerning a company before

20

publishing a quotation for the company’s securities, often including the

21

registration statement filed with the SEC.

22

30.

Once FINRA provides clearance, the company works with the market

23

maker and a transfer agent to obtain Depository Trust Clearing (“DTC”) eligibility

24

so that trades of its stock can be settled electronically and thereby reduce costs and

25

time when a share of stock is traded.

26
27

31.

To best utilize the self-filing model, Jaclin advised Husain to create

small companies that Husain could control from start to finish, including control

28
13

Case 2:16-cv-03250 Document 1 Filed 05/12/16 Page 14 of 45 Page ID #:14

1

of both the private placement investors and the companies’ management.

2

B.

The Shell Factory
32.

3

Utilizing this self-filing model, Husain and Jaclin proceeded to create

4

nine public shell companies, seven of which they sold. This fraudulent shell

5

factory proceeded using the following series of recurring steps.

6

1.

Incorporating the Shell Companies and Hiring Puppet CEOs

7

33.

First, Husain would identify a potential puppet, such as a friend,

8

friend of a friend, relative, or administrative assistant, to serve as a CEO in name

9

only.

10
11
12

34.

Jaclin advised Husain that the puppet CEOs should receive some

salary to avoid raising suspicions.
35.

Husain promised potential puppet CEOs a salary of between $500

13

and $700 per month, explaining that Husain himself would handle all of the

14

corporate, legal, and regulatory matters necessary to form the shell company and

15

take it public.

16
17
18

36.

Husain typically selected a business plan for the shell company that

related to the puppet CEO’s own background.
37.

Husain then introduced the puppet CEO to Jaclin, who sent the

19

puppet CEO, directly or through Husain, an engagement letter for he and his firm

20

to serve as the shell company’s counsel.

21

38.

As counsel, the work Jaclin and his firm did included incorporating

22

the shell company; preparing private placement documents; preparing a

23

registration statement and handling the SEC comment process; and helping to

24

provide information to a market maker to obtain FINRA clearance to quote the

25

shell company’s stock.

26

2.

The Sham Private Offerings

27

39.

After incorporating the shell company, Husain organized a private

28
14

Case 2:16-cv-03250 Document 1 Filed 05/12/16 Page 15 of 45 Page ID #:15

1
2
3
4

offering of the shell company’s stock to approximately 35 Straw Shareholders.
40.

Jaclin’s law firm prepared a private placement memorandum, based

on a business plan provided by Husain.
41.

The private offerings were shams because Husain gave the Straw

5

Shareholders cash to buy the stock, and, in some instances used the names and

6

social security numbers of deceased individuals as the purported investors.

7

42.

Husain enlisted several acquaintances to recruit Straw Shareholders,

8

paying the recruiters a commission of between $200 to $400 for each investor they

9

obtained.

10

43.

The Straw Shareholders used Husain’s cash either to write a personal

11

check or to obtain a cashier’s check payable to the shell company. Some Straw

12

Shareholders paid with money orders from retail outlets such as CVS or Seven-

13

Eleven.

14

44.

Jaclin advised Husain that the Straw Shareholders should submit

15

personal or cashier’s checks, rather than money orders, to avoid raising regulators’

16

suspicions.

17

45.

The Straw Shareholder signed the documents that Husain gave the

18

recruiter, namely a subscription agreement, investor questionnaire, and a blank

19

stock power.

20

46.

Husain subsequently filled in the stock power when selling the shell

21

company to a Straw Shareholder, to make it appear to the transfer agent that the

22

Straw Shareholder was selling his or her stock.

23
24
25

47.

Jaclin or Husain maintained possession of the stock certificates issued

to the Straw Shareholders in the sham private offering.
48.

When the Straw Shareholders purportedly purchased shares in the

26

shell companies, the shell companies were controlled by Husain, and no restrictive

27

legend appeared on the stock certificates for the shares sold to the Straw

28
15

Case 2:16-cv-03250 Document 1 Filed 05/12/16 Page 16 of 45 Page ID #:16

1
2

Shareholders.
49.

The fact that the companies’ shares were purportedly sold to and held

3

by the Straw Shareholders gave the appearance that third parties actually owned

4

the companies, when, in fact, Husain retained control over them.

5

50.

Husain and Jaclin knew, or were reckless or negligent in not

6

knowing, that the private offerings were shams, that the Straw Shareholders were

7

using Husain’s money to purchase the shares, and that Husain controlled the

8

shares.

9

3.

The False and Misleading S-1 Registration Statements

10

51.

Husain and Jaclin then took each shell company public through a

11

Form S-1 registration statement filed with the SEC, and when necessary,

12

amendments thereto, offering the shares from the sham private placement.

13
14
15

52.

For each shell company public offering, and the registration of the

offering, Jaclin and his law firm served as counsel for the shell company.
53.

For the registration statement for each of the nine shell companies,

16

Husain controlled the efforts to prepare, review, file, and obtain a notice from the

17

SEC declaring it effective, including providing to Jaclin’s firm and to the auditor

18

information, documents, and puppet CEO signatures, as needed.

19
20
21
22
23
24
25
26
27

54.

Husain approved documents and served as the main point of contact

for the shell companies throughout the registration process.
55.

Jaclin instructed his associates that Husain had the authority to

approve documents for filing with the SEC.
56.

Jaclin’s associates emailed each draft registration statement,

including any changes or edits, to Jaclin for his approval.
57.

The draft registration statement was then sent to Husain and the shell

companies’ outside auditors for review, before being filed with the SEC.
58.

Jaclin permitted his associates to use his electronic signature for his

28
16

Case 2:16-cv-03250 Document 1 Filed 05/12/16 Page 17 of 45 Page ID #:17

1

law firm’s opinion letters that were attached to the registration statements, which

2

stated that the shares in the offering had been duly authorized, legally issued, fully

3

paid and were non-assessable.

4
5
6

59.

Each of the shell companies’ registration statements contained

numerous materially false and misleading statements.
(a)

Each shell company registration statement falsely claimed that

7

the puppet CEO was the officer, director, and employee of the shell company, and

8

often the sole one of each. These statements were false and misleading because

9

there was no mention of Husain’s role as the control person and promoter of the

10
11

shell company, or that the puppet CEO was the CEO in name only.
(b)

Each shell company registration statement misrepresented the

12

shell company’s business purpose by stating that the company would operate in

13

accordance with its business plan. These statements were false and misleading

14

because the actual operations of the shell companies consisted only of turning the

15

shell company into a public shell that would then be sold.

16

(c)

Each shell company registration statement misrepresented that

17

the Straw Shareholders: (1) purchased their shares in a private offering; (2) were

18

selling the shares for their own account in the registered offering; and (3) were not

19

affiliated with any of the shell company’s officers, directors, promoters, or any

20

beneficial owner of 10% or more of the shell company’s securities. These

21

statements were false and misleading because: (1) some of the Straw

22

Shareholders did not exist, much less purchase or hold shares; (2) the majority of

23

the remaining Straw Shareholders paid for the shares with cash that Husain

24

supplied; (3) Husain and Jaclin held the shares rather than the Straw Shareholders;

25

(4) the shares under the offering were for Husain’s account, not the Straw

26

Shareholders’ accounts; and (5) each Straw Shareholder was affiliated with

27

Husain, who controlled each shell company and its securities.

28
17

60.

Husain and Jaclin knew, or were reckless or negligent in not

2

knowing, that the statements alleged above and in the registration statements for

3

each of the nine shell companies were false and misleading.

16
17

False and Misleading Information Provided to Transfer Agents

62.

Husain selected the transfer agents for each of the shell companies

18

and supplied them with shareholder information, serving as the main point of

19

contact for the transfer agents. Husain however disclosed neither his role nor the

20

investors’ status as Straw Shareholders.

21
22
23

63.

Once a shell company’s Form S-1 registration statement was declared

effective, Jaclin sent the transfer agent his law firm’s Form S-1 opinion letter.
64.

Husain and Jaclin then worked with a market maker to file a FINRA

24

Form 211 application in order for the market maker to publish quotes for the shell

25

company’s stock.

26
27

65.

As part of preparing the Form 211, the market maker reviewed the

shell company’s registration statement, which was incorporated into the Form

28
20

Case 2:16-cv-03250 Document 1 Filed 05/12/16 Page 21 of 45 Page ID #:21

1
2

211, including the materially false and misleading statements.
66.

Also as part of the Form 211 process, Husain completed an

3

information statement and officer and director questionnaire for each shell

4

company. These documents repeated the false and misleading statements from the

5

shell company’s registration statement (except the statements regarding the Straw

6

Shareholders).

7

67.

8
9

Husain had the puppet CEO for each shell company sign the

information statement and questionnaire, or forged his or her signature.
68.

Jaclin provided information and documents to the market maker, such

10

as copies of the subscription agreements and investor checks from the private

11

placement. Jaclin also helped respond to comments from FINRA about the shell

12

companies’ applications.

13
14
15

69.

Once FINRA provided clearance, the market makers entered quotes

for each shell company’s stock on one of the over-the-counter quotation systems.
70.

Husain then worked with the market maker and its affiliated transfer

16

agent to obtain DTC eligibility for each shell company’s stock, enhancing the

17

value for sale.

18

71.

Husain and Jaclin knew, or were reckless or negligent in not

19

knowing, that the information and documents given to the market makers and

20

transfer agents repeated the false and misleading information contained in the

21

registration statements.

False and Misleading Periodic Reports Filed By Eight of the Shell

72.

Eight of the nine shell companies—i.e., all of them except

25

Counseling International—became public reporting companies under SEC

26

regulations, which required them to file periodic reports with the SEC.

27

73.

In order to maintain these eight shell companies’ status as reporting

28
21

Case 2:16-cv-03250 Document 1 Filed 05/12/16 Page 22 of 45 Page ID #:22

1

companies, Husain and Jaclin filed periodic reports with the SEC on Forms 10-K

2

and 10-Q.

3

74.

4
5

Jaclin’s associates emailed draft periodic filings for these eight shell

companies to Jaclin for his approval.
75.

Husain also received draft periodic filings for the eight shell

6

companies from Jaclin’s associates, once the filings were ready for review by the

7

company and the outside auditor.

8
9

76.

The periodic reports repeated the following false and misleading

information contained in the registration statements:
(a)

10

They falsely claimed that the puppet CEO was the officer,

11

director, and employee of the shell company, and often the sole one of each.

12

These statements were false and misleading because there was no mention of

13

Husain’s role as control person and promoter or the puppet CEO’s de minimis

14

role; and
(b)

15

They misrepresented the company’s business purpose by

16

stating that the company would operate in accordance with its business plan,

17

whereas the actual plans and operations consisted of turning the company into a

18

public shell that subsequently would be sold.

19

77.

Husain and Jaclin knew, or were reckless or negligent in not

20

knowing, that the statements alleged above in the periodic reports for the eight

21

shell companies were false and misleading.

The Sales of Seven of the Shell Companies
79.

Approximately one-and-a-half to two years after incorporation,

13

Husain and Jaclin sold seven of the nine shell companies for sale proceeds ranging

14

from $215,000 to $425,000, for a total of $2.25 million.

15

80.

Jaclin introduced Husain to the purchasers for at least six of the shell

16

companies that were sold: New Image, Ciglarette, PR Complete, Rapid Holdings,

17

Resume, and Movie Trailer.

18

81.

For each shell company sale, Jaclin advised Husain to appoint a

19

shareholder representative to effect the sale, including the transfer of the Straw

20

Shareholders’ stock to the purchaser(s).

21
22
23

82.

Husain appointed a shareholder nominee as a representative for the

Straw Shareholders for each shell company sale.
83.

For each sale, Jaclin’s law firm prepared stock purchase agreements

24

among the shell company purchaser(s), the shell company, the puppet CEO, and

25

each Straw Shareholder (on whose behalf the nominee-representative signed the

26

agreement).

27

84.

Also as part of each shell company sale, Jaclin’s law firm prepared an

28
24

Case 2:16-cv-03250 Document 1 Filed 05/12/16 Page 25 of 45 Page ID #:25

1

escrow agreement among the nominee-representative, the shell company

2

purchaser(s), and an escrow agent. For six of the shell company sales (i.e., all

3

except Ciglarette), Jaclin’s firm served as the escrow agent to effect the transfer of

4

the stock certificates and the funds for the shell company purchase.

5

85.

Once the escrow agent received all of the funds for the sale, the

6

signed agreements, the stock certificates, and the stock powers, the escrow agent

7

wired the sales proceeds to the nominee-representative’s bank account, less any

8

amounts owed for Jaclin’s firm’s legal fees.

9
10
11

86.

Husain directed the nominee-representative to wire transfer portions

of the funds to one or more of Husain’s bank accounts in the United States.
87.

As a further part of each shell company sale, Jaclin’s firm provided

12

opinion letters instructing the transfer agent to cancel the shares in the name of the

13

Straw Shareholders and to reissue them in the names of the shell company

14

purchasers.

15

88.

The sales of the shell companies were accomplished through “reverse

16

merger” transactions with private purchasing entities, where the shareholders of

17

the purchaser would acquire a majority of the shares of the public shell company

18

(i.e., the Straw Shareholders’ shares), and then the public shell company would

19

then be merged into the purchasing entity.

20

89.

For two of the shell companies, Movie Trailer and Health Directory,

21

the nominee-representative held the shares in the nominee’s brokerage account.

22

As part of the sale of these two shell companies, Husain instructed the nominee-

23

representative to sell his shares in the open market, where the shell company

24

purchasers bought them.

25
26
27

90.

After the sale of each shell company, the shell company’s puppet

CEO resigned and new management was installed.
91.

New management changed the shell company’s name and business

model, as announced in Form 8-K reports publicly filed with the SEC.
92.

2

Following quotation clearance by FINRA and the establishment of

3

the stock’s DTC eligibility, the stock in at least three shell companies – New

4

Image, Health Directory and Movie Trailer – were publicly traded before these

5

three were sold to the shell company purchasers.

The Movie Trailer Post-Effective Form S-1 Amendment and the Health

Directory Form 10-K

18

94.

In connection with the sales of Health Directory and Movie Trailer,

19

Husain and Jaclin filed documents with the SEC that made false and misleading

20

statements about the companies.

21

95.

As set forth above, Health Directory was sold to a purchaser on July

20, 2012 for $425,000.
96.

On June 28, 2012, Husain and Jaclin caused Health Directory to file a

Form 10-K annual report with the SEC.
97.

At the time of the Form 10-K filing, Husain had agreed in principle to

26

sell Health Directory, the two parties had begun to prepare merger documents, and

27

the Health Directory shell company purchaser had paid a down payment of

$25,000 of the $425,000 purchase price to the escrow account at Jaclin’s firm.
98.

As set forth above, Movie Trailer was sold to a purchaser on

September 11, 2012 for $370,000.
99.

One week before the sale was consummated, on September 4, 2012,

5

Husain and Jaclin caused Movie Trailer to file with the SEC a post-effective

6

amendment to its Form S-1 registration statement.

7

100. At the time the Form S-1 amendment was filed, the purchaser of

8

Movie Trailer had paid $187,500, representing half of the $375,000 purchase

9

price, to the escrow account at Jaclin’s firm.

10

101. The Health Directory Form10-K and the Movie Trailer post-effective

11

Form S-1 amendment repeated the same false and misleading statements from

12

these shell companies’ earlier SEC filings:
(a)

13

They falsely claimed that the puppet CEO was the officer,

14

director, and employee of the shell company, and often the sole one of each.

15

These statements were false and misleading because there was no mention of

16

Husain’s role as control person and promoter or the puppet CEO’s de minimis

17

role; and

18

(b)

They misrepresented the company’s business purpose by

19

stating that the company would operate in accordance with its business plan,

20

whereas the actual plans and operations consisted of turning the company into a

21

public shell that subsequently would be sold.

22

102. These filings further falsely stated that each shell company had no

23

plans, arrangement, or understanding to engage in a merger. The shell company

24

purchasers for each of the two shell companies, however, had already sent Husain

25

and Jaclin closing checklists; requested documents to review; and the shell

26

company purchasers had already deposited funds covering portions of the

27

purchase prices into Jaclin’s firm’s escrow account.

28
27

Case 2:16-cv-03250 Document 1 Filed 05/12/16 Page 28 of 45 Page ID #:28

1

103. Husain and Jaclin knew, or were reckless or negligent in not

2

knowing, that Health Directory’s Form 10-K filed with the SEC was false and

3

misleading, because: (1) Husain had already agreed to sell the shell company; (2)

4

Husain and Jaclin were actively working with the shell company purchasers’

5

counsel for the sale; and (3) Jaclin’s firm had already received a portion of the

6

purchase price for the sale.

7

104. Husain and Jaclin knew, or were reckless or negligent in not

8

knowing, that Movie Trailer’s post effective Form S-1 amendment filed with the

9

SEC was false and misleading, because: (1) Husain had already agreed to sell the

10

shell company; (2) Husain and Jaclin were actively working with the shell

11

company purchasers’ counsel for the sale; and (3) Jaclin’s firm had already

12

received a portion of the purchase price for the sale.

14

The Unregistered Offer and Sale of Six Shell Companies’ Stock
105. After seven of the nine shell companies were sold by the defendants

15

in the reverse merger transactions, the stock of six of those companies was offered

16

and sold to the public in the over-the-counter market.

17

106. The offer and sale of these six companies’ shares through the over-

18

the-counter market each occurred within three months of the defendants selling

19

the companies in reverse mergers, as set forth below. The table that follows sets

20

forth the name of the shell company that defendants created and sold, the name of

21

the company that the purchasers gave the company after buying it from the

22

defendants, the date of that sale or reverse merger, and the date the stock in that

23

newly named company was sold to the public:

107. These transactions were not registered with the SEC, as no
registration statement was in effect, and no exemption from registration existed.
108. For each of these six offerings, Husain was the issuer of the shell

17

company’s shares because he had complete control over the shell companies at the

18

time the shell companies were sold to the shell company purchasers.

19

109. For each of these six offerings, the purchasers of the shell companies

20

were the underwriters of the public offerings of their stock, because the purchasers

21

had obtained the stock with a view to subsequently distributing the shares to the

22

public.

23
24
25
26

110. Husain and Jaclin were necessary participants and substantial factors
in the offer and sale of these shares to the public, inter alia, because:
(a)

Husain’s shell factory business was for the creation and sale of

shell companies to third parties who intended to resell in open market

27
28
29

Case 2:16-cv-03250 Document 1 Filed 05/12/16 Page 30 of 45 Page ID #:30

1

transactions. He set up the sham private placements, and he sold the stock to the

2

shell purchasers, using the stock powers from the Straw Shareholders.
(b)

3

Jaclin taught Husain how to use the self-filing model; he

4

prepared the legal documentation at each step of the shell factory; and he

5

instructed the transfer agent to issue shares without restrictive legends.
(c)

6
7

Both worked with market makers to facilitate quotes, so the

shell purchasers could have access to the public markets to distribute the shares.
(d)

8

Both worked to bring about the shell company sales, including

9

negotiating the price; preparing the necessary agreements; instructing the transfer

10

agents to cancel the stock certificates in the names of the Straw Shareholders and

11

reissue in the name of the shell purchasers; and Jaclin additionally acted as the

12

escrow agent for the sales.
111. Husain and Jaclin knew or were reckless in not knowing that they

13
14

substantially assisted having these six offerings of the shell companies’ stock to

15

the public take place without registration with the SEC.

Husain’s and Jaclin’s Attempts to Obstruct Regulatory Oversight
112. Husain and Jaclin also attempted to obstruct regulatory oversight of

the offerings of the stock of their shell companies.
113. Initially, Husain and Jaclin communicated via email using Jaclin’s
email address at his law firm, and Husain’s email address.
114. Several years into the shell factory scheme, in or about 2011, Jaclin

22

advised Husain that, to avoid regulatory scrutiny, they should exchange fewer

23

emails. Jaclin suggested that Husain instead utilize email accounts in the names

24

of the puppet CEOs to communicate with Jaclin and his law firm.

25

115. Following Jaclin’s suggestion, Husain, for at least four shell

26

companies (Health Directory, Movie Trailer, Comp Services, and Counseling

27

International), then communicated with Jaclin under the guise of each shell

28
30

Case 2:16-cv-03250 Document 1 Filed 05/12/16 Page 31 of 45 Page ID #:31

1

company’s puppet CEO.
116. In 2012, Jaclin asked Husain, and Husain agreed, to hire a computer

2
3

consultant to “scrub” emails amongst Husain, Jaclin and Jaclin’s firm. A

4

consultant was retained and did scrub Jaclin’s and at least two of his associates’

5

emails. As a result, the emails were permanently deleted from Jaclin’s law firm’s

6

email servers.

7

117. Husain also instructed the puppet CEOs for two of the shell

8

companies to make false statements during investigative testimony before the

9

SEC.

10
11

G.

Husain’s and Jaclin’s Roles in the Fraud and Registration Violations
118. Husain knowingly, or at least recklessly or negligently, carried out

12

deceptive acts and engaged in a course of business in furtherance of a scheme to

13

defraud.

14

119. Husain was the architect and prime mover of the fraudulent scheme

15

by running the shell factory, by overseeing, directing, and controlling each part of

16

its operation, specifically:
(a)

17
18

never be implemented, to give the appearance of a legitimate business;
(b)

19
20

23

locating puppet CEOs to hide his shell factory activities,

including his control of each shell company;

21
22

formulating the shell companies’ business plans, which would

(c)

paying the puppet CEOs a monthly salary to reduce regulatory

(d)

conducting sham private placements, using cash payments,

scrutiny;

24

Straw Shareholders, and forged documents, to make it appear as if the shell

25

companies had actual investors;

26
27

(e)

working with Jaclin to create materially false and misleading

registration statements and periodic filings;

28
31

Case 2:16-cv-03250 Document 1 Filed 05/12/16 Page 32 of 45 Page ID #:32

(f)

1
2

making and obtaining money by means of materially false and

misleading information;
(g)

3

providing materially false and misleading information,

4

including documents from the sham public offering and forged background

5

information documents, to the market makers and transfer agents for the FINRA

6

Form 211 application process;
(h)

7
8

the puppet CEO was approving SEC filings;
(i)

9
10

using email accounts that Husain created to make it appear as if

selling seven of the nine shell companies, through nominee-

representatives, for profit, by selling all of the stock;
(j)

11

approving a post-effective Form S-1 amendment and a Form

12

10-K that were materially false and misleading to facilitate the sale of two shell

13

companies;

14

(k) attempting to obstruct regulatory oversight of the shell factory

15

scheme by causing the deletion of emails and instructing two puppet CEOs to

16

make false statements in SEC investigative testimony; and

17
18
19

(l)

failing to exercise reasonable prudence in preparing the shell

companies’ SEC filings.
120. Husain also substantially assisted the shell companies’ fraud of giving

20

the false appearance that they were legitimate companies going public and of

21

issuing materially and false misleading statements and omissions. In short, he

22

knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the shell companies were committing

23

fraud and issuing materially false and misleading public statements; and he

24

provided substantial assistance by locating puppet CEOs; paying their salaries;

25

conducting sham private placements; hiring counsel, accountants, and auditors;

26

working with market makers and transfer agents; approving registration statements

27

and periodic reports; and selling the shell companies.

28
32

Case 2:16-cv-03250 Document 1 Filed 05/12/16 Page 33 of 45 Page ID #:33

1

121. Husain also substantially assisted the shell companies’ failure to

2

register their public offerings. In short, he knew, or was reckless in not knowing,

3

that six of the shell companies were, after their reverse mergers, offering and

4

selling stock without an effective registration statement. Husain knowingly or

5

recklessly conducted purported private placements to enable him to subsequently

6

file Form S-1 registration statements for shares held by the Straw Shareholders.

7

He knew or was reckless in not knowing that because the shares had been placed in

8

the names of Straw Shareholders, disguising his control over them, that the shares

9

could appear to be eligible for subsequent sale without restrictive legends. Husain

10

knowingly or recklessly provided substantial assistance to enable the shell

11

company stock sales into the over-the-counter market. Husain also knew or was

12

reckless in not knowing that the shell company purchasers bought the shares from

13

him with a view to engaging in a distribution.

14
15
16

122. Husain had motive to engage in this conduct because he earned
between $215,000 and $425,000 for each shell company sale.
123. Jaclin knowingly, or at least recklessly or negligently, carried out

17

deceptive acts and engaged in a course of business in furtherance of the fraudulent

18

shell factory scheme. Jaclin’s deceptive conduct consisted of him:

19

(a)

advising Husain to secretly remain in control of the entire

20

shell-making operation, including the puppet CEOs and Straw Shareholders, while

21

preparing registration statements which described the shell companies as actual

22

development stage companies with bona fide CEOs and which concealed Husain’s

23

identity and control over both company management and the Straw Shareholders;

24
25
26
27

(b)

telling Husain to pay the puppet CEOs a salary to avoid

regulatory scrutiny;
(c)

instructing Husain to obtain personal and cashier’s checks

rather than money orders to avoid regulatory scrutiny;

28
33

Case 2:16-cv-03250 Document 1 Filed 05/12/16 Page 34 of 45 Page ID #:34

(d)

1
2

approving materially false and misleading registration

statements and periodic reports for filing;
(e)

3

instructing his law firm to send the market makers the

4

subscription documents, checks, and money orders from the sham private

5

placements for their review and inclusion in their Form 211 applications to

6

FINRA;

7

(f)

suggesting that Husain create email accounts that appeared to

8

be those of the puppet CEOs but that Husain actually used, to hide Husain’s role

9

as control person;

10

(g)

approving a post-effective Form S-1 amendment and a Form

11

10-K that were materially false and misleading to facilitate the sale of two shell

12

companies; and

13

(h)

14
15
16
17

attempting to obstruct regulatory oversight of the shell factory

scheme by causing the deletion of emails; and
(i)

failing to exercise reasonable prudence in preparing the shell

companies’ SEC filings.
124. Jaclin also substantially assisted the shell companies’ and Husain’s

18

fraud of giving the false appearance that they were legitimate companies going

19

public, and substantially assisted the shell companies’ fraud of issuing materially

20

and false misleading statements and omissions. In short, Jaclin knew, or was

21

reckless in not knowing, that Husain and the shell companies were committing

22

fraud, and that the shell companies were issuing materially false and misleading

23

periodic reports, and he provided substantial assistance by approving the private

24

placements, registration statements, and periodic reports; providing the market

25

makers with documents from the sham private placements and responding to

26

FINRA requests for more information during the Form 211 process; suggesting

27

that Husain create email accounts that appeared to be those of the puppet CEOs but

28
34

Case 2:16-cv-03250 Document 1 Filed 05/12/16 Page 35 of 45 Page ID #:35

1

that Husain actually used, to hide Husain’s role as control person; locating

2

potential shell company purchasers; and providing legal and escrow services in the

3

reverse mergers, including his role in preparing and filing the Movie Trailer post-

4

effective amendment and the Health Directory Form 10-K.

5

125. Jaclin also substantially assisted the shell companies’ failure to

6

register their public offerings. In short, Jaclin knew, or was reckless in not

7

knowing, that six of the shell companies were offering and selling stock without an

8

effective registration statement. Jaclin knew or was reckless in not knowing that

9

the purpose of the series of transactions in which he assisted Husain was to

10

facilitate the sale of stock to the public. Jaclin approved the S-1 registration

11

statements and worked with market makers to obtain clearance from FINRA to

12

publish quotes for the six shell companies’ shares, thereby providing the shell

13

company purchasers access to the public markets to distribute the shares. Jaclin

14

found six of the purchasers for the shell companies. Jaclin signed letters to the

15

transfer agents to cancel the share certificates in the names of the Straw

16

Shareholders and reissue the certificates without restrictive legends in the names of

17

the shell purchasers. Jaclin prepared the documentation for the share sales and

18

acted as escrow agent for each reverse merger. Jaclin filed a post-effective

19

amendment for Movie Trailer as part of that sale.

20
21
22

126. Jaclin had motive to engage in this conduct because his law firm
earned nearly $225,000 in attorneys’ fees from these representations.
127. Husain and Jaclin’s fraudulent scheme was an ongoing and continuing

23

fraud that began in 2008 or earlier, and continued through at least 2013. Their

24

continuing fraudulent scheme was still ongoing on and after March 1, 2011.

25

128. Husain and Jaclin have each entered into tolling agreements to toll the

26

running of any statute of limitations for any action or proceeding against them,

27

including any sanctions or relief that may be sought or imposed in such action or

28
35

commenced in that tolling period, on May 12, 2016.
