SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to Section 3(e)(2)(A) of the Securities
Investor Protection Act of 1970 (“SIPA”), 1 notice is hereby given that SIPC filed with the
Commission on April 17, 2015, proposed rules, and subsequently filed amendments to the

1

15 U.S.C. 78ccc(e)(2)(A).
2

proposed rules on June 23, 2015, July 24, 2015, and September 29, 2015 as described in Item I
below, which item has been substantially prepared by SIPC. The Commission is publishing this
notice to solicit comments on the proposed rules from interested persons.
I.

SIPC’S STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF, AND STATUTORY BASIS FOR,
THE PROPOSED RULES
In its filing with the Commission, SIPC included statements concerning the purpose of

and basis for the proposed rules. The text of these statements may be examined at the places
specified above.
Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 78ddd(c), and SIPC Bylaws, broker-dealers that are SIPC
members pay assessments into the SIPC Fund. As long as the assessment is a percentage of
revenue, each member must file with SIPC a Form SIPC-6 (General Assessment Payment
Form) and a Form SIPC-7 (General Assessment Reconciliation Form) which show the
member’s calculation of the assessment. 2 If the broker-dealer is exempt from having to pay an
assessment, it files a Form SIPC-3, which is a certification by the broker-dealer that it is
excluded from SIPC membership under 15 U.S.C. 78ccc(a)(2)(A).
In 1972, as a result of significant discrepancies between the assessment information
reported to SIPC and information supplied in reports filed with the Commission on which the
calculation of the assessment was based, the Commission amended its broker-dealer reporting
rule, Rule 17a-5, 3 to require every member of a national securities exchange and every brokerdealer subject to the reporting requirements of Rule 17a-5 to file a supplemental report. 4 The
2

Form SIPC-6 reflects the assessment calculation for the first half of the fiscal year.
Form SIPC-7 is submitted at the end of the member's fiscal year and provides for a
deduction of the amount paid with the Form SIPC-6.

supplemental report must include forms showing a detailed calculation of the member’s SIPC
assessment payments or the broker-dealer’s exclusion from membership, and be accompanied by
a report of the independent public accountant of the broker-dealer. The independent public
accountant must be engaged to perform certain procedures specified in Rule 17a-5. 5
The annual reports that broker-dealers file with the Commission under paragraph (d) of
Rule 17a-5 contain detailed information regarding the financial condition of the broker-dealer.
On July 30, 2013, the Commission, among other things, made significant amendments to Rule
17a-5 (“the 2013 amendments”). 6 Effective December 31, 2013, the Commission’s amendments
to paragraph (d)(6) of Rule 17a-5 require that a copy of the annual reports also be provided to
SIPC if the broker-dealer is a member of SIPC. 7 In addition, effective June 1, 2014, the
Commission’s amendments to paragraph (e)(4) of Rule 17a-5 provide that the broker-dealer must
file with SIPC a report on the SIPC annual general assessment reconciliation or exclusion from
membership forms that contains such information and is in such format as determined by SIPC
by rule and approved by the Commission.8 The Commission determined that because Forms
SIPC-3 and SIPC-7 are used solely by SIPC for purposes of levying its assessments, SIPC should
prescribe by rule the form of the report. Under the amendments to paragraph (e)(4), brokerdealers are required to file the SIPC supplemental reports using the existing formats for the
reports until the earlier of the Commission approving a rule adopted by SIPC or two years from
the effective date of the amendment and if, after two years, no such rule has been approved,
5

The items that must be included in the report and the procedures to be performed by the
accountant are listed in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii)(A), (B), and (C) of Rule 17a-5.

broker-dealers would no longer be required to file the reports. 9 The proposed rule change would
add SIPC Rule 600 (“Rule 600”), entitled “Rules Relating to Supplemental Report of SIPC
Membership.” 10 The purpose of the proposed rule is to prescribe the information that must be
included in, and the format of, a broker-dealer’s supplemental report to SIPC.
In a letter to SIPC dated January 9, 1989, Commission staff advised that it would not
recommend action by the Commission if a SIPC member reporting $500,000 or less in total
revenue did not file the supplemental report. 11 The proposed SIPC rules incorporate this relief
by providing that a SIPC member broker-dealer is exempt from filing the supplemental report if
the broker-dealer reports $500,000 or less in total revenue in its “annual audited statement of
income” filed with the Commission. The proposed rules also provide that the independent public
accountant must be independent in accordance with the provisions of 17 CFR 240.2-01 and that
the accountant must be engaged to perform the enumerated agreed-upon procedures in
accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Finally, under
paragraph (e) of Rule 17a-5, a broker-dealer’s annual reports must be prepared and filed in
accordance with certain enumerated requirements. Paragraph (e)(4) of Rule 17a-5 requires the
broker-dealer to file the supplemental report, and paragraph (e)(5) of Rule 17a-5 requires that a
broker-dealer’s annual reports be filed not more than 60 calendar days after the fiscal year end of
the broker-dealer. Accordingly, the proposed rules provide that a broker-dealer must file the
supplemental report within 60 days after the end of its fiscal year. In other respects, the
proposed rules largely mirror the text of paragraphs (e)(4)(ii)(A), (B), and (C) of Rule 17a-5.

(a)(i) Who must file the supplemental report. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(ii)
of this section, a broker or dealer must file with SIPC, within 60 days after the end of its fiscal
year, a supplemental report on the status of its membership in SIPC (commonly referred to as the

financial statements annually.

the supplemental report for any year in which it reports $500,000 or less in total revenues in its
annual audited statement of income filed with the SEC.
(b) Requirements of the supplemental report. The supplemental report must cover the
