INITIAL DECISION
AS TO RICHARD
HAMPTON SCURLOCK, III,
and RTAG INC.
January 4, 2016

Andrew O. Schiff for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission
Andre F. Regard of Regard Law Group, PLLC, for Respondents Richard
Hampton Scurlock, III, and RTAG Inc.

BEFORE:

Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision concludes that Richard Hampton Scurlock, III, and RTAG Inc. d/b/a
Retirement Tax Advisory Group (collectively, Respondents) violated Section 15(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) by operating as unregistered brokers from January 2010
through March 2012. The Initial Decision orders Respondents to cease and desist from further
violations, censures them, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $15,000 and a civil money
penalty of $15,000.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Procedural Background
The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on January 23, 2015, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of
1933 (Securities Act), Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Exchange Act, and Sections 203(e) and (f) of

the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act).1 The undersigned held a one-day hearing in
Washington, D.C., on July 6, 2015. The Division of Enforcement (Division) called two witnesses,
including Scurlock, from whom testimony was taken, and Scurlock testified in Respondents’ case.
Numerous exhibits were admitted into evidence.2
B. Allegations and Arguments of the Parties
This proceeding concerns Respondents’ relationship with Diversified Energy Group, Inc.
(Diversified), pursuant to a “Finder’s Fee Agreement.” The OIP alleges that Respondents, neither
of which was registered as, or associated with, a registered broker-dealer, solicited investors and
received compensation for the sale of Diversified bonds and, thus, willfully violated Section 15(a)
of the Exchange Act.
The Division is seeking cease-and-desist orders, disgorgement, civil monetary penalties, and
industry and penny stock bars against Respondents. Respondents argue that the charges are
unproven and no sanctions should be imposed.3
II. FINDINGS OF FACT
A. Scurlock and RTAG
Scurlock owns RTAG. Joint Ex. 1 at 1. He has been in the financial services field for
eighteen years, with no disciplinary history; between 1999 and 2005, he was a registered
representative of four different broker-dealers registered with the Commission and held Series 7 and
other licenses. Tr. 15-16, 79, 136. Thereafter, Scurlock began an investment advisory business
under the name Retirement Tax Advisory Group, which since 2008 has been a state-registered
investment advisor in Kentucky, and also provides insurance sales and tax services to clients.
Tr. 17, 36, 77; Joint Ex. 1 at 1-2. The business was operated initially through Scurlock’s
corporation, Retirement Tax Advisory Group Inc., then as a sole proprietorship, and by 2011
through RTAG, but all were essentially the “same business,” of which Scurlock is associated as the
1

The proceeding has ended as to David B. Havanich, Jr., Carmine A. DellaSala, and Matthew D.
Welch. See David B. Havanich, Jr., Securities Act Release Nos. 9791, 9792, 9793; 2015 SEC
LEXIS 2144, 2146, 2147 (May 26, 2015).

Respondents, and jointly are noted as “Div. Ex. __,” “Resp. Ex. __,” and “Joint Ex. 1,” respectively,
and citations to the parties’ posthearing briefs are noted as “Div. Br. at __,” “Resp. Br. at __,” and

Respondents also request that the Division be ordered to pay their legal costs. Such a request,
which is premature, can only be made under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 5 U.S.C. §
504, and Sections 201.31-.59 of the Commission’s Rules, 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.31-.59. The EAJA and
the cited Commission Rules specify the circumstances under which an award of fees and expenses
will be made to a party.

owner and president. Tr. 17; Joint Ex. 1 at 1-2; Div. Ex. 2 at 2. At no time after 2005 were
Scurlock or RTAG (or any related entities) registered with the Commission as broker-dealers or
representatives of registered broker-dealers. Tr. 17-18. Scurlock was aware that to permissibly act
as a broker, a person must either be registered as a broker-dealer or be a registered representative of
one. Tr. 16.
From August 2009 until August 2012, RTAG had between fifty and seventy-two household
clients, comprised of “mostly individuals, some trusts, estates, charities and pension plans.” Tr. 1920; Div. Ex. 26 at 3; Div. Ex. 27 at 2. RTAG’s advisory business generally involves financial
planning for clients, including reviewing risks of investments and making recommendations on “a
pretty broad spectrum” of securities. Tr. at 69-71. Scurlock and RTAG have discretionary
authority over client accounts, but also advise clients that carry out their own transactions. Tr. 71,
73.
B. Finder’s Fee Agreement Between Scurlock and Diversified
In February 2009, Scurlock attended a conference for independent investment advisers,
during which he learned about Diversified and its securities. Tr. 80-81; Joint Ex. 1 at 2.
Diversified, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Florida, invested in oil
and gas wells and “had a . . . hedging account and other cattle and other offshoot businesses.” Tr.
21; Joint Ex. 1 at 2. Between February and December 2009, Scurlock performed due diligence on
Diversified as an investment. Joint Ex. 1 at 2; Tr. 81-83, 92-93.
In December 2009, Scurlock entered into a written agreement, titled “Finder’s Fee
Agreement,” with Diversified to find investors for its bonds. Tr. 21-22, 92-94; Joint Ex. 1 at 3; Div.
Ex. 14; Resp. Ex. A. The Finder’s Fee Agreement provided that in exchange for introducing
investors to Diversified, Scurlock would receive a “[f]inder’s fee” of five percent of amounts
invested by those he introduced. Tr. 22; Joint Ex. 1 at 3; Div. Ex. 14; Resp. Ex. A.4 At some point,
this fee increased to ten percent. Tr. 22, 93; Joint Ex. 1 at 3. The Finder’s Fee Agreement was nonexclusive: it provided that Scurlock “acknowledges and agrees that . . . [Diversified] shall be free to
engage such other finders, brokers, consultants or agents as it shall deem necessary.” Div. Ex. 14 at
2; Resp. Ex. A at 2.
C. Scurlock and RTAG Find Investors for Diversified and Receive Commissions
From January 2010 through March 2012, Scurlock introduced approximately fifty investors
to Diversified; some were preexisting clients of RTAG while others Scurlock considered to have
become RTAG clients upon his referring them to Diversified. Tr. 35-37, 46-48; Div. Ex. 16.
Scurlock and RTAG used the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce in performing
these activities. Joint Ex. 1 at 4. During this period and pursuant to the Finder’s Fee Agreement,
Diversified paid Scurlock and RTAG $443,249.73 in finder’s fees as a result of investments made
by those Scurlock referred to Diversified. Tr. 37; Joint Ex. 1 at 3; Div. Exs. 16, 18. In the first few
months of 2012, Diversified paid $95,441.09 of these fees to RTAG rather than Scurlock. Tr. 474

The Finder’s Fee Agreement is found at both Division Exhibit 14 and Respondent Exhibit A.
3

48; Div. Ex. 18. According to Scurlock, although most of the money was paid to him individually,
all of it actually “came in to [RTAG].” Tr. 47. RTAG’s usual “management fee” for discretionary
accounts did not apply to the Diversified bonds in which clients invested. Tr. 77-78.
Throughout the relevant time period, Respondents had a relationship with broker TD
Ameritrade.5 Tr. 32-33; Joint Ex. 1 at 3. After entering the Finder’s Fee Agreement, Scurlock
asked TD Ameritrade to carry Diversified bonds on its platform. Tr. 85-86; Joint Ex. 1 at 3; Resp.
Ex. D at 101-08. In May 2010, after conducting a review of Diversified’s materials, TD Ameritrade
added the bonds to its platform and approved them for retirement accounts. Tr. 86-87, 110, 114;
Joint Ex. 1 at 3; Resp. Ex. D at 106. Thereafter, some investors whom Scurlock introduced to
Diversified made their investments through TD Ameritrade, which would handle the purchase
transaction, including forwarding the customer funds to Diversified, providing transaction
confirmation to the customer, acting as custodian of the bonds, and receiving interest payments on
the customer’s behalf. Tr. 33-34, 108-09; Joint Ex. 1 at 3. Other of Scurlock’s clients simply sent
their money directly to Diversified or provided Scurlock a check, which he in turn would forward to
Diversified. Tr. 35.
Before clients invested in Diversified bonds, Scurlock reviewed the bonds in detail with
them and assisted with transactions. This included the following: discussing Diversified’s offering
materials, including its private placement memorandum and information about how Diversified
would use the invested funds and the interest the bonds would pay, Tr. 28-31, 110-11; reviewing
risk factors—including the fact that the bonds were illiquid and non-publicly traded, Tr. 28-29, 88;
answering questions about Diversified or referring clients to Diversified to answer questions, Tr.
28-29; assisting with the paperwork necessary to invest in Diversified, Tr. 31-32, 90, 101; and
helping determine whether Diversified’s bonds were suitable for clients and whether clients were
accredited, Tr. 32; Joint Ex. 1 at 3. Scurlock testified that this review process was “very similar” to
that used for other investments, but that the Diversified bonds carried “different risks.” Tr. 74-75,
88-90. Respondents disclosed the Finder’s Fee to clients by “hav[ing] a list on the front page” of
the offering or private placement memorandum, stating it verbally, “writ[ing] it down on a note
pad” when “going over different options,” and eventually listing it on RTAG’s Form ADV. Tr. 75.
D. State Regulatory Examination of RTAG
In February 2011, Kentucky’s Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) conducted an
examination of RTAG. Tr. 48-49; Joint Ex. 1 at 3. DFI conducts such examinations to “determine
compliance with [the] Kentucky Securities Act.” Tr. 159. Scurlock and DFI examiners discussed
the Finder’s Fee Agreement and whether it necessitated some form of registration. Tr. 49, 97. In
March 2011, following the DFI exam, Scurlock amended RTAG’s January 2011 Form ADV to
disclose that Scurlock “can receive a finders fee from Diversified . . . as outlined in their offering
memorandum” and that “[t]hese assets will not be counted as assets managed and will not be
subject to management fees.” Tr. 125-26; Resp. Ex. G-2 at 8.

5

TD Ameritrade was one of a number of custodians and trading platforms that RTAG used
generally. Tr. 71.
4

On June 2, 2011, Scurlock received an email from DFI Compliance Branch Manager
Carmen Bishop; she had “received an opinion” that if Scurlock “continue[ed] to effect purchases
and sales of private placements and receive a Finder’s fee from [Diversified]” then he would be
required to “register[] as an issuer agent.” Joint Ex. 1 at 4; Div. Ex. 25. According to the email,
this left Scurlock with four options: (1) “[b]ecome registered as an agent of the issuer”; (2)
“[o]perate as a solicitor for the issuer with a solicitor’s agreement in place”; (3) “recommend the
private placement to a client but accept no compensation from the issuer”; or (4) “[s]top effecting
purchases and sales of private placements.” Id. The email noted that if Scurlock chose either of the
first two options, he would “need to make full disclosure of the agent registration or solicitor
arrangement.” Id. Lastly, the email stated that DFI would “not take action at this time for the
earlier sales although [Scurlock was] conducting activity without being registered as an issuer
agent.” Id. The email did not address the question of whether federal law required Scurlock to
register as a broker. Id.; Tr. 50-51. Following the email from DFI, RTAG amended its Form ADV
to include a summary and a more detailed description of Scurlock’s Finder’s Fee Agreement. Tr.
51, 53-54; Joint Ex. 1 at 4; Div. Ex. 15 at 2, 5, 10.6
E. Investor Losses on Diversified Bonds
In the fall of 2011, Scurlock requested and received from Diversified updated financials
showing $4.1 million in negative shareholder equity and a $2 million loss for the first three quarters
of 2011. Tr. 40-41; Div. Ex. 9. This information “surprised” him, as he believed Diversified “had
been doing better” based on its literature and what people at the company had told him. Tr. 41-42.
After receiving the financials, Scurlock continued to recommend Diversified to a number of clients,
but believed “it wasn’t a good fit for all [RTAG’s] investment clients.” Tr. 42.
In April 2012, a number of RTAG clients that had invested in Diversified began receiving
letters from the company announcing that it was under Commission investigation, that it would be
restructuring its debt to reduce interest rates paid on its bonds, and that fifty-seven percent of the
bonds’ principal would be paid over thirty-six months, with the remaining forty-three percent to be
paid at the end of that period. Tr. 54-55; Div. Ex. 45. Scurlock stopped offering Diversified bonds
after seeing these letters, though it is not clear any such bonds were being issued by then. Tr. 55,
80, 129, 149. Subsequent letters sent by Diversified in July 2013 stated that the debt restructuring
failed and that investors would suffer a loss. Tr. 58; Div. Ex. 46. Investors holding Diversified’s
bonds as of April 2012 lost at least a portion of their principal, and some of Scurlock’s clients lost
“close to . . . two-thirds” of their investment, while others lost less. Tr. 61, 63.
6

Scurlock testified that he called DFI prior to signing the Finder’s Fee Agreement and inquired
about “anything we need[ed] to do just in general terms of [being] a state registered investment
advisor,” and was told verbally that broker registration was not required. Tr. 23, 26-27, 28, 82-83.
Nothing indicates this purported discussion related to federal law. See id. Indeed, DFI’s record of
its February 2011 examination of RTAG noted that Scurlock was not “registered as an issuer agent
or broker dealer, which is required to accept transaction-based compensation as a finder’s fee has
been deemed transaction-based,” and does not reflect Scurlock’s having mentioned any prior
guidance from DFI that broker registration was not required. Div. Ex. 28. at 7; see Tr. 165-66.

III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
The OIP charges that Respondents violated Exchange Act Section 15(a), the broker-dealer
registration provision. Specifically, the OIP charges that they willfully violated Exchange Act
Section 15(a) by effecting transactions in, or attempting to induce the purchase of, Diversified
bonds while neither was registered as a broker-dealer or associated with a registered broker-dealer.
As discussed below, it is concluded that Respondents violated Exchange Act Section 15(a).
A. Broker-Dealer Registration Provision
Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act makes it unlawful for any entity to effect transactions
in securities, by jurisdictional means, without registering as a broker or dealer. 15 U.S.C. §
78o(a)(1). “Broker” is defined in Section 3(a)(4) of the Exchange Act as “any person engaged in
the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others.” 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(4).
Scienter is not required to establish a violation of this provision. SEC v. Montana, 464 F. Supp. 2d
772, 785 (S.D. Ind. 2006).
Activities of a broker are characterized by “a certain regularity of participation in securities
transactions at key points in the chain of distribution.” Mass. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Secs. Investor Prot.
Corp., 411 F. Supp. 411, 415 (D. Mass. 1976), aff’d, 545 F.2d 754 (1st Cir. 1976). Other relevant
factors include whether the alleged broker: “1) is an employee of the issuer; 2) received
commissions as opposed to salary; 3) is selling, or previously sold, the securities of other issuers; 4)
is involved in negotiations between the issuer and the investor; 5) makes valuations as to the merits
of the investment or gives advice; and 6) is an active rather than passive finder of investors.” SEC
v. Zubkis, No. 97-cv-8086, 2000 WL 218393, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2000) (quoting SEC v.
Hansen, No. 83-cv-3692, 1984 WL 2413 at, *10 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 1984)). However, “transactionbased compensation” is “one of the hallmarks of being a broker-dealer.” SEC v. Kramer, 778 F.
Supp. 2d 1320, 1334 (M.D. Fla. 2011) (quoting Cornhusker Energy Lexington, LLC v. Prospect
Street Ventures, No. 8:04-cv-586, WL 2620985, at *6 (D. Neb. Sept. 12, 2006)).
1. Willfulness
Respondents are charged with willful violations of Exchange Act Sections 15(a). A finding
of willfulness does not require an intent to violate, but merely an intent to do the act which
constitutes a violation. See Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1135 (5th Cir. 1979), aff’d on other
grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981); Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965).
2. Corporate Liability
RTAG is accountable for the actions of its responsible officers, including Scurlock. See
C.E. Carlson, Inc. v. SEC, 859 F.2d 1429, 1435 (10th Cir. 1988) (citing A.J. White & Co. v. SEC,
556 F.2d 619, 624 (1st Cir. 1977)). A company’s scienter is imputed from that of the individuals
controlling it. See SEC v. Blinder, Robinson & Co., 542 F. Supp. 468, 476 n.3 (D. Colo. 1982)
(citing SEC v. Manor Nursing Ctrs., Inc., 458 F.2d 1082, 1096-97 nn.16-18 (2d Cir. 1972)).
Scurlock, as RTAG’s owner, was an associated person of the investment adviser (as well as being
an investment adviser himself). See Section 202(a)(11) and (17) of the Advisers Act. As an
6

associated person of an investment adviser, Scurlock’s conduct and scienter are also attributed to
the investment adviser. See Section 203(e) of the Advisers Act.
B. Violation
Scurlock and RTAG made no attempt to comply with the broker registration requirements
yet were clearly “in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the accounts of others,” in
violation of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. The undisputed facts show that their conduct
satisfied numerous indicia of broker activity.
First, it is undisputed that Scurlock and RTAG received transaction-based compensation—
the broker “hallmark.” See Kramer, 778 F. Supp. 2d at 1334. Under his Finder’s Fee Agreement
with Diversified, Scurlock received finder’s fees (i.e., commissions) of five percent—and later, ten
percent—of amounts invested by those he introduced to Diversified. These fees were plainly
“transaction-based,” as they depended on introduced persons completing investment transactions in
Diversified, and were wholly distinct from the advisory management fees usually charged to
Scurlock’s clients. Both Scurlock and RTAG received these commissions directly from
Diversified, the issuer, altogether totaling $443,249.73 over a twenty-seven month period.
Second, in recommending Diversified’s bonds to his clients, Scurlock made “valuations as
to the merits of the investment [and gave] advice.” Zubkis, 2000 WL 218393 at *9. He
indisputably “advised his clients as to the availability and suitability of [Diversified’s] bonds for
them to purchase.” As a matter of course, he discussed the merits of the investment with clients in
detail, which included going through Diversified’s offering materials and the terms of its bonds. He
reviewed risks of the investment and answered client questions, or referred questions to Diversified.
Third, Scurlock was “an active rather than passive finder of investors” in Diversified.
Zubkis, 2000 WL 21893, at *9. From January 2010 through March 2012, Scurlock introduced
approximately fifty clients to Diversified, actively carrying out the express goal of the Finder’s Fee
Agreement by recommending the bonds to a large majority of his client base. In so doing, he
helped facilitate transactions by determining whether the clients were accredited, whether the bonds
were a suitable investment, and assisting with paperwork necessary to buy the bonds. Scurlock took
custody of some clients’ checks, which he forwarded to Diversified.
This pattern of activity reflects “a certain regularity of participation in securities transactions
at key points in the chain of distribution.” Mass. Fin. Servs., Inc., 411 F. Supp. at 415. Indeed,
Scurlock materially participated in numerous key points of his clients’ transactions in Diversified
bonds, from “finding” the clients initially, to advising them on the merits of the investment, to
shepherding them through the steps necessary to execute the transaction. See Kramer, 778 F. Supp.
2d at 1336 (identifying “discussing the details of the transaction[] and recommending an
investment” as key points in the chain of distribution). Scurlock thus acted as a broker. RTAG also
acted as a broker; Scurlock controlled RTAG and acted through it, and RTAG directly received
nearly $100,000 in transaction-based compensation from the Diversified bond transactions. It is
undisputed that when these activities occurred, neither Scurlock nor RTAG were registered with the
Commission as broker-dealers or representatives of registered broker-dealers.
7

Respondents assert two defenses—that these activities were “within the scope of a
Registered Investment Adviser,” and that Scurlock was acting as a mere “[f]inder . . . not required
to register as a broker.” Resp. Br. at 1, 5-15. Both defenses are unavailing.
Though Scurlock was associated with RTAG, a state-registered investment adviser in
Kentucky, and though it is possible their conduct may not have violated Kentucky law or the
Advisers Act, neither fact compels the conclusion that broker registration was unnecessary under
the Exchange Act, as Respondents suggest.7 Although brokers may be exempt from registering as
investment advisers if their advisory activity is “solely incidental” to their brokerage business,
investment advisers are not similarly exempt from registering as brokers when, in connection with
their advisory business, they act as brokers. Compare 15 U.S.C. § 80b-2(a)(11) (defining
“investment adviser”) with § 78c(a)(4) (defining “broker”) and § 78o(a)(1)-(2) (governing broker
registration); see also 17 C.F.R. § 240.3a4-1 (inapplicable broker registration exemption); Anthony
Fields, CPA, Exchange Act Release No. 74344, 2015 SEC LEXIS 662, at *75 (Feb. 20, 2015)
(noting that “there is no requirement . . . that [broker] activity be a person’s principal business or the
principal source of income,” and that indicators of broker activity “include holding oneself out as a
broker-dealer, recruiting or soliciting potential investors, handling client funds and securities,
negotiating with issuers, and receiving transaction-based compensation”).
The cases on which Respondents rely largely undercut their argument rather than bolster it.
See, e.g., Kramer, 778 F. Supp. 2d at 1336 (most important factors for determining broker activity
are receiving transaction-based compensation and participating in “key points in the chain of
distribution,” which includes “discussing the details of the transaction[] and recommending an
investment”); Hansen, 1984 WL 2413, at *10 (listing relevant indicia of broker activity, many of
which Respondents satisfy).8
As to Respondents’ “finder’s” defense, the concept of a finder exempt from the Exchange
Act’s registration requirement does not exist in any decision of the Commission, the Supreme
Court, or any federal court of appeals. Moreover, the district court decisions recognizing the finder
concept indicate that it would be inapplicable here. See Kramer, 778 F.2d at 1336 (finder exception
pertains to “a narrow scope of activities” and broker registration is required for “involvement at key
points in the chain of distribution such as . . . discussing the details of the transaction, and
7

See David A. Lipton, A Primer on Broker-Dealer Registration, 36 Cath. U. L. Rev. 899, 933
(1987) (collecting No-Action letters on the topic, and noting that “[r]egistration of investment
advisers under the provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 does not resolve the issue
whether registration is also required pursuant to section 15(a) of the 1934 Act”).
8

Respondents point to Section 211(g)(1) of the Advisers Act, which authorizes the Commission to
promulgate standards for brokers, dealers, and investment advisers to act in the best interest of retail
customers receiving personalized investment advice, and provides: “The receipt of compensation
based on commission or fees shall not, in and of itself be considered a violation of such standard
applied to a broker, dealer, or investment adviser.” However, that is irrelevant. The issue in this
proceeding is not whether Respondents violated conflict of interest standards. Rather, it is whether
Respondents violated Exchange Act Section 15(a)(1) by acting as unregistered brokers.

recommending the investment”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); DeHuff v. Digital
Ally, Inc., No. 3:08-cv-327, 2009 WL 4908581, at *4 (S.D. Miss. Dec. 11, 2009) (finder concept is
only applicable in “certain limited circumstances” and activities “triggering [broker-dealer]
registration requirements . . . include . . . discussion of details of securities transactions [and]
making investment recommendations”).
Respondents’ defense is also undercut by the Finder’s Fee Agreement itself, which likens
Scurlock’s finder activity to that of a broker by providing that Diversified “shall be free to engage
such other finders, brokers, consultants or agents as it shall deem necessary.”
In sum, it is concluded that Respondents violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.
IV. SANCTIONS
The Division requests cease-and-desist orders; disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, by Scurlock
of $443,249.73 and by RTAG of $95,441.09, respectively, plus prejudgment interest; civil penalties
of $75,000 against each Respondent; and industry and penny stock bars.
As discussed below, the following will be ordered: cease-and-desist orders; disgorgement,
jointly and severally by Respondents of $15,000 plus prejudgment interest; civil penalties, jointly
and severally, against Respondents of $15,000; and a censure.
A. Sanction Considerations
In determining sanctions, the Commission considers such factors as:
the egregiousness of the [respondent’s] actions, the isolated or recurrent nature of
the infraction, the degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the [respondent’s]
assurances against future violations, the defendant’s recognition of the wrongful
nature of his conduct, and the likelihood that the [respondent’s] occupation will
present opportunities for future violations.
Steadman, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (quoting SEC v. Blatt, 583 F.2d 1325, 1334 n.29 (5th Cir. 1978)).
The Commission also considers the age of the violation and the degree of harm to investors and the
marketplace resulting from the violation. Marshall E. Melton, Exchange Act Release No. 48228,
2003 SEC LEXIS 1767, at *4-5 (July 25, 2003). Additionally, the Commission considers the extent
to which the sanction will have a deterrent effect. Schield Mgmt. Co., Exchange Act Release No.
53201, 2006 SEC LEXIS 195, at *35-36 & n.46 (Jan. 31, 2006). As the Commission has often
emphasized, the public interest determination extends to the public-at-large, the welfare of investors
as a class, and standards of conduct in the securities business generally. See Christopher A. Lowry,
Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 2052, 2002 SEC LEXIS 2346, at *20 (Aug. 30,
2002), aff’d, 340 F.3d 501 (8th Cir. 2003); Arthur Lipper Corp., Exchange Act Release No. 11773,
1975 SEC LEXIS 527, at *52 (Oct. 24, 1975). The amount of a sanction depends on the facts of
each case and the value of the sanction in preventing a recurrence. See Leo Glassman, Exchange
Act Release No. 11929, 1975 SEC LEXIS 111, at *7 (Dec. 16, 1975).

B. Cease and Desist
Exchange Act Section 21C authorizes the Commission to issue a cease-and-desist order
against a person who “is violating, has violated, or is about to violate” any provision of the
Exchange Act or who “is, was, or would be a cause of the violation.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-3(a).
Whether there is a reasonable likelihood of such violations in the future must be considered. KPMG
Peat Marwick LLP, Exchange Act Release No. 43862, 2001 SEC LEXIS 98, at *101, pet. denied,
289 F.3d 109 (D.C. Cir. 2002). Such a showing is “significantly less than that required for an
injunction.” Id. at *114. In determining whether a cease-and-desist order is appropriate, the
Commission considers the Steadman factors quoted above, as well as the recency of the violation,
the degree of harm to investors or the marketplace, and the combination of sanctions against the
respondent. See WHX Corp. v. SEC, 362 F.3d 854, 859-61 (D.C. Cir. 2004); KPMG, 2001 SEC
LEXIS 98, at *116.
Respondents’ conduct in operating as unregistered brokers was recurrent over more than two
years. The violation was relatively recent, occurring through early 2012. Although scienter is not
an element of the violation, Respondents were at least reckless. Scurlock has been associated with
broker-dealers, has held securities licenses, and is aware of the broker-dealer registration
requirements. Respondents’ occupations provide opportunities for future violations. Scurlock has
been in the financial services field for the last eighteen years, and he still has opportunities to
interact with clients, including RTAG’s tax and insurance clients. Additionally, investors suffered
losses on Diversified bonds sold as a result of the unlawful broker activity. Further, Respondents’
disregard of broker-dealer registration requirements caused harm generally to the marketplace,
which those requirements are intended to protect.
Accordingly, a cease-and-desist order against Respondents is appropriate.
C. Disgorgement
Exchange Act Section 21C(e) authorizes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, including
reasonable interest, in cease-and-desist proceedings.9 15 U.S.C. § 78u-3(e). Disgorgement of illgotten gains is “an equitable remedy designed to deprive a wrongdoer of his unjust enrichment and
to deter others from violating the securities laws.” Montford & Co. v. SEC, 793 F.3d 76, 84 (D.C.
Cir. 2015) (quoting SEC v. First City Fin. Corp., 890 F.2d 1215, 1230 (D.C. Cir. 1989)).
Respondents received a total of $443,249.73 ($347,808.64 paid to Scurlock and $95,441.09
paid to RTAG) in commissions from their operation as unregistered brokers. Accordingly,
$443,249.73 of ill-gotten gains is subject to disgorgement. Since Scurlock owns 100% of RTAG,
joint and several liability for disgorging this amount plus prejudgment interest is appropriate, before
taking into consideration ability to pay. However, the financial information Respondents submitted

9

The OIP also authorizes disgorgement pursuant to Exchange Act Section 21B(e), a similarly
worded provision.
10

shows that they are not able to pay the full amount in addition to penalties.10 See Section 21B(d) of
the Exchange Act;11 17 C.F.R. § 201.630(a).12 Nonetheless, it is concluded that Respondents are
able to pay a nominal amount of $15,000, and disgorgement of $15,000 plus prejudgment interest
will be ordered against Respondents.
D. Civil Money Penalty
Exchange Act Section 21B authorizes the Commission to impose civil money penalties
against a person who violated, or was the cause of the violation of, any provision of the Exchange
Act, or rules thereunder, where such penalties are in the public interest. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-2(a). In
considering whether a penalty is in the public interest, the Commission may consider six factors:
(1) fraud or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement; (2) harm to others; (3)
unjust enrichment; (4) previous violations; (5) deterrence; and (6) such other matters as justice may
require. See Section 21B(c) of the Exchange Act; New Allied Dev. Corp., Exchange Act Release
No. 37990, 1996 SEC LEXIS 3262, at *30 n.33 (Nov. 26, 1996); First Sec. Transfer Sys., Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 36183, 1995 SEC LEXIS 2261, at *9 (Sept. 1, 1995); see also Jay
Houston Meadows, Exchange Act Release No. 37156, 1996 SEC LEXIS 1194, at *25-27 (May 1,
1996), aff’d, 119 F.3d 1219 (5th Cir. 1997); Consol. Inv. Servs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No.
36687, 1996 SEC LEXIS 83, at *22-24 (Jan. 5, 1996).

10

The Division argues that Respondents did not address their inability to pay in post-hearing
briefing and that such claim should be rejected because their back-up submissions – over 1200
pages of account statements, as well as tax returns – “did not [include] all [such documents] going
back to 2010, the beginning of the violation.” Div. Reply Br. at 3. However, Respondents asserted
an inability to pay at the hearing, Tr. 132-43, and submitted statements of financial condition.
Moreover, the Division does not explain with any specificity why the missing back-up documents
might render Respondents’ statements of financial condition inaccurate, and when cross-examining
Scurlock on the tax returns he provided, did not ask him about those that were missing. Tr. 138-42.
11

Exchange Act Section 21B authorizes the Commission to impose a civil penalty in a proceeding,
such as this one, instituted pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15(b). Section 21B(d) provides:
In any proceeding in which the Commission . . . may impose a penalty under this
section, a respondent may present evidence of [his] ability to pay such penalty. The
Commission . . . may, in its discretion, consider such evidence in determining
whether such penalty is in the public interest. Such evidence may relate to the extent
of such person’s ability to continue in business and the collectability of a penalty,
taking into account any other claims of the United States or third parties upon such
person’s assets and the amount of such person’s assets.
12

“The [Administrative Law Judge] may, in . . . her discretion, consider evidence concerning ability
to pay in determining whether disgorgement . . . or a penalty is in the public interest.” 17 C.F.R. §
201.630(a).
11

Fraud and previous violations are absent from the instant case. However, Respondents’
violations involved a reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement and resulted in unjust
enrichment and harm to others. Deterrence also requires penalties.
Penalties in addition to the other sanctions ordered are in the public interest. Pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 21B(b)(1), for each violative act or omission after March 3, 2009, and before
March 6, 2013, the maximum first-tier penalty is $7,500 for a natural person and $75,000 for any
other person. 17 C.F.R. § 201.1004, Subpt. E, Table IV. A second-tier penalty is appropriate when
a respondent’s violative acts involved a deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement.
Exchange Act Section 21B(b)(2). Under that provision, for each violative act or omission during
the same time period, the maximum second-tier penalty for each violation for a natural person is
$75,000 and for any other person is $375,000. 17 C.F.R. § 201.1004, Subpt. E, Table IV.
The provisions, like most civil penalty statutes, leave the precise unit of violation undefined.
See Colin S. Diver, The Assessment and Mitigation of Civil Money Penalties by Federal
Administrative Agencies, 79 Colum. L. Rev. 1435, 1440-41 (1979).
The events at issue will be considered as one course of action – Respondents’ operations as
an unregistered broker-dealer from 2010 to 2012. A second-tier civil penalty of $15,000 is
appropriate because Respondent’s conduct involved a reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement
and takes into account Respondents’ ability to pay. See Exchange Act Section 21B(b)(2), (d). The
penalty will be imposed jointly and severally on Respondents. Combined with the other sanctions
ordered, these penalties are in the public interest.
E. Exchange Act Section 15(b)(4), (6) and Advisers Act Section 203(e), (f) Sanctions
The Division requests industry and penny stock bars. However, a lesser sanction than a bar
– a censure – is appropriate. No Commission opinion in a litigated administrative proceeding has
imposed a bar on a respondent solely for operating as an unregistered broker-dealer. Such a
sanction is found where the respondent has also violated, or aided and abetted violation of, the
antifraud provisions. See David F. Bandimere, Securities Act Release No. 9972, 2015 SEC LEXIS
4472 (Oct. 29, 2015) (violation of antifraud, broker-dealer registration, and securities registration
provisions); Maria T. Giesige, Exchange Act Release No. 60000, 2009 SEC LEXIS 1756 (May 29,
2009); Paul Carroll Ferguson, Exchange Act Release No. 6009, 1959 SEC LEXIS 549 (July 7,
1959) (violation of antifraud, broker-dealer registration, and other provisions; respondent’s
registration as a broker-dealer revoked); Gregory & Co., Exchange Act Release No. 5680, 1958
SEC LEXIS 251 (Apr. 18, 1958) (violation of antifraud, broker-dealer registration, and other
provisions; respondent’s application for registration as a broker-dealer denied); The Whitehall
Corp., Exchange Act Release No. 5667, 1958 SEC LEXIS 246 (Apr. 2, 1958) (violation of
antifraud, broker-dealer registration, and other provisions; respondent’s application for registration
as a broker-dealer denied).
Accordingly, in combination with the other sanctions ordered, a censure of Scurlock and of
RTAG is in the public interest.
