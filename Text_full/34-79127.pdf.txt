Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions, Cease-and-Desist Orders and Penalties (“Order”), as
set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds3 that:
SUMMARY
This matter involves various books and records and internal accounting controls violations
by FMC Technologies, Inc. and two of its former executives: segment controller Jeffrey Favret and
his subordinate, business unit controller Steven Croft.
During the first quarter of 2013, Favret and Croft improperly reversed required accruals to
improve their segment’s results. Their improper adjustments, which overstated their segment’s
pre-tax operating profits by $800,000 in that period, enabled the segment to meet its internal target.
Favret and Croft continued to understate this accrual inappropriately in part of the second quarter
of 2013.
Favret and Croft also failed to comply with FMCTI’s internal accounting controls by not
reporting internally, as required, that they had corrected a $730,000 error recorded in 2012 that
increased their segment’s operating results in the first quarter of 2013. Within about two weeks of
discussing this correction, Favret and Croft signed management representation letters attesting
there had been no out-of-period adjustments larger than $250,000 recorded during the period
ending March 31, 2013.
Separately, Croft failed to comply with FMCTI’s internal accounting controls by directing
that his business unit switch to a new accounting system before obtaining assurance that the new
system would operate properly. This failure resulted in errors that significantly overstated the
segment’s results in two quarterly periods in 2014.
3

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offers of Settlement and are not binding on any
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

2

FMCTI committed other books and records and internal accounting controls violations as
well. Another business that FMCTI acquired in 2012 failed to account properly for the same
accrual account that Favret and Croft used improperly. And FMCTI improperly accounted for
interest income associated with certain large intercompany loans, which resulted in an $8 million
out-of-period adjustment in 2014.
RESPONDENTS
1.
FMC Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation headquartered in Houston, Texas,
describes itself as a global provider of technology solutions for the energy industry. FMCTI is a
Fortune 500 company whose common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section
12(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 and trades on the New York Stock Exchange. FMCTI has
three reporting segments: Subsea Technologies, Surface Technologies, and Energy Infrastructure.
Energy Infrastructure is FMCTI’s smallest segment. During most of the relevant period, Jeffrey
Favret was Energy Infrastructure’s controller. During 2012, Energy Infrastructure acquired
Automation & Control (“A&C”) as a new business unit. Steven Croft was A&C’s controller.
2.
Jeffrey Favret, CPA, 55, is a resident of Spring, Texas and holds a Louisiana CPA
license, which expired in 2012. From May 2012 until May 2013, Favret was the controller of
FMCTI's Energy Infrastructure segment.
3.
Steven K. Croft, CPA, 42, is a resident of Manhattan, Kansas and holds an inactive
Louisiana CPA license. Croft is currently the controller of a private company. Croft served as
FMCTI’s consolidations and reporting manager from April 2010 until mid-2012, when he became
the controller of Automation & Control (“A&C”), a newly acquired FMCTI business unit in the
company’s Energy Infrastructure segment. As controller of A&C, Croft reported to Segment
Controller Jeffrey Favret until Favret’s departure from FMCTI in May 2013.
FACTS
Favret’s and Croft’s Manipulation of a Paid Time Off Account to Improve Segment Results
FMCTI’s Paid Time Off Policy
4.
FMCTI has an atypical paid time off ("PTO") policy in that employees earn their
full-year PTO allowances on January 1 of each year, instead of ratably in each pay period. For
example, whereas in most companies, an employee who receives 12 days of PTO per year earns 1
day of leave each month, an FMCTI employee with the same amount of PTO would earn the entire
12 days on January 1. If that employee were to resign from FMCTI on January 2, she would be
paid for all 12 days. Because this liability accrues on January 1, Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (“GAAP”) require FMCTI to establish a reserve for its full-year PTO liabilities as of
January 1.4 Throughout the relevant period, FMCTI had internal accounting policies, described as
"Financial Standards," which specified that PTO accruals must be maintained in this manner.
ASC 710-10-25-1 Compensated Absences, states that “An employer shall accrue a liability for employees’
compensation for future absences if . . . [t]he obligation relates to rights that vest or accumulate.”
4

3

5.
Like many employers, FMCTI allowed its employees to roll over a certain amount
of unused PTO from one year to the next. GAAP required FMCTI's PTO accounts to hold the full
year PTO liabilities for the current year as well as the amount of unused PTO employees were
allowed to carry from the prior year (the "roll-over") on January 1 of each year.
Croft Records the Required PTO Accruals.
6.
In May 2012, FMCTI acquired a private company that it renamed Automation and
Control ("A&C"). A&C had a traditional PTO policy wherein employees earned their leave over
the course of each year. A&C accrued this liability ratably. A&C continued using this PTO policy
throughout 2012.
7.
FMCTI required A&C to adopt FMCTI's PTO policy as of January 1, 2013.
Consequently, on January 1, 2013, A&C was required to record an accrual for its full-year 2013
PTO liability, while also maintaining an accrual for the 2012 PTO roll-over.
8.
As A&C's controller, Croft was responsible for ensuring that the business unit was
appropriately accounting for its PTO liability. Because he was new to the role, Croft consulted in
January 2013 with a long-time FMCTI employee to determine what accrual he needed to establish
for A&C's 2013 PTO liability. At that point, FMCTI's PTO accrual included only the 2012 rollover ($223,000). They concluded that A&C was required to also accrue the entire amount of its
full-year 2013 PTO liability ($928,000). In late January 2013, Croft directed his staff to accrue this
additional liability.
Favret and Croft Revise A&C's Approach to the PTO Accrual.
9.
The 2013 PTO accrual had a significant, negative impact on not only A&C's
January results, but on the Energy Infrastructure segment's results as well. Favret and other
executives in the segment were under pressure from the head of Energy Infrastructure to "push"
their teams "to discomfort" to make up for lower revenues and earnings, and Favret began to
question whether it was necessary for A&C to record the entire 2013 PTO accrual in January.
10.
In early February 2013, Favret and Croft decided – without consulting FMCTI's
corporate accounting office – to accrue for A&C's 2013 PTO liability ratably over the course of
2013, instead of accruing the liability all at once. Croft then directed a subordinate to reduce
A&C's 2013 PTO accrual by almost $800,000, leaving only the 2012 roll-over accrual ($223,000)
plus two-twelfths (representing two months' worth of accruals) of the full-year 2013 accrual
($154,667). This method of accruing for A&C’s PTO liability did not comply with FMCTI’s
accounting policy and resulted in an understatement of the required liability, which was not in
compliance with GAAP.
11.
Neither Favret nor Croft ever sought or received guidance, much less approval,
from FMCTI’s corporate accounting office before adopting this new approach.

4

12.
In mid-March 2013, an FMCTI internal audit manager conducting a review of
A&C advised Croft that his business unit needed to record the full 2013 PTO accrual.
Favret and Croft Revise the Approach Again, Completely Eliminating the 2013 PTO Accrual.
13.
During the quarterly closing process in April 2013, Favret and Croft again sought to
improve results for the first quarter. The head of Energy Infrastructure directed Favret to "push
everyone for a couple of hundred k each above their stretch" and to "[s]ee if you can scratch out
100k somewhere" and told Favret to "keep following up with [Croft] please - has to be more
there."
14.
During this effort, Croft informed Favret that A&C's results may be even lower
than they had anticipated. Croft warned Favret that A&C's bonus accrual was not sufficient to
cover a larger-than-expected bonus payout for 2012.
15.
To improve the segment's results, Favret and Croft decided during early April 2013
to eliminate A&C's 2013 PTO accrual entirely. Doing so left only the 2012 roll-over accrual
($223,000) on A&C's general ledger for the quarter ended March 31, 2013.
16.
The failure to accrue anything for A&C’s 2013 PTO liability meant FMCTI’s
accrued liability for PTO was understated and was not in compliance with GAAP.
17.
By not accruing anything for the 2013 PTO liability, Favret and Croft overstated
the Energy Infrastructure segment's operating profits by about 10 percent for the quarter ended
March 31, 2013 and allowed the company to claim that the segment's operating profit as a
percentage of revenue had increased from 6.8 percent to 7.4 percent as compared to the prior year’s
first quarter. But for Favret and Croft's misconduct, Energy Infrastructure's operating profit as a
percentage of revenue would have decreased to 6.7 percent.
18.
Croft eliminated the 2013 PTO accrual at Favret's direction. After Favret and Croft
“scrubbed” A&C’s quarterly numbers together, Favret reported to the head of the Energy
Infrastructure segment that he had changed Croft’s computation for PTO, which subsequently
reflected no accrual for 2013. Croft did not seek advice from anyone in FMCTI's internal audit or
corporate accounting group even though an FMCTI internal audit manager had recently told him
that A&C needed to have the full 2013 PTO accrual on its books and even though Croft was in
contact with FMCTI's corporate accounting group at that time on other issues.
19.
One of FMCTI’s internal accounting controls required segment and business unit
controllers to certify whether all significant liabilities, including accounts payable and payroll, had
been properly recorded. Both Favret and Croft signed quarterly management representation letters
to FMCTI’s corporate controller on April 15, 2013 and April 11, 2013, respectively, in which they
represented that all such liabilities had been properly recorded.

5

Favret and Croft Revise the Approach Yet Again, Using the 2012 Rollover Accrual to Improve
April 2013 Results.
20.
During April 2013, Favret and Croft reduced A&C's PTO accrual yet again. With
nothing left on the books for A&C's 2013 PTO liability, this time they decided to release most of
the 2012 PTO rollover. The new approach was to accrue the 2012 PTO rollover ratably such that
A&C would not be fully accrued for this liability, which clearly existed as of the end of 2012, until
the end of 2013.
21.
After discussing with Favret, Croft directed a subordinate to reverse all but onethird ($74,357) of the 2012 PTO rollover ($223,000) that had remained on A&C's books at the end
of the first quarter. This action improved A&C's income by nearly $150,000 for the month.
22.
The change in methodology to a ratable accrual of the 2012 rollover and the failure
to accrue anything for A&C’s 2013 PTO liability, meant FMCTI was not in compliance with
GAAP.
FMCTI Re-Establishes A&C's 2013 PTO Accrual and the 2012 Roll-Over.
23.
FMCTI's corporate accounting group learned about the issues with A&C's PTO
accrual in late May or early June 2013. Before the end of the second quarter, the corporate
accounting group directed A&C to re-establish its full-year 2013 PTO accrual and the 2012
rollover accrual by adding $1.18 million to A&C's vacation accrual account.
Schilling Robotics' Improper Accounting for its 2013 PTO Liability
24.
Schilling Robotics was another entity FMCTI acquired in 2012 that, like A&C,
adopted FMCTI's PTO policy on January 1, 2013. Schilling, which was part of FMCTI's Subsea
segment, also failed to properly accrue for its PTO liabilities in accordance with GAAP and
FMCTI's accounting policies. Upon adoption of FMCTI’s benefits program, Schilling took ratable
accruals for its PTO liability throughout 2013 rather than recording the entire 2013 PTO liability
($1.4 million) as of January 1, 2013.
Favret and Croft Fail to Report Internally an Out-of-Period Adjustment as Required by
FMCTI’s Internal Controls.
25.
On March 30, 2013, during the same quarter in which Favret and Croft eliminated
A&C's 2013 PTO accrual, Croft sought approval from Favret to capitalize $730,000 in research
and development costs that A&C had previously expensed in 2012. This spending should have
been capitalized as incurred during 2012. Favret approved the capitalization, which corrected the
earlier accounting treatment. Favret directed Croft to reverse the $730,000 into income and
capitalize the research and development costs. Though FMCTI's corporate accounting office had,
only three weeks earlier, notified Favret that FMCTI's threshold for reporting internally out of
period adjustments was $250,000 (pre-tax), he instructed Croft that the $730,000 was "not material
enough to call an out of period charge."

6

26.
One of FMCTI's internal accounting controls was to require segment and business
unit controllers to certify whether they had made accounting entries during any given quarter over
the $250,000 threshold that related to a prior period. Both Favret and Croft signed quarterly
management representation letters to FMCTI's corporate controller on April 15, 2013 and April 11,
2013, respectively, in which they represented that they had made no such entries. These statements
were false. Both Favret and Croft knew that A&C had recorded the $730,000 adjustment related to
2012 less than two weeks prior.
Croft's Additional Failure to Comply with FMCTI's Internal Controls
27.
In January 2014, A&C implemented a new accounting system to replace a legacy
accounting system that required the business unit to calculate revenue manually. FMCTI's internal
accounting controls required that A&C either adequately test the new system before relying on it or
maintain the old and new systems in parallel until the new system proved reliable. Despite this,
Croft discontinued the legacy system as soon as the new accounting system became operable,
before it was tested and found to be working reliably.
28.
During A&C's transition to the new system, contractors made errors in using the
new system that resulted in the Energy Infrastructure segment improperly recognizing $6.7 million
in revenue. These errors went undetected for two quarters, causing overstatements in the Energy
Infrastructure segment's operating results in FMCTI's Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March
31, 2014 and June 30, 2014.
Internal Controls Failures in Recording Inter-Company Loans Result in Additional Out-ofPeriod Adjustments.
29.
As part of an April 2012 tax restructuring of FMC subsidiaries in Europe, FMC’s
Luxembourg subsidiary, which functions in U.S. dollars, made an 11.5 billion Norwegian Kroner
(NOK) inter-company loan to FMC’s Norwegian subsidiary, which functions in NOK. The loan
between the two subsidiaries was considered to be part of FMC’s net investment in the Norwegian
subsidiary under GAAP within FMCTI’s consolidated financial statements, which meant that only
the interest income and accrued interest receivable (and not the principal balance) needed to be remeasured quarterly for currency fluctuations.5
30.
FMCTI's Luxembourg entity did not, however, perform the required remeasurements. Due to a lack of internal accounting controls for non-routine tax transactions, the
Luxembourg entity recorded its interest income receivable along with the loan principal in a
general ledger account that did not automatically re-measure for currency fluctuations. As a result,
the entity failed to re-measure the interest payments from NOK into U.S. dollars from the time of
the loan's inception in April 2012 until the accounting error was discovered in the third quarter of
2014. The Norwegian entity also failed to make the necessary interest payments to the
Luxembourg entity, triggering penalties that also needed to be re-measured. The required remeasurement of the penalties and interest required FMCTI to record an unrealized foreign currency

loss of $20.9 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2014, $8.1 million of which was an outof-period adjustment to correct the prior failures to re-measure.
VIOLATIONS
31.
Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) requires reporting companies to make and keep
books, records, and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their
transactions and the dispositions of their assets.
32.
Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B) requires all reporting companies to devise and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with GAAP.
33.
Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) provides that no person shall knowingly circumvent
or knowingly fail to implement a system of internal accounting controls or knowingly falsify any
book, record, or account.
34.
Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 provides that no person shall, directly or indirectly,
falsify or cause to be falsified, any book, record or account subject to Exchange Act Section
13(b)(2)(A).
35.
As a result of the conduct described above, FMCTI violated Exchange Act Sections
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) because it failed to make and keep appropriate books and records and
devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that its newly acquired business units recorded the necessary accruals for their PTO
liabilities, reported out-of-period adjustments, appropriately tested new revenue calculation
systems before discontinuing old systems, and properly recorded inter-company loans.
36.
As a result of the conduct described above, Favret violated Exchange Act Section
13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and caused FMCTI’s violations of Exchange Act Sections
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) because he willfully manipulated FMCTI’s PTO accrual and failed to
report an out-of-period adjustment.
37.
As a result of the conduct described above, Croft violated Exchange Act Section
13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and caused FMCTI’s violations of Exchange Act Sections
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) because he willfully manipulated FMCTI’s PTO accrual, failed to
report an out-of-period adjustment, and discontinued A&C’s old revenue calculation system before
the new system was found to be working properly.

The Commission will consider an application by Favret to resume appearing or
practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and he has
resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy. However,
if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission will
consider an application on its other merits. The Commission’s review may include consideration
of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to Favret’s character,
integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission.

1.
a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or
review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with the Commission.
Such an application must satisfy the Commission that Croft’s work in his practice before
the Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public
company for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices
before the Commission in this capacity; and/or
12

2.
an independent accountant. Such an application must satisfy the
Commission that:
(a)

is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“Board”) in
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues
to be effective;
(b)
Croft, or the registered public accounting firm with which he is
associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not identify
any criticisms of or potential defects in Croft’s or the firm’s quality control
system that would indicate that Croft will not receive appropriate supervision;
(c)
Croft has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board, and has
complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the Board
(other than reinstatement by the Commission); and
(d)
Croft acknowledges his responsibility, as long as Croft appears or
practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to comply with all
requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all
requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and
quality control standards.

K.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalties, Respondents agree that in any Related Investor
Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled to, nor shall they benefit by, offset or reduction of
any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondents’ payment of civil
penalties in this action ("Penalty Offset"). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a
15

Penalty Offset, Respondents agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order
granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of
the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be
deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil
penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action"
means a private damages action brought against Respondents by or on behalf of one or more
investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the
Commission in this proceeding.
V.
It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section
523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by
Respondents Jeffrey Favret and Steven K. Croft, and further, any debt for disgorgement,
prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other amounts due by Respondents Favret and Croft under
this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree or settlement agreement entered in
connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by Respondents Favret and Croft of the
federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set forth in Section
523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).
By the Commission.
