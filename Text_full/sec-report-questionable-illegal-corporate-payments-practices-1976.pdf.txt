The following sets

forth that report.
The almost universal characteristic of the cases reviewed to date by the Commission has been the apparent.frustration of our system of corporate accountability which has
been designed to assure that there is a proper accounting
of the use of corporate funds and that documents filed with
the Commission and

circulated to shareholders do not omit

or misrepresent material facts.

Millions of dollars of

funds have been inaccurately recorded in corporate books
and records to facilitate the making of questionable payments.
Suer. falsification of records has been known to corporate
employees and often to top management, but often has been
concealed from outside auditors and counsel and outside
directors.

PART I:

THE COMMISSION'S ACTIVITIES
AND CONCLUSIONS

A synopsis of the public filings made with the
Commission has been assembled in tabular form, attached
as Exhibit A.

The Commission's staff, in preparing

these tables, has analyzed the public disclosures filed
with

it~by·69

corporations as of April 21, 1976, that

refer to questionable or illegal foreign and domestic
payments and practices.

In addition, the staff has

prepared summaries of the six special reports obtaJned
as· a result of our enforcement actions, attached as
Exhibit B.

Finally, we also have included as-part of

Exhibit B a description of the allegations made in eight
other enforcement actions in which we have obtained
judicial relief but where reports have not been completed

The tremendous variation in the types and amounts
of

~_ayme_nts

and the attendant _circumst:ances disclosed

in the reports filed with the Commission make categorization
or quantification of the extent and seriousness of the
problem of questionable or illegal foreign payments
difficult.

Accordingly, we recognize that the matters

The Commission also alleged that the company made a
$150,000 foreign payment in order to have itself removed
from the Arab Boycott list, and in connection with that
effort sworn certificates were filed with the Arab League
representing that General Tire and its subsidiaries did not,
and would not provide technical assistance or know-how to
any Israeli company and that a particular major General
Tire subsidiary would not provide technical assistance or
make any investment in Israel.

Although the voluntary disclosure prog~am was originally conceived to apply only to fore1gn payment
problems, in practice it has been applied to ~isclosures
of certain domestic problems as well. In add1tion to
requiring appropriate disclosure under the federal

appear to represent violations of dome~t~c law to
the appropriate law enforcement author1t1es.

Commission on or before April 21, 1976. The filings of eightynine corporations are analyzed herein.* The following practices
were followed in compiling these tables.

.,
'

!

The companies that obtained the informal views of the
Commission prior to making disclosures are identified by a
double asterisk (**). In some cases brought to the Commission,
it took no position.
The Commission's staff attempted to avoid making subjective
judgments to the extent possible in compiling the charts. Whenever possible, the staff sought to characterize the conduct in
as close to the company's own terms as the limited format allowed.
The staff additionally avoided introducing non-public information
into the charts.

l:i

"i

The categories that are described in these tables provide
only general breakdowns of the reported conduct. Obviously, conduct
of the nature and variety of that set forth herein does not lend
itself to easy categorization, and there is a considerable overlap
among the classifications contained in the tables.
In cases in which the corporation made a statement that appeared to report a category of conduct contained in the table, a representation was entered in the charts. Where no statement of any kind
was made regarding a particular category of conduct, that category
was reported as "not indicated."
In compiling the tables, the Commission and its staff made
no effort to verify the information contained in the
. public filings. Thus, the Commission's report of this information
··should·drt no.:manner-.. be·considered an:.atfirmation.;Q£ its.:accur.acy , .

provide an accurate. overall pictor"e ·of the kinds of ·conduct ...
reported herein, the limitations inherent in summarization· of·
this kind of information render the charts an inappropriate source
for determining the precise conduct of any particular corporation.
The Commission suggests that persons interested in this -information·
instead consult the public documents on whic~ these tables are based.

*I The companies that submitted more detailed reports pursuant
to court order are set forth separately in Exhibit B. Exhibit A does
contain, however, public disclosures made by companies that have
settled Commission actions but have not completed and submitted
reports. Exhibit A does not contain the submissions of the J.I.
Case Company and the Midwestern Gas Transmission Company. Both
are subsidiaries of the Tenneco Corporation, and their filings
largely duplicate that of Tenneco, which is discussed herein.

The following is a summary of the six reports prepared and filed with the United States District Courts and
the Commi~sion pursuant to settlements of Commission
actions against the corporations. Each of the reports
was required to be attached as an exhibit to the
company's Current Report on Form 8-K. In view of the
significantly greater degree of detail in these reports
in comparison to most other disclosures, these reports
have been summarized separately.
These summaries present a general view of the
matters set forth in the reports. They are not intended
to be incl~sive. Moreover, in view of the limitations
inherent in summarizing such a significant body of information, the Commission strongly urges that persons interested in the conduct of particular corporations contained
in this exhibit consult the actual reports themselves.

l'

Also contained in this exhibit is a description of
the facts alleged in eight other cases, the most recent of
whicl• was filed on May 10, 1976. In all of these cases,
the corpotate defendants consented to permanent injunctions
against violations of the federal securities laws without
admitting or denying the allegations set forth in the
Commission's complaint and described herein. */ The factual
allegations described in this portion of exhibit should
be read with that limitation in mind.

AMERICAN SHIP BUILDING COMPANY
The report, compiled by a special review committee comprised
of two outside directors and an ~ndependent chairman, was filed on
April 25,-1975, pursuant to the terms of a judgment and order
entered against the American Ship Building Company. It generally
indicated the following:
Domestic Political Contributions: The report indicates
that selected employees were pa1d bonuses of $30,000 in 1970,
$25,000 in 1971 and $42,325.17 in 1972. After receiving
these bonuses and paying taxes thereon, the selected employees
would be directed to contribute the remainder to various
political figures. The Review Committee decided that the
$42,325.17.bonus paid by the company to the nine selected
employees i~ 1972 was a questionable expenditure and should be
repaid to the Gompany by its principal officer.
Other Domestic Payments: The report did not indicate
whether other domestic payments were paid from corporate funds.
Foreign Political Contributions: The report did not,state
whether foreign polit1cal contributions were made from corporate
funds.
· Questionable Foreign Sales-type Commissions: The report did
not indicate whether questionable foreign sales-type commissions
were paid from corporate funds.
Payments to Foreign Officials: The report did not indicate
whether payments to foreign offiCials were made.
Other Foreign Payments: The report did not indicate whether
other-roreTgn payments were made from corporate funds.
Books and Records Problems: The questionable bonuses discussed above were recorded as bonuses on the company's books and
records. If the contributions made from them should be deemed to
have been made by the company, recording them in this manner
would be questionable. The reports did not indicate whether
other possible books and records problems existed.
U.S. Tax Liabilities: The report did not indicate whether
problems ex1st regarding the company's u.s. tax liabilities.

. Cessation: The report indicates that the company apparently
term1nated the bonus program after it was disclosed to the watergate Committee. The report neither indicates nor recommends future
company policy changes or other measures to assure that there will
be no repetition of such questionable payments.

B-3
ASHLAND OIL INC.
The report was filed pursuant to the terms of a
judgment and undertaking entered on May 16, 1975, against Ashland and some of its principal officers. It was prepared by a
special review committee comprised of outside directors of
the company. The special committee retained independent
counsel and independent accountants to assist in the investigation and in preparation of the report. Neither the counsel nor
the accountants were Ashland's regular outside counsel or
auditors. The report, dated June 26, 1975, was filed with
the Commission and the U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia on July 7, 1975. It revealed the following:

D~mestic Political Contributions: The report disclosed
that Ashland made domestic political contributions from
corporate funds totalling nearly $850,000 during the period
1967 to 1972. The report indicated that a total of $25,700
expended from 1972-1974 constituted legal contributions.
The following sums were reported but not identified as legal,
however: 1967 - $66,5001 1968 ~ $239,6001 1969 - $46,3001
1970 - $71,7001 1971- $54,5001 1972 - $256,815.
In addition, the report indicated that $71,700 was "presumed

to have been used" for political contributions during
the 1967-1972 period.
Other Domestic Payments:

The report indicated that

$15,000 was paid by a subsidiary of the company in 1970 in

response to an extortionate demand by a local government
official. Federal criminal charges subsequently were brought
in connection with this payment.
Foreign Political Contributions: The report indicated
that Ashland Oil Canada, Ltd. (approximately 85% owned by
Ashland Oil, Inc.) made political contributions of corporate
funds in connection with federal and provincial elections in
Canada. From September 1970 through September 1974 the total
amount expended for such purposes was approximately $125,000.
The report indicates that the Chairman and Chief Executive
of Ashland-Canada advised the Special Committee that, in his
opinion, such payments were not prohibited. by applicable laws.

B-4
Payments to Foreign Officials:

B-5
The company paid

$202,000 to officials in a foreign country in conection

with the acquisition of petroleqm rights and the transfer
of operating permits. The report also stated that in 1967
and 1968 the company made payments totalling approximately
$50,000 to a group of individuals who were to provide "consulting services" to assist the company in the initiation
of a refinery project in another country. This group
included officials of that country.
The report states that in 1969, Ashland's
Chief Executive Officer personally delivered $7,500 to an
official of a third foreign country. The report further
states that the company expended $2,500 of corporate monies
on behalf of another official of that country, and that all
or part of a $100,000 payment by the company to a consultant
in that country may have been paid by the consultant
to another official of the national petroleum company of that
country.
Other Foreign PatiTents: In connection with Ashland's
attempts 1n the late 19~ 1 s to secure business opportunities
in a foreign country, the company made substantial payments to
various consultants. Thirty thousand dollars of the amounts
paid to a particular consultant were not satisfactorily
corroborated by the special committee. The committee was
unable to determine to its satisfaction that such amounts
were received by him and were not used for political or illegal
purposes in the United States or overseas.
Additional payments and transactions, totalling
$162,500 during the period 1967-1970, were identified as

having been effected with virtually no written documentation
or with inadequate supporting documentation. In almost every
case, they involved overseas cash disbursements to senior
officers of the company.
Books and Records Problems: Most, if not all, of the
transact1ons generat1ng funds for domestic payments were
improperly reflected on Ashland's books and records.· Cash
was generated for the fund principally by overseas wire
transfers from company accounts at domestic banks to overseas
correspondent banks. The funds would then be withdrawn by a
senior corporate officer and secretly returned to corporate
headquarters in the United States. False entries (e.g., "intercompany advances--exploration/production") were made in the
company's books and records to cover such transfers and disbursements.

u.s. Tax Liabilities: As a result of the improper
entries on the company's books and records, improper deductions
totalling_at least $429,997 were taken ~y Ashland in connection
with its United States taxes. At the t1me of the report,,the
company had entered into a settlement with the IRS as to certain
years in question, and it was understood that the_I~ was
continuing to review the tax returns for the rema1n1ng years.
Management Knowledge: The great majority of domestic·
payments were made by means of an off-books cash fun~ kept
in an officer's safe at corporate headquarters. Sen1or
management of the company, :including th7 Chair~ar:' and ~hief
Executive 0fficer, Vice-Chairman and Ch1ef Adm1n1strat1ve
Officer as well as a number of other senior officers, were
not onl~ aware of but were actively involved in the operation
of the fun9 and participated in the diversion of corporate
monies to 'the fund and in making disbursements therefrom.
(A total of more than $800,000 in cash ~as funneled .
through this fund over a seven year per1od.) There lS also
evidence that certain former principal officers of the corporation may have made contributions from corporate funds in ad~
dition to those specifically identified in the report. Sen1or
officers of the company were directly involved in and aware of
most of the foreign payments identified above.
Cessation: The report contained numerous recommendations
by the special committee with respect to the.cessation of the
practices described in the report ~n~ :stabllshment.of new
controls over certain business act1v1t1es and pract1ces.
Recommendations also were made regarding certain matters of
corporate structure. The principal recommendations,_with the
action taken by the Board in response thereto shown 1n parenthesis, are as follows:
(1)

No political contributions should be made by the
corporation, whether lawful or not.
(Adopted, except for political contributions
which are l~gal under a foreign country's
laws)

( 2)

Adoption of a policy and appropriate
implementing procedures against the. use
of corporate assets for any purpose
illegal under the law of the jurisdiction
where the transaction occurs. (Adopted
with specific recommended procedures to be
developed and submitted for further Board
consideration)

GULF OIL CORPORATION
The Gulf Oil report was compiled by a special review
committee comprised of two of the outside directors of Gulf
and the chairman of the committee, who was completely independent. The committee retained outside accountants and counsel
to assist in its investigation. The report was filed on
December 30, 1975. It disclosed the following:
.
Domestic Political Contributions: The report
d1sclosed specific domestic. political contributions (including
gifts and related expenses) from corporate funds totalling
approximately $1.4 million from 1960-1972. The report further
disclo~ed.that during the perio~ Gulf had approximately
$5.4 m1ll1qn returned to the Un1ted States from foreign
countries i~ off-books transactions to be used for political
contributions, gifts and related expenses. The Committee was
unable to determine the disposition of over $4 million of
this total.
Other Domestic Payments: The report does not indicate
whether other domestic payments were made from corporate·
funds.
Foreign Political Contributions: The report indicates
that the company made foreign political contributions in
seven countries totalling approximately $6.9 million
during the period 1960-1973.
In some of these countries the
p~yments were legal; in others they apparently were not.
W1th respect to those contributions that the committee was able
to trace, the report identifies the recipients and discusses the
circumstances involved.
. Ques~ionable.Foreign Sales-Type Commissions: The
comm1ttee d1d not f1nd any unusual or excessive commissions.
However, it recommended that the Board of Directors institute
a review of all commissions and consultants fees.
Payments to Foreign Officials: The report treated
all payments to foreign officials as foreign political contributions, discussed above.

B-8

B-9

Other Foreign Payments: The repo~ts indicated
that the Committee investigated leads in approximately
eleven foreign countries which ~roved fruitless.
Books and Records Problems: The report described the
use of a subsid1ary 1n the Bahamas to launder approximately
$10 million for both foreign and domestic use. The company
would disburse approximately $500,000 a year to the
subsidiary, which would be capitalized as operating
expenses of the subsidiary. Every few weeks, approximately
$25,000 would be brought back to the United States to
create an off-books fund for domestic purposes. The report
also discusses the false_accounting used in connection with
approximately $2.3 million used for foreign contributions.
U.S. Tax Liability: The IRS is investigating to
determine whether the company has additional tax liabilities.
Management Knowledge: The report concluded that
certain past top officials of the company knew of the
questionable and illegal activities and that others currently
in the company's management should have known of the activities. A past Chairman of the company and two past Executive
Vice-Presidents resigned as a result of these activities and
the Secretary was removed from that position and given a posi. tion in the company's legal department. Additionally, one
director found to be involved did not run for re-election.
Cessation: The report concluded that Gulf's
questionable activities have been effectively terminated.
The report discussed the changes in corporate policy on
which it based its belief, including:
(1)

A statement in the Policy Manual
that illegal contributions of
corporate funds are prohibited
and activities in this area
must be reported to the Chief
Executive Officer and the
Board;

(2)

A requirement that approval of
retainer and consulting agreements·
exceeding certain amounts must be
obtained at a high level of management;

(3)

Establishment of a policy of
compliance with all laws and regulations of all countries where Gulf
operates;

(4)

Institution of tighter control
over bank accounts; and

( 5)·

The requirement of annual representation
letters from certain executives and
employees.

The h report also indicated certa1'n accoun t'1ng procedures
een c anged in an effort to prevent such activities and
recommend\d certain ~ther changes to the Company.

COt~PANY

The report of the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing
Company ("3M) was prepared by a special agent, Judge William P.
Murphy, a retired Associate Justice on the Minnesota Supreme
Court, upon completion of an investigation which was conducted pursuant to a judgment and undertaking entered against
the company.
It was filed with the Company's Form 8-K for the
month of November, 1975. Generally, it reveals:

of $52,000 to 3M. The report did not disclose the identity
of the foreign country, foreign subsidiary, or managing
director in light of the small size of the subsidiary,
which accounted for less than one percent of the consolidated
sales and profits, and 3M's claim that such disclosure would
imperil the company's investment, expose its property to expropriation, or result in costly harassment.

Domestic Political Contributions:
Between 1963 and
1969, a total of $633,997 of 3M corporate funds was
misappropriated and placed in a secret fund to be used for
domestic corporate political contributions. Of that amount,
$545,799 ultimately was used for domestic corporate political
contributions from 1963 to and including 1972. Although some
contributions were made in states where such corporate
contributions were legal, the vast majority of this amount
was illegally contributed.

Other Foreign Payments: The report indicated that
no other foreign corporate payments were discovered.

The assets of the secret fund were generated through
fictitious foreign insurance premiums issued from 1963-1967,
and through kickbacks by a foreign legal consultant from
1967-1969.
Other Domestic Payments: The report indicated that
no other corporate domestic payments were discovered.
Foreign Political Contributions: The report indicated
that no corporate fore1gn political contributions were
discovered.
Questionable Foreign Sales-type Commissions: The
report indicated that no other corporate foreign sales-type
commissions were discovered.
Payments to Foreign Officials: The investigation
revealed that in 1975 a payment of $52,000 was made by the
Managing Director of a 3M foreign subsidiary to a foreign
customs official to avoid liabilities and penalties arising
from an alleged evasion of customs payments.
Because such
payment was unauthorized and contrary to 3M policy the
individual was relieved of his duties, assigned to another
position with 3M, and required to execute notes in the amount
I

Books and Records Problem: The assets of the secret
fund. used to~make domestic political contributions were
falsely recorded on the books and records of 3M as foreign
insurance premium expenses from 1963-1967 and as'foreign
legal expe~ses from 1967 through 1969.
u.s. Tax Liability: Because all of the sums placed
.in the secret fund were recorded as insurance and. legal
expenses and deducted in computing federal income tax, th~
computations on its tax return were in error. At last report,
two of the individuals responsible for the political contribution schemes were under federal indictment as a result
of the filings.
Management Knowledge: The President and Vice-President
of Finance actively participated in the activities connected with
the political contributions, as did the company's Director for
Civic Affairs. Subsequently, another President also authorized
disbursements from the secret fund, but did not participate in
its replenishment.
Cessation. Domestic political contributions were not
made after 1972, at which time the then President became aware
that they were illegal. On August 16, 1972, the President
caused 3M voluntarily to contact the Special Prosecutor's
Office to inform it of the fund's existence and use. Subsequentlyj 3M and the President both pled guilty to violations
of the Corrupt Practices Act and fines were imposed on both.

PHILLIPS PETROLEUM COMPANY

As a direct consequence of these unlawful corporate
political contributions and the resulting criminal convictions an~ civil injunctions, three officers resigned. Another
was to retire in 1976.
Other than a statement within the report that 3M had
accepted the above resignations and has taken steps to
minimize the possibility of a recurrence of a similar event,
no other steps to minimize the possibility of a recurrence
are reported. The report mentioned that the Audit Committee
made up of "outsiders" is a significant deterrent to similar
future activities.

The report, filed pursuant to a judgment and ~rder
entered against Phillips Petroleum Company as part of a
settlement on March 6, 1975, was based on an investigation conducted by outside counsel. One of the partners
of the firm retained to conduct the investigation was an
outside director of the Company. The report was dated
September 26, 1975. It indicated:
Domestic Political Contributions: The report
disclosed that Ph1ll1ps made domest1c political contributions
from corporate funds totalling approximately $585,000 from
1964 throu9h 1972. The contributions included $215,000 contributed in conjunction with state elections; $70,000
contribut~d to various candidates in conjunction witq political
dinners; $125,000 contributed to Congressional candidates;
and $175,000 contributed to Presidential candidates. The report
did not attempt to distinguish between illegal and legal
contributions.
Other Domestic Payments: The report did not indicate
whether other domest1c payments were made from corporate
funds.
Foreign Political Contributions: The report did not
indicate whether foreign pol1t1cal contributions were made
from corporate funds.
Questionable Foreign Sales-type Commissions: The
report d1d not indicate whether questionable fore1gn sales~
type commissions were paid from corporate funds.
Payments to Foreign Officials: The report did not
indicate whether payments to fore1gn officials were made
from corporate funds.

B-14

Other Foreign Payments:

B-15

The report indicated that

$1,258,000 of off-books cash was paid to two foreign indi-

viduals involved in a construction project by Phillips in
a foreign-country. The report indicates that this payment,
which was not properly entered in Phillips' books and
records, was for services rendered to Phillips in connection
with the project and was made secretly to enable the two
individuals to avoid income taxes by their country.
Books and Records Problem: Beginning in 1963,
Phillips disbursed over $2.8 million of corporate funds to
two Swiss accounts. These disbursements were made by means
of false and fictitious entries on its books and records.
$2.1 million of the total was represented as an overpayment
on a contract. The balance of the fund was generated by means
of a secret discount which Phillips received in conjunction
with a transportation contract. Neither of these rebates were
reflected on Phillips' books and records.
U.S. Tax Liability: The $2.8 million in the slush
fund discussed above was not reported as income by Phillips.
Subsequently, it has been so reported. Evidently, Phillips
did not claim any deductions for the payments it made. The
IRS is investigating the company's tax returns.
Management Knowledge: The chief executive officers
of Phill1ps in 1963 and 1964 were responsible for originating
the fund. The subsequent chief executive officers were
aware of and controlled the fund. The report indicates that
few others in the company knew of ·the fund.
Cessation: Since Phillips' consent to the entry of
permanent injunction, the company has issued a directive
to the heads of staff. under the signatures of the
Chairman and President, prohibiting the creation and
maintenance of secret or unrecorded funds of assets and the
recording of false and fictitious entries in books and
records of the company, and reiterating the company policy
against the use of corporate funds for unlawful purposes.
Also, the company's board has acted to carry out
the requirement of the judgment that it monitor the activities
of the company on a continuing basis to prevent recurrence of
the offenses which had been the subject of action. By a

resolution adopted on June 9, 1975, the board recited the
terms of the final judgment of permanent injunction and
undertakipg and assigned extensive new responsibilities
in connection therewith to the audit committee. Pursuant
to that resolution, the audit committee is engaged in
establishing, in consultation with the company's outside
auditors and comptroller, reporting and auditing procedures
designed to ensure the observation of ·the terms of the
final judgment.

NORTHROP CORPORATION
The report was filed pursuant to the terms of a
judgement and undertaking entered April 17, 1975, against
Northrop and certain of its pri~cipal officers. It was
compiled by the outside directors of Northrop's Executive
Committee. The Committee retained independent accountants
and independent counsel to investigate and report on the
nature and extent of corporate misconduct. The report, dated
July 16, 1975, was filed with the Commission and the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia, on
July 17, 1975. In general terms, it revealed:
Domestic Political Contributions: The report
disclosed that Northrop made domestLc political contributions
from corporate funds totalling at least $501,928 during the
period 1962 to 1973. This total includes $150,000
specifically identified as having been illegally contributed
to the 1972 Nixon re-election campaign. Moreover, the
majority of all contributions were effected by means of
falsely recorded transactions from an off-books fund of
cash.
·

Questionable Foreign Sales-type Commissions: The
report details the Committee's ~nvestigation into nineteen
specific transactions or arrangements identified by the
independent auditors as requiring further investigation.
Most of these involved overseas agency and commission arrangements. In all, the company paid ap9roximately $30 million to
foreign consultants and sales agents, a significant portion
of which was found to have been inadequately accounted for,
lacking in documentary support or incapable of satisfactory
corroboration.
Payments to Foreign Officials: The report identified
a total of at least $454,400 as having been specifically paid
to foreign officials, and indicated that such payments "raised
serious questions as to possible violations of law." Of this
amount, pay~gents aggregating $450,000 were made to a foreign
agent of the company with the knowledge that these funds
were to be paid to two foreign officials. The remaining
$4,400 was paid directly to an official of another country,
in an apparently unlawful effort to settle a tax liability.
In addition, it is evident from the report that substantial
amounts of money paid by Northrop as commission fees were
paid to individuals or organizations having principals who
were then foreign government officials or who were or had
been closely associated with foreign officials. For example,
a foreign official was a principal in a foreign corporation
which Northrop used as a marketing agent in connection with
foreign sales. The company received an initial advance
from Northrop of.$250,000 and currently has claims against
Northrop for $7-8 million.

Other Domestic Payments: The report indicates that
Northrop's Eastern Regional Office (located in Washington,
D.C.) engaged in improper practices involving the extensive
use of cash and improper accounting for funds that the
report described as "in effect, a hidden fund of cash." A
total of $119,000 was disbursed in numerous cash transactions
by that office from 1971 to 1973. While the Committee did
not specifically conclude that violations of law had, in
fact, taken place, the report indicated that such expenditures
were predominantly made in connection with the company's
efforts to extend "corporate hospitality" to government
officials and that the "acceptence of such hospitality by the
officials involved appears to have been questionable." The
report also indicated that $40,000 paid to a Northrop
consultant was used to pay the retired Chief Counsel of a
House Committee for "consulting services."

Other Foreign Payments: Subsequent to the report, the
company disclosed that approximately $861,301 had been paid
by one of its subsidiaries during the period 1969 to 1975 to
recipients in several foreign countries. The company indicated
that such payments "may have been in violation of applicable
laws." The company further indicated that these amounts were
paid by the subsidiary's managing director without Northrop's
knowledge. Approximately $129,000 of this amount was paid
subsequent to the entry of the judgment against Northrop
in the Commission's injunctive action.

Foreign Political Contributions: While the report
indicated that Northrop made very substantial overseas
expeditures, none were specifically identified as having
been made as foreign political contributions.

Books and Records Problem: An unrecorded "slush fund"
was utillzed by top management of Northrop as a principal
me·ans of funding political payments. The fund was derived from
payments, totalling $1.15 million over a 12 1/2 year period,

B-18

I

to a foreign consultant retained by Northrop. Approximately
one-third of the ~~aunt paid to the consultant ($376,000)
was returned in cash to a senior Northrop official who
maintained the secret fund. The total of the $1.15 million
paid to the foreign consultant was inaccurately reflected
on Northrop's books and tax returns as consultants' payments.
The practices of Northrop's Eastern Regional Office involved
currency transactions totalling $119,000 which were effected
by means of improper accounting practices. The payments to
two foreign officials by an agent of the company were
deducted by the company as "ordinary and necessary business
expenses" on Northrop's 1973 tax return, resulting in an
inaccurate statement of income. The company's treatment of
such payments also resulted in an inaccurate submi~s~on of
cost figures to the Department of Defense. In add1t1on
substantial amounts of Northrop's other foreign commission
payments were effected by means of improper or inadequ~te
accounting practices, and frequently were totally lack1ng
in any appropriate documentation.
•

B-19
Cessation: The report contained various recommendations
with respect to correcting the improprieties revealed by the
investigation, including the following:
(1)

( 2)

The adoption of specific procedural requirements to assure that information is obtained
regarding proposed consultants' or agents'
agreements to insure their propriety and to
) enable informed management decisions prior
to entering into such agreements.

( 3)

The adoption of specific requirements to be
incorporated into all consultants' or agents'
agreements, including a covenant by each
consultant or agent that he will comply with·
all applicable laws, that periodic reports
concerning his activities will be furnished
to the company, and that he will enter into
no undisclosed relationships.

( 4)

The adoption of a policy prohibiting retention
of a government official as a representative
of the company absent a clearly legal basis
for doing so under applicable laws and unless
prior Board approval has been obtained.

( 5)

Recommendation of policies regarding other
corporate matters, including the formalization
of procedures to insure against violation of
conflict of interest laws,·against improprieties
in providing corporate hospitality to government
officials, and to assure compliance with federal
procurement regulations.

( 6)

Identification of certain institutional shortcomings as subjects for Board action to correct
a corporate atmosphere which permitted the
practices discussed.

u.s.

Tax Liability: Many o~ the ~ay~ents and ~rans­
actions may have 1nvolved substant1al omlSSlons and misstatements by the company of various items in its U.S. tax
returns. The IRS has been conducting an investigation into
the matters disclosed in the report and related matters.
Management Knowledge: The Chairm~n of the Bo~rd of
Directors of Northrop, who also was Pres1dent and Ch1ef
Executive Officer; and a former Vice-President and director,
personally maintained the unrecorded cash fund ~nd made_
political payments therefrom. The sam: former V1ce Pres1d7nt
received the cash rebated by the fore1gn consultant for dlversion to the fund. While both have maintained that they were
the only officers, directors or employees specifically aware of
or responsible for the creation and use of the secret fund,
various other senior company officials knew of or participated
in the consulting, commission and other arrangements detailed
in the report. In addition, the report included information
confirming that the Chairman of the Board submitted falsified
documents to federal investigators in connection with the Nixon
contribution investigation, and that all four officer-directors
involved in the transactions had given false statements to
federal investigators.

Board approval should be required on all
consultants' or agents' agreements above
specified dollar amounts, with a requirement
of written approval by senior management of
all significant consultants' or agents' relationships.

Adoption of a new policy requiring periodic
changes in the company's outside auditors
as an added safeguard in the audit process.
The- company had had the sa"me independent
auditors for over 35 years. The Committee
did not find any breach of duty by the
auditor in fulfilling its responsibility to
conduct its audits in accord with appropriate
standards.

The following is a description of the facts set
forth in the Commission's complaints ih cases that
have not yet resulted, or in one case will not result,
in the production of reports similar to those previously
analyzed.

The complaint, naming Braniff Airways,
Inc., Braniff International Corporation and three
officers of Braniff Airways as defendants, charged
the maintenance of a secret fund of corporate assets
in excess of $900,000, which was used in connection
with an illegal political contribution and secret
payments to travel agents in Latin America in
contravention of the Federal Aviation Act, foreign
law and International Air Transport Association resolutions. Among other things, it was also alleged that
certain of the defendants disbursed $40,000 in corporate
funds to a Panama corporation closely held by a
regional vice president of Braniff Airways as an alleged
bona fide exp~nse, when in fact this payment was a
vehicle for conversion of corporate assets into cash
to be used for unlawful political purposes.

Lockheed Aircraft Corporation:

General Tire & Rubber Corporation:
The Commission alleged that a "slush fund"
had been established by General Tire and its
subsidiaries in order to obtain favorable
treatment by certain foreign governments. In
addition, the complaint alleged that through
purported salary increases and bonuses corporate
funds were diverted for political purposes. In
the aggregate, several million dollars were used
for these and similar undisclosed corporate
activities. The allegations are described in
more detail at pages 5-6 of this report.

Kalvex, Inc:
The Commission charged defalcations of corporate asets by senior officers who allegedly submitted duplicate
expense vouchers and received kickbacks that were not
reported to the company. Following litigation, an
order of permanent injunction was entered.

The Commission complaint named Lockheed, the Chairman of the Board of Directors from 1967 until
February, 1976, and the President of the company
from 1967 until October, 1975. In particular, the
Commission alleged that secret payments of at least
$25 million (at times in cash) had be'en made to
foreign .government officials for the purpose of
assisting Lockheed in procuring and maintaining
contracts· with foreign govarnment customers, and
in expediting permits necessary to perform existing
contracts. Among other things, it was alleged that
the defendants disguised these secret payments on
Lockheed's books and records by utilizing, or causing
to be utilized, false accounting entries, cash and
"bearer~ drafts payable directly to foreign government
officials, nominees and conduits for payments to
government officials and other artifices and schemes.
As a result of their activities, at least $750,000
was not expended for the purpose indicated on the
books and records of Lockheed and its subsidiaries
and was deposited instead in a secret Swiss bank
account, and an additional $25 million was expended
in secret payments to foreign officials. In addition,
the Commission alleged that over $200 million was
disbursed to consultants and commission agents without adequate records and controls to insure that ·
the services actually were rendered. The practices
were alleged to have resulted in the filing of
inaccurate financial statements with the Commission
with respect to the income, cost and expenses of
the company.

Missouri Public Service Company:
The Commission alleged that the defendants utilized
corporate money for illegal political purposes. In
particular, the Commission alleged that corporate
funds were diverted by means of certain employees' secret
agreement to contribute a percentage of their monthly salaries
to a nonprofit club, which would in turn make the contributions. In excess of $67,000 was alleged to have been
diverted from the company's system of accountability.

Sanitas Service Corporation:
j;

The Commission alleged that the defendants caused
Sanitas to enter into an agreement designed to disguise
otherwise secret cash payments for illegal political
purposesr bribes, kick-backs and other similar payments.
Through this contractual relationship the defendants
funneled in excess of $1.2 million out of the corporation's system of financial accountability, some
indeterminate portion of which was converted by one
of the defendants for his personal use.
In order
further to disguise and effectuate such payments, the
defendants submitted fictitious invoices and authorized
the payment of corporate assets to wholly-owned subsi-diaries.

The Commission-alleged that United Brands deposited
$1.25 million in the Swiss bank accounts of designated
foreign government officials and agreed to pay an
additional $1.25 miilion at a later date, provided the
company received certain preferential export tax
considerations. (These matters are reported in substantially the same manner in United Brands filing
that is analyzed in Exhibit A).
·

Waste Management, Inc:
The Commission alleged that a secret fund of approximately $36,000 was used by the defendants for political
contributions and other purposes, some of which were
illegal. The Commission further alleged that the corporation and the defendants failed to maintain adequate
accountability such that its auditors were unable
to verify disbursements.

An exposure draft of a proposed Statement on Auditing Standards entitled

"Illegal Acts by Cli'ents• accompanies this letter. The exposure
period has been extended in recognition of the importance of this issue.
This proposed Statement does not contain specific procedures to detect
an illegal act by a client. An examination in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards cannot be expected to provide assurance that
illegal acts will be detected. This limitation is considered in another
proposed Statement entitled "The Independent Auditor's Responsibility for the
Detec~ion at Errors and Irregularities• also issued for comment today.
The proposed Statement does specify that the auditor should be aware
ot the possibility that illegal acts may have occurred that may have
a material effect on the financial statements. It further requires that
should an auditor become aware of a possible illegal act he should
perform additional procedures to investigate the matter and, if necessary,
consult with legal counsel. The exposure draft also offers practical
suggestions in connection with illegal acts that do not appear to have
a material effect on the financial statements.
Comments and suggestions on any aspect of the enclosed draft are sought
and will be appreciated. They should be addressed to the Auditing Standards
Division, File Ref. No. 3620, at the AICPA in time to be received by
July 30, 1976. The Auditing Standards Executive Committee will be particularly
interested in the reasoning underlying comme~ts and suggestions.

l. This Statement provides guidance for an independent auditor
when acts that appear to him to be
illegal come to his attention during
an examination of financial state.
ments in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. This
Statement also discusses the extent
of the attention he should give,
when ~rfonning such an examina·
tion, to the possibility that such acts
may have occurred. The types of
acts encompassed by this Statement
include illegal political conhibutions to a candidate in an election
for a federal office, bribes, and other
violations of laws and regulations.
2. This Stateme~t sets forth
guidelines for the ~ropriate con·
duct of an independent auditor in
fu!Biling his obligation to report on
financial statements in accordance

with professional standards (paragraphs 4-19). It also offers practical
suggestions and guidance for the
auditor in connection with illegal
acts not having a material effect
on the financial statements (paragraphs 20 and 21).
3. An examination made in ac·
cordance with generally accepted
auditing standards cannot be expected to provide assurance that
illegal acts will be detected.' In reporting on financial statements, the
independent auditor holds himself
out as one who is proficient in ac·
~unting and ~uditing. Determinmg whether an act is illegal is
· usually beyond the professional
competence of an auditor. The
auditor's training and experience,
however, ordinarily should provide
a reasonable basis for an awareness

that some acts by a client coming to
his attention in the performance of
his examination might be illegal.
Nevertheless, the further removed
such an act is from the events and

transactions ordinarily reflected
specifically in financial statements,
the less likely it is that the auditor
may become aware of the act or
recognize its possible illegality.

4. The auditor's examination
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards does
not ordinarily include procedures
specifically designed to detect illegal acts. In making such an examination, however, the auditor should
be·. aware of the possibility that
illegal acts may have occurred that
may have a material effect on the
financial statements. If as a result
of h1s procedures the auditor believes that illegal acts may have
occurred, he should perform additional procedures to investigate
those matters, including consultation with legal counsel as necessary,
to obtain an understanding of the
nature of the acts and their posSible effects on the financial statements.

classification; or transactions not
recorded in a complete or timely
manner to maintain accountability
for assets. Such transactions may
raise questions about the possible
existence of" an illegal act.
7. In making an examination, the
aJ.Iditor obtains evidential matter as

to the propriety of the accounting
treatment of and support for trans-

actions and balances. The procedures performed to obtain evidential
matter include obtaining an under-

standing of the transactions tested
and their business purpose. A trans-

action that appears to the auditor
to have a very unusual or questionable purpose may raise questions
about the possible existence of an

illegal act.

15. Because of the variety of
acts and circumstances that might
be encountered, it is not practicable
to provide specific guidance on. the
steps an auditor should connder
taking with respect to a possible
illegal act that comes to his attention. The auditor should consider
the circumstances promptly; such
consideration may include seeking

the ad vice of legal counsel or other
specialists. The implications of a
possible illegal act should be considered in relation to the intended
degree of reliance to be placed on
the internal accounting control and

the representations of management.

Illegal Acts Having a Material ERect

17. If the auditor concludes that
an event whose effect, taken alone
or with similar events, is material
in amount and has not been prop-

erly accounted for or disclosed in
the financial statements, he would

ordinarily need to qualify his opinion or express an adverse opinion

because of the departure from generally accepted accounting principles (see SAS No. 2, paragraphs
15:17),

amount of the potential loss cannot
be estimated, an uncertainty e:tists
for which the auditor should consider the need to qualify his opinion
(see SAS No. 2, paragraphs 21-25).
19. In s901e instances, the audi.

tor may nc:if:>be able fo d"etermine

may have been accomplished by
circumventing the internal control

system and may nnt be propei-1y
recorded or otherwise adequately
documented. In those circumstances, the auditor should comider
the need. to qualify his opinion or

Dear Mil:
I want to take this opportunity to congratulate you again on your
recent appointment and to wish you the best of luck. The job is a
challenging one, but one I know you will fill with distinction. I speak
for all the members-of the Commission in saying that we look forward to
working with you on the many complex problems facing the securities
industry today. In that vein, I would like to advise you of a subject
which Jim Needham and I have discussed inforillally in the past, and
ask for the benefit of your thoughts.
•
As you know, the Commission has for many years advocated that
publicly-held companies create audit committees, composed of independent
directors to work with outside auditors.*/ In our review of corporations
who have ~evealed questionable foreign and domestic payments we have
found an almost universal use of misleading financial records to conceal
such corporate practices from outside auditors and director~ and cor~orate

counsel. The existence of an audit committee th~t meets ~r~vate~y.W1th t~e
outside auditors to discuss the scope of the aud1t, quest~ons ar1s1ng dur1ng
the audit, including disputes with management, and that has access to the
corporate financial information, is an important part of our eff?rt \:0
maintain the credibility of our system of corporate self regulat1on.
I am sure you are aware of the fact that the Auditing Standards
Committee of the A.I.C.P.A. has circulated an exposure draft of

aud~t

Additionally, there has been considerable recent comment about
steps that can be taken to make the role of the board of-directors
more meaningful. Some major corporations have already taken steps
to restructure their boards so that a majority consists of outside
directors. Indeed, the Chairman of Connecticut General has recently
written us abo.ut actions taken by that corporation to create a board
consisting only of outside directors and the chief executive officer.
While ~have no firm notion about the optimum relationship between
outside and inside directors, we do believe it is a subject of considerable importance.
Finally, many thoughtful commentators and many major law firms
have come to the conclusion that the effectiveness of the board of
of directors and independent counsel is enhanced when the crit.ical
aspects of the two functions are kept separate. This. of course,
raises the question of whether members of law firms which have the
responsibility of advising the corporation. including the board,
should also serve as members of that board of directors.
The importance of maintaining the truly indepe~dent character
of the boards of directors. of our larger corporations has been illustrated
by the Commission's recent enforcement actions in the area of questionable
or illegal co,porate payments. Significantly, in some of these cases
no audit committee existed. In the others, with a single e~ception,
audit committees were either only operated during a portion of the
time when the questionable payments were alleged to have been made,
or not wholly independent of management. Accordingly, the resolution
of these actions typically has involved the establishment of a committee
comprised of independent members of the ~oard of directors in order
to conduct a full investigation, utilizing independent legal counsel
and outside auditors to conduct the necessary detailed inquiries.
The thoroughness and vigor with which these committees have conducted·
their investigations demonstrates the importance of establishing entirely
independent audit committees as permanent, rather than extraordinary,
corporate organs and encouraging the Board to rely on independent counsel.

William Batten, Chairman

With these thoughts in mind, we have been considering various
approaches to increase the likelihood that larger public corporations
will establish audit committees composed of outside directors, that
they will take further steps to make the role of the board of directors
more meaningful, and that corporate boards will deal with independent counsel.
One particularly promising approach to accomplish these goals would be for
the Exchange to amend its policies and practices. As the Company Manual
points out, the Exchange's listing agreement constitutes a code of
performance to which companies commit when listing their securities
on the Exchange. When the listing agreement was first instituted in
1399, the Exchange took the lead in the field of financial disclosure
by requiring regular financial reports from listed companies; subsequently,
independent public accountants were required. -

We look forward to receiving the benefit of your views, particularly
as to what Commission action, if any, in this area would be useful. We
would be pleased to meet with you to discuss these matters further.

The Exchange's listing policies have expanded in scope over the
years. Specifically, the Exchange has long urged the desirability of
including outside directors on corporate boards and specifically charging
them with ensuring full disclosure of corporate affairs. In its 1973
White Paper on financial reporting, the Exchange recommended that audit
committees, preferably comprised eXclusively of outside directors, be
formed. This recommendation represented a reaffirmation of a principle
first raised by the Exchange in 1940.
In keeping with this tradition, the Exchange now could take the
lead in this area by appropriately revising its listing policies, thus
providing a practical means of effecting these important objectives without
increasing direct government regulation. The objectives are sound in
principle and, if implemented, they would significantly advance the
public interest.
We would very much appreciate rece~v~ng your views on whether
the New York Stock Exchange would find it appropriate to alter its
listing policies along the lines discussed above. We are sensitive to
the fact that, to the extent the Exchange's listing policies impose
burdens which corporations might otherwise avoid, the attractiveness
of listing on the Exchange may be diminished. But, at the same time,
the Exchange has frequently recognized that it could provide effective
le3dershiD "'here its initiativzs ,,..ere. consistent with develoome.nts

in public. policy in the fields of corporation finance, manag~ment,
stockholder relations and accounting, and recent surveys suggest that
perhaps two-thirds of NYSE listed companies already have independent
audit committees.
