In the Matter of

REBORNNE (USA) INC.
On June 23, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondent has a class of securities registered with the Commission and is delinquent in its
periodic filings. A hearing is scheduled for July 12, 2016.
To allow time for the Division of Enforcement to establish service of the OIP on
Respondent and for Respondent to file an answer, I POSTPONE the hearing currently scheduled
for July 12, 2016. The Division is ORDERED to file a declaration of service by July 15, 2016. I
will schedule a telephonic prehearing conference once service on Respondent has been
established.
