ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order Instituting
Proceedings (OIP) on March 30, 2015. The OIP alleges that Respondents violated the antifraud
provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 in their operation of three collateral loan obligation
funds (known as the Zohar Funds) by reporting misleading values for the assets held by the funds and
failing to disclose a conflict of interest arising from Lynn Tilton’s undisclosed approach to
categorization of assets. The proceeding was stayed by order of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit between September 17, 2015, and June 2016. See Tilton v. SEC, No. 15-2103, 2016
U.S. App. LEXIS 9970, at *37 (2d Cir. June 1, 2016); Tilton v. SEC, No. 15-2103, ECF Nos. 76, 125.
The hearing is currently scheduled to commence on October 24, 2016.
A subpoena directed to Barclays PLC was issued on May 27, 2015, at Respondents’ request.
Respondents and Barclays have entered a confidentiality agreement covering documents and
information produced pursuant to the subpoena. Under consideration are Respondents’ October 17,
2016, Motions: (1) to Compel Barclays to Produce a Document Responsive to [that] Subpoena; and
(2) for Leave to File the Motion to Compel. The Motion for Leave to File will be granted. Exhibit C
to the Motion to Compel – an email from Barclays’s counsel to Respondents’ counsel Susan Brune –
states that Barclays is amenable to producing the document at issue (subject to mutually agreeable
redactions) but that the document is covered by a confidentiality agreement between Barclays and
MBIA. Thus, Barclays awaits either further instruction from the undersigned or written consent from
MBIA. In light of the confidentiality agreement between Respondents and Barclays, MBIA is
protected from misuse of the document at issue, and Barclays will be ordered to produce it, subject to
the confidentiality agreement, unless MBIA files an objection thereto by 5:30 p.m. EDT on October
19, 2016.
This order shall be served on: Jonathan Hoff and Joshua P. Arnold, Cadwalader, 200 Liberty
St., New York, NY 10281 (counsel for MBIA); and Andrew Z. Michaelson, Boies, Schiller & Flexner,
LLP, 575 Lexington Ave., 7th Floor, New York, NY 10022 (counsel for Barclays).
IT IS SO ORDERED.
