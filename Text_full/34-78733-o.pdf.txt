SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
August 31, 2016

In the Matter of
Luxeyard, Inc., and
SuperDirectories, Inc.
ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING
File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Luxeyard, Inc. (CIK No.
1493587), a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business listed as Los
Angeles, California, with stock quoted on OTC Link (previously, “Pink Sheets”) operated
by OTC Markets Group, Inc. (“OTC Link”) under the ticker symbol LUXR, because it
has not filed any periodic reports since April 9, 2013. On August 19, 2015, Luxeyard,
Inc. was sent a delinquency letter by the Division of Corporation Finance requesting
compliance with its periodic filing obligations , but did not receive the delinquency letter
due to its failure to maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by
Commission rules (Rule 301 of Regulation S-T, 17 CFR 232.301 and Section 5.4 of
EDGAR Filer Manual).
It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of SuperDirectories, Inc. (CIK

No. 1338624), a delinquent Wyoming corporation with its principal place of business
listed as Merrill, New York, with stock quoted on OTC Link under the ticker symbol
SDIR, because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended June 30, 2014.
On September 25, 2015, SuperDirectories, Inc. was sent a delinquency letter by the
Division of Corporation Finance requesting compliance with its periodic filing
obligations, but did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a valid
address on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules (Rule 301 of
Regulation S-T, 17 CFR 232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual).
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of
investors require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed company.
Therefore, it is ordered, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on August 31, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT on September
14, 2016.
By the Commission.
