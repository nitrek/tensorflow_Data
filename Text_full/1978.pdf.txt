CHAIRMAN'S LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL

The Honorable Walter F. Mondale
President, U. S. Senate
Washington, D.C 20510
The Honorable Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr
Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C 20515
Gentlemen:
I am pleased to transmit herewith the Annual Report of the Untted
States Securities and Exchange CommISSIOn for the period October 1,
1977 to September 30, 1978. Reflecting the Comrrussron's continuing
efforts to review and improve ItS internal procedures, this year's Annual
Report has a new, streamlined format, which we hope Will Increase its
utility to the Congress and to others interested In the Commission's

work.
The activmes and accomplishments
set forth in the Annual Report
once again reflect the Commission's long tradition of hard work and
high achievement. As I did last year, I would like to take thrs
opportunity to offer my views of the Commission's progress In
addressing the major Issues facmg the Commission. One theme runs
throughout my review of the Comrrnssron's progress. Each Issue we
address reflects the Cornrrussion's effort to balance judrcrously ItS use
of direct regulatory authority against its reliance on private sector selfregulatory initiatives wherever consistent With investor protection.
Through this process, the Commission has cultivated one of the sources
of ItS fundamental strength and vitality-the
ability to maximize the
Implementation
of the Congressional goals embodied In the federal
securities laws With a minimum of federal intervention.
Development

of a Netionel

Market System

The Secuntres Acts Amendments of 1975 require the Cornrmssion to
tacrlitate the Implementation of a national market system for the
trading of securrtres. The Commission believes that such a system
III

should Ideally be an Industry undertaking, and that the Commission's
role should be to Identify objectives. stimulate Initiatives, assess
progress, and fill whatever vords may occur from time to time In the
process. It was In this SPirit that the Commission In January 1978
released a comprehensive policy statement setting forth SIX Interrelated
initiatives which It believed should be taken to facilitate development
of the system
DUring the past year, substantial progress was made In Implementing
three of the January rrutratrves-i-a consolidated quotation system, a
nationwide network of order-routing facilities, and refinement of the
exrstrng consolidated transaction reporting system Following the end of
the fiscal year, additional progress was made In facilitating the
development of a national market system. In March 1979, the
Commission Issued a status report assessing the progress made dunng
the past year and indicating the Commission's views as to those steps
which next should be taken to continue progress toward a national
market system. The status report discussed developments towards
achrevmg the other three January initiatives and indicated that the
Commission's first Priority IS the achievement of nation-Wide price
protection for public limit orders against execution at inferior prices In
additron, the status report stated that the Cornrrussron would Initiate
rulernakmg proceedings, which It has done, to consider redefinition of
the trading environment for secuntres now traded over-the-counter
when those secuntres become listed on an exchange for the first time
Finally, the Cornrrussion IS actively considering rulernakrng with respect
to qualified secuntres,
Industry and Comrrussron actions related to these areas have a high
pnority, and I remain confident that the baSIC elements of a national
market system Will all be In place before the end of my term as
Chairman In 1982 While much remains to be done In order to attain
that goal, the Cornrrussion IS fully committed to insuring that Congress'
mandate IS Implemented In a fashion which strengthens and Improves
our capital markets. Those markets are the finest in the world, and
nothing In the evolving new system threatens that pre-eminence.
The Problems of Small BUSiness
Small busmess has long been recognized as a Vital part of the
American economy. The 13 rrulhon or so small firms account for 55
percent of all private employment, 48 percent of the nation's bus.ness
output and 43 percent of ItS GNP. Even these rather rrnpressive figures
fall to convey the full Importance of small businesses to the drversrty
and Vitality of our society. lndrvidual efforts to respond to the demands
of a free market provrde our economy With ItS Immense diversrty,
achieved to a great extent through the efforts of small businessmen.
But, In recent years, small busmesses have not tlounshed. The
opportunity cost of capital IS high-c-as IS rnflatron-c-and adverse
attitudes towards risk-taking have worked to exclude small companies
from our capital markets and Impaired their ability to grow. The
inability of small business to accumulate capital and generate the
IV

savings required for innovation has slowed growth, diminished
productivity and contributed to the increasing difficulty In maintaining
the standard of living we have come to expect In the United States
Many of the problems facing small businesses are beyond the scope
of the Commission to address. However, a fundamental objective of the
federal securities laws IS to promote public confidence In the securities
markets, so that Investors will be willing to participate In the process by
which capital IS marshalled from the public and channelled Into
economic growth. This Important interrelationship
between Investor
confidence and capital formation requires that the Commission be
sensitive to the effects of ItS activities on the capital formation process
Thus, the Commission has tried to remain cognizant of the effects of ItS
actions on small businesses
While we must carefully balance our efforts to facilitate venture
capital formation against our primary responsibility to protect Investors,
we have been able to ease the regulatory burden on small business In a
number of areas Although the federal secunties laws are not generally
considered to be a primary contributor to the capital formation
problems of small business, they do have an Impact We therefore
monitor our regulatory actions to ensure that they do not Inadvertently
affect thrs sector of the economy In a negative way Further, we are
taking affirmative steps to rmrurruze the tension which often
accompanies the interaction between small business and the
government.
The Commission has recently amended Rules 144 and 146, and
Regulation A, to liberalize sales of restricted securities and to make
small offerings more viable In addition, we have adopted a new
registration statement, Form S-18, to assist small business capital
formation
This Form will allow a small, unseasoned Issuer to sell up to
$5 million In equrty secuntres without Incurring the full range of
disclosure and reporting burdens Imposed upon other Issuers
Finally, the Commission has created a new Office of Small Business
Policy In the DIVISion of Corporation Finance, to serve as the focal POint
for small business matters Within the Commission As these initiatives
are Implemented, there should be a substantial lessening of the
frustration that has historically accompanied much of the dealings by
small businesses With the Commission
Corporate Accountsbtttty
One of the oldest and most traditional of all our self-regulatory
frameworks is embodied In the relationship between shareholders,
management and the board of directors of a corporation The
effectiveness of thrs framework has been criticized, and some of the
Criticism IS no doubt valid. But, thrs structure IS fundamental to our
society, and I believe It retains a great vitality
The Cornrrussron has been engaged In a continuing review of
mechanisms of corporate accountability
since September 1977 Thrs
review has so far produced amendments to our proxy rules including
disclosure of the background and relationships of nominees for

v

membership on the board of directors and disclosure of board and
cornrruttee structure and composition, new rules regarding disclosure of
management remuneration, and a heightened sensitivity In the
corporate community to the need to reexamine the traditional roles
played by boards of directors, management and shareholders In the
accountability
process. Currently, a staff report IS being prepared
consolidating the knowledge we gained from our hearings on corporate
accountability,
examining the areas appropriate for future exploration,
and analyzing the roles which the publrc and pnvate sectors should play
in the accountability
process. In addition, as a result of the Increased
disclosure requirements for 1979 proxy statements, the Commission
will be able to quantify data regarding composition and structure of
boards of directors and their committees and develop a baseline for
tracking future developments. This should provide all concerned with
corporate accountability
a better understanding of developments and
programs In this vital area.
The Commission IS consrdenng proposing for comment amendments
to the proxy rules which would Improve the effectiveness of the proxy
Solicitation process as a vehicle for communication
between
shareholders and their companies. If adopted, such amendments would
be effective for the 1980 proxy season. One proposal under
consrderatron would require that proxy cards permit shareholders to
vote with respect to mdrvrdual nominees for election to boards of
directors. A second proposal would clarify the time by which
shareholder proposals must be submitted In order to be Included in
corporate proxy materials. And a third proposal would expand the
limited exemption which now exists for the furrushrng of unsolrcited
proxy voting advice.
The Commission's efforts to enhance corporate accountability
are not
Intended as adversary, but rather as furthenng the tradrtionat and Vital
mechanisms of corporate governance and self-regulation.
Our
contrnumg initiatives will hopefully provide disclosures which will
enable and encourage Investors and others to assess how well the
corporate cornrnuruty governs Itself, and may thus help avoid the need
for federal legrslative intervention.
Enforcement
A vigorous and ettective enforcement program IS entreat to the
Comrnissron's ability to carry out ItS responsibility to protect investors.
Our willingness and ability to take prompt enforcement action to
redress violations of the statutes and regulations which we administer
helps to Insure the credibility of the Commission's activtties and
voluntary compliance With the federal securlties laws. The
Cornrnisston's enforcement cases discussed in this year's annual report
reflect the complexity and breadth of the Commission's responsibilities.
The Commission attempts to tailor the relief obtained In ItS
enforcement cases In order to protect the investing public, remedy the
results of past Violative conduct, and assure that circumstances which
may have facilitated violations of the federal securities laws do not
VI

recur Such an approach requires that the Commission have and
exercise a degree of flexibility-not
only to respond to traditional areas
of concern to the Congress and the Commission but to assure that the
Commission IS capable of meeting new challenges. A good example of
this approach IS the Commission's ability to obtain other equitable
relief In appropriate injunctive cases. Such additional relief, including
the appointment of special review persons to conduct further
mvestigatrons Into factual allegations made by the Commission and to
make a comprehensive report of their findings, helps to place the cost
and responsibility of remedying the harm caused to the investing publrc
by Violations of the federal secuntres laws upon those who are
responsible for the Violations. In this manner, the Commission's
enforcement staff may devote its energies to other problem areas In the
knowledge that the public will be protected, and that the full facts
surrounding vrolatrons will be made known This approach has enabled
the Commission to rnaxrrruze the effective use of Its limited staff
resources
Nevertheless, our resources are Inadequate to police all secunties law
Violations which may take place. As a result, our enforcement actrvrtres
are designed not only to address specifrc wrongdoings, but also to alert
the private sector as to the kinds of actrvitres which we believe Violate
the secuntres laws.
Private actions, brought by aggrieved mdrvrduals to protect their own
rights, supplement the Commission's own enforcement program, and
Significantly Increase the likelihood that securities law Violations will be
challenged and corrected Increasingly, however, the ability of private
parties to enforce provrsions of the federal secunt.es laws has been
challenged In the courts. * To the extent courts determine that the
federal secunties laws do not Imply private rights of action, the ability
of aggrieved mdivrduals to seek redress for personal wrongs will thereby
be curtailed. The resulting burden on the Cornrrussron would seriously
Impair ItS ability to enforce the federal secuntres laws
Disclosure

Developments

Assuring the disclosure of corporate information necessary to enable
Investors to make an intelligent Investment decision IS one of the
Commission's primary responsibilities
The Securttres Act of 1933
generally requires that before securrtres may be offered to the public a
registration statement must be filed With the Commission, and a
prospectus containing the most Significant intorrnatron In the
registration statement must be furnished to Investors. In addition, the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 contains disclosure provisrons
designed to provide current information on a periodic basis about
companies In whose securrtres there IS a substantial public Interest.
The Commission IS endeavoring to Integrate the various types of
* See, e.g., Touche Ross & Co v. Redington, __

disclosures under both acts to reduce compartmentalized,
duplicative
or Inadequate disclosures and to rrururruze the Cornrnrssron's regulatory
role. To this end, the short registration Form S-16, which Incorporates
by reference all current 1934 Act reports on file that already contain
basic frrrn-ortented
information, has been expanded In a number of
respects. Primary underwritten offerings are now permitted on this
Form by certain high-quality Issuers and their substdranes, as well as
rights offerings and offenngs of secuntres pursuant to dividend and
Interest reinvestment plans As we gain further experience with this
new concept, we Will be exploring ways to broaden the categones of
Issuers and transactions covered by the Form. In addition, the
Commission IS encouraging companies to use information filed with the
Commission as the pnmary means of communication with shareholders
rather than creating alternative documents such as annual reports
which may be less useful to Investors. To this end, we have published a
gurdehne which encourages companies to combine their annual report
on Form 10-K with their annual report to shareholders and we also are
explonng revismg our forms, as discussed below.
The Commission's AdVISOry Committee on Corporate Disclosure,
which reported ItS recommendations to the Commission In 1977,
favored the integration of the 1933 and 1934 Acts Into a continuous
disclosure system. The Commission presently IS Implementing many of
the AdVISOry Committee's other recommendations,
including a revrsion
of the Commission's Form 10-K to make It a more flexrble document,
and the encouragement of corporate disclosure of forward-looking
information, such as projections of earnings. Because of the increasing
importance attached to such "soft" mtorrnatron-c-as
opposed to
Commission
objectively vennabte rustoncal facts, or "hard" data-the
has encouraged companies voluntarily to disclose management
projections and has published staff gurdes for such disclosures
In
addition, we have adopted a "safe harbor" rule designed to afford
protection from liability for reasonably-based projections disclosed In
good faith that subsequently are not met
Our Interest In encouraging the disclosure of other "soft" and "firmspecrfrc" information IS continuing. We are also encouraging the use of
a "management report on operations," as a part of the annual report to
shareholders, to aid users of financial information In interpreting a
company's accounting and financial reports
Oversight of the Accounting

Profession

One of the major areas of current Commission concern IS ItS oversight
of the accounting profession. Where feasible, we Intend to emphasize
self-regulatory initiatives from within the profession.
Our first report to Congress regarding the accounting professton, In
July 1978, reflects ttus approach We did not attempt to tell the
profession how It should go about meeting the objectives of selfregulation. Rather, we set forth with particularity the major objectives
that we believed the profession should meet In order to be effectively
self-regulating
And, while the record IS far from complete concerning
VII I

the effectiveness of the profession's voluntary efforts, we told the
Congress that the profession was making adequate progress In developing
initiatives of its own to achieve self-regulatory objectives Consequently,
we recommended that these private Initiatives be allowed to continue to
evolve.
The Commission, through ItS Chief Accountant's Office, has given
close attention to the protession's self-regulatory efforts over the past
year. In July 1979, the Commission Issued ItS second annual Report to
Congress on the Accounting Profession and the Commission's Oversight
Role, assessing progress made toward the articulated objectives.
The corning years should also see major developments In several
substantive accounting and auditing areas. The Commission, aided by
an AdVISOry Committee on Oil and Gas Accounting, IS In the process of
Implementing ItS September 1978 decrsion to consider a new
accounting prrncipte-s-reserve recognition accounting-for
011 and gas
producers, a task which Will take several years to complete
In addition, the Cornrrussion IS closely tollowmg the work being done
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board In the development of a
conceptual framework for the accounting profession. The result of the
FASB's project should be a set of pnnciples which can serve as a guide
for the profession to work toward as It develops and refines accounting
and disclosure pnnciples and methodologies. It IS a safe prediction
that, dunng the coming decades, the economic, political and
technological changes in thrs country and the world-and
their Impact
on the nature and methods of American business-i-wr!l be enormous.
Accountants and frnancial managers Will need such a conceptual
framework, one that IS suffrcrently tlexible and broad to accommodate
these new developments.
Appropriate accounting for the effects of changing prices IS a
fundamental problem which demands Imaginative and progressive
solutions. In 1976, the Cornrrussron provided an Important Impetus to
this effort m ASR No. 190, which Introduced a limited requirement for
disclosure of the replacement costs for certain assets The Cornrrussron
remains fully committed to insuring that users of nnancral statements
receive adequate information about the Impact of changing prices on
corporate earnings and assets. The FASB has proposed that certain
large publicly-held enterprises provide disclosures regarding certain
effects of price changes on earnings, assets, liabilities, and owner's
equity in periods of nsing prices These disclosures would supplement,
but not replace, historical cost frnancral statements. While the
Commission Will consider amendrng or rescrndrng ItS replacement cost
rule If an acceptable final standard IS adopted by the FASB, the
Cornrrussron would not view positively a delay rn the adoption of that
standard.

Investment

Management

For the past 40 years, the Cornrrussion has regulated Virtually every
aspect of the investment company Industry. There has been little, If
IX

any, self-regulation
The Commission's presence has been formal and
pervasive.
This IS now beginning to change. The Commission IS rethinking the
fundamental assumptions on which our regulatory program In this area
has historically been based, and I expect, over time, dramatic changes
Will be visible In the way we interact With the private sector In
regulating Investment companies.
The Drvrsion of Investment Management IS currently engaged In a
thorough review of the Investment Company Act and all the rules and
administrative
practices thereunder. As a result of this re-evaluation, a
Significant regulatory shifting has already begun. First, we are moving
towards Simpler rules that are easier to understand, less costly to
comply With, and state objectives and policy rather than describe
method. Second, we are encouraging Investment company directorsespecially those who are dismterested -to assume their responstbihtres
to the companies that they serve. As this shift to private sector
responsrbrlrty occurs, we will enhance the Cornrnissron's oversight
capabilities to assure compliance With the new regulatory scheme, and
thereby ensure that there is no dirnurutron In Investor protection
The Drvision has also begun a thorough re-evaluatron of the
Investment Advisers Act and our regulatory program under It to
determine whether they are adequate In light of the Significant growth
of and change In the advisory protession in recent years. As a first step
In this re-evaluation, the Commission has recently acted to Improve the
quality of information regarding Investment advisers which IS available
to the public. To the extent our experience leads us to adopt new rules
affecting Investment advisers, I expect our approach to be Similar to
that taken In the Investment company area. Indeed, the staff has
already begun to consider the possibtlrty of self-regulation for
Investment advisers
I firmly believe that these initiatives, which Will be continued in the
years to come, will return to the private sector the responsrbihty for
managing the Investment company Industry, and Will Improve
Investment advisory regulation as well.
Options
On February 15, 1979, The Commission's Options Study released ItS
report on the efficacy of exrstrng self-regulatory and Commission
oversight of the burgeoning options markets. This Study, which
commenced In 1977 With the announcement of a moratorium on the
expansion of trading In exchange-listed options, extended to all aspects
of standardized options trading and the regulation of such trading.
Followmg the release of the report, the Commission approved a plan
which Will lead to lifting the moratorium
The plan calls for close
cooperation among the self-regulatory organizations and the
Cornrrussron In the Implementation of some 75 specrnc actions
designed to correct the defrcrenctes found by the Options Study in
current surveillance and sales practices.
The Study Identified specrtic problems, and established specrfrc

x

regulatory objectives. But, we hope to rely on the Industry Itself to take
the trutiatives which will lead to a lifting of the moratorium, rather than
ourselves prescribing specifrc corrective action. The response of the
industry to the results of the Study has In general been encouraging,
and I expect the Commission's goals to be met without undue delay.
Market Surveillance
In order to insure that self-regulation IS consistent with our mandate
to protect Investors, It IS Important that we have effective oversight of
what the self-regulatory orgaruzatrons-i-whether
In options or equities-are dorng and how well they are doing It. To this end, the Drvrsion of
Market Regulation has recently strengthened ItS ability to oversee the
performance of the self-regulatory organizations. The Drvrsion has
established a new inspection Unit to oversee the activrtres of these
entitles In carrying out their own surveillance, inspection and
enforcement functions. This unit Will advise the Commission, on a
regular basis, as to the current performance of the self-regulatory
organizations. Further, a consultant has been engaged to advise the
Commission regarding Improvements In ItS surveillance system. Our
goal is not to duplicate the surveillance capabilities of the selfregulatory organizations, but rather to insure that the aggregate
surveillance capacity IS adequate, that there are no gaps and that there
has been an appropriate allocation of surveillance functions among the
self-regulators and the Commission
Implementation

of the Foreign Corrupt Precuces Act

One of the most challenging projects facing the Cornrnrssron IS the
Implementation
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This Act, Signed
Into law December 19, 1977, requires every public Issuer of securitres
to make and keep accurate books and records and to establish and
maintain a system of Internal accounting control which provides
reasonable assurance that specrfred objectives of reliability are met.
The primary impetus for the enactment of the Act were disclosures In
the mid-1970's
of widespread corporate bribery. The Commission has
already brought several cases alleging Violations of the Act, and
recently adopted rules designed to Implement prcvisrons of the Act
These rules, codified as new Regulation 13B-2, expressly prohibit the
falsification
of corporate books, records, or accounts and prohibit the
offtcers and directors of an Issuer from making false, misleading or
Incomplete statements to any accountant In connection With any audit
or examination of the Issuer's financial statements or the preparation of
required reports. In addition, the Commission has proposed to require a
management statement on Internal accounting controls In the coming
years, the Act Will play an increasingly Significant role In our regulatory
and enforcement programs.
Management

Developments

and Resource Attocetion

FIscal year 1978 was marked by the launching of several Important
management initiatives Intended to make more effrcrent use of limited
XI

Cornrrussron resources and strengthen the Commission's ability to
deliver services to both Investors and regulated entities Major strides
were taken In the area of Information handling, including the
replacement of the agency's computer, the development of important
program tracking systems and the pilot Implementation of a
computerized micrographics system In the area of personnel
management, the Commission offered ItS first formal upward mobility
program, creating new professional and administrative opportunities for
seasoned clerical staff A unrque arrangement with the CIvil Service
Commission has provided the Commission with an unusual opportunity
to begin to develop a performance appraisal system that will aid In
manpower plannrng, career counseling and management development.
The Offtce of Data Processing and the Office of the Comptroller
commenced design of the agency's first comprehensive financial
management reporting and budgetmg system, while the Office of the
Executive Director initiated a major study of all fees collected by the
Commission. In addition, under the guidance of the Office of Consumer
Affairs, a unrform small claims processing procedure was Implemented
by all of the major self-regulatory agencies.
The Commission IS proud It has achieved the reputation of being one
of the most effective federal regulatory agencies with one of the
smallest staffs In government. However, over the past few years, the
Cornrrussron has been given broad new statutory responsibilities-particularly by the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 and the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Its workload under pre-existing statues
has also Increased dramatically, and major demands on ItS resources
have been made to meet new obligations under statutes such as the
Freedom of Information, Sunshine and Privacy Acts. In addition, the
Cornrnrssron has undertaken a number of special studies and hearings
to Improve ItS regulatory efforts
Yet at the same time as the Commission's workload IS burgeoning,
ItS resources are shrinking. Indeed, under current budgetary proposals,
the Cornrnrssron will have 44 fewer authorized positions In fiscal 1980
than It had In fiscal 1975, before much of the workload explosion took
place As a result, we must constantly reassess our resource capability
In light of current needs, and shift personnel as best we can to try
to staff adequately our Priority programs.
The Comrrussion supports the President's efforts to control inflation
and to contain the federal budget We are therefore prepared to work
within necessary budgetary constraints, and to be even more selective
In allocating scarce resources and In setting priorities than we have
been In the past However, even under current staffing levels, we are
concerned that some of our responsibilities
may not be discharged as
fully or as well as has come to be expected from the Cornrnrssron, and
any further restraints could have a Significant detrimental effect on
both our enforcement and regulatory programs.

These are Important times for the Commission We are developing
and Implementing new concepts In secunties regulation and

enforcement, and we have been pleased and gratified at the
cooperation and support which we have received from the Congress In
our efforts. I look forward to a continued excellent relationship In the
future. Should the Commission be able to assist the Congress In ItS
legislative programs, we stand ready to do so at your request

Regulation of the Securities Markets

DUring the fiscal year, the Commission worked to fulfill ItS continuing responsibility
to strengthen the nation's
securities markets and to protect Investors who trade In those markets
The Commission took significant steps
to enhance competition In the secunties
industry; to Improve the availability of
transaction and quotation information,
to Increase efficiency In the execution
and clearance of securities
transactions; and to make It practical for brokers to execute Investors' orders In the
best market available. Many of those
steps brought closer the realizatron of
a national market system and a national
system for the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement
of transactions In securrties. both of which the
Congress directed the Commission to
help establish. 1

Securities Markets and Facilities
The National Market System-The
past year was most significant
In the
development of a national market system.
In December 1977, the Cornrntsston
adopted amendments to Rule 19c-1
under the Securities Exchange Act removing certain remaining restrictions
on the ability of exchange members to
effect transactions In listed secunties
otherwise than on exchanges. This action assured that a member of an exchange would be permitted to effect

over-the-counter agency transactions In
listed securities With any person not also
represented as agent by that member
(r.e , precluding only "In-house agency
cross" transactions), thereby permitting
brokers greater tlexrbrlrty In seeking the
best market In which to effect agency
transactions 2
On January 26, 1978, the Commission Issued a statement on the development of a national market system
(January Statement)
In that Statement,
the Commission set forth ItS views as to
those steps which It believed should be
taken In 1978 to facrl itate development
of a natrona I market system as envistoned by the Congress In the Securities
Acts Amendments of 1975 (the 1975
Amendments).
The program described In the January
Statement consisted of SIX Interrelated
initiatives the development and Implementation of three new national market
system facilities,
a consolidated quotation system (CaS), a nationwrde network of order routing facilities and a
central publrc agency limited order file,
the refinement of an exrstrng natronal
market system facility, the consolidated
transaction reporting system (Consolidated System); the commencement
of
rulernakmg proceedings to consider
desrgnatton of certain categories of securities as qualified for trading In the
national market system; and the continued consrderatron of off-board trading

rules In light of the progress made toward a national market system 3
DUring the remainder of the fiscal
year the Commission and the Industry
made significant
progress
toward
achievement of some of the objectives
of a national market system and, more
particularly,
certain of the initiatives
described In the January Statement
In
addition, through comments and industry proposals submitted In response to
the January Statement, the self-regulatory organizations and the securities
Industry have Increased their collective
commitment
to enhance and perfect
market linkage and information systems
and to address unresolved policy and
technological concerns.
COincident with the Issuance of the
January Statement, the Commission announced the adoption of Rule llAcl1 under the Exchange Act, which requrred each self-regulatory
organization, as of August 1, 1978, to collect
and disseminate to securities information vendors quotations and quotation
sizes for all equity securities as to which
last sale information IS included In the
Consolidated
System. Quotations and
quotation sizes are required by the rule
to be firm at the prices and In the
amounts displayed by vendors, subject
only to exceptions for revised quotations
or quotation sizes and for unusual market conditions.
Although Rule 11 Acl-l
, unlike Rule
17a-15, does not require reporting selfregulatory organizations to file plans for
the dissemination
of quotation mtormatron, the Commission, In the release
announcing the adoption of Rule llAcl1, encouraged the exchanges and the
National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) to consider joint Implementation
of Rule llAcl-l
on a
voluntary basis. 4
In response to this statement, In April
1978, representatives of the American
Stock Exchange (Arnex), Boston Stock

2

Exchange (SSE>, Cmcmnati Stock Exchange (CSE), Midwest Stock Exchange
(MSE), NASD, New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Pacific Stock Exchange
(PSE) and Philadelphia Stock Exchange
(Phlx) met to diSCUSSthe possibility of
developing a JOint plan for the Implementation of the Rule. On July 25,
1978, the Amex and NYSE JOintly filed
With the Cornrnissron a "Plan for the
Purpose of Implementing Rule llAcl1 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934"
(CQ Plan) and, on July 28,
1978, the Commission temporarily declared that plan effective pursuant to
Section lIA(a)(3)(B)
of the Exchange
Act for a period of 180 days. 5
The CQ Plan (1) establishes JOint procedures to govern the collection, processing and dissemination
of quotation
information
by participating
market
centers; (2) provides for the selection
and evaluation of an exclusive processor
to collect quotation Information
from
partrcrpating market centers and make
that information available to quotations
vendors; and (3) establishes fees relatmg to the receipt of quotation information. Pursuant to the CQ Plan, on
August 1, 1978, the BSE, MSE, NYSE,
PSE and Phlx commenced drsserrunatmg quotations to vendors In a Single
data stream processed by the Securities
Industry Automation Corporation (SIAC)
and, at this time, all exchanges reportrng quotations" other than the CSE are
partrclpating.? The Implementation of
the CQ Plan and the resultant availability to brokers, dealers and Investors of
firm quotations from all reporting market centers ISan Important step In meetmg the statutory goals of a national
market system. 8
Significant steps also have been taken
toward Implementation
of comprehensive market linkage systems. In the January Statement, the Commission called
for prompt development of market linkage systems to permit orders In qualr-

fled securities
to be promptly
and
efficiently transmitted
from one qualified market center to another.
On March 9, 1978, the Amex, BSE,
NYSE, PSE and Phlx JOintly filed with
the Cornrrussron a "Plan for the Purpose
of Creating and Operating an InterMarket Cornrnurucatrons Linkage" (ITS
Plan). The ITS Plan provides the basis
for the Implementation
of an Intermarket Trading System linking the various
participants and providing facilities and
procedures for (l) routing of orders and
administrative
messages between and
among participants
and (2) partrcrpatron, under certain conditions, by members of all participating
markets In
opening transactions In those markets
On April 14, 1978, the Cornrrussron,
noting that the ITS Plan represented a
positive response to the January Statement, issued a temporary order pursuant to Section 11A(a)(3)(B)
of the
Exchange Act approving the Implementation of the ITS 9 and In August 1978,
the Commission extended that approval
for an additional year 10 As of the end
of the fiscal year, all reporting self-regulatory organizations other than the CSE
and NASD were partrcipating In the ITS
and over 100 securitres were being
traded in the system.
The other linkage system, the Cincinnati Stock Exchange multiple-dealer facility
(CSE system),
represents
an
expert rnent in the use of a fu lIy automated electronic trading system. The
Cornrnissron, on April 18, 1979, approved the CSE Pilot on a nine month
experimental basis." The CSE System,
through an electronic communications
network maintained by the CSE, enables
CSE members, without the necessity of
maintaining a presence on the floor of
the CSE or any other exchange, to participate In a market conducted In accordance
with certain auction-type
trading principles by entenng bids and
offers for securities for their own ac-

count and as agents for their customers'
accounts. In addition, CSE rules permit
a specialist on any national secuntres
exchange, without becoming a member
of the CSE, to enter bids and offers In
the system as principal or as agent In
any security In which that specialist IS
registered on another exchange. Orders
entered into the CSE System are stored
In the CSE's computer
facilities and
queued for execution as follows: pnonty
IS governed first by pnce (J.e., the highest bid and lowest offer) and second, as
between orders at the same prrce, by
time of entry. However, public agency
orders as defined In the CSE's rules, regardless of time of entry, are granted
pnonty over other orders at the same

price.
The Cornrmssion believes that these
systems evidence considerable progress
in the application
of automation and
computer and communications
technology to overcome some of the problems
associated
with
market
fragmentation. In the Commission's view,
the ITS and the CSE System both offer
valuable opportunities
to the Commission and the brokerage community to
assess the ability of differing types of
market I In kage systems to integrate
trading In physically separate locations
and to observe the effects of these linkage systems on the operation of the
markets
In response to its universal message
switch initiative, announced In the January Statement,
the Cornrnissron received two different types of proposals.
The NYSE submitted a letter generally
expressing support for enhancing order
switching mechanisms but noting that
a variety of such facihties, including ItS
own common message SWitch, were currently available. The NYSE further noted
that those SWitches commercially available from brokerage services firms currently permit brokers to route orders
directly to the market of their choice.

3

Notwithstanding
Its belief that a universal message switch IS now functionally available, the NYSE expressed ItS
willingness,
later concurred In by the
Amex, to provide other exchanges access to its swrtch.
In contrast to this proposal, the NASD
described a national order routing system (NORS) as a part of the overall national market system configuration.
NORS would be designed to link all exchanges and third market makers With
any broker or dealer establish mg access
to the system and would permit the routmg of designated orders to a specific
market center or undesignated orders
on the baSIS of the best machine drsplayed quotation
Because of the difference In scope of
these proposals, the Commission,
In
June, requested further comment from
the various self-regulatory organizations
and other potential users of the routing
system on the baSIC policy question of
whether order-by-order routing of retail
orders to the best market In size should
be a characteristic of the national market system." At the end of the fiscal
year the Commission was evaluating the
responses to ItS June 1978 request.
An addrtronal area of significant progress dunng fiscal year 1978 was the
proposal, In October 1978, of two rules
dealing extensively With the operation
of the Consolidated
System and the
manner In which vendors of market information display transaction and quotation information to their subscribers. 13
The Commission hopes to take further
regulatory action With respect to these
proposals In the near future.
Although there has been considerably
less tangible progress toward achievement of the other three initiatives deSCribed In the January Statement (I.e,
rmplernentation of a central agency limit
order file, consideration
of off-board
trading rules, and initiation of rulemak-

4

mg With respect to qualified secuntres),
the dialogue between the Commission
and the securities Industry with respect
to these matters has refined both the
Commission's views on these subjects
and those of the Industry. At the end of
the fiscal year, the Commission was
continuing to evaluate the comments
which had been received With respect
to these initiatives.

National system for clearance and
settlement of secunttes trensections-:
During the fiscal year, substantial progress was made In the Commission's effort to foster development of a national
clearance and settlement system.
The United States Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circurt affirmed the Commission's order of January 13, 1977 which granted
the
application of National Securities Clearrng Corporation (NSCC) for registration
as a clearing agency 14 The Commission
views the registration of NSCC as a key
step In achieving the national clearance
and settlement
system envrsioned by
the Congress. Although the court did not
disturb NSCC's registration,
It did remand to the Commission for further consideration the matters of competitive
bidding for NSCC's facilrtres management contract and geograph IC price mutualization.
The Commission took several Important steps toward achieving a competitive national clearance and settlement
system. The Commission has reviewed
the transaction completion rules of the
securities exchanges and of the National Assocratron of Securities Dealers,
Inc. (NASD). Some of those rules unnecessarily restricted competition among
clearing agencies Others failed to comply With the Exchange Act for other reasons. 15 As a result of this review, over
100 exchange and NASD rules were
amended or deleted. This step removed
many Impediments to development of

a national clearance and settlement system.
The Commission also held hearings
in March and April 1978 on this subject. The Commission
received data,
views and arguments concerning the
extent to which NSCC had satisfied the
conditions imposed upon It by the Commission In ItS order granting NSCC regrstration as a clearing agency." In
addition, the Commission received other
information which has proven useful In
formulating further steps toward ach levmg a national clearance and settlement
system.
Progress toward a national system
also was evident In other areas. The expansion of Interfaces among clearing
agencies has permitted
most brokers
and dealers to clear through a Single
clearing agency (one account processing) all transactions
regardless of the
market of execution. Expanded interfaces among depositones have further
Immobilized securities certificates and
allowed most partrcrpants to move securities throughout the country, to effect pledges and to make deliveries by
book entry. These developments have
reduced costs and accelerated the settlement process.
During the year, the Commission took
two Important steps In rrnrnobrlrzmg certificates. First, Rule 17f-4 under the
Investment Company Act was adopted.
The rule establishes the conditions under which registered Investment companies, or custodians
for registered
Investment companies, may deposit investment company secuntres In a secunties depository 17
The Commission also worked toward
increasing Insurance company particrpation in secuntres depositones. Insurance companies are large holders of
secuntres but, principally
because of
certain requirements of state laws, have
been inhibited from widespread partrcipatron In securities deposrtones
The

National ASSOCiation of Insurance Commissioners recently formed a task force
on the use of book entry and depository
systems by Insurance companies Members of the Cornrrussron staff met With
the task force and were appointed by the
task force to serve on an advisory committee which Will seek solutions to both
the legal and practical problems restricting Insurance company particrpation.

Charges for Market Information-In
May 1978, the Cornrnrssron began a review of a dispute between the Options
Price Reporting Authority (OPRA) and
two commercial vendors of transaction
and quotation information. The dispute
concerns fees charged by OPRA to vendors for access to options last sale Information. 18
OPRA IS the exclusive processor of
market information for the options exchanges, and the dispute arose when
OPRA decided to charge an "access
fee" to those persons having direct access to the high speed communications
line for last sale reports of options transactions The Cornrnissron held a hearing
to provide Interested persons an opportunity to present both oral and written
views on the Issues raised, including the
question of whether the Exchange Act
authonzes an exclusrve processor, such
as OPRA, to charge a fee to vendors as
a condition of access to market information, such as options last sale reports.

Tradmg by exchange members-Section l1(a)( 1) of the Exchange Act, as
amended In 1975, prohibits, With specified exceptions, any member of a national secuntres exchange from effecting
any transaction on that exchange for ItS
own account, the account of an assocrated person, or an account With respect to which it or any of Its associated
persons exercises Investment discretion. Under Section l Ita), the Commission has broad authonty to fashion either

5

more flexible or more restnctive standards. Section 11 (a) became effective,
as applied to most exchanges members,
on February 1, 1978.
Durrng the fiscal year, the Commission made significant progress In completing ItS regulatory program under
Section 11(a)(l).
Based on proposals
publrshed In the preceding two years
and on an exhaustive public drscussion
relating to those proposals and the Secnon generally, the Cornrrussron announced In March and Aprrl 1978 several
Important actions. First, the Commission adopted a rule under which member transactions for accounts covered by
the general
prohibition
of Section
11 (a)( 1) may be effected as long as
those transactions are referred to independent members for execution and
meet certain conditions. The exemption
was designed to put members and nonmembers In the money management
business on the same footing, to the
extent practicable, In light of the purposes of this provisron.
Second, the Cornrrussron adopted
separate exemptions for (l) member
transactions effected for affiliates which
a member Itself would be permitted to
effect under Section 11(a)(l) and rules
thereunder
and (2) members'
bond
transactions
These exemptions were
designed to remove unintended burdens
Imposed by Section 11(a)(l) In the exchange markets and, at the same time,
to avoid permitting members and their
affiliates any special trading advantages
over public customers and other nonmembers. Finally, the Commission resolved several major interpretive Issues
under Section 11(a)(l) and rules thereunder, including the meaning of the
phrase "Investment discretion"
The Commission also approved programs designed by the NYSE and Amex
to supplement the market making capacity of specrahsts by creating new
classes of market makers who would be

6

exempt from the prohibitions of the Section These programs were established
for a temporary perrod In order to permit
the Cornrrussron to review them to determine whether the predicted market
benefits are being realized.
Options Trading-In July 1977, the
Commission requested those national
secunties exchanges on which options
are traded to refrain from expanding
their options trading programs. 19 The
Cornrmssron's request, which was honored, was based upon concerns that
the rapid growth In options trading since
1973 had been accompanied by trading
abuses.
In October 1977, the Commission
announced commencement
of a comprehensive mvestrgatron and study of
the nation's standardized options markets " and a proposed rule to halt temporarrly any expansion of trading In
standardized options pending completion of the study and resolution of the
Comrmssron's concerns as to the adequacy of existrng regulation. 21
On June 22, 1978, the Cornrrussron
requested the NASD and each national
securttres exchange wh rch traded, or
had proposed to trade, standardized options to continue to honor the Cornrrnssion's request for a voluntary moratorrum
on further expansion until the Cornrrussion had evaluated the findings of the
Options Study. 22 The Commission made
that request because It hoped to resolve
ItS concerns with respect to the standardized options markets In a cooperative
effort with the self-regulatory organizations, rather than tormalrzmg the rnoratorrum by rulernakmg. 23
On August 3, 1978, the Cornrrussron
announced that the NASD, the NYSE
and the five options exchanges had
agreed to ItS request 24 Accordingly, the
Cornrrussion postponed final action on
ItS proposal to halt any trading expansion by rule. The Cornrrussron also said
It would consider whether to continue

or terminate the moratorium on expansion of options trading promptly after
reviewing the report of the Options
Study. (Subsequent to the close of the
fiscal year the Commission received the
Report of the Options Study and, In February 1979, Issued a release setting
forth the circumstances
under which
expansion of options trading could take
place.)
Effects of the Absence of Fixed Commission Rate~ln
1975, the Commission prohibited the national securitres
exchanges from prescribing fixed minimum commission
rates and from requiring their members to charge no less
than those rates. The Commission has
submitted to the Congress five reports
covering the first twenty months of commission price competition through December 31, 1976, describing what effect
the absence of any schedule of fixed
rates of cornrrussion IS having on the
maintenance of fair and orderly markets
and on the development of a national
market system for securities.
Analysis of cornrrussion rates IS now
Integrated Into the Commission's
ongoing monitoring of the financial condition of the industry. In that connection,
the Commission released to the public
on May 22, 1978, a "Staff Report on
the Securities Industry In 1977," which
detailed among other findings, the results of ItS cornrrussron rate survey.
From May 1, 1975, to the end of September 1978, individual investors' effective cornrrnssron rates when measured
as a percent of principal value declined
13.9 percent. Instrtutronal customers,
due to their larger average order size and
greater bargaining power, have negotiated discounts averaging 48.8 percent
from the exchange prescnbed minimum
rates. When the rates are measured as
cents per share, the declines were 6
percent for individuals and 48.5 percent for mstitutions. lndrvrduals paid an
average of 28.2 cents per share on their

September 1978 orders, which averaged 394 shares In size. Institutional
orders averaged 1,859 shares In size
and cornrrnssions averaged 13.4 cents
per share for these customers.
Broker-dealers were affected by the
elimination of fixed minimum commission rates largely depending upon the
extent they serve institutional Investors.
Some firms which did a large portion of
their total business wrth institutions
merged with more diversified frrrns. A
group of new discount broker-dealers
have entered the Industry to offer investors a reduced level of services at reduced cornrrussron rates. Broker-dealers'
gross revenue for the first nine months
of 1978 was one-third higher than the
comparable 1977 period, due to recordsetting VOlume In the second and third
quarters of 1978. This Jump In revenue
more than doubled pre-tax profits
The Commission's economic staff has
continued to rnorutor the Impact of negotiated cornrrussron rates. Competitively determined cornrrussion rates do
not appear to have adversely affected
the development of a national market
system or the maintenance of fair and
orderly markets

RegUlation of Brokers, Dealers,
Municipal Securities Dealers and
Transfer Agents
Regulatory burdens on small brokers
and deeters-stne Commission IS aware
of the need to evaluate the costs and
cornpetrtive Impact of ItS regulations on
brokers and dealers
Accordingly,
In
adopting regulatory requrrernents, the
Commission
weighs the benefits
to
Investor protection and other statutory
goals against possible compliance and
competitive
burdens. In addition, the
Commission has endeavored to tailor
regulatory requirements
to particular
busmess practices or ways of doing
business so as to avoid Imposing regulatory burdens. This effort can partrcu-

7

larly benefit smaller, more specialized
brokerage firms.
In 1975, the Commission's
financial and operational reporting system
and ItS financial
responsibility
rules
were substantially
restructured to reflect this approach
Based on three
years' experience with their operation,
the Commission has undertaken a comprehensive review of these rules with a
view toward eliminating
any unnecessary requirement
Although this review
IS generally directed toward Improving
the efficiency and effectiveness of the
regulatory system as a whole, the possible benefits to brokers and dealers
domg a limited secunties business are
receiving particular attention
Through such efforts, the Commission has attempted to rrururntze the effects of ItS rules on smaller brokerdealers and to help assure their continued participation In the securities markets without sacrificing the Commission's
primary statutory objective of protecting
Investors
Lost and stolen secunties-: The Comrrussron's program for the reporting of
missing, counterfeit or stolen securities
became fully operational dunng fiscal
1978 The Commission arranged with
the Unted States Attorney General to
enter flies of the National Crime Information Center on securitres thefts Into
the data base maintained by the Securities Information Center, Inc. (SIC), the
organization designated by the Commission to receive reports and respond
to mqurnes regarding corporate and
municipal secuntres. The Federal Reserve Banks perform the same functions
with respect to government securities.
The Commission
made arrangements
with the National Crime Information
Center for the exchange of information
on lost or stolen securities
As of Septernber 1, 1978, approximately
190,000 reports of rnrssrng, lost, stolen or
counterfeit secuntres, with an aggregate

8

market value of nearly $1 billion, had
been received by the SIC
Secunttes conttrmsttons-: The Comrmssion adopted, effective December
18, 1978, a new rule prescribing delivery and disclosure requrrernents for confnrnatrons of securrtres transactions sent
by brokers and dealers to customers 25
The confirmation
IS an Important disclosure document
that provides an
Investor with information
pertinent to
each securities transaction. The Comrnrssron's adoption of new confirmation
disclosure and delivery requirements
represents an effort to review old regulatory requirements
so as to enhance
Investor protection
while eliminating
regulatory burdens for which the compliance costs appear to exceed the public benefit The Commission IScontinuing
to evaluate whether additional disclosure on customer
confrrrnatrons
for
transactions In particularly debt securities would be appropriate
Broker-dealer practices-On September 28, 1978 the Commission
published a release26 givmg notice to brokerdealers that certain practices regarding
customer accounts are inconsistent with
Just and equitable principles of trade
and may In some Instances violate the
antifraud provisions of the Federal secunties laws These practices are as follows
(a) Issuance to customers of checks
drawn on distant banks, a practice referred to as "remote checking",
(b) retention of Interest and divrdend
payments rather than disbursing such
payments to customers promptly upon
receipt, without afford Ing customers adequate prior notice and a reasonable
opportunity to elect either Immediate or
deferred payment;
(c) Imposition of Increased commission rates without adequate prior notice;
(d) rrnposrtron of custodial fees on
"inactive"
customer accounts without
adequate prior notice; and

(e) failure to promptly transfer customer accounts.
Uniform dispute resolution procedures for Jnvestors-A program to Implement
uniform,
fair and efficient
dispute resolution procedures for investors was undertaken by the Commission
In May 1976, In connection with ItS establishment
of an Office of Consumer
Affairs. The purpose of this program IS
to Improve the ability of Investors to resolve disputes with broker-dealers In a
satisfactory
manner, and at less cost
then litigation. In April 1977, the Comrrussion agreed to consider proposals
from the Securities Industry Conference
on Arbitration (SICA), a voluntary group
of secuntres Industry and public representatives
which would contemplate
utilization of exrstrng arbitration facilities of the self-regulatory
orgarnzatlons.27
On November 15, 1977 SICA submitted to the Comrnrssron a proposal for
a Uniform small claims procedure for
Investor-broker
disputes
SICA proposed that the securities Industry selfregulatory organizations adopt a unrform
set of rules for the simplified arbitration
of customer claims against broker-dealers mvolvmg less than $2500. Any such
dispute could be resolved by a Single
arbitrator on the basis of pleadings and
documentary evidence Without a hearmg, although a hearing could be requested by the customer claimant or an
arbitrator. On May 4, 1978 the Commission approved, pursuant to Section
19(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule
19~
thereunder, the adoption of a set
of rules similar to the SICA proposal, by
the NYSE and the Amex. 28 The uniform
small claims rules were approved subsequently for adoption by other orgaru-

zanons."
The Cornrrusston

expects to receive
further proposals from SICA regarding
uniform investor dispute resolution procedures, including a unrform arbitration

code for adoption by self-regulatory organizations.
The Cornrrussion
will review the operation of these arbitration facilities as
part of ItS general oversight responsibilities With respect to self-regulatory
organizations.
MUnicipal secunties dealers-On July
17, 1978, the Cornrrussron published
for comment proposed amendments to
Form MSD, which IS used for rnurucrpal
secuntres dealers, registration by banks
and separately Identifiable departments
or divrsrons of banks 30 The proposed
amendments were designed to simplify
or to clarify, In several respects, the
scope of information
solrcited by the
Form
Transfer agent rules- The Commission's first substantive rules governing
the performance of transfer agents became effective durrng the fiscal year. 31
These rules (l) prescn be for registered
transfer agents performance time standards for the transfer of secuntres from
one record owner to another for the completion of the registrar function and for
responding to mqumes concerning the
status of Items previously presented for
transfer; (2) provide for early warning to
the regulatory agencies of Inadequate
transfer agent performance;
(3) apply
limitations on the expansion of transfer
agent actrvitres when transfer agents are
repeatedly
unable to meet the time
standards for performance of the transfer or registrar functions; (4) require the
making and keeping of certain records,
and (5) provide exemptions from the
performance time standards and recordkeeping sections for certain registered
transfer agents

Oversight of Self-Regulatory
Organizations
Secunties exchanges-As of September 30, 1978, ten exchanges were regrstered With the Cornrrussion as national
secuntres exchanges: American Stock
9

Exchange, Inc. (Arnex), Boston Stock
Exchange, Incorporated (BSE); Chicago
Board Options Exchange, Incorporated
(CBOE); Cincinnati
Stock Exchange
(CSE); Intermountain
Stock Exchange
(ISE); Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc.
(MSE); New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
(NYSE); Pacific Stock Exchange Incorporated (PSE); Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (Phlx): Spokane Stock
Exchange (SSE). The Commission ISsued on November 8, 1978 an order
terminating the exemption from registration as a national secunties exchange
of the Honolulu Stock Exchange, which
had ceased operation earlier In the fiscal
year.
In connection With the Commission's
oversight of the delistmg of secuntres
traded on exchanges, the Commission
during the fiscal year granted applications by exchanges to strike 116 equity
issues and 25 debt Issues from listing
and registration. The Commission also
granted applications,
submitted by ISsuers, requesting Withdrawal from listmg and registration for 35 equity Issues
and 5 debt Issues.
In November 1977, the Cornrrussron
initiated a review of ItS past practices
In granting
applications
for unlisted
trading privileges. Since the Initiation
of that review, the Cornrrussron has not
granted any applications
for unlisted
trading privileges. The Cornrrussron's
review of ItS policies IS designed to develop standards which the Commission
will apply In considenng whether the
extension of unlisted trading privileges
IS consistent With the maintenance of
fair and orderly markets.
DUring the fiscal year, the national
securities exchanges reported to the
Commission approximately
250 diSCIplmary actions, Imposing a variety of
sanctions upon member firms and their
employees
National ASSOCIatIon of Securities
Dealers, Inc.-The National ASSOCiation
10

of Secuntres, Inc. (the "NASD") IS the
only secunties association
registered
with the Cornrrusston At the close of the
fiscal year, 2,798 brokers and dealers
were NASD members.
DUring the past fiscal year, the NASD
reported to the Commission final drspositron of 230 disciplinary complaints
In which
105 member firms and 230
indivrduals were named as respondents.
At the beginning of fiscal 1978, 15
proceedings for review of NASD diSCIplmary decrsions were pending before
the Commission, and during the year 16
additional cases were brought up for review. The Commission revrewed 17 of
these cases, and reduced the sanctions
to be Imposed In some of those cases.
The Cornrrussron also reviewed 35
NASD applications to admit a broker or
dealer to membership or to permit a person to become associated with a member where the broker or dealer or person
ISsubject to a statutory disqualification.
The Comrrussron denied the registration
of one indrvrdual and instituted
proceedings to deny the registration of two
others. It has taken no adverse action
With respect to the other 32 notices.
The Cornrrussion began during the
year to review an NASD proposed rule
to prohibit its members from giving drscounts to customers In distributions
of
sscuntres offered at a fixed price. The
proposal was written In response to a
1976 judicial
decrsion (Paprlsky v.
Berndt32)
which held that such drscounts were lawful In some circumstances, absent a contrary Commission or
NASD ruling. The matter Involves complex Issues which. depending upon their
resolution, could have far reaching impact on underwriting practices.
DUring the fiscal year the Commission
worked With self-regulatory
organizations to Simplify and eliminate duplication In the self-regulatory system for
brokers and dealers. In September 1978,
the Cornrrusston temporarily approved

four plans proposed by self-regulatory
organizations
for allocating
their responsibilities
to perform various regulatory functions for brokers and dealers
which belong to more than one self-regulatory organization.
The plans represent agreements reached between the
NASD and four exchanges: the Boston
Stock Exchange, Inc., the Clncmnat:
Stock Exchange, Inc., the Midwest Stock
Exchange, Inc., and the Pacrfrc Stock
Exchange, Inc.
The plans reflect progress toward reducing unnecessary regulatory duplication by assigning to the NASD much
of the responsibility for conducting onsite examination of dual members and
for processing various applications.
At
the close of the fiscal year, the Comrrussion was constdering plans proposed
with respect to other self-regulatory organizations.

the case of national secunties exchanges and the NASD, the
Commission
reviews proposed

changes of the Murucipal
Securities
Rulemakmg Board (the MSRB) During
the fiscal year, the MSRB filed seventeen rule proposals. The Commission
considered several of those proposals
and others which were pending from the
previous fiscal year.
The Commission approved a series of
rule proposals designed to establish
baSIC standards of fair and ethical conduct for rnumcrpal securities
profesThe
rules
establish

In particular
areas such
as: (1) SUitability of recommendations

(2) professional advertising; (3) administration
of discretrenary
and other
accounts;
(4)
supervrsion of employees; (5) determination of prices and cornrmssrons: (6)
disclosures in connection with new ISsue municipal

of such secunties.
The
rules provided the first regulation of thrs

securrtres
professionals,
since the rules of fair
practice of the NASD do not apply to
transactions In municipal secuntres and
exemptions are available for many persons subject to comparable rules applicable to brokers and dealers who are not
members of the NASD
The Cornrrussron also approved a rule
establishing
terms and conditions for
the sale of new Issue murucipal securities dunng the underwriting penod. 34
The rule requires rnurucipal secuntres
underwntrng
syndicates
to establish
procedures
for allocating
securrtres
among competing orders; to disclose
those procedures to syndicate members
and, upon request, to others; and to reveal information
concerning
certain
customers to syndicate members.
In addrnon,
the Cornrnissron
approved two new examinations for rnunrcrpal securities professionals. 35 The
first examination IS required In order for
a person associated With a murucipal
secuntres broker or rnurucrpal secuntres
dealer to become qualified as a tmancrat
and operations principal.
The second
examination IS required In order for a
person to become qualified as a rnurucrpal securities representative.
Clearing AgenCies-The Commission
has granted temporary registration to 12
clearing agencies pending the development of permanent standards for registratron.
On June 1, 1977, the Comrrussron
proposed for publrc comment standards
which clearing agencies would have to
meet In order to be granted permanent
registration 36 The Commission received
numerous comment letters on the proposed standards and on March 6, 1978,
proposed revised standards for publrc
comment. 37 The Commission again received many comment letters on the reVised proposed
standards
and IS
considering them.

inspections of self-regulatory orgent11

zatlOns---During
the fiscal year, the
Commission's staff conducted inspections of NASD district offices located In
Los Angeles, New York and San FranCISCO.These Inspections Involved a review and evaluation of the organization
and staffing of those offices, the procedures and quality of their broker-dealer
exarrunatron. disciplinary and customer
complaint processes, the adequacy of
their survlliance for compliance With
Comrrussron and NASD rules, and the
composition
and effectiveness of the
District Committees. In the Los Angeles
and New York district offices, the Comrrussron's staff noted areas In which the
NASD's compliance programs could be
enhanced The staff was generally satisfted With the NASD's compliance program at ItS San Francrsco district office
In ItS inspection of the Los Angeles
district office, the staff noted shortcommgs In that office's ability (1) to conduct
adequate ftnancral, operational and sales
practices exarrunatrons.
(2) to meet
planned examination cycles; (3) to respond fully and promptly to customer
mqumes and complaints, (4) to process
appropriately
requests for extensions
of time for delivery of payment for secuntres pursuant to Regulation T of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; and (5) to follow up on
examinations In order to institute drsciphnary actions In a timely fashion It
appeared that these deticrencres were
attributable,
In large part, to a lack of
adequate and experienced staff durmg
1976 and 1977. These matters were
reviewed With otfrcials from the NASD's
headquarters office and its Los Angeles
district office upon completion of the
mspectron,
and were also discussed
With these offrcrals In follow-up meetings later In the fiscal year. The DIStrict's manpower quota was Increased
from 16 to 20, to authonze an additional full time attorney, a supervisor
and two examiners, and the NASD pro-

12

vrded assurances that the district's

operations were current.
The inspection of the New York district office revealed several dencienc res , Including
(1) the relative
inexperience of, and a high rate of turnover among, the examiner staff; (2) a
lack of adequate supervisron of the examination process; (3) the narrow scope
of the examinations conducted by the
NASD's staff, particularly With respect
to sales practices; (4) the failure of the
examiners to follow specmed examination procedures; (5) the failure of the
staff to take adequate follow-up steps
to assure that noted defrcrencres were
corrected; and (6) problems regarding
the processing of requests for extensions of time for payment of securities
pursuant to Regulation T Revised procedures have been Implemented or are
under consideration as a result of this
Inspection.
On November 15, 1977, the Comrrussron's staff Inspected the Amex to
determine the adequacy of ItS surveillance programs for monitoring compliance With Amex rules regarding position
limits. In addition, the staff reviewed
the Amex's procedures for rnorutonng
the use of market maker accounts With
clearing firms by specralrsts and Regrstered Option Traders to determine
whether the Amex's procedures would
detect Violations of Regulation T.
The staff found deficrencies
In the
regulatory and surveillance
programs
designed to monitor or provide for regulation of options POSitions. The staff
also raised a number of as yet unresolved questions based on conflicting
Interpretations
by the FRS and the
Amex regarding the availability of "exempt credit"
for Registered Options
Traders.
The Comrrussron's staff inspected the
Amex and NYSE on November 7, 1977,
and on January 25 and 26, 1978, respectively
The purpose of these In-

spections was to review and evaluate the
enforcement by the Amex and NYSE of
their delrstmg policies to determine
whether those exchanges are fulfilling
their regulatory responsibilities.
The staff concluded that the NYSE's
regulatory responsibilities,
In relation to
Its dehstrng policies and procedures,
were being earned out satrsfactonly.
With respect to the Amex, the staff
found that It had no program of centralized management and control for
dehsting securities. The Amex subsequently has taken steps to correct the
deficiencies found
On Apnl 20-21,
1978, the Commission's staff conducted an inspection of
the NYSE's processing of Regulation T
extension requests. The inspection disclosed that the NYSE procedures for review of Regulation T extension requests
do not assure compliance With that Regulation's requirement that extensions be
granted only in exceptional circumstances. In addition,
inadequacies
were
found in member firm's supervisory procedures, and NYSE surveillance thereof,
for compliance With Regulation T requirements. By letter dated September
19, 1978, the Drvrsion of Market Regulation Informed the NYSE of ItS findrngs and suggested possible alternative
solutions to the problem The Commission's staff IS drscussing With the NYSE
the Implementation
of new procedures
for the processing of extension requests
and IS also reviewmg whether the procedures of other exchanges and the
NASD are adequate to assure compliance With the requirements of Regulation T.
On October 3-5, 1977, the Commission's staff conducted an rnspectron of
the CBOE which focused pnmarily upon
the CBOE's examination program and
its procedures for enforcing member
compliance
With its rules concerning
option selling practices. The Commission's Inspection team noted a number

of areas In which It felt that the CBOE's
surveillance systems, like those of other
options exchanges, should be strengthened. The staffs of the Commission and
the Options Exchanges were working on
solutions to a number of problems as
the fiscal year ended
On May 18-19,
1978, the Commission's staff reviewed the CBOE's closmg
rotations procedures. The Commission's
staff was concerned about the need for
uniform procedures among the options
exchanges and the unfairness to publrc
customers of dally closing rotation procedures because of limitations that are
imposed on publrc customers but not on
protessronals on exchange floors. Based
In part on the results of this rnspectron,
the Commission approved a four month
experirnent by the options exchanges to
extend trading unt,14.10 New York time
and to suspend dally closmg rotations
On July 27 and 28, 1978, the Commission's staff Inspected the Phlx With
respect to (1) operation and surveillance
of the trading floor for stocks, (2) regulation of specralrsts and alternate dealers, (3) functioning
of the BUSiness
Conduct, Floor Procedures, and Stock
Life Committees; and (4) processing of
Regulation T extension requests submitted by member firms At the end of
the fiscal year, the Commission's staff
was continuing to analyze data gathered
In the course of this inspection
After
completion of this work, a report drscussing the staff's findings Will be transmitted to the Phlx.
On September 27 and 28, 1978,
members of the Commission staff conducted an inspection of the NYSE Arbitration Department.
The purpose of
the inspection was to determine whether
the NYSE's procedures result In the fair
and etncient resolution of disputes between broker-dealers
and their customers. As of the end of the fiscal year,
the Cornrnissron staff was In the process
of reviewing the data gathered dunng

13

the course of the inspection and, after
evaluation, will make any necessary recommendations to the NYSE and to the
Commission. The inspection Included
Interviews with the staff of the Arbitration Department, review of the system
of documentation for matters submitted
for arbitration, and reivew of a sample
of case files. The subjects of inquiry included the time necessary to conclude
arbitration proceedings, the manner In
which arbitrators are selected, the number of locations In which hearings may
be held, the types of cases and issues
involved, the appropnateness of awards,
the extent of particrpatron by the NYSE
staff In the resolution of disputes, and
the referral of matters which may be of
concern to the appropriate disciplinary
authorities of the NYSE and/or other organizations.

Revenues and expenses of self-regulatory organizations- The regulatory

14

functions of the various exchanges and
the NASD With regard to their brokerdealer members are financed through
various fees and dues, such as listing
fees and transaction charges. The nature of some of these revenue sources
makes the financial condition of selfregulatory organizations dependent upon
price fluctuations and trading volume.
Furthermore, the various self-regulatory organizations are quite different in
the extent of their dependence on particular sources of revenue. Some sources
of revenue, such as transaction, clearing and depository fees, change directly
with changes in share volume. Others
are relatively fixed, such as listing fees
and membership dues. Additional analysis and statistical detail on share volume and revenues and expenses of each
self-regulatory organization IS presented
in the Appendix of this report.

The Disclosure System

Corporate Governance; Management
Background and Remuneration
During the fiscal year, the Cornrrussion took sigruftcant steps toward providing new disclosures to investors
regarding the structure and function of
corporate boards of directors, and toward Implementing required disclosures
of new material inforrnatron regarding
the background and remuneration of
directors.
As a result of many recent events, including numerous corporate disclosures
revealing questionable and Illegal payments, the Commission became concerned about the adequacy of corporate
accountability and conducted a broad
re-examination of ItS rules relating to
shareholder communications, shareholder participation in the corporate
electoral process and corporate governance generally. 38 The Cornrrussionheld
public hearings which commenced in
Washington on September 29, 1977,
and continued for five and a half weeks,
with sessions In Los Angeles, New York
and Chicago. On July 18, 1978, the
Commission proposed rule, form, and
schedule amendments designed to increase the information available to
Investors regard109 (l) the structure,
cornposrtron, and functioning of Issuers'
boards of directors; (2) resignations of
directors; (3) attendance at board and
committee meetings; (4) voting policies
and procedures of certain institutions

subject to the proxy rules that exercise
voting rights With respect to equity securitres held for their own accounts or
for the accounts of others; and (5) the
terms of settlement of proxy contests.
The Commission also requested com.
ments on a rule proposal that would enable shareholder-proponents to review
management statements opposing
shareholder proposals pnor to the mailing of Issuers' proxy matenals.39
Final rules adopting many of the proposals were Issued after the close of the
fiscal year. Generally, those amendments require disclosures In the areas
descnbed above Including disclosure of
certain economic and other relationships of directors and nominees. However, the proposals on institutional
Investors' voting polrcres were Withdrawn.
The staff is also engaged In the preparation of a comprehensive report which
would address some of the more complex questions raised dunng the course
of the corporate governance proceedrngs, The report is expected to address
such issues as exrstmg checks on corporate conduct, available shareholder
remedies, the functions of the board of
directors and ItS various committees,
and the respective roles of the pnvate
sector, shareholders, the Commission,
the self-regulatory organizations, and
Congress In corporate accountability.
After review and perhaps publication of .

15

the staff report, the Commission will
consider what further action, if any, IS
appropriate and will determine whether
to publish additional rulernakmg proposals or to recommend or support new
legislation affecting corporate accountability.
The Commission also published proposed amendments to various forms,
reports, and schedules
Intended to
standardize and Improve ItS disclosure
requirements
relating to management
renurneratron 40 In view of the development of complex and varied management remuneration
packages and the
necessity for accurate and complete remuneratron
disclosure,
the amendments were Intended to provide clearer
and more concise reporting of all types
and formats of remuneration, including
security-based and other non-cash arrangements.
In addrtron, these proposed amendments were Intended to
provide a clearer method for reporting
of personal benefits or "perqursites"
provided to management, In recognition
of the considerable concern engendered
In the corporate and legal cornrnurutres
by the Commission's
Interpretive
releases regarding how such benefits
should be disclosed. (After the close of
the fiscal year, the Commission adopted
amendments to the remuneration disclosure requrrernents.)
In connection with ItS efforts to consolidate, for easier reference, substantially all disclosure requirements
Into
one uniform schedule, the Commission
also adopted standardized Items, which
set forth In one regulation the current
disclosure requirements concerning directors and executive officers, management remuneration,
legal proceedings
and security ownership of certain benefrcral owners and management 41 The
Commission's action at the time also
Involved amendments to the disclosure
requirements regarding the Identity and
background of corporate offtcials and

16

events which are material to Investors'
evaluation of the ability and integrity of
management. 42 These amendments, for
example, will require disclosure With respect to the previous five year period of
any injunctions or consent decrees relating to business practices or Violations
of Federal or State secunties laws and
certain CIVil actions involvmg Violations
of such laws to which directors and officers are subject, as well as disclosure
of other directorships
held by each director or nominee.

Small Business Hearings
On December 14, 1977, the Commission announced that It would hold
pubhc hearings concerning the effects
of ItS rules and regulations on the ability
of small businesses to raise capital and
the Impact on small businesses of the
disclosure requirements under the Secunties Acts.43 The Commission,
on
March 6, 1978, published a release listmg the Issues to be considered at the
hearings. 44 The general areas of inquiry
for which the Commission requested
oral presentations and written subrnrsstorrs Included the following.
(a) The Definition of a Small Business
Issuer;
(b) POSSible Revision of Disclosure
Obligations
Imposed on Small Bustnesses:
(c) Role of Underwriters, Accountants
and Attorneys In a Small Business Secuntres Offering;
(d) Intrastate Offerings and Rule 147;
(e) Regulation A;
(f) Rule 240; and
(g) Private Placements and Rule 146.
In a companion release dated March
6, 1978, the Commission
proposed
Form S-18 and related actions concerning Simplified registration and reporting requirements for small Issuers 45
The Form was proposed to be available
for offerings of up to $3 million by domestic or Canadian corporate Issuers

which are not subject to the Commission's continuous
reporting
requirements
The Form calls for narrative
disclosure somewhat less extensive that
that presently required by Form $-1 and
audited financial statements substantially srrnilar to those required by Regulation A. In addition,
the proposal
relaxed certain financial statement requirements by allowing such Issuers to
Include In their initial annual report
filed with the Commission audited financial statements substantially similar
to those required by Regulation A
Between Aprr112, 1978 and May 18,
1978, the Commission conducted a senes of hearrngs In Washington,
DC;
Los Angeles, California; Denver, Colorado, Atlanta, Georgia, Chicago, Illinois; and Boston, Massachusetts. The
commentators
discussed a number of
deletions, additions, and modifications
of registration
and reporting requirements in an effort to aid small bustnesses and new ventures. Commentators
also emphasized that there are a number of factors other than the Federal securities laws that have a substantial
Impact on access to the public marketplace.
Based on the hearrngs and other
available information and suggestions,
the Commission adopted revrsrons to
Rule 144, Rule 146, and Regulation A
The Commission
relaxed Rule 144's
quantitative
resale restnctrons, 46 and
proposed an amendment to Rule 144
which would permit certain persons who
have held securities covered by the Rule
for a five year perrod to sell such securities Without any volume limitations
(This proposal was adopted after the end
of the fiscal year With a holding period
of three years for exchange listed securrties and four years for secuntres not
listed but Issued by a reporting company).47 An amendment was adopted to
Rule 146 to allow the use of Regulation
A type financial
information
for Rule

146 offerings up to $1.5 million 48Pursuant to requisrte Congressional
authorrzation, the Commission raised the
ceiling on the amounts of securities
which may be sold under Regulation A
Within a twelve month perrod from
$500,000
to $1,500,000
49
In conjunction With the Commission's
ongoing review of problems facing small
businesses, additional
proposals-e-rncludmg Form $-l8-were
stili In various stages of staff formulation
and
review at the end of the fiscal year
(Subsequent to the close of the fiscal
year, the Commission adopted, on March
29, 1979, Form S-18 as revised to reflect certain recommendations
of commentators. The form IS available for
offerrngs of up to $5 million dollars, of
which up to $1.5 million may be sales
by existmg securrty holders.)

New Developments in Disclosure
Policy
Advisory Committee
On Corporate
DIsclosure-In
November, 1977, the
Report of The AdVISOry Committee on
Corporate DIsclosure was presented to
the Commission and the public 50 The
Report represented the culmination
of
a 21-month investigation by a 17 -rnernber Committee which was assisted by
the staff of the Commission and a number of other protessional and self-regulatory organizations
The transmittal
letter accompanying
the Report Indicated that although not
all members agreed unreservedly, the
conclusions reached were that the disclosure system established by the Comrnrssron IS sound and does not need
radical reform or renovation. However,
the letter also urged that the Commission be mindful of the POSSIbilities extant for such reform, and the Report
goes on to recommend that the Comrrussion review ItS practices In 13 major
areas: (1) the Commission's disclosure
objectives; (2) the Commission's rule-

17

making and monitoring practices; (3)
the development of Industry gurdelines:
(4) soft information;
(5) segment reporting; (6) social and environmental
information; (7) proxy statement disclosure; (8) further integration of the Secuntres Act and the Exchange Act; (9)
reporting requirements
under the Exchange Act; (10) financial statement
disclosures, (11) disclosure problems
of small companies; (12) dissemination
of company filings; and (13) reorganization of the Commission's file-keeping
system.
In a release Issued In February,
1978,51 the Commission summarized
the major aspects of the Report and announced ItS preliminary response to the
recommendations.
In the area of Industry guidelmes, the
Commission has Issued two releases 52
announcing Its Intent to develop guides
for railroads and for gas and electric
utilities, and the staff IS reviewing the
letters received on these projects With
a view to making further recommendations to the Commission.
Projections of Future Economic Performance.-In connection With projections of financial
information,
the
Commission reviewed the administrative record on several prior rule-making
porposals and hearings, completed ItS
review of the Advisory Committee's recommendation that the Commission ISsue a publrc statement encouraging the
disclosure of earnings forecasts and
other forward-looking
information
by
registrants, and approved, after the end
of the fiscal year, proposed gurdelmes
for disclosure of such information. The
guidelmes Included, in accord With the
Advisory Committee's recommendation,
a proposed rule that would provide a
"safe-harbor"
from the liability provisions of the Federal securities laws for
reasonably based and adequately presented projections or forecasts that are
made In good faith, but ultimately prove
to be erroneous
18

In a release " Issued In December,
1977, the Commission adopted amendments to ItS disclosure forms Implementing
the Advisory
Committee's
recommendations
concerning the disclosure of Industry segment and geographrc information,
and integrating
such disclosure With the registrant's description of business Information.
To
provide the public With further guidance
concerning the Issues presented by segment disclosure, the Diviston of Corporatron
Finance
later Issued an
interpretative release responding to some
of the more frequently-asked
questlons.54

lntegreiton of Documents and Other
DIsclosure Revtstons-Â« The Advisory
Committee also recommended that the
Commission continue ItS efforts to integrate the disclosure aspects of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
pursuant to thrs goal, the Commission
has taken several actions. On April 11,
1978, the Cornrnissron adopted admendments to Form S-16, the Simplest
and shortest
registration
form; the
amendments,
for the first time, made
the form available for registration of securities to be offered directly to the public in primary offerings. 55Issuers eligible
to use form S-16 are required to file
periodic reports under the Exchange Act
containing information about their bUSIness management and financial operations. Since these reports are generally
available, the form requires only limited
further disclosure concerning the offering, and basic disclosure regarding the
Issuer IS included through incorporating
these reports by reference.
Further
amendments to Form S-16 were proposed on September 7, 197856 making
the short form available for primary offerings by larger, well established subsidiary Issuers. (These proposals were
adopted after the close of the fiscal
year.)
Another Significant action relating to
the format of disclosure involves the

Cornrrussron action of August 16, 1978
inviting comment on a proposed new
version of Form 100K, the annual reporting form under the Exchange Act 57
The Advisory Committee recommended
that Form 100K be amended to eliminate what are, In the Committee's View,
unnecessary requirements, to add new
requirements
and to allow the information required to be presented In a
more effective and flexible format.
A number of comments were received
on this concept and the Commission's
staff is reviewing them with a view to
making specrfic recommendations
to
the Commission. It IS expected that a
number of the revrsions to Form 10-K
which might be proposed would allow
that document to be prepared In a "freewriting" style similar to the annual report to security holders, rather than In
the rigid format now required under
Form lO-K. One result of thrs approach
might be that registrants would be encouraged to combine the two documents--the
annual report to security
holders and the annual report on Form
10-K-thereby
Improving the comprehensrveness of mtorrnatron
disseminated by registrants While easing the
burdens of preparing and filing the required documents.
The Commission has also taken steps
to further the Advisory Committee's recommendation
that disclosure requirements under the Securities Act and
Exchange Act relating to the same categories of information be uniform among
forms and reports. In December, 1977,58
the Commission adopted the first two
Items of Regulation S-K, which provide
uniform requirements for registrants to
provide disclosure In various reports and
forms of their busrness and properties
by focusmg on their Industry segments
and geographic areas. In July 1978,59
the Commission adopted additional uniform Items regarding disclosure of management background and remuneration,
material legal proceedings, and bene-

ncrat ownership

of management and
certain substantial security holders. The
approach of Regulation S-K IS Intended
to make compliance With disclosure requrrernents Simpler by providrng one
convenient reference source and assurmg that information required to be disclosed on a particular subject does not
vary from one form to another.
Elsewhere In this Report, a descrrptron IS provided of actions taken concerning
the Advisory
Committee's
recommendations
on corporate governance and small busmess frnancmgs
and disclosure

Tender Offers, Large Acquisitions
and Corporate Repurchases
Sections

13(d) and (e), and

14(d),

(e) and (f) of the Exchange Act, enacted

In 1968 and amended In 1970, provide
for full disclosure In cash tender offers,
other stock acqursrtrons
mvolving
changes In ownership or control, and
corporate repurchases of stock These
provisions were desrgned to close gaps
In the full disclosure
provrsions of the
securities laws and to safeguard the interest of persons who tender their securitres In response to a tender offer or
have their securities repurchased by the
Issuer
On April 21, 1978, the Commission
adopted amendments to Regulation 130
as well as a new Schedule 13G relating
to disclosure by certain beneftcial owners of equity secunties pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act 60 Among
other th rngs, the new provrsrons (l) proVide a definition of the term "benefrcral
ownership" for the purpose of Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act; (2) make the
disclosure In Schedule 130 acqursitron
statements more meaningful to investors and the reporting of that inforrnatron less burdensome
to beneftctal
owners; and (3) provide a short form
acquisrtron statement to be used by certain institutional
Investors and certain
employee benefit plans acquiring se-

19

cunties In the ordinary course of their
business and not for purposes of control.
Concurrently with the adoption of the
amendments
to Regulation 130, the
Commission
proposed for comment
amendments to Regulation 130 which
would Implement Section 13(g) of the
Exchange Act. 61The principal effect of
the proposed amendments IS to require
persons who own more than five percent
of a class of equity securities specified
In Rule 13d-Hc)
and who are not presently required to file under Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act, to file annually the applicable
information
required by Schedule 13G. (The gaps In
reporting
under Section
13(d) were
closed with the adoption
of these
amendments,
essentially as proposed,
on November 22, 1978,62 subsequent
to the end of the fiscal year.)
Various technical and interpretive ISsues raised by the amendments to Regulation 130 were also addressed In a
staff interpretive release.P and further
amendments to Regulation 13D were
adopted relating to the availability
of
Schedule 13G to a parent holding company and to the beneficial ownership of
pledged secuntres, including secuntres
pledged to a broker-dealer In connection
with margin account transactions. 64
To satisfy the obligation under Section 13(g) to tabulate and make promptly
available the Information contained In
Schedules 130, 13G, and 14D-1, the
Commission, after the close of the fiscal
year, proposed and adopted amendments to the cover pages of those forms 65
These proposals require persons filing
the schedules to abstract certain data
from within the schedule In order to facrhtate the entry of such data Into a proposed computer system.
On November 17, 1977, the Comrrussron also proposed for comment a
new rule and related schedule with respect to gomg private transactions by

20

public companies or their affiliates. 66
The effect of these transactions IS the
elimination or substantial reduction of
the public equity Interests, thereby resulting In the corporation or ItS successor becoming a privately held firm. If
adopted, the proposals would provide
defrrutrons, specific disclosure and dissemination
requirements,
substantive
protections and particular antifraud provisions with respect to gomg private
transactions.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
In December 1977, the President
signed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
of 1977 (FCPA), which amended certain sections of the Federal securitres
laws. The Act prohibits Issuers from,
among other things, corruptly making
payments to officials of foreign governments In order to Induce such officials
to use their authority or Influence to obtain business In the country for the ISsuer.
The Act also requires issuers to comply with certain related provrsrons including the maintenance of a system of
Internal accounting controls which provides reasonable assurance that certain
objectives are met. The Act will sigrnticantly assist the Commission In its continuing
program
against
fraud
by
management of publicly held companies.
Subsequent to the end of the fiscal
year, the Cornrnissron adopted rules that
prohibit the falsification
of an Issuer's
books and records and the making of
false, misleading or Incomplete statements to an accountant In connection
With any audit or examination of the financial statements of the Issuer or the
preparation
of reports or documents
filed with the Cornrrussron. These rules
are intended to assure that an issuer's
books and records accurately and fairly
reflect Its transactions and dispositions
of assets; to protect the integrity of the

Independent audit of Issuer financial
statements
required
under the Exchange Act; to promote the reliability
and completeness
of financial
information that issuers are required to file
with the Commission, or disseminate to
Investors under the Exchange Act; to
promote compliance with the new Sections 13(b)(2)(A) (FCPA provisions); and
to prevent the concealment of questionable or Illegal corporate payments and
practices. The Commission believes that
these rules, while Intended to deal with
a much broader range of practices than
the problem of questionable or Illegal
corporate payments and practices, will
serve to discourage repetition of the seriOUSabuses which the Commission has
uncovered in this area.
It bears emphasis that the Internal
accounting
control provrsions of the
FCPA are not exclusively concerned with
the preparation of financial statements.
An equally Important objective of the
new law, as well as pre-existing provisions of the Federal securities laws, IS
the goal of corporate accountability.
In.
this context the Act embodies certain
requirements
of integrity In corporate
record keeping and includes assurances
that there IS proper control over and accountability for the use of corporate assets and that corporate transactions are
executed In accordance with management's general or specific authorization.
Accordingly, the Act establishes requirements concerning the Internal activities of reporting companies that are
supportive
of the disclosure
system
mandated by the Exchange Act, but
should not be analyzed solely from that
point of view. The new requirements
may provide an independent baSIS for
enforcement action by the Commission,
whether or not violation of the provisions
may lead, in a particular case, to the
dissemination of materially false or misleading Information to Investors.

Certain cases brought by the Comrrussron under the Act are discussed In
this report In the "Enforcement
Program" section.

Oversight of the Accounting
Profession
Report on the Accounting Profession
and the Commission's Oversight RoleIn July 1978, the Commission submitted to Congress ItS frrst Report on the
Accounting Profession and the Commission's Oversight Role This was In accordance
With the Commission's
undertaking dunng the hearings held on
the accounting profession by the Subcommittee on Reports, Accounting and
Management of the Senate Committee
on Governmental Affatrs one year earlier
to report periodically on the accounting
profession's response to the challenges
which Congress and others have placed
before It and on related Commission in-

rtiatives.
The questions raised concerning the
accounting
profession and ItS future
have centered principally on the profession's capability, absent direct government regulation,
to regulate
and
discipline
its members and to assure
their Independence; and to set auditing
and accounting standards. The Report
contained the views of the Commission
and the staff on on the major issues confronting the accounting profession. and
analyzed In detail the recent progress
made by the Commission and, under ItS
active oversight, the protession, in dealIng With them.
During the fiscal year, the profession's major self-regulatory
initiatives
were focused on the new Drvision of
Firms of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants.
The SEC
Practice Section of that Divisron, monitored by a Public Oversight Board composed of distingurshed individuals from
outside the accounting profession, IS to
provide leadership In addressing Issues

21

of importance to the profession and ItS
Independence,
such as the range of
services appropriate for accountants to
offer clients, and IS responsible for the
development and conduct of a continuing program of peer reviews of member
firms.
Based on ItS review of events during
the preceding year, the Commission indicated that It was too early to assess
the long-run effectiveness of the profession's efforts at self-regulation,
but that
It regarded the section's creation as a
major accomplishment and a potentially
viable foundation for a meaningful program of self-regulation.
The Comrnrstherefore,
that the
sron Indicated,
profession's
initiatives
showed sufficient promise to be permitted to continue to evolve, and that It would not at
that time recommend legislation, such
as that Introduced In Congress dunng
the year, which would institute formalized procedures for self-regulation
of
the profession.
The Cornrrussron has worked with the
accounting profession to define the objectives of the self-regulatory program,
and to assure that the profession's proposed Implementation IS consistent with
those objectives. As described In the
staff report, the Cornrrussron has monrtored the profession's efforts m this
area closely In addition, the Commission was active dunng the year m overseeing the profession's
Initiatives
concernrng the Independence of auditors and the accountrng and audrtmg
standard-setti ng processes.
Accounting Standards for Oil and Gas
Producers-During
the fiscal year the
Cornrrnsston conducted an extensive
public proceeding on accounting standards for 011 and gas producers. The Commission's
proceeding was conducted
pursuant to both the Federal securrtres
laws and the Energy Policy and Conservatron Act of 1975 (EPCA), which re-

22

quires that the Cornrnrssron assure the
development
and observance of accounting practices for the oil and gas
Industry. The Impact of the requirements of EPCA, among other things,
contributed
to the uniqueness of the
Cornrrussron's proceeding In this matter.
In August 1978, the Cornrnission announced that It had determrned, among
other things, to require disclosure In financial statements of supplemental financial and operating data, Including
inforrnatron on future net revenues from
production of proved 011 and gas reserves. It also specrfred a form of successful efforts accounting to be followed,
and proposed an alternative
full-cost
method
Based on ItS conclusions that development of new tmancral accounting
measurement standards will be necessary to achieve meaningful reporting of
earnings and fmancral position for 011
and gas producing companies, the Comrnrssron announced that it had determined to work toward the development
of a method of accounting that recognizes valuations of proved 011 and gas
reserves In the balance sheets and mcome statements of 011 and gas producers, a method which the Cornrrussion
designated
"reserve
recognition
accountmg." Because of the inherent imprecrsion
of reserve valuation,
the
Cornrnrssron also indicated that It Will
closely study the feasibility of th ISmethod
and ItS usefulness before determining
the ultimate method of reporting
Although the Cornrrussron's conclusions In this matter differed from those
of the FASB, the Comrrussron. In announcing ItS determinations,
emphaSized that ItS policy toward the FASB
remained unchanged, and reiterated Its
strong general support of the FASB's
role rn addressing frnanctal accounting
Issues.

Investment Companies and Advisers

Comprehensive Review of Regulatory
System
The Divrsron of Investment Management undertook during the fiscal year
comprehensive
reviews of the Investment Company Act and the Investment
Advisers Act. These reviews were Implemented with a view to ensuring that the
Acts and the Commission's administration of them are consistent with both the
protection of investors and the needs of
regulated Investment managers In light
of current and anticipated
trends In
business
The DIVision established
a special
study group to review the Investment
Company Act and the rules, regulations,
and administrative
practices under it,
with the purpose of simplifying and reducrng the burden of regulation, to the
extent possible, consistent with the protection of Investors. One objective of the
study ISto replace administrative review
of proposed Investment company activities with rules codifying general condrtions under which such activities are
permissible.
Such rules could obviate
certain routinely granted applications
for exemptive relief and requests for interpretive advice. More significantly the
study is explonng ways of reducing the
extent to which the staff becomes involved in decisrons of investment companies and their managements which
involve the exercise of both business
judgment and legal and frducrary re-

sponstbilrty. A major focus of this effort
will be on strengthening and structuring
the role of drsrnterested directors of Investment companies
In making and
overseeing such decisrons,
The result should be a regulatory system which relies primarily on investment companies and their managers,
and particularly the disinterested directors, to discharge their duties properly
and to make full and fair disclosure, but
which preserves a strong oversight function for the Cornrmssion through ItS inspectron and enforcement
programs
(Subsequent to the close of the fiscal
year, the Cornrnrssron
proposed rules
regarding the pricing of redeemable investment company securities; the receipt of brokerage
commissions
by
affiliated
brokers In connection
With
stock exchange transactions;
transactions With portfolio affiliates; reorganization of portfolio companies; and certain
jornt purchases of Insurance coverage
It also proposed and adopted three rules
regarding unit Investment trusts. Moreover, It proposed to rescind an obsolete
rule regarding the receipt of brokerage
cornrnissions
by affiliated
brokers In
connection With over-the-counter transactrons.)
The Investment Advisers Act review
IS concentrating on whether the exrstrng
regulatory structure IS adequate In light
of the dramatic growth of the advisory
industry in recent years Subjects to be

23

examined by the review Include. whether
or not there should be professional and
financial qualifications
for Investment
advisers, whether there should be speerne antifraud rules dealing with abuses
to which the advisory Industry may be
particularly
vulnerable, whether there
should be different regulations for different types of advisers, and to what
extent the Advisers Act should apply to
entitles such as banks, Insurance companies, rruru-accounts. and certain kinds
of publications
(Subsequent to the end
of the fiscal year, on January 24, 1979,
the Commission adopted major amendments to the Investment adviser registration form and adopted a new rule
requiring advisers to make certain drsclosures to their clients. These actions
should greatly Increase the amount of
material information about Investment
advisers which IS available to the Comrnrssion and the public)

Institutional Disclosure
The Commission adopted dunng the
fiscal year Rule 13f-1 and related Form
13F Implementing the institutional drsclosure program mandated by Section
13(f) of the Exchange Act which was
added by the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 67 Section 13(f) empowers the Cornrnissron
to adopt rules
creating a reporting and disclosure system to collect specifrc mtorrnatron as to
the equity secuntres held In accounts
over which certain institutional
investment managers exercise Investment drscrenon. The reporting system required
by Section 13(f) IS Intended to create
In the Commission a central repository
of historical and current data about the
Investment activrtres of institutional investment managers.
Under Rule 13f-1,
an institutional
Investment manager exercismg investment discretion
with respect to accounts having $100 million or more In
exchange-traded or other specrfred eq24

urty secunties, on the last trading day
of any of the twelve months of a calendar
year, must file Form 13F With the Comrrussron, Within forty-five days after the
last day of such calendar year. The new
rule took effect beginning With calendar
year 1978. Banks must also file Form
13F With the appropriate banking agency.
The release announcing adoption of
Rule 13f-1 sought comments concernmg the usefulness and costs associated
With quarterly, as opposed to annual reporting. As of the end of the fiscal year,
the DIVISion of Investment Management
was reviewing the numerous comments
It had received concerning that matter
(Subsequently to the close of the fiscal
year the Cornrnrssron, on January 5,
1979, Issued final rules requiring quarterly reportrng.)

Integrated Registration and
Reporting System
The Comrrussron adopted dunng tiscal 1978 a rule and forms creating an
Integrated
regrstration and reporting
system designed to reduce both the
number of forms and the duplicative information filed by management investment companies. 68 The need to Integrate
the various registration and reporting
requirements under the Securities Act
and the Investment Company Act has
been recognized since 1941, and the
Cornrrussion's action achieved thrs Important goal.
The Integrated registration
and reporting system provides for a unified
registration statement form (Form N-1
for open-end companies and Form N-2
for closed-end companies) which may
be used both to register securities under
the Securities Act and to meet the requrrernents for filing a registratron statement under the Investment Company
Act. The unified registratron statement
Includes most of the information previously contained In registration state-

ment
Form
N-8B-l
under
the
Investment Company Act, and Forms S4 and S-5 under the Securities Act. The
Commission also adopted a revised notification
of registration,
Form N-8A,
under the Investment Company Act The
new form permits Investment companies filing a notification of registration
Simultaneously with a registration statement to file a special short-form nonficatron of registration.
As part of the Integrated registration
and reporting system, the Commission
adopted Rule 8b--16 requiring the annual updating of registration statements
filed under the Investment Company
Act. This IS a new requirement
for

closed-end
management
Investment
companies. The effect of Rule 8b-16
will be to ensure that the staff of the
Commission and the public have access
to complete and current Information
about all registered management
investment companies
The Commission revised Form N-l R,
the annual report form under the Investment Company Act for management
Investment
companies
The annual
amendment of registration statements
filed under the Investment Company Act
required by Rule 8b-16 permits elimination of separate narrative annual reports previously required to be filed as
part of Form N-l R

Enforcement Program

DUring the past fiscal year, the Comrrussron has continued to maintain a vigorousand effective enforcement program
as a means of accomplishing ItS Investor
protection goals. The significant cases
brought and disposed of reflect the variety of fraudulent conduct detected and
prosecuted by the Commission. They
also show the channelling of the enforcement effort Into specific problem
areas.
The Commission's enforcement activities, which are designed to combat securities fraud and other Illegal conduct,
encompass civil and criminal court actions, as well as administrative proceedings. Where Violations of the
securities laws are established, the
sanctions which may result range from
censure by the Commission to prison
sentences Imposed by a court.
The enforcement program ISdesigned
to achieve as broad a regulatory Impact
as possible within the framework of resources available to the Commission. In
view of the capability of self-regulatory
and state and local agencies to deal effectively With certain secunties violations, the Commission seeks to promote
effective coordination and cooperation
between its own enforcement activities
and those of other agencies.

Settlement of Commission Actions
A high percentage of the Commission's judicial and administrative en-

forcement actions are settled before any
trial of the action ISheld. These actions
are primarily remedial In nature and are
aimed at preventing future Violative conduct and at remedying the results of
past Violations. The Commission has
been successfu I In obta Inmg settlements which meet both of these goals
Without the necessity for prolonged litigation which could Impose a serious
burden upon limited personnel resources
Typically, defendants consent to such
settlements Without admitting or denymg the factual allegations contained In
the Commission's complaint (In the
case of injunctive actions) or order for
proceedings (In the case of administrative proceedings) Accordingly, In the
following discussion of significant enforcement actions, it should be assumed that the defendant consented to
any indicated settlement Without admitting or denying the factual allegations.

Questionable Payments
The Commission continued ItS enforcement Interest in the area of questionable and Illegal corporate payments
in fiscal 1978, and expects that ItS interest in this area Will continue in fiscal
1979. While more than 400 corporations have made disclosures of such
payments, the Commission IS continuing to investigate evidence of violative

27

conduct In this area both by companies
which have disclosed such activities
and by other corporations as well
Prevrous Commission enforcement
activities disclosed a widespread pattern of rllegal and unethical corporate
activity and contributed to the enactment by the Congress of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (Sections
13(b)(2), 30A and 31 (c) of the Exchange Act) which was signed Into law
rn December 1977. The Act prohibits
Issuers from, among other things, corruptly makrng payments to officials of
foreign governments rn order to rnduce
such offtcials to use their authority or
rnfluence to obtarn busrness for the ISsuer rn the country.
The Act also requires Issuers to comply with certarn related provisrons, rncludrng the maintenance of a system of
Internal accountrng controls which provrdes reasonable assurance that certarn
objectives are met. The Act Will sigruficantly assist the Commission In ItScontinuing program against fraud by
management of public companies
The relief obtarned rn these cases IS
designed to be both remedial and prospective For example, rn the Seagrams
case discussed below, the Frnal Order
prohibits the defendants (1) from filing
Inaccurate annual and other reports
with the Comriussion pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, regardIng, among other things, (a) any
accountrng practices employed to disguise Illegal activities, (b) the Illegal
contribution of funds for the benefit of
political candidates, (c) the Illegal drsPOSitionof wrnes and SPirits for gratuities, promotion, or entertarnment, and
(d) the establishment or maintenance
of any fund of corporate monies or other
assets which are not accurately and
fairly accounted for, In reasonable detail, on the books and records of the
defendants; (2) from makrng or ardrng
and abettrng the making of false and
28

ncntrous entries rn books and records
under their control; and (3) orders the
defendants to file With the Cornmission
reports on Form 8--K drsclosmg all material matters relevant to the complarnt.
The following cases Illustrate the
Comrrussron's efforts rn thrs area

payments, the Commission charged that
there had been falsifications
of corporate books and records, and filings of

proxy and reporting provrsions of the
Federal securities laws as well as additional equitable relief. including the appointrnent
of a Special Counsel to

Based upon ItS view that the alleged
payments might be material facts to
Investors, the court denied a motion by
Schiltz to drsrruss the Commission's
complaint.
The Court's determination
of materiality was premised on the alleged payments' reflection
on the integrity of
management and on the potentially adverse consequences to Schiltz's licenses as a result of ItS Illegal conduct. The
court also cited with approval the Commission's May 12, 1976 report to the

29

Senate Banking Housing and Urban Affairs Committee

Tender Offers and Corporate
Takeovers
Due to a variety of corporate economic
considerations, there has recently been
a significant
Increase In tender offers
and other corporate takeover activity.
The Commission's enforcement and rulemaking responsibilities
under the Williams Act " are designed to ensure that
parties involved in such transactions are
provided the benefit of full and fair disclosure; to ensure that all affected
shareholders and Investors are treated
fairly; and to avoid tippmg the balance

31

of regulation In favor either of the bidder
or the target company's management
Because of the swiftly changing circumstances often associated with tender
offers, the Commission has taken measures to insure ItS capability to monitor
changes In corporate ownership; to coordinate ItS efforts to detect promptly
any possible violations of the applicable
laws; and to take appropnate investigatory and enforcement action.
Among the recent Important enforcement actions In the tender offer area are
the following:
SEC v. Sun Company, Inc. BO_On

Management Perquisites
The staff's continuing Investigations
involvrng management perquisites have
focused on the payment of nonbusiness
expenses and subsidres to corporate officers and directors. Examples Include
rental of expensive livrng quarters at far
less than the amount paid by the companies for their maintenance, and the
use of corporate airplanes, as well as
other undisclosed expenses and benefits.
An Important action brought In this
area IS the following case.

they received for their personal benefit.

Municipal Securities
The trading of government and murucipat secunties has Significantly
increased In recent years. At one time,
these secuntres were purchased primarily by financial institutions for their
Investment yield and low risk. More recently, however, highly sophisticated
and extremely speculative trading practices In these securities have developed,
mvolvrng brokers and dealers who, by
the use of manipulative and deceptive
practices, have preyed upon unsoptustreated Investors. These developments
have generated an active enforcement
Interest on the part of the Commission.
The followmg enforcement actions reflect the Commission's activity In this
area.

SEC v. Winters Government Secun-

ties CorporatlOnB7-ThlS

case, filed on
August 15, 1977, was one of the first
injunctive actions by the Commission in
connection With transactions In United

certain of the antifraud provisions of the
Federal securines laws, In connection
WIth transactions In secunties consist-

34

sales techniques,
charged excessive
markups and cornrrussrons and used
sham accounts. The complaint further
alleged that fraudulent misrepresentanons and omissions were made In
that the defendants
represented that
quick and substantial profits could be
made Without risks.
In addition to permanent injunctive
relief consented to In the case, the Commission obtained a representation from
one defendant and instituted pubhc admirustrative
proceedings
against another which limited, for periods of tirne,
their ability to be associated with broker-dealers. The Commission also cancelled the broker-dealer registration of
one defendant. 88
The Cornrnissron has also been concerned with the growing number of
abuses in the offer and sale of industrial
development bonds. In some instances
these bond offerings have resulted In
ftnancral loss for investors. One case In
the area IS U.S. v. George Mariscal. 89
Tlus case Involves Criminal charges
against a Phoenix, Arizona attorney who
In another matter had been enjoined
from offering and/or selling the securities of any issuer in Violation of the registration requirements of the Securities
Act and, subsequently,
had been permanently suspended from appearing or
practicmg before the Commission under
an order Issued pursuant
to Rule
2(e)(3)(II) of the Cornrnission's Rules of
Practice. 90
The Ind ictment 91 charged George

Currency JOintly filed a CIvil injunctive
action against The National Bank of
Georgia (NBG), The Calhoun First National Bank (Calhoun), and T. Bertram
Lance (Lance) alleging violations of certain ofthe antifraud, reporting and proxy
soucrtation provrsrons of the Federal securitres laws. Simultaneously
the defendants consented to the entry of Final
Judgments of Permanent Injunction and
Other Equitable Relief.
The complaint alleged that NBG, Calhoun and Lance engaged in certain unsafe and unsound banking practices
including
a pattern of related-party
transactions by Lance and certain of his
relatives, substantial and prolonged overdraftmg in checking accounts at Calhoun, numerous questionable loans to

misleading entries on its books and records, Incomplete and Inadequate evaluations of NBG's loan porttoho, and
loans by N BG to relatives and associates
of Lance without adequate regard for the
creditworthiness
of the borrowers and
on preferential terms.
The complaint alleged that the senior
management of Calhoun and the management of N BG engaged In, were aware
of, or permitted certain of the unsafe
practices, and that the board of directors In a number of Significant respects
performed no meaningful
monitoring
role of management. The management
of Calhoun engaged In such acnvrties
despite persistent criticisms
and recommendations by the Comptroller of the
Currency and despite having knowledge
of many of the unsafe practices.
As part of the settlement of the case,

NBG and Calhoun made certain undertakings which are construed to be Written agreements entered Into with the
Comptroller of the Currency within the

SEC v. Netionet Student Marketing
coroorettonv-usÂ» August 31, 1978,
District Judge Barrington D. Parker of
the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia issued a Memorandum Opinion and Judgment tollowing
the trial of the remaining defendants In
the Commission's litigation ansmg from
the National Student Marketing Corporation (NSMC) stock fraud.
The Commission proceeded to trial
against. the president of an Insurance
holding company acquired by NSMC
th rough a merger In 1969; a d Irector of
the Insurance holding company who was
a partner In ItS law firm; another partner
In the law firm; and the law firm Thtr-

35

teen other defendants In the case settled the civil case before trral; three
defendants were granted summary Judgment. 95
The Commission had alleged that the
remaining defendants had violated and
aided and abetted violations of Section
lO(b) of the Exchange Act, Rule 1O~
5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the
Securities Act by participating
In the
merger of NSMC and the Insurance
holding company, a merger which was
approved by that company's
public
shareholders based on allegedly materially false and misleading financial information concerning
NSMC, and by
engaging in the sale of NSMC stock Immediately after the merger, all without
disclosrng
materral Information
contained In a comfort letter delivered at
the closmg by NSMC's outside auditors.
The NSMC tmancial statements which
were contained In the proxy statement
sent to the public shareholders of the
Insurance holding company showed a
profit of approximately $700,000 while
the auditors stated irrthe comfort letter
that retroactive adjustments were necessary such that they would show a loss.
The court found that" ... [the attorneys] should have refused to proceed
with the merger absent disclosure to and
resolrcrtatron of the shareholders."
Concerning the alleged aiding and
abetting Violations by the attorneys In
failing to take any action at the closmg,
the court held that" ... the attorneys'
responsibilities to their corporate client
required them to take steps to ensure
that the information [contained In the
comfort letter] would be disclosed to the
shareholders. "
The court concluded that the attorneys were required at the very least to
"speak out at the closmg concerning the
... concomitant requirements that the
merger not be closed until the adjustments were disclosed and approval of
the merger was again obtained from the

36

Interstate shareholders".
Although
It
determined that the defendants had VIolated the securrties laws, the court concluded that an Injunction
was not
warranted.

Civil injunctive action naming as defendants certain former officers, directors and employees
of National

Waterhouse & Co (PW), National's former Independent auditors. The complaint alleged Violations of Section 17(a)
of the Sec unties Act and Sections 10(b)
and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and rules
thereunder, and the Commission's Regulation S-X.
The complaint alleged that certain financial statements Issued by National
and reported upon by PW were rnaten-

37

ally false and rrusleadrng, rn that they
materially overstated assets and revenues and understated liabilities and expenses. The complaint also alleged that
PW failed to conduct Its audit of National rn accordance with generally accepted
auditing
standards
and,
accordingly, that PW lacked sufficient
basis to conclude that National's frnancial statements were presented rn accordance
with generally
accepted
accountrng pnnciples. In addition, the
indivrdual defendants were named for
their roles in the preparation and ISSUance of allegedly materrally false and
misleading public cornrnurucatrons concerning National's declrnrng frnanctal
condition durrng the perrod prror to National's enterrng bankruptcy proceedrngs.
PW agreed to a settlement rn which
It consented to the entry of a Frnal Judgment and Other Relief enjcrrung PW
from Violations of the antifraud and reportrng provisions of the Federal secuntres laws rn connection
With the
securitres of National or ItS subsrdrarres.
The judgment entered against PW also'

to assure the adequacy of ItS audit practices; (2) ordered PW to submit to a
"peer review" of the manner In which
PW conducts ItS audit practice With respect to clients whose financial statements are filed With the Commission or

exchange or traded in the over-thecounter market; and (3) ordered PW to
return to Natronal's Chapter X Trustee
$90,000 rn fees paid rn connection With
the National engagement for Natronal's
1973 and 1974 fiscal years
Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission also Issued
its Report of Investigation (Report) based
on rntorrnatron received in the Cornrrus-

38

sion's non-public mvesngatron-i-ro the
Matter of National Telephone Co., Inc.With respect to the actrvities of certarn
directors of National. These directors
consented to the issuance of the Report
Without adrrutting or denyrng the Report's findrngs.
The Report found that these directors
were aware, durrng the fall of 1974 and
the wrnter and sprrng of 1975, of significant
facts concernrng
National's
troublesome financial condition. Moreover, they were also aware of the optimistic nature of the company's publrc
disclosures, disclosures which were in
direct contrast With the true state of the
company's affairs. Under these circumstances, the Report contrnued, "ITlhe
company's outside directors had an affirmative duty to see to It that proper
disclosures were made." The Report
concluded that "In general, outside directors should be expected to rnamtain
a general tarnilranty
with their company's communications
with the public.
Inthisway, theycancomparesuch
comrnurucatrons With what they know to be
the facts, and If the facts as they know
them are rnconsrstent With those communications, they can see to It, as stewards for the company, that approprrate
revistons or add It Ions be made."
SEC v. George M. OssermanlOO-On
September 7, 1978, the Cornrrussron
filed a complarnt seekrng Injunctions
agarnst a number of Individual corporations and limited partnerships, and a
law firm. The complarnt alleged that
each of the defendants Violated the regrstration provrsrons of the Securities Act
m connection With the offer and sale of
approximately $112 million of unregistered securitres rn the form of limited
partnersh Ip interests.
The complarnt further alleged that
certain of the defendants Violated the
general antifraud provisrons of the Secunties Act and the Exchange Act rn

connection with the sale of the limited
partnership interests.
On September 14, 1978, certain defendants (including the law firm) consented to the issuance of permanent
Injunctions without admitting or denyrng the allegations of the complaint. The
court ordered one of these defendants
to make an accounting of the disposition
of funds received by him in connection
with the activities alleged In the complaint. The law firm further stipulated
that It would adopt, Implement
and
maintain
Internal supervisory
procedures set forth in a letter of undertaking
to the Commission.
The Commission is conducting drscovery as to the remaining defendants
and expects a hearing on the merits In
the coming fiscal year.

In the Matter of Bateman, EIchler,
Hill Richards Inc.101--On March 20,
1978,
the Commission
issued an
Order Instituting
Proceedings against
Bateman Eichler, Hili Richards, Inc.
(Bateman Eichler) and four of its senior
officers for violation of the anti-manipulative and antifraud provisrons of the
Exchange Act In connection With trading
in the securities of Frigitromcs,
Inc.,
Vernitron Corporation and Logicon Inc.
The Order also alleged that Bateman
Eichler violated the beneficial ownership reporting requirements and recordkeeping provisions of the Exchange Act,
that the four officers aided and abetted
such Violations and that all of the respondents violated the margin provisions of the Exchange Act. The Order
alleged that a senior vice-president of
Bateman Eichler purchased the securities of these three Issuers for customers
accounts without their authonzation.
Approximately $9.6 million of these securities were purchased on such unauthorized basis. The fact that customers
were unaware of the unauthorized purchases for their accounts or in some instances,
refused
to accept
the

unauthonzed
purchases for their accounts, enabled this officer to offer to
sell securities to other customers at a
price below their then current market
price. These transactions resulted in an
artificial
inflation of the prices of the
securities.
Bateman Eichler and its officers consented to findings of violations as alleged In the order and the Imposition of
certain remedial sanctions.
As part of the remedial sanctions ordered by the Commission, Bateman EIchler's registration With the Commission
as a broker-dealer was suspended for
one year but the suspension was held
In abeyance providing that Bateman EIchler met certain conditions. The conditions Included a protubrtron
(with
certain exceptions) from engaging in
any block posrtiorung on certain national securities exchanges for a period
of six months, the setting aside of $1
million for claims and the establishment
of a Special Review Committee to review
and monitor the compliance activities
of the firm. Three officers were suspended from assocratron With any broker-dealer for one year each but that
sanctron was held In abeyance provided
that each officer not serve in any capacity with any broker or dealer for three
months, nor receive compensation from
the firm for an additional three months
and not be found to have committed
additional
violations of the Exchange
Act for a period of one year from the date
of the order. The fourth officer was
barred from association With a broker or
dealer With the proviso that he could
reapply to be associated with a broker
or dealer after three years from the date
of the order.

In the Matter of Memll Lynch, PIerce,
Fenner & Smith, Inc 102_ln November
1977, the Commission issued an Opinion and Order wherein it found that Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc.
(Merrill Lynch), a research analyst em-

39

ployed by Merrill Lynch, and twentyeight of Merrill Lynch's salesmen had
violated the antifraud provisions of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act In
connection
with recommendations
to
purchase shares of Scientific
Control
Corporation (Scientific). After the institution of public administrative
proceedmgs, hearings were held before an
administrative
law judge In various major crties throughout the United States.
At the conclusion of the proceeding, the
respondents made offers of settlement,
which were accepted by the Commission. The Cornrnrssron Issued an OprnIon and Order, which contained findings
and Imposed remedial sanctions upon
the respondents.
The find ings of violations by the Merrill Lynch salesmen primarily rest upon
the false and misleading
representations made to public customers dunng
oral presentations designed to encourage the purchase of SCientific shares.
Most common among these misrepresentations were statements related to
the future Increase In the market price
of SCientific shares, and statements
comparing SCientific, In terms of future
potential, to much larger and more seasoned companies
The Commission
found these statements to have been
-made without a reasonable basis In fact
and, hence, In violation of the antifraud
provrsions. Merrill Lynch was also found
to have failed to reasonably supervise
the twenty-eight salesmen with a view
toward preventing these violations.
The Commission
censured Merrill
Lynch and ordered the payment of the
sum of $1.6 million to compensate ItS
customers who suffered losses In connection with transactions In Sctentrfrc.'?'
In addition, the Commission directed
Merrill Lynch to review and strengthen,
where necessary, ItS sales and research
guidehnes and its training program for
salesmen.
Seven individual salesmen received

40

suspension from association with the
secuntres Industry for various periods;
twenty-one salesmen were censured. In
the Commission's
Opinion and Order,
the proceedings were dismissed against
eighteen salesmen and a supervisory
analyst.

In the Matter of Bache Halsey Stuart
Shields Incorporated and Shearson
two adminisHayden Stone Inc.-In
trative proceedings,
the Commission
found that Bache Halsey Stuart Shields,
Inc. (Bache) and four of ItS employees 104
violated the Federal securities laws In
connection with listed option activity In
the accounts of certain customers. 105
The respondents
were charged with
churning their customers' accounts over
which they had discretionary authority
and effecting option trades for such accounts which were not suited to the investment
objectives,
Investment
sophistication
and financial situations
of the customers.
The Commission found that Bache
and two of ItS salesmen violated certain
of the antifraud provrsions of the Federal
secunnes laws and that Bache and one
of its salesmen violated the margin requirementsofthe
Federal Reserve Board.
Two branch managers were found to
have failed reasonably to supervise persons subject to their supervision.
As part of Bache's offer to settle the
proceedings, Bache agreed to pay approximately $74,000 to customers who
suffered losses, and to cancel debit balances In customers' accounts totalling
approximately $264,000.
The Commission ordered all option
trading suspended for forty-five days In
two of Bache's branch offices where the
respondent employees had worked. Three
of the employees were barred from association with any broker or dealer and
one was suspended for 15 days. The
barred respondents may reapply to become associated with a broker or dealer

after specified
periods of time have
elapsed.
In the other administrative
proceeding, the Commission alleged that Shearson Hayden Stone (Shearson) and two
of its employees violated the general
antifraud
provisions of the S 303
Act and the Exchange Act and that two
employees failed reasonably to supervise a person subject to their supervision.
As part of the settlement,
Shearson
agreed to pay approximately $146,000
to customers who suffered losses. The
Comrnissron ordered that one branch
office of Shearson suspend option trading for 30 days and another branch office suspend option trading for 60 days
One employee was censured, another
suspended from association with a broker or dealer for 90 days and another
was barred from association With any
broker or dealer.
The findings were made pursuant to
offers of settlement submitted by the
respondents.
SEC v. The IES Management Group,
Inc.106-ln a series of judrcial and administrative
actions mvolvrng the I ES
Management Group, Inc (lES), a registered broker-dealer, and related indrviduals,
the Cornrrussicn
obtained
permanent orders of mjunctron, by consent, against nine indivrduals enjoining
them from Violations of registration,
antifraud, customer protection, and financial responsibility
provrsrons of the
Federal secuntres laws. Additionally,
a
Securities Investor Protection Corporation trustee was appointed to liquidate
IES.
The Commission's complaint In thrs
matter alleged that I ES fraudulently
sold Interests in tax shelter limited partnerships. Pursuant to offers of settlement, the Commission
revoked the
broker-dealer and Investment adviser
registrations of I ES, barred three individuals and suspended one person for

a one-year period from being associated
with any broker, dealer, Investment
company, or Investment adviser The
Cornrnissron also accepted resignations
from practice before the Commission
from three attorneys.
In the Matter of Steven S Mltchell107The Cornmissron ordered public adrrunistrative proceedings against two registered broker-dealers and nine individual
options market makers In connection
with certain options trades on the floor
of the Pacrfrc Stock Exchange (PSE) In
San Francisco. The proceedings
are
based upon allegations of the Commission's staff that the respondents VIOlated certain of the anti-manipulation
and antifraud provrsrons of the Federal
securities laws by engaging In trade reversals In call option contracts respectmg the underlying stock of Houston Oil
and Minerals Corp. (Houston 0,1). Listmg and trading In Houston 011 options
began Simultaneously on the PSE and
the Chicago Board Options Exchange on
November 22, 1976 The trades In ISsue occurred on that first day of competitive
trading
between
the two
exchanges. A pubhc evrdentrary hearing
In San Francisco has been completed
and the Administrative
Law Judge has
entered find ings that the respondents
Violated certain provrsions of the securities laws alleged In the order mstrtuting proceedings
and has Imposed
sanctions including a suspension
The
matter IS now an appeal to the Commission.
In the Matter of The Boston Company
tnstttuttonel Investors, Inc.-In
an initial decision which became the final
Cornrrussron decision as to all respondents except Raymond L. Dirks (Dirks) of
New York, New York (petition for review
pending), SIX registered Investment advisers were found to have Violated the
general antifraud provisrons of the Federal securities laws In March 1973, by
offering for sale and seiling on their

41

clients' behalf the securities of Equity
Funding Corporation of America (Equity
Funding) after receiving information from
Dirks that one or more former Equity
Funding employees had alleged that a
substantial amount of the corporation's
reported Insurance business had been
fabricated by company offrcrals.
Four of the respondents were censured. The administrative law judge,
finding that another respondent had dISclosed to ItS immediate purchaser, a
large New York block trading firm, much
but not all of the information about Equity Funding It possessed, determined
that the public Interest required no
sanction against the respondent.
Dirks was found to have violated the
antifraud provisions and aided and abetted the other respondents' Violations by
selectively disseminating allegations
about the Equity Funding fraud to them
and others, all of whom were clients of
potential clients of Dirks' broker-dealer
firm. Dirks was tmtrally suspended from
association With a broker-dealer for sixty
days; he has petitioned for review of
each adverse finding and legal conclusion. The Divrsion of Enforcement IS
seeking review of that portion of the initial decision wherein Dirks was suspended for only sixty days.
In reaching hrs decision that the other
respondents received and wrongfully
employed material, non-public information about Equity Funding, the administrative
law judge
sharply
drstrngurshed between vague, unattnbuted rumors Circulating in financial
Circles and concrete allegations from
one or more recent employees In a positron to know about alleged Improprieties. The judge also ruled that material
information under the antifraud provisions could consist of the allegations of
fraud, falsified records, and artrftcrally
Inflated earnings conveyed In this case.
The judge found that the seiling respondents' sudden lrqurdatron of their
42

clients' Equrty Funding holdings and
Dirk's pattern of intensive Investigation
and selective dissemination were all
strong indications that the Equity FundIng allegations were both material and
a substantial factor in the determination
to sell.
U.S. v. Richard P. Curran108-On
September 14, 1976, a Federal grand
jury In Phoenix, Arizona returned a
multi-count indictment against 18 individuals and 5 corporations. The indictment charged the defendants With
various counts of securities fraud, mail
fraud, and interstate transportation of
money obtained by fraud in connection
with the purchase and sale of various
Interests in land contracts offered for
sale and sold by Cochise College Park,
Inc. (Cochise). In addition, certain defendants were charged With operating
enterprises In Violation of the Federal
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute. The indictment resulted from a joint CommissionFBI investigation.
Over $40 million was raised from
members of the publrc, the public loss
from the sales of these Interests exceeded $20 mIIlion. The losswascaused
by an extremely high default rate on the
contracts for the lots sold, together With
large sales commissions and assignment discounts paid by Cochise on the
lot contracts.
On the basis of verdicts of guilt rendered after trial and the entry of pleas
of guilty to Informations, various fines
of up to $10,000 have been imposed
upon certain of the defendants. Sentences range from periods of probation
to ten years Imprisonment. The matter
remains pending or on appeal With respect to certain of the defendants. 109
(Subsequent to the close of the fiscal
year, certain appeals were resolved resulting in attirrnatrons of convictions of
three defendants and reversal of convictions for two others. 110)

U. S. v. Larry L. Stevens alkJa Frank
Goodman111_A thirty-nine
count indictrnent was returned against Larry L
Stevens a/kJa Frank Goodman charging
him WIth VIolations of the antifraud proVISIons of the Securities Act, mall fraud
and bankruptcy fraud. The alleged VIOlations occurred In connection With the
sale of promissory notes and Investment
contracts of North Western Mortgage
Investors Corporation (the company) of
Seattle, Washington of which Stevens
was president and In connection With ItS
Chapter X reorganization
proceeding.
The company, under the control of the
defendant, raised In excess of $6 million from over 1,700 Investors, the vast
majority of which were elderly and retired, attracted by a promised 8 percent
return. The notes and contracts sold to
the public were secured by Interests In
real property. However, the indictment
charged that the notes and contracts
were sold In amounts far In excess of the
company's equity therein; that the company was offering to pay Interest to
Investors at a time when It was not payrng nor could It pay Interest to existrng
investors; and that the company was
making Interest payments from other
investor montes The defendant pleaded
gurlty and was sentenced to serve three
years In a Federal perutentrary followed
by probation.
U.S. v. Barry S. Marlin-In thrs case
a sentence of ten years Imprisonment
followed by five years probation was Imposed on the defendant following his
plea of guilty to SIXcounts of an indictment charging him With secunties fraud,
mall fraud and rnducmg the filing of
false tax returns 111 Marlin earned out
a complex fraudulent scheme In which

numerous Investors were falsely told
that their funds were profitably Invested
In real estate syndrcations, a Caribbean
bank and a London based export-Import
business. Vrctrrns were gathered primarily from airline and airport employment tretds,
and Included
many
commercial pilots, cabin attendants and
airport fire fighters who Innocently involved their friends, associates and famrly members Marlin'S scheme resulted
In a public loss believed to be In excess
of $12 million.

U.S. v. Walter Wencke-In thrs case
five defendants were convicted for their
roles In conspiring to defraud publtc
shareholders of Sun Fruit, Ltd. pursuant
to a scheme In which this fmancrallytroubled concern was taken over by false
assurances of renabihtatron followed by
a systernatrc looting of ItS assets by defendant Wencke and his co-conspirators. The looting was concealed from
discovery for a time through false reports disseminated to shareholders and
through the mstrtutron of a fraudulent
receivership
proceeding In a Nevada
State court In which Wencke caused
himself to be named as receiver All defendants received prison terms. The
principal defendant, Wencke, a prominent San Diego, California attorney, was
sentenced to serve five years Imprisonment followed by five years probation,
fined $31,000 and ordered to make restitution to the Victims. The investigation
leading to the successful prosecution of
the case resulted from a Significant cooperative effort of the Postal Inspection
Service, the Internal Revenue Service
and the Comrrussron's
enforcement
staff. 112

Other Important Litigation

The Commission, through ItS Office
of General Counsel, participates as a
party and as an amicus rn a substantial
amount of lrtrgatron rn addition to ItS
enforcement
actions
The results rn
these suits often affect exrstrng rnterpretations of the Federal secuntres laws
and/or the scope of the Commission's
authority. The followrng IS a summary
of some of these non-enforcement
actions which were litigated rn the past
year.
Daniel v. tnternettonet Brotherhood
of Teamsters--The Issue raised In Daniel rnvolved the extent of the coverage
of the Securities Act. The case presented the question of whether the antifraud provisions of the Federal secuntres
laws are applicable to the acqursttron by
employees of rnterests rn certarn types
of pension funds-a
question which
turned on whether such an acqursrtron
rnvolved the "sale" to the employee of
a "security." The private plarntrff rn that
case contended that it did. The District
Court dismissed that portion of hrs cause
of action but the U.S Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit reversed that
determination.
The Supreme Court
thereafter
granted certiorari
and the
Commission appeared amicus as It had
rn the Circuit Court
In the Supreme Court, the Commission contended that, under the proper
mterpretatron of the terms "sale" and
"security"
rn the securities laws and on

the baSIS of principles long established
and consistently applied rn numerous
Supreme Court decistons considenng
the term "rnvestment contract" (one of
the terms rncluded rn the statutory defrrution of the term "secunty' J-c-the acqursitron of an rnterest rn a pension fund
was a sale of a security and, hence, subject to the antifraud
provrsions. The
Cornrrussron's particular concern which
led It to appear amicus was that the defrnrtion of these terms not be constricted
because ItS experience rn administering
the Federal securrtres laws had shown
that unscrupulous persons who sought
to defraud others through promises of
profits had constantly
devised new
schemes rnvolvrng novel Investment vehicles to effectuate their goals. Srnce
Congress, rn enactrng the secuntres
laws, could not anticipate every potential rnvestment vehicle which could be
utilized to commit fraud, the Commission contended that the traditionally
broad construction
given to the term
"rnvestment contract" was a necessary
protection for rnvestors and an accurate
mterpretatron of the secuntres laws. At
the close of the fiscal year, the case was

Nettonet Resources Defense Council
v. SEC- This case arrses out ofthe Commission's determination
not to adopt a
rule proposed by the plaintiffs
They had
requested the Commission to require,
among other things,
publicly-owned
corporations to disclose detailed information concerning the present and potential
environmental
effects of the
corporations'
activities
including
the
nature and extent of the pollution caused
by such activities,
the teasibthty
of
curbing such pollution and the plans
and prospects for Improving relevant
technology.
The Commission
determined not to adopt the proposed rules
for reasons directly related to Its mandate of Investor protection. It was concerned that rules requiring disclosure of
particular categories of information that
would only be material With respect to
some companies and only of Interest to
some Investors would result In disclosure documents that would be so voluminous as to be of less use to Investors
generally. Also, It was concerned that
disclosure requirements not Impose an
unreasonable administrative
burden on
the Commission or excessive costs on
publicly held corporations. The major
action
Issues raised In the plaintiffs'
contesting the Cornrnissron's determination were whether the determination
of the Commission not to adopt the proposed rules was subject to judrcral review and whether the Commission had
acted properly In contrnurng to elrcrt
environmental
Information through ItS
existing rules rather than through the
methods proposed by the plaintiffs.
The Distnct Court ordered the Comrnissron to undertake further rulemaking
proceedings and the Commission appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Crrcuit. On appeal, the Commission contended that
ItS decision not to promu lgate requested

46

rules was proper and moreover, that the
determination IS committed by law to ItS
discretion and not reviewable under the
Administrative
Procedure Act. (Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the
Court of Appeals reversed the District
Court holdrng and upheld the Commission's determination
not to promulgate
the proposed rules on the grounds that
the Cornrnisston's determinations
were
procedurally free from defect and reasonable.)

Bradford National Cleanng Corporation, et al. v. SEC-Bradford raised issues dea ling with the creation of a
national clearing system as required by
of
the secunties Acts Amendments
1975. These amendments directed the
Commission to facilitate the establishment of a national system for clearance
and settlement
of securities transactions having due regard for the maintenance of fair competition
among
brokers and dealers, c1eanng agencies
and transfer agents.
To carry out this broad directive, Congress gave the Commission authority to
register clearing agencies that meet certain specified cntena, including an abiltty to clear and settle securities
transactions
promptly and accurately
and an absence of rules that Impose any
burden on competition not necessary or
appropnate In furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. Without
such registration, or a Commission exemption therefrom,
it is illegal to operate such an agency.
The plaintiffs
in Bradford appealed
from the registration by the Commission
of the National Securities Clearing Corporation as a cleanng agency alleging
that it imperrnissrbly contained certain
monopolistic tendencies, The U.S. Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit, however, affirmed the Commission's action concluding that the Commission had appropriately assessed the
Importance
of the relevant statutory

considerations
and had properly balto be dependable,
stable, efftcrent-sanced the results. The Court concluded , and more rapidly achievable than any
other alternative-rather

Public Utility Holding Companies

Composition
Under the Holding Company Act, the
Commission regulates Interstate public
utility holding company systems engaged In the electnc utility business or
In the retail distnbution
of gas. The
Commission's
jurisdiction
also covers
natural gas pipeline
companies and
nonutilrty companres which are subsidiary companies of registered holding
companies.
There are presently
15 registered
holding company systems with aggregate assets, as of June 20, 1978, of
over $46 million.
In the 15 systems
there are 62 electnc and/or gas utility
subsidiaries, 71 nonutilrty subsldranes,
and 22 inactive cornparues, or a total
of 174 system cornparues, including the
top parent and subholdrng companies.
Table 35 In the Appendix lists the systems and Table 36 lists their aggregate
assets and operating revenues

Financing
Volume--Durlng
fiscal year 1978,
approximately
$3 billion of seruor securities and common stock financing of
the 15 registered systems was approved
by the Commission. Of thrs amount, approximately $2.1 billion was long-term
debt financing, and over $887 million
was for equity tmancing. These amounts
represent a 34 percent Increase In longterm debt financing
over fiscal year

1977 and a 5 percent Increase In the
sale of common and preferred stock. In
addition, the Commission approved over
$4.2 billion of short term debt tmancmg
and $978 million of pollution control
financing for the 15 registered holding
company systems. Table 37 In the Appendix presents the amount and types
of secuntres Issued under the Act by
these holding company systems.

Fuel Programs
Dunng fiscal year 1978, the Commission authorized $184 million of fuel
exploration and development capital expenditures for the holdmg company systems. This autnonzation covers an annual
maximum expenditure for fuel programs
defined on geographical and functional
terms. Table 38 In the Appendix lists
the authonzatron by holding company
system for each fuel program
Largely as a result of the energy crisis.
holdrng companies have embarked on
major and expensive new commitments
to acquire better control over their own
fuel supplies, and these commitments
require substantial additional
capital
Generally, the arrangements Involve formation of several new subsidianes for
producing, transporting
and financmg
fuel supplies or the Investment of caprtal for the exploration of and development drilling for minerai reserves With
a nght to production accruing to such
Investment. Since 1971, the Cornrrus-

49

sron has authorized over $2.2 billion for
fuel programs of holding companies.

Service Company Operations
At the end of calendar year 1977,
there were eleven subsidiary service
companies providing managerial, accounting, administrative and engineering services to eleven of the 15 holding
companies registered under the Act.
The billings for services rendered to the
holding company systems amount to
$363 million or 2.10 percent of the total revenues generated by the electric
and gas operating utilities of the holding
company systems. All services are rendered at cost to the operating utilities,
With several systems Including a return
on capital Invested by the parent holdrng company. Because the subsidrary
service companies are service oriented,

50

they are heavily labor mtensive havmg
10,299 employees and assets of over
$190 million.
DUring the calendar year, the Commission issued a notice of a proposed
amendment to the Uniform System of
Accounts for pubhc utility service companies. The revised system of accounts
will (l) provide for closer coordination
With the Federal Energy Regulatory
Cornrnissron's Uniform System of Accounts for electnc and gas public utilities, (2) facilitate the conduct of audit
and account Inspection programs, and
(3) Improve reports filed by service companies subject to the Act. At the close
of the fiscal year it was expected that
the final rules for the revised system of
accounts would be submitted to the
Commission for approval in January
1979.

Corporate Reorganizations

The Commission's

role under Chapter

X of the Bankruptcy Act, which provides
a procedure for reorganizing corporations In the United States distnct courts,
differs from that under the vanous other
statutes which it administers. The Commission does not initiate Chapter X proceedings or hold ItS own hearings. and
It has no authonty to determine any of
the Issues In such proceedings
The
Commission participates In proceedings
under Chapter X to provide independent, expert assistance to the courts, participants,
and Investors In a highly
complex area of corporate law and finance. It pays special attention to the
Interest of public security holders who
may not otherwise be represented effectively.
Where the scheduled Indebtedness of
a debtor corporation exceeds $3 million, Section 172 of Chapter X requires
the court, before approving any plan of
reorganization, to submit It to the Commission for its examination and report
If the Indebtedness does not exceed
$3 million, the court may, If It deems
It advisable to do so, submit the plan to
the-Cornrnrssion before decrdrng whether
to approve it. When the Commission
flies a report, copies or summanes must
be sent to all secunty holders and credrtors when they are asked to vote on the
plan. The Commission has no authonty
to veto a plan of reorgaruzatron or to requrre ItS adoption

The Commission has not considered
It necessary or appropnate to participate
In every Chapter X case. Apart from the
excessive administrative
burden, many
of the cases Involve only trade or bank
creditors and few public Investors. The
Commission seeks to participate pnncrpally In those proceedings in which a
substantial
publrc Investor Interest IS
Involved. However, the Commission may
also participate because: 0) an unfair
plan has been or IS about to be proposed; (2) public security holders are
not represented adequately; (3) the reorganization proceedings are being conducted
In Violation
of Important
provrsrons of the Act; (4) the facts indicate that the Cornrnission can perform
a useful service; or (5) the court requests the Commission's participation
The Cornrnissron In ItS Chapter X activities has divided the country Into four
geographical areas. The New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle regional
offices of the Commission each have responsibihty for one of these areas Supervision and review of the regional
offices' Chapter X work IS the responsibility of the DIVISion of Corporate Regu latron of the Comm rssion wh ich, through
Its Branch of ReorganizatIOn,
also
serves
as a field
office
for the
southeastern area of the United States
Dunng the fiscal year, the Commission entered SIXnew Chapter X proceed-

51

ings involving companies with aggregate
stated assets of approximately $165
million and aggregate Indebtedness of
approximately $127 million. Including
the new proceedings. the Commission
was a party In a total of 118 reorgaruzatron proceedings during the fiscal year
(a list of these proceedings appears In

52

Table 39 In the Appendix of thrs report).
The stated assets of the companies involved in these proceedings totaled approximately $5.7 billion and their
indebtedness about $5.1 billion.
During the fiscal year 24 proceedings
were closed, leaving 94 In which the
Commission was a party at year end.

Administration and Management

In FY 1978, the Commission Improved both Its planning capabilities
and Internal management systems In
order to increase the effectiveness of Its
programs and to provide better service
to the public. No major organizational
changes were undertaken
Rather, the
focus was on managing the current organization In order to make It function
more effectively.

Information Systems Management
The Commission took several important steps toward Improving ItS Information handling processes In 1978.
The Commission received authority from
the General Services Administration
to
replace its ten-year old computer with
an IBM 360-65. A three-year lease was
awarded, allowmg the Commission time
to complete
a comprehensive
study
aimed at Identifying possible new computer applications,
delineating
the
agency's ADP requirements and speerfymg the characteristics
and configuration needed to address present and
contemplated needs. In addition, a prototype-teleprocessing
network was established linking the Atlanta and Los
Angeles regional offices with the central
computer facility.
A comprehensive information system
requirements analysis was completed,
as planned, providing a blueprint for information system development activrties to be undertaken over the next

several years. In conjunction with thrs
analysis, work began late In 1978 to formulate functional specifications for the
computer
processing capability
that
would be required to support all of the
Commission's information systems over
the next 5 to 8 year period This task IS
expected to be completed during the
first quarter of 1979.
Significant progress was made during
1978 toward the development of several
new information systems and the enhancement of certain exrstrng systems.
In the administrative area, the new Staff
Time and Actrvrty Tracking
System
(STATS) now provides the Commission
With an expanded and Improved means
to record the work activity of every Commission employee on a continual basis.
Categories of Information have been established to conform With and generate
information useful in preparing ZBB and
congressional budget justifrcatrons
The
system also allows for the production of
certain staff time and activity reports
required by various levels of SEC management. These reports serve as a basis
for manpower planning and provide for
Improved utilization of scarce personnel
resources. Other new systems were developed to maintain the Commission's
personnel records and position management data. Apart from Improving the integrity of the data base and reducrng
manual preparation of forms, these systems provide, for the first time, a means

53

of conducting personnel research and
analysis on a prompt, low cost basis.
In the area of financial management,
the Commission
initiated several Important processing changes In both
budget and accounting systems. Most
significantly,
development
of a Case
and Activities Tracking System (CATS)
was also Initiated In 1978. Thrs system
Will provide the Commission
With a
means of rnorutonng active Investigations and litigation, as well as rulemakmg and special projects. It Will give the
Chairman, the Commission, the Executive Director, drvisron directors and regional administrators the ability to track
the progress of open cases by means of
Identifiable milestones. In addition, authonzed personnel Will be able to inquire Into current case status, access
case-related documentation,
and obtain
related or similar case history and settlement information
In an effort to make more eftrcrent use
of exrstrng information systems through
better utrlrzatron
of ItS upgraded computing capabilities, the Commission inmated the expansion of ItS Name and
Relationship
Search System This innovation Will provide the staff With a facility for Immediate terminal access to
an Index of name and associated data
Oil companies and mdrviduals
having a
direct or indirect relationship with the
Commission.
Thrs on-line access replaces a system of manual requests
which often required several days of
processing.
Operational testing of a major comprehensive records management system
was also begun In 1978. Thrs system,
utrhzrng microform and teleprocessing
techniques, Will provide the staff With
the capability for directly entering and
retrieving information relating to the receipt and disposition of various reports
filed with the Cornrnrssron.
It Will also
provide for quick access to information
being maintained on microfilm.
Even-

54

tually, this system Will be expanded under a consolidated data base concept
and will include relevant data on all entities required to register with and report
to the Commission.
Apart from Improved file integrity,
speedy retrieval
and greater availability of data, the new
system marks the beginning of the end
for the millions of pages of paper normally added to the Commission's voluminous officral files each year Full
operation of the first phase was scheduled for early In 1979

Market Surveillance System
DUring the fiscal year, the Commission conducted a feasibrlrty study and
Initiated the design of a comprehensive
market surveillance system In consultation With the firm of Monchlk-Weber
Associates, Inc. The study represents a
concerted effort by the Cornrnission to
examine and modernize the information
resources used In ItS administration
of
the Federal secuntres laws through enhanced application
of advanced comrnurucations and computer technology.
The feasibility study entailed extensive analysis of the current market surveillance system and techniques With a
view toward establishing a comprehensive market surveillance system which
would monitor all secuntres market activrtres by reference to specified Violations of self-regulatory organization rules
and the Federal securities laws The
study encompassed fact-gathering and
procedural documentation
of a representative cross section of orgamzations
Involved In both the conduct of securities trad mg and the regulatory processes
related to all market activities.
It examined the option, equity, and bond
exchanges, the over-the-counter
market, and the various regulated components and facilities Within those markets.
The activrtres of major classes of market
participants such as retail member firms,
floor members of national secunties ex-

changes, investment advisors, investment companies and related institutions,
clearing agencies and transfer agents
were examined to determine the best
manner In which to Integrate such activities Into the comprehensive surveillance system.
Other governmental
regulatory bodies were also contacted to
reduce possible regulatory overlap The
study has, thus far, made several recommendations
directed at enhancing
the effectiveness of the Commission's
regulatory, oversight, and enforcement
functions. The study was, at the close
of the fiscal year, In the design phase
of ItS effort which IS scheduled to be
completed by April 30, 1979
The proposed market surveillance
system is not Intended to replace or diminish the existing regulatory responsibtlrtres of the various self-regulatory
organizations
Rather It IScontemplated
that the market surveillance system Will
Integrate exrstmg trad mg information
from the various markets at one location, so that the Commission may better
rnorutor trading practices both for oversight and enforcement
purposes as
well as for analysis of self-regulatory
organization rule proposals and revrsion
of Commission rules. In this manner,
the Commission's oversight capabilities
Will be greatly enhanced by making possible more effective dally coordination
with all of the nation's secuntres markets. The proposed system also represents the first attempt ever to correlate
current information from all exchanges
and self-regulatory
organizations In a
manner designed to detect possible secunties violations
The system Will include among ItS Input sources such
Commission filings as. Forms 3,4, 144,
and 146; Schedule 130, 140, and
13G; penodic filings and reports of broker-dealers; dally trading and clearing
information; and corporate news
The system Will facihtate other exrsting Commission functions such as the

inspection and regulation of self-regulatory organizations and the examination of broker-dealers.
The proposed
system will be geared also to accommodate developments
In the evolvrng
national market system For the system
to be completely successful, It IS contemplated that It Will be necessary for
the self-regulatory organizations to move
toward eventual standardization of certain trading and clearing information
Such changes, however, Will be planned
In conjunction With development of the
national market system.
The system IS expected to be Implemented over a five-year period, dependmg upon Industry developments,
the
pace at which trading Information can
be standardized, and the availability of
government funding
By building upon
existmg Industry and self-regulatory automated systems, the system cost will
be relatively modest In comparison to
communications
and computer systems
created In recent years elsewhere In government or In private Industry The comprehensive market surveillance system,
when Implemented, will represent a significant Improvement In the Industry's
and the Commission's regulatory information systems

Financial Management
The Commission collects fees for the
regrstration
of secuntres.
secunties
transactions on national secunties exchanges, and miscellaneous filings, reports and applications
In fiscal year
1978, the Cornrnrssron collected $26 1
million dollars In fees; this represents
approximately
42 percent of the total
funds appropriated by the Congress for
Cornrrnssron operations
The Office of the Executive Director
IS currently conducting a major study of
all fees collected by the Cornrrussron
Thrs study Will address such Issues as
the burden upon registrants and Investors, the relationship between existmg

55

fees and Commission costs, the surtabrhty of exrstrng fees, fee collection procedures and the Impact of fees on the
business community
The staff will submit ItS recommendations
dunng 1979
The development of a comprehensive
financial
management
reporting and
budgeting system was begun In 1978
by the Offices of the Comptroller and
Data Processing under the coordination
of the Office of the Executive Director
The system IS designed to automate and
Integrate accounting and budgeting activities previously administered individually and manually. The long-term goal
IS the linking of the financial management systems Into a larger agency-wide
administrative management system. The
reasons for the Commission's focus on
the financial management system are:
It will facilitate the timely preparation
of complex reports and analyses which
will be tailored to meet the needs and
mandates of controlling agencies and of
the Cornrrussron's Internal management
structure; and It will provide structured
policy planning and review techniques
at a program level.

Personnel Management
On September 30, 1978, the Comrrussron's permanent personnel strength
was 2,009. Approximately two-thirds of
these personnel were assigned to Commission headquarters
In Washington,
D C.; the remaining one-third were employed In the seventeen regional and
branch offices located In major national
and regional financial centers throughout the United States.
DUring 1978, personnel management
activities at the Commission stressed
the increasing Importance of managing
personnel resources more efficiently, as
reflected In several new programs designed to enhance the management of
human resources.
One of the Cornrnissron's Important
initiatives has been the launching of a

56

cornprehensive
promotion
appraisal
program under the sponsorship of the
Civil Service Commission The research
psychologists assigned to this project by
CSC Will Initially collect task data and
behavroral statements for all major attorney functions, with the objective of
developing data needed to Implement
an interim performance evaluation program In 1979. This data Will then be
refined, other major job categories Will
be brought into the program, and the
research team Will be expected to present the Comrrussron with a validated
promotion appraisal system In 1980.
DUring this period, the Cornrrussion may
also seek the assistance of outside consultants, to work with the CIVil Service
team In putting a useful performance
appraisal system Into place at the earliest possible time. Such a system,
when operational,
Will provide an informed and validated basis for making
personnel
dectsrons,
I.e., Initiating
manpower planning,
provrdrng career
counselling, establishing executive development requirements and Improving
recru itrnent efforts.
In order to make the best use of inhouse talent, as well as to enhance ItS
affirmative action efforts, the Commission Initiated ItS first formal upward
mobility program. This was designed to
Identify high-potential
employees
In
lower grade clerical and technical jobs
and develop them for advancement Into
targeted professronal and administrative POSitions. Twelve employees were
selected for particrpatron In the 1978
program, which Will become an annual
feature of the Cornrnrssron's overall personnel effort.
In order to make the upward mobility
program stili more meaningful,
the
Cornrrussron established a career counseling program Oriented toward applicants who were not selected for entry
Into the upward mobility program. A series of workshops was conducted both

to help these mdrvrduals develop career
goals and to better enable them to prepare themselves to qualify for future vacancies.
In another important area, the Comrrussion Increased ItS senior executive
and managerial training by 30 percent,
and Increased both ItS tumon assistance
and In-house training programs by 20
percent dunng 1978. Thrs was supported by an Increase in the quality of
all training activrtres Cornrrussron-wrde
The Cornrnrssron has continued
to
emphasize the recruitment and full utilization of handicapped persons. Its efforts in this area have been recognized
by the CIVil Service Commission as one
of the more aggressive and effective In
the Federal service, and have served as
a model for use by other agencies In
addition to ItS focus on recrurtrnent, the
Commission has sought to eliminate attrtudinal, environmental and procedural
barriers to the employment of handicapped persons. Important steps include obtaining contracts for the services
of Interpreters for the deaf and readers
for the blind; signing major Commission
events, such as the annual Awards Ceremony, for heanng Impaired employees;
brarllmg location and directional signs;
purchasing
telecommunications
devices for use by deaf employees and the
deaf community and those With speech
Impairments; and developing a continuing program to train supervisors and
employees in sign language to allow
heanng-rrnparred workers to communicate more effectively With their co-workers and
supervisors.
The
SEC
headquarters
building has also been
made accessible to handicapped VISItors and employees.
In an effort to be more responsive to
the concerns and problems of ItS employees, the Commission has also established a more effective employee
counseling program. Towards this end,
the Office of Personnel established a

centralized branch to advrse staff members of rights, benefits and obligations
regarding such matters as health benefits, life Insurance, retirement, career
development,
and alcohol and drug
abuse.

Equal Employment Opportunity
Overall, the number of women employees In the Commission Increased by
8 percent during 1978. Women attorneys In the Commission Increased from
105 In September 1977, to 123-approximately a 17 percent Increase Of
the 659 attorneys employed, there was
a nse of 2 2 percent In the number of
women attorneys and a 4.2 percent nse
In the number of rrunorrty attorneys over
the previous year.
The Committee on Equal Employment
Opportunity,
consisting of representatives of the secuntres Industry and the
SEC, published a handbook on equal
employment and affirmative action plans
which was distnbuted
throughout the
secuntres Industry. The purpose of the
handbook IS to Inform securrtres industry employers about equal employment
laws and to assist them In achrevrng voluntary compliance. The committee also
raised $14,000
for the initiation of a
college scholarship program for black
students. The scholarship
program IS
expected to eventually be expanded to
Include women and other rrunontres

Activity under the Freedom of
Information Act
Cornrrussron rules Implementing
the
Freedom of Information Act provide that
the public can Inspect or obtain copies
of records maintained by the SEC, With
the exception of certain specified categories of information
In 1978, the
Commission received 1,252 requests
for information,
up 13 percent from
1977.
While most information flied by registered companies
has always been

57

available for inspection by the publrc,
the public was historically denied access to certain categories of material,
notably investigatory records Pursuant
to various FOIA requests dunng 1978,
the Commission has made available for
public inspection many records which
previously had been considered confidential. Among these records are portions of the broker-dealer manual and
the entire Investment advisers and investment company inspection manuals,
the summary of administrative interpretations under the Securities Act of 1933,
and the Commission's periodic Securities Violations Bulletin
Moreover, the
Commission has made available, pursuant to particular FOIA requests, staff
letters of comment on registration statements and other filings and Well Committee subrrussions.

Office Space Activities
One of the Commission's most serious
operational shortcomings IS In the area
of space The Commission headquarters
expanded Into two floors of the former
Federal Home Loan Bank Board BUildmg In the Spring of 1978 Acqursrtion
of this additional space has provided
some relief from the overcrowded conditions at the main headquarters buildmg. but It has also resulted In a less
efficient and more costly dispersion of
personnel among three burldrngs The
Commission IS contrnumg ItS efforts to
acquire a single buildmg In Washington
large enough to house ItS entire headquarters operations

Self-Regulatory Organizations-Revenues and Expenses
The high trading volume dunng the
first three quarters of 1978 provides an
opportunity to examine how changes In
trading volume Improve each self-regulatory organization's financial results.
As a result of the record high trading
volume in the second and third quarters
of 1978, exchange share volume for the
first nine months was 3.2 percent higher
than the figure for all of 1977. The revenue increase was not as dramatic.
Through the first three quarters of 1978,
revenue was, however, running 8 percent higher than for the same period In
1977. Because operating costs are
largely fixed the growth in revenue dramatically improved pre-tax Income.
For the first nine months of 1978, the
national securities exchanges and the
NASD enjoyed combined pre-tax income of nearly $26 million, more than
double the $12.7 million generated
during all of 1977.
The NYSE derives 44 percent of its
revenue from its volume related transaction and depository fees. Relatively
fixed sources of revenue such as listing
fees paid by corporations, and communications fees and membership dues
paid by brokers generate 45 percent of
revenue and miscellaneous sources account for 11 percent. Pre-tax Income
through September 1978, at $15.5
million, was already 45 percent higher
than 1977 results.
The Amex generates only 22 percent
of Its revenue from volume-related
transaction fees Its listing and communication fees and membership dues,
however, all generated revenue at a
higher annual rate in 1978 than 1977.
Pre-tax Income for the first nine months
of 1978 was nearly triple the 1977 annual figure.
Trading volume In listed and unlisted
Issues over-the-counter was 52 percent

76

above the 1977 pace through September 1978. NASD revenue, however, is
derived from sources which do not vary
with trading volume. Registration, corporate finance and listing fees together
with membership dues generate 87 percent of revenue. Nine-month 1978 revenue was consequently about threefourths of 1977 annual revenue. Pre-tax
income slipped In 1978. The nine-month
figure was only about one-third of 1977's
annual results.
With the registration of the NSCC In
1977, most transactions executed on
the NYSEand Amex and In the over-thecounter market began to be cleared
through this clearing agency. The three
organizations thus no longer have clearing costs and generate only a small
amount of revenue from services performed for the clearing agency. The operating surplus from the clearing agency's
operation is returned to its members in
the form of fee rebates.
The MSE discontinued Its unprofitable broker service bureau in 1978 and
total 1978 revenue was reduced. Nearly
73 percent of revenue IS stili volumerelated, however, and the combined effects of the discontinued losses and the
growth in trading volume have resulted
In pre-tax Income of $724,000 through
September, 1978. Pre-tax losses were
over $1 million in 1977.
The PSE, Phlx and SSE also depend
heavily on volume-related fees. Sixty-six
percent of PSE and 80 percent of both
Phlx and SSE revenue comes from these
sources. The record trading volume has
raised PSE's pre-tax Income to a ninemonth level nearly ten times as high as
the 1977 annual figure. The comparable nine-month Phlx and SSE pre-tax
Income figure is nearly seven times as
large as the previous year's annual results.
The CSOE ISdependent upon volumerelated sources for 65 percent of ItSrevenue. A pre-tax loss of $580,000 In

1977 became pre-tax profit of over$2.2
million in the nine months of 1978.
The CSE, which began an electronic
trading experiment
In 1978, now receives less in floor usage revenue and
more in communications
fees. Its 1978
revenues were higher than the previous
year but profitability
comparisons were
unfavorable for this small exchange.
The ISE In Salt Lake City, and the
SSE appear to be unaffected by the factors which influence the other orgaruzations.
The MSRB Income of $678,476
during fiscal year 1978 (See Table 12) was
derrved prrmarily from three fees established by rules adopted under the Exchange Act. Municipal secunties brokers
and municipal securities dealers are assessed (1) an initial fee of $100, (2) an
underwriting
assessment fee equal to
.001 percent of the face value of all
rnunicrpat secuntres they purchase from
an Issuer as part of a new Issue which
has a final stated maturity of not less
than two years from the date of the secunties, and (3) an annual fee of $100
which can be offset by underwntmg fees
paid Within the calendar year. The underwriting assessment fee accounted for
75.7 percent of the MSRB Income during fiscal year 1978. The balance of
MSRB income was from other fees and
interest income.
During fiscal year 1978, the MSRB
had total expenses of $854,703.
The
major expense items were staff salaries
and employee benefits, including MSRB
contribution to an employee retirement
plan established In 1978 (44 percent);
meetings and travel (24.8 percent); and
mailing list, rule manual, postage and
other prrnting (15.5 percent). Expenses
exceeded income by $176,227,
due, in
part, to a Significant reduction in assessment fees received. As of September 30, 1978, the MSRB had a surplus
of $908,186.
Aggregate cleanng agency revenues

Increased approximately $9 million in
1977 to approximately
$103 million.
Aggregate clearing agency operating expenses Increased In excess of $10 million, or 12 percent over 1976.
NSCC had an increase in clearing revenues over Its predecessors' combined
1976 revenues of 17 percent, or $5
million, to approximately
$35 million
(including an $800,000
loss resulting
from the Insolvency of one of ItS clearing
members and approximately $3.6 million in regulatory fees to the NYSE,
Amex and the NASD). These regulatory
fees were for services consisting prrncipalty of exarrunatron, rnorutonng and
investigation of financial and operating
conditions of existing and prospective
clearing members and notification
of
unusual market conditions which may
affect secunties clearing .
When Boston Stock Exchange Clearrng Corporation and New England Securities Depository Trust Company, both
wholly owned subsidiarres of the BSE,
are combined for purposes of analysis,
their revenue increased $77,000 while
expenses Increased $87,000.
While Bradford Securities Processing
Service, Inc 's clearing and other revenues Increased by $1.6 million and
$1.1 million, respectively, ItS expenses
Increased by $2.6 rrullron.
The Depository Trust Company revenues Increased 8 percent to $33.3 million while Its expenses Increased a like
amount to $33.3 million.
The Midwest Clearrng Corporation experrenced a 7 percent decline In clearmg services revenues while its expenses
Increased 14 percent. The Midwest Securrties Trust Company had a 5 percent
increase in depository servrces revenues
and a 7 percent Increase In expenses.
Pacific Clearing Corporation also experienced a substantial
decrease In
clearing services revenues With a 15
percent decline while its total expenses
remained about the same. The Paciftc

77

Secuntres Depository Trust Company
had a 3 percent decline In depository
services revenues while expenses increased by 8 percent.
Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia also experienced a decline in
clearing services revenues with a decrease of 4 percent while expenses decreased by 2 percent.

78

The Options Clearing Corporation's
total revenues increased 1 percent as
did its expenses.
TAD Depository Corporation, which
ceased dorng business early in 1978,
had an increase in revenues from
$307,000 to $495,000 while its expenses increased from $287,000 to
$466,000.

Rule 12g3-2
provides various exernptrons from the registration provisions of Section 12(g) of the Exchange
Act for the securities of foreign private
Issuers. Perhaps the most Important of
these IS that contained In subparagraph
(b), which provides an exemption for
certain foreign Issuers which submit, on
a current basis, material specified In the
rule. Such material Includes that information about which Investors ought reasonbly to be Informed and which the
issuer. (1) has made public pursuant to
the law of the country of domicile or In
which It IS Incorporated or organized;
(2) has filed with a foreign stock exchange on which its secuntres are traded
and which was made public by such exchange; and/or (3) has distributed to its
security holders. Periodically, the Commission publishes a list of those foreign

85

issuers which appear to be current under this exemptive provision. The most
current list is as of July 31, 1978 and
contains a total of 152 foreign issuers.

STOCKHOLDINGS OF
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND
OTHERS
At year-end 1977, the eleven institutional groups listed below held $342.4
billion of total corporate stock outstanding (both common and preferred). In
comparison, they accounted for $375.2
billion of the stock held a year earlier.
The resulting 8.7 percent decrease In
the value of the stockholdrngs of these
institutions was more than the 6.1 per-

cent decline In the aggregate market
value of all stock outstanding. Thus, the
share of total stock outstanding that was
held by these institutions declined to
34.4 percent at year-end 1977 from
35.4 percent a year earlier. During
1977, the shares held by other domestic Investors, whrch consist of indivrduals, broker-dealers and institutions not
listed, rose to 60.0 percent from 58.6
percent. Foreign Investors,share of
stockholdmgs remained at 6.0 percent

effective. The number of effective registratlons in fiscal 1978 rose 3.9 percent from fiscal 1977. The decrease In
the dollar value is due to a change in
reporting the registrations of investment
companies necessitated by a change in
the rules of the Securities Act of 1933.

company registrations continue to be

ENFORCEMENT
Types of Proceedings
As the table below reflects, the secunties laws provide for a wide range of
enforcement actions by the Commission. The Most common types of actions
are injunctive proceedings Instituted In
the Federal district courts to enjoin continued or threatened securities law VI-

olators, and administrative proceedings
pertaining to broker-dealer firms and/or
mdrviduals associated with such firms
which may lead to various remedial
sanctions as required In the public interest. When an injunction IS entered by
a court, violatron of the court's decree
is a basis for Criminal contempt action
against the violator.

Trading Suspensions
DUring fiscal 1978, the Commission
suspended trading In the secunties of
86 companies, a decrease of 22 percent
from the III secuntres suspended In
fiscal 1977 and a 32 percent decrease
from the 126 securrtres suspended In
fiscal 1976. Of the 86 companies whose
securities were the subject of trading
suspensions In fiscal 1978, 38 were
suspended because of delinquency
In
filing required reports with the Commission. In most other Instances, the
trading suspension was ordered either
because of substantial questions as to
the adequacy, accuracy or availability
of public Information
concerning the
company's financial condition or bustness operations, or because of transactions in the company's
securities
suggesting possible manipulations
or
other violations.

Foreign Restricted List
The Commission maintains and publishes a Foreign Restricted List which
IS designed to put broker-dealers, financial institutions, Investors and others on
notice of unlawful distribution of foreign
securities In the United States. The list
consists of names of foreign companies
whose securities the Commission has
reason to believe have been, or are
being, offered for public sale In the
United States In violation of the registration requirements of Section 5 of the
Securities Act. The offer and sale of unregistered securities deprives Investors
of all the protections afforded by the
Securities Act, including the right to receive a prospectus containing the information required by the Act for the
purpose of enabling the Investor to determine whether the Investment IS SUItable for him. While most broker-dealers
refuse to effect transactions In securities Issued by companies on the Foreign
Restricted trst, trus does not necessar-

ily prevent promoters from Illegally offering such secuntres directly to Investors
In the United States by mail, by telephone, and sometimes by personal solicrtatron
DUring the past fiscal year,
two corporations were added to the Foreign Restricted List, bringing the total
number of corporations on the list to
101. The following company was added
dunng the year:
Empreste Minera Cauda/osa de Panama, S.A.- The Commission received
information that Ernpresia Minera Caudalosa de Panama, S A., a Panamanian
corporation, had been engaged In offermg and seiling In the United States instruments purporting to be options to
buy secuntres, or Instruments appearing
to represent secunties
No registration
statement under the Securities Act of
1933 had been filed With the Commission covering any of these Instruments,
so that these offers and sales may be In
violation of Section 5 of the Securities
Act of 1933.
