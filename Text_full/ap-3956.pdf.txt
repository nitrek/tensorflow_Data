The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on May 13, 2016, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The

James A. McGurk, Esq., appeared for Respondent.
Consistent with 17 C.F.R. § 201.161 and with the consent of the Division, the due date for
Respondent’s Answer to the OIP was postponed to July 12, 2016. The Division was granted
leave to file a motion for summary disposition pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.250, due on July 22,
2016. Respondent’s opposition and the Division’s reply will be due on August 12 and 19, 2016,
respectively. Respondent may file a motion for summary disposition according to the same
schedule if he desires.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
