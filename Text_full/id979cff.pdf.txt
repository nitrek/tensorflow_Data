INITIAL DECISION
March 15, 2016

E. Barrett Atwood for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission
George C. Harris, Su-Han Wang, and Carl H. Loewenson, Jr., of
Morrison & Foerster LLP for Respondent Maher F. Kara

BEFORE:

Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision bars Maher F. Kara from the securities industry with a right to reapply
after three years. He was previously convicted of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit
securities fraud and enjoined against violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Procedural Background
The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on September 10, 2015, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange
Act. The proceeding is a follow-on proceeding based on SEC v. Kara, No. 3:09-cv-1880 (N.D. Cal.),
in which Kara was enjoined against violations of the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act, and
United States v. Kara, No. 3:09-cr-417 (N.D. Cal.), in which Kara was convicted of securities fraud
and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. In accordance with leave granted, the parties timely
filed a joint stipulation of facts and cross-motions for summary disposition, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. §
201.250(a). See Maher F. Kara, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3171, 2015 SEC LEXIS 3950
(A.L.J. Sept. 28, 2015).

This Initial Decision is based on the pleadings, the parties’ Joint Stipulation of Facts,1 and
Kara’s Amended Answer to the OIP. There is no genuine issue with regard to any fact that is
material to this proceeding. All material facts that concern the activities for which Kara was
convicted were decided against him in the criminal and civil cases on which this proceeding is
based. Any other facts in his pleadings have been taken as true, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a).
All arguments and proposed findings and conclusions that are inconsistent with this decision were
considered and rejected.
B. Allegations and Arguments of the Parties
The OIP alleges that Kara was convicted of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit
securities fraud in United States v. Kara, and enjoined against violations of the antifraud provisions
in SEC v. Kara. The Division of Enforcement urges that he be permanently barred from the
securities industry. Kara opposes this, arguing that, at most, a three-year broker-dealer bar is an
appropriate sanction.
C. Procedural Issues
1. Official Notice
Official notice pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.323 is taken of the docket report and the courts’
orders in United States v. Kara and SEC v. Kara.
2. Related Case
The United States Supreme Court has granted certiorari in a case arising out of the facts
underlying SEC v. Kara and United States v. Kara. Salman v. United States, No. 15-628, 2016 WL
207256 (U.S. Jan. 19, 2016). Kara believes that a Supreme Court decision favorable to the
petitioner would eliminate the basis of Kara’s conviction and injunction, and thus, this
administrative proceeding. If this occurs, Kara can request the Commission to vacate any sanctions
ordered in this proceeding (or to dismiss the proceeding, if it is still pending).2
1

Exhibits in the Joint Stipulation of Facts are documents from SEC v. Kara and United States v.
Kara and related cases, including Kara’s plea agreement and the transcript of his July 6, 2011,
change of plea hearing in United States v. Kara (ECF Nos. 134 [viewed in SEC v. Kara, ECF No.
138] and 145 – Exs. 6 and 7, respectively) and Kara’s consent and injunction in SEC v. Kara (ECF
Nos. 138 [which includes United States v. Kara, ECF No. 251, Kara’s judgment] and 145 – Exs. 8
and 9, respectively.)

3. Commission’s Authority
Kara urges these affirmative defenses: “The Commission lacks authority to conduct the
proceedings herein” and “This administrative proceeding is unconstitutional.” However, Exchange
Act Section 15(b) specifically authorizes a follow-on proceeding such as this one based on a
respondent’s injunction or conviction for violation of the antifraud provisions. Further, the
Commission has recently affirmed the constitutionality of its administrative proceedings. See
Raymond J. Lucia Cos., Exchange Act Release No. 75837, 2015 SEC LEXIS 3628, at *76-90 (Sept.
3, 2015), appeal pending, No. 15-1345 (D.C. Cir., filed Oct. 5, 2015); accord Timbervest, LLC,

Bandimere, Securities Act of 1933 Release No. 9972, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4472, at *74-86 (Oct. 29,
2015).
4. Statute of Limitations
Kara argues that the proceeding is barred because it was not brought within the five-year
statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 2462.3 This argument fails. The proceeding was
initiated within five years of the August 21, 2015, injunction in SEC v. Kara and the December 22,
2014, conviction in United States v. Kara.4 Kara argues that since the violative conduct ended in

before Commission, reversed certain convictions and vacated and remanded other convictions, all
of which were basis for OIP); Kenneth E. Mahaffy, Jr., Exchange Act Release No. 68462, 2012
SEC LEXIS 4020 (Dec. 18, 2012) (vacating bar issued in follow-on administrative proceeding
where court of appeals, after Commission had issued bar order, vacated criminal conviction that
was basis for proceeding).
3

Recently, the Commission declared its non-acquiescence to the ruling of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in Johnson v. SEC, 87 F.3d 484, 488-92 (D.C. Cir. 1996), that
sanctions such as associational bars are subject to the statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. §
2462. Timbervest, 2015 SEC LEXIS 3854, at *55-56 & n.71.
4

Even if Kara’s July 6, 2011, guilty plea in United States v. Kara is construed as a “conviction” –
see Gregory Bartko, Exchange Act Release No. 71666, 2014 SEC LEXIS 841, at *28 (Mar. 7,
2014) (construing a jury verdict to be a conviction for the purpose of the Exchange Act) – the
relevant statute of limitations is ten years from the date of the conviction, as expressly provided by
Exchange Act Section 15(b)(6)(A)(ii). The five-year limitation of 28 U.S.C. § 2462 does not apply
when the period for commencing proceedings has been “otherwise provided by Act of Congress.”
Gregory Bartko, 2014 SEC LEXIS 841, at *33 (holding that the ten-year limitations period of
Section 15(b)(6)(A)(ii), not the five-year period of § 2462, applies in a follow-on proceeding based
on a criminal conviction); Frederick W. Wall, Exchange Act Release No. 52467, 2005 SEC LEXIS
2380, at *9 (Sept. 19, 2005) (same). Further, acts outside the statute of limitations may be
considered to establish a respondent’s motive, intent, or knowledge in committing violations that
are within the statute of limitations. Sharon M. Graham, Exchange Act Release No. 40727, 1998
SEC LEXIS 2598, at *41 n.47 (Nov. 30, 1998) (citing Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) and Local Lodge No.
1424 v. NLRB, 362 U.S. 411 (1960)), aff’d, 222 F.3d 994 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Terry T. Steen,
3

2007, the proceeding is untimely because it was not brought within five years, noting that Exchange
Act Section 15(b)(6)(A)(i) authorizes the Commission to bar a person who “has committed or
omitted any act, or is subject to an order or finding, enumerated in [Section 15(b)(4)](A), (D), or
(E).” However, the instant proceeding is not authorized by those sections but rather by Exchange
Act Sections 15(b)(6)(A)(ii), (iii) and 15(b)(4)(B)(i), (C).
5. Collateral Bar
Kara urges that a collateral bar would be an impermissible retroactive application of the
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 since his
misconduct ended before the July 22, 2010, effective date of the Dodd-Frank Act. He notes that
this proceeding was instituted pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15(b), that he was associated with
a broker-dealer only, and that, prior to Dodd-Frank, the Exchange Act had no provision for
collateral bars. Thus, Kara argues, the undersigned has no authority to bar him from anyone other
than a broker-dealer. Kara cites Koch v. SEC, 793 F.3d 147, 157-58 (D.C. Cir. 2015), pet. for
rehearing en banc denied, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 16375 (Sept. 14, 2015), pet. for cert. filed, No.
15-78 (U.S. Dec. 14, 2015), in support of this argument. However, Koch is consistent with
sanctioning Kara with a collateral bar that consists of a bar from association with any broker, dealer,
investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent; the court allowed such a bar to
stand against Respondent Koch, who was associated with an investment adviser only. The court
ruled, however, that imposing bars from association with any municipal advisor or nationally
recognized statistical rating organization would be an impermissible retroactive application of new
sanctions provided by the Dodd-Frank Act.
II. FINDINGS OF FACT
Kara was convicted, on his plea of guilty, of one count of conspiracy, in violation of 18
U.S.C. § 371, and one count of securities fraud, in violation of 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78ff, in
United States v. Kara. Stip. Ex. 6, Stip. Ex. 7, Stip. Ex. 8 at Ex. B; United States v. Kara, ECF Nos.
134, 145, 251 at 1.5 He was sentenced to three years of probation and three months of home
confinement. United States v. Kara, ECF No. 251 at 2-3, ECF No. 277 at 18;6 Stip. at 10. Between
the July 6, 2011, date of his guilty plea and the December 2014 date of his sentencing, and pursuant
to his plea agreement, Kara provided cooperation with the government, which resulted in his
testifying at the trials of his brother-in-law Bassam Salman and of Salman’s brother-in-law Karim
Bayyouk. Stip. at 9-10. The court imposed the relatively light sentence, in part, because of Kara’s

Exchange Act Release No. 40055, 1998 SEC LEXIS 1033, at *13-15 & n.16 (June 1,1998) (citing
H.P. Lambert Co. v. Sec’y of the Treasury, 354 F.2d 819, 822 (1st Cir. 1965)). Also, such acts may
be considered in determining the appropriate sanction if violations are proven. Steen, 1998 SEC
LEXIS 1033, at *13.

“extraordinary cooperation . . . which required him to prolong his sentencing process and participate
in . . . two trials, a number of proffers and the difficulty of circumstances of having to testify against
relatives.” United States v. Kara, ECF No. 277 at 19. The court also noted that Kara “did not
engage in trades for personal gain and gained nothing from this in terms of any monetary
enrichment.” Id., ECF No. 277 at 20. In limiting the probation period to three years, the court
stated, “There’s no need to extend probation beyond that. I think it’s unlikely that Mr. Kara would
recommit any similar offense.” Id., ECF No. 277 at 18.
Kara was enjoined, on consent, in SEC v. Kara from committing violations of Exchange Act
Sections 10(b) and 14(e) and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 on August 21, 2015. Stip. Exs. 8, 9; SEC v.
Kara, ECF Nos. 138, 145. In his July 2, 2015, Consent, Kara affirmatively stated that “in any
disciplinary proceeding before the Commission based on the entry of the injunction in this action,
[he] understands that he shall not be permitted to contest the factual allegations of the complaint in
this action.” Further, he stated that he “understands and agrees to comply with . . . the
Commission’s policy ‘not to permit a defendant . . . to consent to a judgment . . . that imposes a
sanction while denying the allegations . . . in the complaint.’” Finally, he agreed he “will not take
any action or make or permit to be made any public statement denying, directly or indirectly, any
allegation in the complaint or creating the impression that the complaint is without factual basis”
and “hereby withdraws any papers filed in this action to the extent that they deny the facts admitted
in his plea agreement.” SEC v. Kara, ECF No. 138 at 3-4; Stip. Ex. 8 at 3-4.
Facts underlying SEC v. Kara and United States v. Kara are set forth in the Stipulation and
are as follows: From 1999 to 2007, Kara worked as an investment banker at Citigroup. Starting in
mid-2002, Kara worked in Citigroup’s healthcare group, advising public companies and other
clients in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry about takeovers, acquisitions, mergers,
corporate finance, and other multi-million dollar transactions. Kara obtained confidential and
material nonpublic information by virtue of the relationship of trust and confidence between
Citigroup and its clients. He fully understood that the intentional misuse of such information was a
crime. His brother Michael (a/k/a Mounir) Kara understood that Kara received such information
and was prohibited from disclosing it. Michael had a scientific background, which Kara did not,
and, when he started working in the healthcare group, Kara asked Michael questions about
biotechnology and the science associated with the clients’ pharmaceuticals; Kara gave Michael
clear instructions that the information he shared was confidential. Toward the end of 2003, their
father became ill, and Kara shared confidential and material nonpublic information regarding
Citigroup clients that provided treatment options that might help. At the end of 2004, their father
died, and Kara became concerned about Michael’s well-being; they spent more time together and
Kara shared updates about their work that included confidential and material nonpublic information.
At first Kara believed that Michael was maintaining the confidentiality of the information. Later,
when Kara became suspicious and confronted him, Michael denied he was trading on the
information. Eventually, in 2006, Kara came to understand that Michael was trading on the
information. In 2007, Michael begged for more information, and Kara provided information
concerning a transaction that he was not working on personally, in the hope of minimizing the risk
that his misuse of Citigroup’s confidential information would be detected. Michael and a
downstream tippee made millions through trading on the confidential information.7 Kara never
7

Additional downstream tippees made further profits. United States v. Kara, ECF No. 277 at 19.
5

traded on the confidential information or was aware of the profits others made as a result of the tips.
In May 2007, Commission staff telephoned Kara in an investigation into unusual trading in one of
the stocks at issue in SEC v. Kara and United States v. Kara, and he made a number of untruthful
statements; for example, he denied that he had confidential information about the issuer.
In the portion of his plea agreement concerning securities fraud (insider trading), Kara
agreed that “I acted willfully and with an intent to deceive.” United States v. Kara, ECF No. 134 at
2-3; SEC v. Kara, ECF No. 138, Ex. A at 2-3; Stip. Ex. 6 at 2-3. At his sentencing hearing, after
expressing remorse for his wrongful conduct and the resulting harm to others, Kara stated, “I accept
full responsibility for my conduct.” United States v. Kara, ECF No. 277 at 17.
As an investment banker at Citigroup, Kara worked for Citigroup Global Markets Inc., the
registered broker-dealer arm of Citigroup, and had nothing to do with Citigroup’s investment
adviser, Citigroup Asset Management, which was separated from the broker-dealer by a strict
ethical wall. Opposition, Declaration of Maher F. Kara at 1-2. Kara’s employment in the financial
industry ended in October 2008, when he was let go by Barclays PLC after he received a Wells
notice from the Commission. Id. at 2. Since that time, he has been primary caregiver to his two
children, has performed his court-ordered community service and continued such volunteer activity,
and has studied biotechnology at the University of California, Santa Cruz Extension. Id. Kara
testified as a government witness at the trial of Bassam Salman, one of Michael’s tippees; Salman is
Kara’s wife’s brother. Id. His wife’s family blames him for Salman’s conviction and stopped
speaking to Kara and his wife. Id. at 2-3. Kara has not spoken with Michael for more than seven
years. Id. at 3.
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Kara has been convicted “within 10 years of the commencement of [this proceeding]” of a
felony or misdemeanor that “involves the purchase or sale of any security [and] conspiracy to
commit any such offense” within the meaning of Sections 15(b)(4)(B)(i) and 15(b)(6)(A)(ii) of the
Exchange Act. He has been enjoined “from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in
connection with . . . the purchase of sale of any security” within the meaning of Sections
15(b)(4)(C) and 15(b)(6)(A)(iii) of the Exchange Act.
IV. SANCTION
A collateral bar with a right to reapply after three years will be ordered.8
A. Sanction Considerations
The Commission determines sanctions pursuant to a public interest standard. See 15 U.S.C.
§ 78o(b)(6)(A). Commission considers factors including:

8

The sanction will not include a bar from association with a municipal advisor or nationally
recognized statistical rating organization in light of Koch v. SEC, 793 F.3d at 157-58, and the date
of Kara’s violative conduct.
6

the egregiousness of the defendant’s actions, the isolated or recurrent nature of the
infraction, the degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the defendant’s assurances
against future violations, the defendant’s recognition of the wrongful nature of his
conduct, and the likelihood that the defendant’s occupation will present opportunities
for future violations.
Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979) (quoting SEC v. Blatt, 583 F.2d 1325, 1334
n.29 (5th Cir. 1978)), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981). The Commission also considers
the age of the violation and the degree of harm to investors and the marketplace resulting from the
violation. Marshall E. Melton, Advisers Act Release No. 2151, 2003 SEC LEXIS 1767, at *4-5
(July 25, 2003). Additionally, the Commission considers the extent to which the sanction will have
a deterrent effect. Schield Mgmt. Co., Exchange Act Release No. 53201, 2006 SEC LEXIS 195, at
*35 & n.46 (Jan. 31, 2006). The public interest requires a severe sanction when a respondent’s past
misconduct involves fraud because opportunities for dishonesty recur constantly in the securities
business. See Vladimir Boris Bugarski, Exchange Act Release No. 66842, 2012 SEC LEXIS 1267,
at *18 n.26 (Apr. 20, 2012); Richard C. Spangler, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 12104, 1976
SEC LEXIS 2418, at *34 (Feb. 12, 1976).
B. Sanction
As described in the Findings of Fact, Kara’s conduct was egregious and recurrent, over a
period of years, and involved a high degree of scienter, as shown by his conviction for securities
fraud and the admission in his plea agreement, “I acted willfully and with an intent to deceive.” His
previous occupation, if he were allowed to continue it in the future, would present opportunities for
future violations. Absent a bar, he could re-enter the securities industry. The violations are not
recent, having ended more than eight years ago. Kara has recognized the wrongful nature of his
conduct. Any direct financial harm to investors cannot be quantified. Although Kara’s tippee and
downstream tippees made millions in profits from their insider trading, Kara received no financial
benefit; rather he lost his job and has been shunned by those who did benefit. However, as the
Commission has often emphasized, the public interest determination extends beyond consideration
of the particular investors affected by a respondent’s conduct to the public-at-large, the welfare of
investors as a class, and standards of conduct in the securities business generally. See Christopher
A. Lowry, Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 2052, 2002 SEC LEXIS 2346, at *20 (Aug.
30, 2002), aff’d, 340 F.3d 501 (8th Cir. 2003); Arthur Lipper Corp., Exchange Act Release No. 11773,
1975 SEC LEXIS 527, at *52 (Oct. 24, 1975). A conviction involving dishonesty requires a bar, and
because of the Commission’s obligation to ensure honest securities markets, an industry-wide bar is
appropriate.
Kara argues that any sanction should be limited to a three-year bar from association with a
broker-dealer. Concerning his request for a limited sanction, the Commission considers an
antifraud injunction to be especially serious and to subject a respondent to the severest of sanctions.
Marshall E. Melton, 2003 SEC LEXIS 1767, at *29-30. Further, the Commission has said,
“repeated insider trading is exactly the type of egregious behavior that supports a collateral bar.”
Peter Siris, Exchange Act Release No. 71068, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3924, at *29 n.47 (Dec. 12, 2013),
pet. denied, 773 F.3d 89 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Indeed, from 1995 to the present, there have been over
forty-six litigated follow-on proceedings based on antifraud injunctions or convictions in which the

7

Commission issued opinions, and all of the respondents were barred 9 – forty-three unqualified bars
and three bars with the right to reapply after five years. 10 Further, in every such case that followed
the statutory provision of collateral bars, the Commission imposed a collateral bar rather than an
industry specific bar, reasoning that the antifraud provisions of the securities laws apply broadly to
all securities-related professionals and violations demonstrate unfitness for future participation in
the securities industry, even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the professional capacity in
which the respondent was acting when he or she engaged in the misconduct underlying the
proceeding. See John W. Lawton, Advisers Act Release No. 3513, 2012 SEC LEXIS 3855, at *4243 (Dec. 13, 2012).
Although a collateral bar is appropriate, this case includes mitigating circumstances that
militate against a permanent bar. Kara has unequivocally recognized the wrongful nature of his
conduct. His violations did not profit him and were not even motivated by financial concerns. In
the judgment of the court in United States v. Kara, he is unlikely to reoffend. Thus, a permanent
bar is unnecessary. A collateral bar with a right to reapply after three years is congruent with the
sentence of three years’ probation imposed in United States v. Kara and will be ordered.
V. ORDER
IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
MAHER F. KARA IS BARRED from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser,
municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent, subject to a right to reapply after three years.
This Initial Decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Rule 360 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, a
party may file a petition for review of this Initial Decision within twenty-one days after service of
the Initial Decision. A party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten
days of the Initial Decision, pursuant to Rule 111 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.111. If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then a party shall have
twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the undersigned’s order resolving such
motion to correct a manifest error of fact. The Initial Decision will not become final until the
Commission enters an order of finality. The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a
party files a petition for review or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission
determines on its own initiative to review the Initial Decision as to a party. If any of these events
occur, the Initial Decision shall not become final as to that party.
9

The pre-Dodd-Frank cases imposed industry-specific bars, such as a bar from association with an
investment adviser on a respondent who had been associated with an investment adviser at the time
of his violation.
10

Those three were Richard J. Puccio, Exchange Act Release No. 37849, 1996 SEC LEXIS 2987
(Oct. 22, 1996); Martin B. Sloate, Exchange Act Release No. 38373, 1997 SEC LEXIS 524 (Mar. 7,
1997); and Robert Radano, Advisers Act Release No. 2750, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1504 (June 30,
2008). The Commission’s opinions do not make clear the factors that distinguished these cases
from those in which unqualified bars were imposed, but there is little difference between a “bar”
and a “bar with the right to reapply in five years.”
