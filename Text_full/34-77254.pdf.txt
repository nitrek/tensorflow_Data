ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE
AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS,
PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 15(b) AND 21C
OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934, MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING
REMEDIAL SANCTIONS AND A CEASEAND-DESIST ORDER

In the Matter of
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange
Act”) against KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. (“Respondent” or “KBCM”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting
Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the
Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order
(“Order”), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds1 that:
The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer and are not binding on any other
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

Summary
1.
and records.

These proceedings concern Respondent’s failure to make and keep accurate books

2.
Respondent, a broker-dealer registered with the Commission, is a subsidiary of
KeyCorp, a financial services company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio.
3.
Beginning at some point prior to January 2011, and through January 2012,
Respondent’s then Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) (until November 2011), Jason Maiher, caused
unsubstantiated or “plug” entries to be made to one or more accounts in Respondent’s general
ledger. The amount of the unsubstantiated entries varied over time.
4.
The plug entries resulted in Respondent reporting unsubstantiated assets in the
financial statements included in its fiscal year 2010 Annual Audited Report filed with the
Commission in February 2011 and in its monthly FOCUS Reports filed with FINRA, which then
furnished the FOCUS Reports to the Commission, including those filed in 2011and January 2012.
5.
In Respondent’s Annual Audited Report for the year ended December 31, 2011,
Respondent disclosed that its prior period financial statements (for fiscal year 2010) included
unsubstantiated assets of $13,679,000 ($8,591,000 net of taxes) and omitted liabilities of
$4,305,000 ($2,701,000 net of taxes). Accordingly, Respondent restated net income as $3,136,000
versus the previously reported $14,428,000 (a 78% reduction) and restated shareholder’s equity
from $328,088,000 to $316,796,000, as of December 31, 2010.

in Cleveland, Ohio.
Other Relevant Party
7.
Jason Maiher, age 41, was Respondent’s Chief Financial Officer from April 2007
through November 2011 and Series 27 Financial and Operations Principal from April 2007
through December 2011. Maiher was primarily responsible for maintaining Respondent’s
financial records and oversaw the filing of its monthly FOCUS Reports with FINRA, which then
furnished the FOCUS Reports to the Commission. As required by company policy, Maiher was
required to certify at the close of each month that Respondent’s general ledger balance sheet
information had been compared with, and reconciled to, the underlying back-office system
information from which the general ledger was prepared.

KBCM’s Books and Records Were Inaccurate
8.
Beginning at some point prior to January 2011 through January 2012, Maiher
caused unsubstantiated or “plug” entries to be made to one or more accounts in Respondent’s
general ledger, in order to complete Respondent’s monthly close-the-books process.
9.
The plug entries resulted in Respondent overstating its assets and income in its
fiscal year 2010 financial statements, which were included in its fiscal year 2010 Annual Audited
Report filed with the Commission in February 2011. Maiher signed this report, affirming that the
accompanying financial statements were “true and correct.”
10.
The plug entries to the general ledger also resulted in inaccurate financial
information being included in Respondent’s monthly FOCUS Reports that Maiher caused to be
filed with FINRA, which then furnished the FOCUS Reports to the Commission, in January 2011
through January 2012 , among other months.
11.
In its Annual Audited Report for the year ended December 31, 2011, Respondent
disclosed that its prior period financial statements (for fiscal year 2010) included unsubstantiated
assets of $13,679,000 ($8,591,000 net of taxes) and omitted liabilities of $4,305,000 ($2,701,000
net of taxes). The firm’s write-off of the unsubstantiated assets and accrual of the unrecorded
liabilities resulted in restated net income of $3,136,000, a 78% reduction versus the previously
reported $14,428,000, and restated shareholder’s equity of $316,796,000, an $11,292,000
reduction from the previously reported $328,088,000.
12.
As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent willfully2 violated Sections
17(a) and 17(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 17a-3(a)(2) and 17a-5(a) and (d) thereunder, which
require broker-dealers to make and keep current books and records, and to make certain reports and
filings as required by the Commission.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent KBCM’s Offer.
Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Exchange Act, it is hereby
ORDERED that:

A willful violation of the securities laws means merely “‘that the person charged with the duty
knows what he is doing.’” Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting
Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969, 977 (D.C. Cir. 1949)). There is no requirement that the actor
“‘also be aware that he is violating one of the Rules or Acts.’” Id. (quoting Gearhart & Otis, Inc.
v. SEC, 348 F.2d 798, 803 (D.C. Cir. 1965)).
