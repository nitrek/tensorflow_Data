to Congress in three segments, on April 3, July 17, and August 8,
1963. As stated by the Commission in transmitting the final segment,
the Report "is clearly the most thorough examination of the securities markets since the early 1930s. Size alone is but a poor measure
of its importance and achievement. The Report would have high
usefulness if only for its orderly presentation of basic facts about
the markets. More importantly it offers a foundation for regulatory
and industry actions for a long period to come."
In its 13 chapters totaling some 3,000 pages,' the Report provides a
detailed catalog of practices involved in the operation of the securities
industry and markets, as well as developments and problems in their
regulation and self-regulation. A brief summary of the content of
the Report will indicate the breadth of the subject matter reviewed
by the Special Study.
Chapter I of the Report, after describing briefly the purposes and
methods of study and the general nature of recommendations arrived
at, sets forth general data highlighting the growth of the securities
industry in the postwar period, which was an important reason for
the Study and provides the background for many of the subjects explored. Chapters II and III are concerned with the broad range of
persons and business entities engaged in the securities businessbroker-dealers, salesmen, salesmen's supervisors, and persons engaged
in giving investment advice. The first of this pair of chapters examines the standards and controls relating to their entry into and removal from the business; and the second, their activities and respon1The Report Is avaUable from the Superintendent

sibilities in the course of that business and the related controls.
Chapter IV deals with primary and secondary distributions of securities to the public, with particular emphasis on new issues and briefer
review of other specific areas such as the disclosure requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, unregistered distributions, intrastate offerings, and real estate
securities.
Chapters V, VI, VII, and VIII extensively explore the functions,
structures, and problems of markets in which securities are traded
after their distribution. Chapter V is a general introduction to this
group of chapters. Chapter VI covers the exchange markets, with
special attention to the most important of these, the New York Stock
Exchange. The chapter reviews the functions and activities of various specialized categories of members, particularly specialists, oddlot brokers and dealers, and floor traders, and also deals with the
subjects of short selling and commission rate structures. Chapter
VII discusses the over-the-counter markets, their vast and heterogeneous character, their wholesale and retail components, the quotations
systems, and present controls over all of them. Chapter VITI then
examines various interrelationships among trading markets, including patterns of distribution of securities among exchange and overthe-counter markets, institutional participation in various markets,
over-the-counter trading in listed securities, and the regional exchanges as "dual" and primary markets.
Chapter IX reviews the legal requirements and standards in respect
of reporting, proxy solicitation and "insider~' trading which are applicable to issuers of securities in public hands, contrasting those
relating to securities listed on exchanges with those relating to overthe-counter securities and emphasizing the need for legislation in
the latter area. It also considers problems in the dissemination of
corporate publicity by issuers of both kinds of securities. Chapter X
deals with the purposes, effects, and, enforcement of securities credit
and margin regulations and some inconsistencies and anomalies of
the present regulatory pattern. Chapter XI is concerned with certain aspects of open-end investment companies ("mutual funds")
which are for the most part covered neither by the recent industry
study conducted by the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce
nor by continuing inquiries of the Commission's Division of Corporate Regulation. It contains the results of an investor survey and also
specifically treats with selling practices, contractual plans, and certain
problems in connection with fund portfolio transactions. Chapter
XII deals with the self-regulatory pattern which is largely unique
to the securities industry. It evaluates the regulatory functioning

of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange,
the principal regional exchanges, the National.Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), and certain quasi-regulatory agencies,
notes the absence of self-regulatory organizations in certain areas,
and assesses the role of the Commission in relation to all of them.
The market break of May 1962 was thought to merit separate
examination as a major market phenomenon, and also afforded an
opportunity to study certain aspects of the securities markets, already studied under more normal conditions, in the circumstances
of a precipitous decline. The results of this study are set forth in
Chapter XIII, the final chapter of the Report.
The Commission's judgment on the state of the securities markets
and their regulation was summarized in its transmittal letter accompanying the first segment of the Report: "At the outset we emphasize
that, although many specific recommendations for improvements in
rules and practices are made in the Report of the Special Study,
the report demonstrates that neither the fundamental structure of
the securities markets nor of the regulatory pattern of the securities
acts requires dramatic reconstruction. . . . At the same time the
Report makes very clear that important problems do exist, grave
abuses do occur, and additional controls and improvements are much
needed."
The Report points up many shortcomings in investor protection,
of various kinds and degrees, and makes 175 specific recommendations
for their correction. In transmitting the Report to Congress, the
Commission stated that "we do not embrace every recommendation as
our own, but we do accept them as a sound point of departure for
proposals to the Congress, for rule-making by the Commission and
by the self-regulatory agencies, and for discussions with the industry." The Commission's letters of April 19, and July 23, 1963, to
Chairman Oren Harris of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce
Committee and Chairman A. Willis Robertson of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, and its transmittal letter to Congress
of August 8, 1963, stated the Commission's response to each of the
Study's recommendations.
As stated, the Study Report is a basic informational document.
Among other things, it describes for the first time, in an organized and
complete fashion, the operation of the current over-the-counter market,
and the impact of the New York Stock Exchange minimum commission rate schedule on the securities markets. In addition, the Report
provides an over-all review of the operation of self-regulation.
Secondly, the Study and its Report have been and will be a springboard for both industry and regulatory action. The Study's impact

4

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

has already been felt in many ways. Even while still in progress, it
stimulated an extensive self-examination by various segments of the
securities industry, most notably the self-regulatory agencies. As a
result, these agencies have made a number of improvements in rules
and practices, which may be in whole or part attributed to the Study.
Thus, the American Stock Exchange followed up its reorganization,
as reported in last year's annual report, by a number of beneficial
changes. It substituted a staff system for the self-perpetuating
standing committees of Exchange members, substantially augmented
its staff and adopted higher listing and delisting standards.
The Exchange also took disciplinary action against various members and
allied members whose activities had been discussed in the January
1962 staff report on the Exchange.
In sum, the Exchange has now instituted a responsible regulatory system as a basis for meeting its
obligations under the Securities Exchange Act. The New York Stock
Exchange has also made a substantial number of significant improvements. Qualification standards applicable to various classes of members and member-firm employees were raised. The rules covering
market letters were strengthened and the procedures for review of
these letters by the Exchange were improved.
The Exchange staff
was increased to strengthen the capacity for self-regulation.
The
NASD also increased its staff and expanded its surveillance activities.
It is now undertaking a complete review of its by-laws, rules, and organizational structure, which is expected to result in more effective organization and operation.
The second result of the Special Study Report has been the Commission's legislative program, submitted to Congress in June 1963.2
Following hearings before a subcommittee of the Senate Banking and
Currency Committee on a bill embodying the Commission's proposals,
during which the broad purposes of the legislative program were
strongly endorsed by all segments of the securities industry, the
bill was passed by the Senate on July 30, 1963. As of December 1963,
hearings had been held by a subcommittee of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives on the
two bills introduced in the House of Representatives.
• The Commission's proposals were submitted to the Committee on Banking and Currency
of the Senate and the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of
Representatives.
On .Tune 4, 1963, three identical bills embodying the Cammission's proposals were introduced in the Congress. S. 1642 was introduced (by request) in the Senate
by Senator A. Willis Robertson, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency; H.R. 6789 was Introduced In the House of Representatives by Representative Oren
Harris, Chairman of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, House ot Representatives, and H.R. 6793 was introduced by Representative Harley O. 'Staggers, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance of the Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives.

TWENTY-NINTH

A-l\TNUAL REPORT

The proposed legislation, in its broadest terms, has two major purposes. The first is to improve investor protection in the over-thecounter market, primarily by extending to investors in over-thecounter securities the fundamental protections which under existing
legislation are generally afforded only to investors in securities listed
on an exchange. Briefly, these protections are as follows: A company listing its securities on an exchange must file a registration
statement containing material information regarding its business and
must keep such information current by periodic reports; securityholders whose votes are solicited must be furnished with a proxy
statement, which must contain adequate and accurate information; and
corporate "insiders" must report their securities transactions and are
liable to the company for short-swing trading profits. The proposed
legislation would extend these protections to investors in over-thecounter companies having more than 750 shareholders (500 shareholders at a subsequent date) and more than $1 million in assets. The
second purpose of the proposed legislation is to strengthen qualification standards for entrance into the securities business and controls
over those already in that business, again with emphasis on the overthe-counter market. The principal proposed changes in this area
would include the following: All over-the-counter broker or dealer
firms would be required to be members of a registered securities association, in order to bring them within the self-regulatory scheme.
Registered securities associations would be required to adopt rules!
subject to Commission approval, establishing standards of training,
experience and competence for members and their employees and to
establish capital requirements for members. In addition, the rigidity
of the present statutory scheme for disciplining violators, which does
not provide for direct Commission action against individual wrongdoers connected with a broker or dealer, or expressly authorize the
Commission to impose useful intermediate sanctions against a registered :firm short of revoking its registration, would be removed by
permitting action against the individual in lieu of proceeding against
the entire firm, and by authorizing the imposition of intermediate
sanctions such as temporary suspension or censure. The authority of
a national securities association to act directly against offending individuals would also be clarified.
A major part of the Study's recommendations can be implemented
under existing legislation, through the rule-making powers of the
Commission or the self-regulatory agencies. At the present time, the
Commission and the industry are actively engaged in considering the
Study's recommendations and analyzing the problems discussed by the
Study Report. Because of the vast number of recommendations, the

6

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

Commission has thought it necessary to select out certain priority items
which will be given first attention. To this end, the recommendations
have been divided into two main groups. The first, those of particular
concern to specific self-regulatory agencies, have been taken up with
the affected exchange or the NASD and agreement has been reached
on the subjects to be given first attention. Thus, in the exchange area,
priority designation has been given to the proposals relating to odd-lot
dealers, floor traders, specialists and automation.
Further, the Commission and the NASD are giving first priority in the over-the-counter
market to the quotation systems, the "markup" policy, execution of
retail transactions and the strengthening of the organization and structure of the NASD itself.
The other major group of recommendations are those of concern
to the securities industry as a whole, transcending the particular interest of anyone self-regulatory agency. These have already been
discussed with the members of the Industry Advisory Committee. The
Committee is designating appropriate subcommittees to consider such
vital matters as selling practices, the establishment of minimum capital
requirements, and rules relating to the conduct of those who distribute
securities.
The priority groups include those matters which in the Commission's
opinion warrant immediate attention. As a practical matter, not all
175 specific recommendations can be implemented immediately and
simultaneously.
But those recommendations
not receiving first
priority are being neither discarded nor neglected. A considerable
amount of work has already been done on a number of them; it is expected that in a reasonable period of time they will all receive full
attention and action by the Commission and its staff.
The Commission has taken steps to reorganize its personnel for the
implementation of the Study's recommendations.
Thus, a new Office
of Program Planning was created, with the initial task of assisting
and advising the Commission with respect to the implementation program. The Division of Trading and Exchanges was renamed the
Division of Trading and Markets and was reorganized. Many of the
Special Study's personnel have been assigned to these units, as well
as to other staff offices, and they are playing an important role in the
implementation program.
The Special Study recommended that the Commission more fully
exercise its powers of oversight and supervision over the self-regulatory agencies. Accordingly, a new office within the Division of Trading and Markets, the Office of Regulation, has been created and
assigned the general responsibility of overseeing the operations of
the self-regulatory agencies. At the same time, the Commission has

TWENTY-NINTH

ANNUAL REPORT

7

strengthened and instituted important oversight programs, including
an increased schedule of examinations of the exchanges and of the
NASD and in general securing more information about their
operations.
As has been noted, the securities industry and the various selfregulatory agencies have already taken many important and significant steps which should have the effect of raising investor protection. The Commission itself has issued a proposed rule, based on
the Study's recommendations, which would require financial statements in annual reports transmitted to stockholders not to be materially misleading in light of the reports filed with the Commission,
and, as of December 1963, consideration was being given to other
possible proposed rules. Furthermore, out of the very intensive
and active scrutiny and examination of rules and practices stimulated
by the Special Study Report and now being conducted by the Commission, the self-regulatory agencies and the securities industry itself, it can be anticipated that many additional important changes
in rules and practices can be adopted, which will contribute to the
improvement of investor protection.
Enforcement

Activity

As described in more detail in other parts of this report, the Commission continued to pursue a vigorous enforcement program during
the fiscal year in an effort to combat fraudulent and other illegal
practices in securities transactions. The Commission, as in the past,
took action on all available fronts-civil, criminal and administrative.
Thus, 121 injunction or related court enforcement proceedings were
instituted by the Commission during the year, a larger number than
in any previous year. Six hundred and twenty-two investigations of
securities transactions involving possible violations of the anti-fraud
or other provisions of the securities acts were instituted. Forty-nine
cases were referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. A striking example of the complexity which criminal cases
in this field may assume, and the extent, of the investigative work which
must necessarily precede the actual prosecution of such cases, is presented by United States v. Garfield, in which, after the longest trial
in the history of Federal criminal prosecutions (some 11 months),
the defendants were convicted in February 1963 of manipulating the
market price of the common stock of United Dye and Chemical Corporation and fraudulently distributing unregistered shares of such
stock through "boiler-rooms." At the conclusion of the trial, the
judge commented that "there never was a case that was proved to the
hilt the way this case was proved." He commended two members of
the Commission's staff for their investigative efforts, stating that "it

is evident that they performed Herculean labors by way of investigation and ferreting out the facts."
During the year 1,534 broker-dealer inspections were conducted,
and broker-dealer registrations were revoked in 75 cases. Inspections
were completed with respect to 219 investment advisers, and 5 investment adviser registrations were revoked. Examinations or investigations were initiated in 20 cases to determine whether stop order proceedings should be brought with respect to registration statements
filed under the Securities Act of 1933, and investigations were instituted in 19 cases to determine whether other information filed with
the Commission was accurate and adequate. Orders which suspended
the exemption from registration provided for small security issues
were issued in 53 instances.
The fiscal year also saw a further increase in the Commission's in.
spection program under the Investment Company Act of 1940. During the year, 84 inspections of investment companies were completed,
as compared to a total of 165 inspections conducted in all prior years
since the inception of the program in 1957, and 52 inspections during
the 1962 fiscal year. Chiefly as a result of information obtained
through inspections, 29 investigations were commenced, and 9 civil actions were instituted. The inspection and investigation program produced rather dramatic results in certain instances in terms of tangible
benefits to investment companies or their shareholders.
In one instance, where it appeared that an investment company's investment
adviser, a broker-dealer, had taken improper brokerage commissions
in executing securities transactions for the company, a settlement was
agreed upon which will result in the return of more than $200,000 to the
company. In another instance, where an inspection and investigation
revealed that promoters had used a company and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, a registered investment company, as a means of financing
other corporations controlled by them, and had committed numerous
violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company
Act of 1940, the Commission's staff negotiated a settlement which
provided, among other things, for a return of about $250,000 to public
shareholders.
Registration of New Security Offerings

Continuing the trend set since the severe market break of May 1962,
fiscal year 1963 saw a considerable reduction, by contrast with
recent years, in the number of registration statements filed under the
Securities Act of 1933 for public offerings of securities. A total of
1,159 statements was filed during the year, representing a dollar amount
of $14.7 billion. The lower number of filings enabled the Commission's staff to reduce the processing period substantially.
The median

number of days elapsing from the date of filing to the date of the staff's
letter of comment, with respect to registration statements which became
effective during the year (excluding certain investment company filings), was 27 during the 1963 fiscal year as compared with 57 days in
the preceding year. A total of 1,157 statements in the amount of
$14.8 billion became effective during the year. The chart below portrays the dollar volume and number of registrations with respect to
securities which became registered during the fiscal years 1935
through 1963.

LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES
The Commission's major activity relating to legislation during the
fiscal year 1963, namely, the preparation and submission of its "legislative program based on the recommendations of the Special Study of
Securities Markets, has already been discussed in some detail in the
p~edingparlofthisreport.
Additionally, Chairman Cary testified before Subcommittee No.2
of the Committee on the District of Columbia, House of Representatives, in favor of H.R. 4200, a bill to provide for the regulation of the
business of selling securities in the District of Columbia and for the
licensing of persons engaged in that business. Chairman Cary also
appeared before the Legal and Monetary Mairs Subcommittee of the
Committee on Government Operations, House of Representatives, to
discuss the relation of the Federal securities laws to certain aspects of
the Comptroller of the Currency's revised Regulation 9, particularly
the expansion, as contemplated by that regulation, of the power
national banks to commingle funds for investment management and
the relation of the Federal securities laws to the provisions of the Self
Employed. Individuals Tax Retirement Act of 1962. In addition,
Chairman Cary discussed the problem of the exploitation of elderly
citizens in securities transactions and the Commission's responsibility
in that area in hearings before the Special Committee on Aging, United
States Senate. Commissioner Cohen testified before the Subcommittee
on Administrative Practice and Procedure of the Senate Committee
on the Judiciary with respect to S. 1664, a bill to establish a Permanent
Administrative Conference.
During the fiscal year the Commission and its staff analyzed or
commented on 49 bills and other legislative matters referred by various
committees of the Senate and House of Representatives and the Bureau
of the Budget.

PART III
REVISION OF RULES, REGULATIONS, AND FORMS
As previously noted, the Report of the Special Study of Securities
Markets recommended, among other things, changes in the Commission's rules in various areas. Even aside from the Special Study
and its implementation, the Commission maintains a continuing program of reviewing its rules, regulations and forms in order to determine whether any changes are appropriate in the light of changing
conditions, methods and procedures in business and in the financial
practices of business, and in the light of the experience gained in the
administration of the statutes administered by it. Certain members
of the staff are specifically assigned to this task, but changes are
also suggested, from time to time, by other members of the staff who
are engaged in the examination of material filed with the Commission, and by persons outside of the Commission who are subject to
the Commission's requirements or who have occasion to work with
those requirements in a professional capacity such as underwriters,
attorneys and accountants. With a few exceptions provided for by
the Administrative Procedure Act; proposed new rules, regulations
and forms and proposed changes in existing rules, regulations and
forms are published in preliminary form for the purpose of obtaining
the views and comments of interested persons, including issuers and
various industry groups. These views and comments are carefully
reviewed by the staff and by the Commission and are very helpful
in revealing the manner in which proposed changes will operate,'
During the 1963 fiscal year, the Commission made a number of
changes in its rules, regulations and forms, and published in preliminary form various proposed changes. The changes made during
the year and those pending at the end of the year are described below.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

THE SECURITIES ACf OF 1933
Proposed

Rule 156

During the fiscal year the Commission invited public comments on
a proposed rule relating to transactions involving certain group annuity contracts," The proposed rule, to be designated Rule 156,
would define as "transactions by an issuer not involving any public
offering" in Section 4(1) of the Securities Act, transactions which
are exempted from the Investment Company Act of 1940 by Rule
3c-3 under that Act. Rule 30-3, which was recently adopted, exempts
from the provisions of the Investment Company Act transactions by
any insurance company with respect to certain group annuity contracts providing for the administration of funds held by such company in separate accounts established and maintained pursuant to
state law. It has been represented to the Commission that these contracts are individually negotiated with employers who are able to
fend for themselves. The proposed new rule provides that transactions of the character referred to therein shall come within the rule
only if the transaction is not solicited by advertising which, insofar
as it relates to a separate account group annuity contract, does more
than identify the insurance company, state that it is engaged in the
business of writing separate account contracts and invite inquiries in
regard thereto. The rule provides, however, that disclosure in the
course of direct discussion or negotiation of such contracts would not
be prohibited.
The proposed rule would provide an exemption only
from the provisions of Section 5 'of the Act and would not, therefore,
afford any exemption from the anti-fraud provisions of the Act.3
Proposed

Rules 402A and 440

The Commission announced that it has under consideration two
proposed new rules relating to the registration of securities by foreign
issuers other than foreign governments.'
Section 6(a) of the Securities Act requires that where a registrant
is a foreign or territorial person, the registration statement shall be
signed by its duly authorized representative in the United States.
This signature is in addition to the signatures required where the
registrant is a domestic issuer. Under Section 11 of the Act, an authorized representative may be liable to persons purchasing the securities offered pursuant to the registration statement.
In order for
this provision to operate effectively for the protection of investors,
• Securities Act Release No. 4598 (April 16, 1963) .
• Rule 156 was adopted shortly after the eud of the fiscal year. See Securlties Act
Release No. 4627 (August 1, 1963) •
• Securities Act Release No. 4511 (.July 16, 1962); Securities Act Rels-ase No. 4524
(August 10, 1962).

TWENTY-NINTH

13

it is essential that the authorized representative be a person having a
reasonable degree of responsibility. In the past, efforts have been
made to meet the requirement that the registration statement be signed
by an authorized representative in the United States by organizing a
dummy corporation solely for that purpose. Other devices may
similarly be used to evade the intent and purpose of the requirement.
The proposed new Rule 402A would require that where the registrant
is a foreign person other than a foreign government, the authorized
representative in the United States shall meet certain qualifications
designed to insure that there will be in this country a person against
whom investors may have recourse in appropriate cases.
The proposed new Rule 440 would require that where the registrant,
any of its directors or officers, any selling security holder or any
underwriter is a nonresident (other than a foreign government or a
political subdivision thereof), it shall furnish to the Commission a
consent and power of attorney authorizing the Commission to accept
service of process in connection with civil actions arising out of the
offering or sale of the registered securities. The purpose of this rule
is to make it easier for purchasers of the registered securities to obtain
service of process upon foreign issuers and their insiders in connection
with civil actions instituted in the courts in this country.
The proposed rules were still under consideration at the close of the
year.
Adoption of Revised Form S-8

During the :fiscalyear the Commission adopted certain amendments
to Form 8-8 which is the form authorized for use in registering securities under the Securities Act to be offered pursuant to certain
stock purchase, savings or similar plans, and for registering the interests in such plans where such registration is required," In addition
to certain changes designed to simplify and clarify the form in certain respects, Form 8-8 was amplified to permit use of the form for
securities other than "equity" securities and for securities to be offered
pursuant to restricted stock options.
THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Proposed Amendments to Rule 3al2-3

Rule 3a12-3 exempts the securities of certain foreign issuers from
the operation of Sections 14(a) and 16 of the Securities Exchange
Act. During the fiscal year, the Commission announced that it has
under consideration certain proposed amendments to Rule 3al2-3
&

Securities A.ct Release No. 4533 (August 30. 1962).

and invited public comments," The rule, as amended, would provide
that no exemption is available for voting trust certificates where the
voting trustee is or, if there is more than one, at least one-half of the
voting trustees are citizens or residents of the United States, or if
any person or persons controlling such voting trustee or trustees are
citizens or residents of the United States.
A further amendment of the rule would take out of the exemption
from Sections 14(a) and 16 of the Act certain issuers organized in a
foreign country. These would include (i) companies which have their
principal executive offices in the United States and which have a substantial portion of their assets in, or derive a substantial portion of
their gross revenues from sources in, the United States; (ii) companies which have the major portion of their assets in, or derive the
major portion of their gross revenues from sources in, the United
States; (iii) companies the majority of whose directors are citizens
or residents of the United States; and (Vv) companies more than 50
percent of whose voting securities are owned by residents of the
United States.
This matter was pending at the end of the fiscal year.
Adoption of Rule IOb-9

There have been instances where persons distributing securities have
represented that such securities were being offered on an "all-or-none"
basis when, because of ambiguities in the contractual arrangement,
it was not clear whether the conditions for a completed offering would
be met if persons were found who agreed to purchase all of the securities within the specified time, but the underwriter did not succeed
in collecting the purchase price for all of the securities. Rule 10b-9
was adopted to deal with this type of situation.
The rule makes it a
"manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance," as used in Section
10 (b) of the Act, for any person, in connection with the offer or sale
of a security, to make any representation to the effect that the security
is being offered or sold on an "all-or-none" basis unless the security is
part of an offering being made on the condition that all or a specified
amount of the purchase price will be promptly refunded to the purchaser if all of the securities being offered are not sold at a specified
price within a specified time and the total amount due to the seller is
not received by him by a specified date. The rule would also prohibit
a representation to the effect that the security is being offered or sold
on any other basis under which all or part of the amount paid will be
refunded to the purchaser if all or part of the securities are not sold,
unless the security is part of an offering being made on the condition

that all or a specified part of the amount paid will be promptly refunded if a specified number of units are not sold at a specified price
within a specified time and the total amount due to the seller is not
received by him by a specified date. '1
Proposed

Rule 10b-l0

During the fiscal year, the Commission invited public comments on
a proposed rule relating to representations concerning the sale or
redemption of certain securities." The proposed rule, to be designated
Ru1e 10~1O, wou1d provide that it shall constitute a manipulative or
deceptive device or contrivance within the meaning of Section 10(b)
of the Act for any person, in connection with the offering or sale of any
equity security, to make any representation to the effect that (1) the
offering price of such security is based upon and varies with the current
value of its proportionate share of the assets of the issuer, or (2) such
security is or will be redeemable at the option of the holder at a price
which is based upon and varies with the current value of such proportionate share, unless substantially all of the assets of the issuer
consist of cash, cash items and securities (other than mortgages and
other liens on and interests ill real estate) for which market quotations
are readily available and which are readily marketable.
This matter has become of particular interest in connection with
proposals by certain real estate investment companies to offer redeemable securities. However, the proposed rule as drafted would apply
to any company seeking to offer securities in the manner or of the
character described in the rule. One purpose of the rule is to prohibit
the offering of securities on the basis of the value of their proportionate
share of the assets of the company in cases where the nature of the
company's assets is such that it is impossible to determine their value
with sufficient precision to compute the offering price of the securities
on that basis. The rule wou1d also prohibit the offering of securities
of a company as "redeemable" securities when the assets of the company are such that their value cannot be precisely determined for the
purpose of redemption and are not sufficiently liquid to make possible
their conversion into cash for the purpose of redeeming the securities.
A number of comments were received in regard to the proposed rule
and the rule was being considered in the light of such comments at the
end of the fiscal year.
Proposed Amendments to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 and Form 7-K

tions to shareholders.
Form 7-K is the form prescribed for such
reports. At the time of adoption of these rules and form, the Commission announced that it would consider all views and comments submitted with respect thereto by interested persons and would make such
changes, if any, as it might deem necessary or appropriate in the light
of such views and comments," Accordingly, after consideration of a
number of comments submitted by interested persons, the Commission,
during the fiscal year, invited public comments on certain proposed
amendments to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 and Form 7_K.I0
The rules as proposed to be amended would require the filing of
quarterly reports on Form 7-K by real estate investment trusts and
by real estate companies which as a matter of policy or practice
make distributions to shareholders from sources other than current
or retained earnings. Other real estate companies would be required
to file reports with respect to quarters in which a distribution is made
from a source other than current or retained earnings. It is proposed
to amend Form 7-K to eliminate the two-column reporting now required and to clarify the language of the items of the form so as to
simplify the preparation and filing of the required reports.
This matter was pending at the close of the fiscal year.
Adoption of Rule 15d-21 and Form ll-K;

Amendment to Form 10-K

During the fiscal year, the Commission adopted regulations governing the filing of annual reports, pursuant to Section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, relating to employee stock purchase,
savings and similar plans.
A new Form ll-K was adopted for use in filing annual reports with
respect to such plans. A new Rule 15d-21 provides that separate
annual and other reports need not be filed with respect to any plan if
the issuer of the stock or other securities offered to employees through
the plan files annual reports on Form lO-K or U5S and as a part of
such reports furnishes the information, financial statements and exhibits required by Form ll-K and if it furnishes to the Commission
copies of any annual report submitted to employees in regard to the
plan. A new general instruction was added to Form lo-K which
specifies the procedure to be followed where an issuer elects to file
information and documents pursuant to Rule 15d-21.11

Commission is authorized to exempt from Section 16 (b) transactions
not comprehended within the purpose of that Section. During the
fiscal year, the Commission invited public comments on a proposed new
Rule 16b-9 which would exempt from the operation of Section 16(b)
certain acquisitions of shares of stock in exchange for similar shares
of stock of the same issuer."
The proposed rule would exempt any acquisition of shares of stock
of an issuer in exchange for an equal number of shares of another class
of stock of the same issuer pursuant to a right of conversion under the
terms of the issuer's certificate of incorporation, for the purpose or in
contemplation of a public sale which in fact occurs. The exemption
would be available only if the shares surrendered and those acquired in
exchange therefor evidence the same rights and privileges except that
the shares surrendered may, in the discretion of the board of directors,
receive a lesser cash dividend than the shares for which they are exchanged. The exemption would be further conditioned upon there
being no other acquisitions of securities of either class within 6 months
before or after the exempted transaction.
The exemption would apply
to any such acquisition occurring either before or after the effective
date of the rule, except that it would not affect judgments rendered
prior to the effective date."

Form 8-K is the form prescribed for current reports filed pursuant
to Sections 13 and 15( d) of the Securities Exchange Act. During
the 1962 fiscal year, the Commission announced that it had under
consideration certain proposed amendments to the form and invited
public comments.e
The amendments are designed to require prompt
reporting of material changes affecting a company or its affairs when
it appears that they are of such importance that reporting should not
be deferred to the end of the company's fiscal year. The amendments
relate to matters such as the pledging of securities of the issuer or its
affiliates under such circumstances that a default will result in a
change in control of the issuer, changes in the board of directors otherwise than by stockholder action, the acquisition or disposition of significant amounts of assets otherwise than in the ordinary course of
business, interests of management and others in certain transactions,
and the issuance of debt securities by subsidiaries.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940
Adoption of Rule 3c-3

During the fiscal year, the Commission adopted a new Rule 3c-3.15
The rule exempts from the provisions of the Act transactions of insurance companies with respect to certain group annuity contracts
providing for the administration of funds held by an insurance company in a separate account established and maintained pursuant to
legislation which permits the income, gains and losses, whether or not
realized, from assets allocated to such account to be credited to or
charged against such account without regard to other income, gains
or losses of the insurance company.
It is contemplated that employers would make payments to such
accounts as a means of accumulating the funds required to discharge
their obligations under pension plans to provide their employees with
annuities in fixed-dollar amounts upon their retirement. It is also
contemplated that the assets allocated to such a special account would
be invested free of the usual restrictions applicable to investment by
insurance companies in common stocks. Under the type of pension
contract which would utilize such special accounts, the risk of market
fluctuation of equities occurs only during the accumulation period and
is on the employer. The annuity which will be provided for a retired
employee is not affected by market fluctuations.
Although the insurance companies may not be acting as trustees,
the arrangements for utilization by employers of such special accounts
maintained by insurance companies would be similar to arrangements
excepted from the definition of investment company pursuant to Section 3(c) (13) of the Act, relating to accounts maintained by bank
trustees for the investment of funds which employers have set aside
to meet their obligations under qualified pension plans.
The exemption provided by the rule is available only if the
following requirements are met: the pension plan must meet the
qualification requirements of Section 401 of the Internal Revenue
Code or the requirements for deduction of the employer's contribution
under Section 404(a) (2) of the Code whether or not the employer
deducts the amounts paid for the contract under such Section; must
cover at least 25 employees as of the plan's initiation date; must not
provide for payment of retirement benefits measured by the investment results of the assets allocated to the segregated account; and must
not permit the allocation to the separate account of any payment or
contribution by employees .

Amendment of Rule 3Od-l

The Commission also adopted certain amendments to Rule 30d-1
under the Investment Company Act of 1940.16 This rule relates to
reports required to be furnished to stockholders of management
companies pursuant to Section 30(d) of the Act.
Paragraph (a) of the rule previously required the first report of
a registered management company to be made as of a date not later
than the close of the fiscal year or half-year first occurring on or after
December 31, 1940. Since that date no longer has any significance,
this provision has been amended to provide that the first such report
shall be made as of a date not later than the close of the fiscal year
or half-year first occurring on or after the date on which the company's notification of registration under the Act is filed with the
Commission.
Another amendment to paragraph (a) provides that, with certain
exceptions, reports shall be mailed to stockholders within 45 days
(rather than within 30 days, as previously required) after the date as
of which the report is made. The procedure for securing an extension
of time in certain cases has also been simplified.
Paragraph (b) of the rule has been amended to provide expressly
that the financial statements included in such reports for the company's fiscal year shall be certified by independent public accountants. The rule has been consistently construed to require such certification and the amendment merely makes the requirement explicit.
Amendments to Rules 31a-l

and 31a-2; Adoption of Rule 31a-3

Rules 31a-l and 31a-2, which relate to the records to be maintained
and preserved by registered investment companies, certain majorityowned subsidiaries, and other persons having transactions with registered investment companies, were amended during the fiscal year to
prescribe with greater specificity and detail the records of securities
transactions required to be kept, and to require the keeping of certain
memoranda and documents not previously required." At the same
time, a new Rule 31a-3 was adopted, which sets forth certain requirements in circumstances where the records specified in Rules 31a-1 and
31a-2 are prepared or maintained by others on behalf of the person
required. to maintain them.

PART IV
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
The Securities Act of 1933is primarily a disclosure statute designed
to provide investors with material facts concerning securities
publicly offered for sale by an issuing company or any person in a
control relationship to such company by the use of the mails or
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and to prevent misrepresentation, deceit, or other fraudulent practices in the sale of securities
generally. Disclosure is obtained by requiring the issuer of such
securities to .filewith the Commission a registration statement which
includes a prospectus containing significant financial and other
information about the issuer and the offering. The registration statement is available for public inspection as soon as it is .filed. Although
the securities may be offered after the registration statement is
.filed,sales may not be made until the registration statement has become "effective." A copy of the prospectus must be furnished to
each purchaser at or before the sale or delivery of the security. The
registrant and the underwriter are responsible for the contents of
the registration statement. The Commission has no authority to
control the nature or quality of a security to be offered for public
sale or to pass upon its merits or the terms of its distribution. Its
action in permitting a registration statement to become effective does
not constitute approval of the securities, and any representation to
a prospective purchaser of securities to the contrary is made unlawful
by Section 23 of the Act.
DESCRIPTION

OF THE REGISTRATION

PROCESS

Registration Statement and Prospectus

Registration of any security proposed to be publicly offered may
be effected by filing with the Commission a registration statement
on the applicable form containing the prescribed disclosure. Generally speaking, when a registration statement relates to a security
issued by a corporation or other private issuer, it must contain the
information, and be accompanied by the documents, specified in
Schedule A of the Act; when it relates to a security issued by
a foreign government, the material specified in Schedule B must be
supplied. Both schedules specify in considerable detail the disclosure
20

TWENTY-NINTH

ANNUAL REPORT

21

which should be made available to an investor in order that he may
make a realistic appraisal of the company and the securities and
thus exercise an informed judgment whether to buy the security. In
addition, the Act provides flexibility in its administration by empowering the Commission to classify issues, issuers and prospectuses,
to prescribe appropriate forms, and to increase, or in certain instances
vary or diminish, the particular items of information required to
be disclosed in the registration statement as the Commission deems
appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors,
The Commission has prepared special registration forms which vary
in their disclosure requirements so as to provide maximum disclosure
of the essential facts pertinent in a given type of case while at the
same time minimizing the burden and expense of compliance with
the law.
In general, the registration statement of an issuer other than a foreign government must describe such matters as the names of persons
who participate in the direction, management, or control of the issuer's
business; their security holdings and remuneration and the options or
bonus and profit-sharing privileges allotted to them; the character
and size of the business enterprise, its capital structure, past history
and earnings, and its financial statements, certified by independent
accountants; underwriters' commissions; payments to promoters made
within 2 years or intended to be made; the interest of directors, officers
and principal stockholders in material transactions; pending or threatened legal proceedings; and the purpose to which the proceeds of the
offering are to be applied. The prospectus constitutes a part of the
registration statement and presents the more important of the required
disclosures.
Examination

Procedure

Registration statements are examined by the staff of the Division of
Corporation Finance for compliance with the standards of accurate
and full disclosure. The registrant is usually notified by an informal
letter of comment of any material respects in which the statement
appears to fail to conform with the applicable requirements and is
afforded an opportunity to file correcting or clarifying amendments.
In addition, the Commission has power, after notice and opportunity
for hearing, to issue an order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement if it finds that material representations are misleading, inaccurate or incomplete. In certain cases, such as where the
deficiencies in a registration statement appear to stem from careless
disregard of applicable requirements or from a deliberate attempt to
conceal or mislead, a letter of comment is generally not sent and the
Commission either institutes an investigation to determine whether

22

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

stop-order proceedings should be instituted or immediately institutes
stop-order proceedings. Information about the use of this "stoporder" power during 1963 appears below under "Stop-Order
Proceedings."
Time Required to Complete Registration

Because prompt examination of a registration statement is important to industry, the Commission endeavors to complete its analysis
in as short a time as possible. The Act provides that a registration
statement shall become effective on the 20th day after it is filed (or on
the 20th day after the filing of any amendment thereto) . Since most
registration statements require one or more amendments, they usually
do not become effective until some time after the original 20-day
period. This waiting period is intended to afford investors an opportunity to become familiar with the proposed offering through the
dissemination of the preliminary form of prospectus. The Commission is empowered to accelerate the effective date so as to shorten the
20-day waiting period where the facts justify such action, In exercising this power, the Commission is required to take into account the
adequacy of the information respecting the issuer theretofore available
to the public, the ease with which the facts about the new offering can
be disseminated and understood, and the public interest and the protection of investors. The note to Rule 460 under the Act indicates, for
the information of interested persons, some of the more common situations in which the Commission considers that the statute generally
requires it to deny acceleration of the effective date of a registration
statement.
During the 1963 fiscal year, 985 registration statements became
effective.' The number of calendar days which elapsed from the date
of the original filing to the effective date of registration for the median
registration statement was 52, compared with 78 days for 1,646 registration statements in fiscal year 1962, and 55 days for 1,389registration
statements in fiscal year 1961. The number of registration statements
filed during fiscal year 1963was 1,159,as compared with 2,307 and 1,830
in fiscal years 1962and 1961,respectively,"
The following table shows by months during the 1963 fiscal year
the number of calendar days for the median registration statement
during each of the three principal stages of the registration process,

VOLUME OF SECURITIES

REGISTERED

During the fiscal year 1963, a total of 1,157 statements in the amount
of $14.8 billion became fully effective under the Securities Act of 1933.
This was a decrease of 37 percent in number of statements and 24 percent in dollar amount from the record registrations of the preceding
fiscal year. The chart on page 9 shows the number and dollar amounts
of fully effective registrations from 1935 to 1963.
These figures cover all registrations which became fully effective,
including secondary distributions and securities registered for other
than cash sale, such as exchange transactions and issues reserved for
conversion. Of the dollar amount of securities registered in 1963,
80 percent was for account of issuer for cash sale, 12 percent for account of issuer for other than cash sale and 8 percent for account of
others, as shown below.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The $11.9 billion of securities to be offered for cash sale for account
of issuer represented a decrease of $4.4 billion, or 27 percent, from the
previous year. This was due chiefly to a decrease of almost $4.3 billion
in common stock, debt securities declining by only $140 million. Debt
securities made up $4.4 billion of the 1963 volume, preferred stock $270
million and common stock $7.2 billion. Of issues for cash sale, most
of the common stock, 88 percent, was to be offered over an extended
period, including investment company issues, stock to be issued under
employee purchase plans and stock called for by warrants and options.
Appendix Table 1 shows the number of statements which became
effective and total amounts registered for each of the fiscal years 1935
through 1963, and contains a classification, by type of security, of issues
to be offered for cash sale on behalf of the issuer during those years.
More detailed information for 1963 is given in Appendix Table 2.
Corporate issues scheduled for immediate offering following effective registration amounted to $5.1 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion
from the previous year. Of the total, electric, gas and water companies
registered $2.3 billion of securities, about the same amount as in the
preceding 2 years. The total for communication companies was $1.1
billion, exceeding the volume registered in fiscal year 1962 by 35 percent. All other groups, except for the extractive industry, registered
lower amounts for immediate offering. The decline was greatest for
manufacturing companies with $850 million of issues in 1963 compared
with $1.8 billion in 1962. Issues registered for offering over an extended period amounted to $6.5 billion, as against $9.7 billion in fiscal
year 1962.

REGISTRATION

STATEMENTS

FILED

During the 1963 fiscal year, 1,159 registration statements were filed
for offerings of securities aggregating $14.7 billion, as compared with
2,307 registration statements filed during the 1962 fiscal year for
offerings amounting to $21.6 billion. This represents a decrease of
49.8 percent in the number of statements filed and 32 percent in the
dollar amount involved.
Of the 1,159 registration statements filed in the 1963 fiscal year, 357,
or 31 percent, were filed by companies that had not previously filed
registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933. Comparable
figures for the 1962 and 1961 fiscal years were 1,377, or 60 percent,
and 958, or 52 percent, respectively.
From the effective date of the Securities Act of 1933 to June 30, 1963,
a cumulative total of 22,854 registration statements has been filed
under the Act by 10,863 different issuers, covering proposed offerings
of securities aggregating over $240 billion.

STOP ORDER PROCEEDINGS

Section 8(d) provides that, if it appears to the Commission at any
time that a registration statement contains an untrue statement of
a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to 'be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
the Commission may institute proceedings looking to the issuance of
a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement.

Two of the proceedings which were terminated during the fiscal
year through the issuance of stop orders are described below:
The Richmond Corporation.-The
registrant, a District of Columbia corporation organized in 1959, engages in various phases of the
real estate business, including the ownership of undeveloped acreage,
income-producing properties, and promissory notes secured by mortgages and deeds of trust. It filed a registration statement covering a
proposed offering of 142,858 shares of 10 cent par value common stock
at $7 per share, 36,500 common stock purchase warrants to be sold to
the underwriter at 1 cent per warrant, and 36,500 shares of common
stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of the warrants.
The Commission instituted proceedings under Section 8 (d), and the
registrant stipulated certain facts and consented to the entry of a stop
order," Following are some of the more important deficiencies in the
registration statement:
The Commission found the registration statement to be materially
deficient in failing to disclose that various officers and directors of the
registrant were engaged, through companies similar to the registrant
which they control, or in person, in competitive real estate activities
which involved potential conflicts of interest with the business purposes of the registrant. The Commission accordingly concluded that
the statement in the prospectus that "There are no business relations
between the Board members or officers or promoters which are competitive with, or in conflict with the business purposes of the company," was materially false and misleading.
The managing underwriter named in the registration statement, a
sole proprietorship, was organized February 14, 1961. Its owner's
only prior experience in the securities business was as a securities salesman between May and December 1960. The firm's only experience as

COMMISSION

an underwriter was in connection with two proposed offerings neither
of which involved securities of real estate investment companies. One
of these offerings was deregistered shortly after the registration state-

ment became effective. In the other offering, made pursuant to a
claimed exemption from registration under Regulation A under the
Act, the firm acted together with co-underwriters and sold 30,000
shares at $2 per share. The Commission held that the limited experience of the underwriter was a material factor bearing on the success
of the offering and that the failure to disclose it was a material
omission.
The Commission's opinion stated that the underwriter's investigation of registrant's business was so limited in nature that he did not
exercise the degree of care necessary for and required of an underwriter to satisfy himself as to the accuracy and adequacy of the prospectus. His investigation consisted of (1) visits to two of the registrant's three tracts of land, (2) an examination of a list of registrant's
stockholders and (3) the obtaining of a credit report on the registrant's
president. As to all other matters in connection with the registration
statement, the underwriter apparently relied only on representations
of the registrant's management. The Commission referred to a report,
which preceded the passage of the Act, in which the Congress recognized that the high standards of honesty, care and competence required
of fiduciaries were responsibilities assumed by reputable investment
bankers.' The Commission also cited various provisions in the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act which imposed upon underwriters a responsibility to conform to those standards upon pain of
severe civil liability or revocation of broker-dealer registration.
Doman Helicopters, Inc.-The registrant was organized in 1945
for the purpose of developing certain inventions in the field of helicopter rotor construction. It had never engaged in any substantial
manufacturing activity and had never earned a profit. Its financial
history had been marked by continual difficulties and by the repeated
conversion of creditors' rights into common stock positions. Its future
plans were predicated on a proposed helicopter to be called the DlOB, which was intended to be a variant of an earlier model, two
prototypes of which had been sold to and tested by the Defense Department. After testing these earlier prototypes and after making an
extensive study of the registrant's rotor system, the Department of
Defense had found "no significant advantages in the Doman rotor
system over other types."
On April 19, 1962, registrant filed a registration statement wi~h
respect to 681,971shares of its common stock to be offered to the public
• H. Rept. No. SIl. 1M Cong., 1st Sess. (1983) at p. II.

TWENTY-NINTH

without the aid of underwriters. At that time its liabilities were in
excess of its assets and its shares had a book value of minus 30 cents
per share. This book value would have increased to 55 cents per share
if all of the shares covered by the registration statement had been sold
at the proposed offering price. Purchasers would therefore have suffered a substantial immediate dilution, the benefit of which would
have inured entirely to the existing stockholders.
The cover page of the prospectus stated that the shares were being
offered as a speculation and referred the reader to a section headed
"The Company," which summarized the registrant's poor financial
history and stated that it was then insolvent, but which made no
reference to the dilution aspects of the offering, to the fact that there
was no D-IOB in existence, or to the history of the registrant's dealings with the Defense Department. Elsewhere in the prospectus a
passing reference was made to the registrant's unsuccessful efforts to
secure military markets for its helicopters. But neither the nature
of those efforts, which had in fact been strenuous and persistent, nor
the Department's adverse action with respect to them was disclosed.
The prospectus spoke of the D-IOB as though it were an existing
helicopter and claimed that it was superior to other helicopters without ever disclosing that it had never been flown, tested or even assembled in prototype form. The prospectus claimed that the registrant's hingeless rotor system was superior to other devices, stated
that it was the "only fully developed and proven helicopter design
concept" that did not involve the use of hinges, and implied that the
system was protected by an elaborate patent structure. It did not
disclose the fact that the system had never been subjected to normal
day to day usage and made no mention of the fact that two of the
registrant's competitors were developing hingeless rotor systems, something that the registrant's patents did not preclude them from doing.
Moreover, during the course of the stop order proceedings the registrant conceded that hingelessness was not in itself meaningful and
that the discussion of hingelessness in the prospectus was incomplete.
The Commission issued a stop order that suspended the effectiveness
of the registration statement," It found that there was no adequate
factual foundation for the registrant's claims with respect to the
merits of the D-IOB and its hingeless rotor system. The failure to
disclose the facts that the Department of Defense had found registrant's hingeless rotor system to be devoid of any special merit was
held a material omission. The registrant argued that it was under
no duty to disclose the Defense Department findings because the persons who made them were biased and incompetent and because it did

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

not intend to sell to the military. The Commission disagreed, holding that: "Irrespective of the correctness of the Department's conclusions, they constitute a determination by the technical staff and
responsible authorities of the largest single purchaser of helicopters
that for their purposes registrant's rotor system has no special merit.
Such determination was a significant adverse factor, and the failure
to disclose it rendered the prospectus misleading."
The Commission also found, among other deficiencies, that the
prospectus "presented an incomplete and distorted portrayal of the
complex of risk elements involved," that "it was essential that the
speculative aspects of registrant's business and the dilution aspects
of the offering be set forth and described concisely and lucidly at the
very outset of the prospectus under an appropriate caption directing
attention to the fact that special risks are present," and that neither
the heading "The Company" used in the body of the prospectus nor
the statement on its cover page that the securities were offered as
a speculation was sufficient to serve that purpose.
Registrant argued that the registration statement against which
the proceeding was directed was a mere "preliminary filing," which
it had always intended to amend, contended that the proceeding had
been prematurely brought since no letter of comment had been sent
by the Commission's staff, and asked the Commission to deem the
registration statement to have been superseded by an amended registration statement filed while the hearings were in progress. The
Commission held that registrant's "preliminary filing" concept had
no statutory basis, that "registrants are under a duty to make every
effort to see to it that their initial filings measure up to the standards
prescribed by the Act," and that letters of comment were merely informal administrative aids "developed ... for the purpose of assisting those registrants who have conscientiously attempted to comply
with the Act," which are "not generally employed where the deficiencies appear to stem from careless disregard of the statutes and rules
or a deliberate attempt to conceal or mislead or where the Commission
deems formal proceedings necessary in the public interest." With
respect to the assertedly curative amendment that had been filed after
the institution of the proceeding, the Commission pointed out that
it considers such amendments only when it is of the opinion that such
consideration will be in the best interests of investors and of the public.
It concluded that this was not such a case in view of the serious character of the deficiencies, the large amount of the registrant's stock
outstanding and held by approximately 8,000public investors, the fact
that the misleading information in the registration statement had
been a matter of public record on which investors might have relied,

TWENTY-NINTH

and the further facts that the registrant had done nothing to advise
its stockholders and investors generally of the misleading character
of the information in the registration statement, and that the amendment was itself misleading and inadequate.
EXAMINATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission is authorized by Section 8 (e) of the Aot to make
an examination in order to determine whether a stop order proceeding should be instituted under Section 8(d) . For this purpose the
Commission is empowered to examine witnesses and require the production of pertinent documents. The Commission is also authorized
by Section 20(a) of the Act to make an investigation to determine
whether any provision of the Act or of any rule or regulation prescribed thereunder has been or is about to be violated. In appropriate
cases, investigations are instituted under this Section as an expeditious
means of determining whether a registration statement is false or misleading or omits to state any material fact. The following table
indicates the number of such examinations and investigations with
which the Commission was concerned during the fiscal year:

EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION OF SMAIL ISSUES

The Commission is authorized under Section 3 (b) of the Securities
Act to exempt, by its rules and regulations and subject to such terms
and conditions as it may prescribe therein, any class of securities from
registration under the Act, if it finds that the enforcement of the registration provisions of the Act with respect to such securities is not
necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors
by reason of the small amount involved or the limited character of the
public offering. The statute imposes a maximum limitation of $300,000 upon the size of the issues which may be exempted by the Commission in the exercise of this power.
Acting under this authority, the Commission has adopted the following exemptive rules and regulations:

Regulation B: Exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas
rights up to $100,000.
Regulation F: Exemption for assessments on assessable stock and for
assessable stock offered or sold to realize the amount of assessment
thereon.

Under Section 3(c) of the Securities Act, which was added by
Section 307(a) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, the
Commission is authorized to adopt rules and regulations exempting
securities issued by a company which is operating or proposes to operate as a small business investment company under the Small Business
Investment Act. Acting pursuant to this authority, the Commission
has adopted a Regulation E which exempts upon certain terms and
conditions limited amounts of securities issued by any small business
investment company which is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This regulation is substantially similar to the one
provided by Regulation A adopted under Section 3 (b) of the Act.
Exemption from registration under Section 3 (b) or 3 (c) of the Act
does not carry any exemption from the civil liabilities for false and
misleading statements imposed upon any person by Section 12(2)
or from the criminal liabilities for fraud imposed upon any person by
Section 17 of the Act.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation A

The general exemption under Section 3 (b) is embodied in Regulation
A, Rules 251-263 under the Act, which permits a company to obtain
needed capital not in excess of $300,000 (including underwriting commissions) in any 1 year from a public offering of its securities without
registration, if the company complies with certain requirements.
Secondary offerings by control persons are limited under the regulation to $100,000 in a year for anyone such person, but a total of
$300,000 for all such persons and the issuer. Regulation A requires
that the issuer file a notification supplying basic information about the
company, certain exhibits, and an offering circular which must be used
in offering the securities. However, in the case of a company with an
earnings history which is making an offering not in excess of $50,000
an offering circular need not be used. A notification is filed with the
Regional Officeof the Commission in the region in which the company
has its principal place of business.
During the 1963 fiscal year, 517 notifications were filed under Regulation A, covering proposed offerings of $101,040,982,compared with
1,065 notifications covering proposed offerings of $237,238,600 in the
1962 fiscal year. Included in the 1963total were 34 notifications covering stock offerings of $3,819,980 with respect to companies en~a~ed

Suspension of Exemption

Regulation A provides for the suspension of an exemption thereunder where, in general, the exemption is sought for securities for
which the regulation provides no exemption or where the offering is
not made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the regulation
or with prescribed disclosure standards. Following the issuance of a
temporary suspension order by the Commission, the respondents may
request a hearing to determine whether the temporary suspension
should be vacated or made permanent. If no hearing is requested
within 30 days after the entry of the temporary suspension order and
none is ordered by the Commission on its own motion, the temporary
suspension order becomes permanent.
During the 1963fiscal year, temporary suspension orders were issued
in 53 cases, which, added to the 31 cases pending at the beginning of
the year, resulted in a total of 84 cases for disposition. Of these, the
temporary suspension order was vacated in 2 cases and became permanent in 55 : in 27 by lapse of time, in 20 by withdrawal of the request
for hearing, and in 8 after hearing. Thus, there were 27 cases pending
at the end of the fiscal year.
One of the cases disposed of during the year is summarized below
to illustrate the type of misrepresentations and other noncompliance
with the regulation which led to the issuance of suspension orders.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

General Aeromation, Inc.-General Aeromation filed a notification and offering circular under Regulation A in March 1960,relating
to a proposed public offering of 84,450 shares of common stock at $3
per share. The company proposed to develop and market a selfpowered vehicle, invented by Henry J. Wiebe, the issuer's president,
and named "Romatt," which was designed to transport aircraft to and
from various airport locations such as hangars and runways. One
version of the vehicle was designed for commercial use and another
for military use. The offering circular included a letter from the
issuer's patent attorney to the effect that the Air Force and commercial airlines were "desperately" in need of ground handling equipment, and the circular stated that the device had been checked by competent industry sources, that no satisfactory ground equipment of comparable nature was available, and that no direct known competition
existed employing the Romatt method of moving heavy aircraft on the
ground. The offering circular projected a military market of up to
1,000Romatt-type vehicles and stated that the issuer expected to market or lease a considerable number of units to commercial airlines "as
they are manufactured and . . . tested."
In its order suspending the exemption for this offering, the ComIt
mission held that these representations were false or misleading,"
found that, at the time of filing, both commercial and military aircraft
were being handled by specially designed ground equipment which
was considered to be reasonably adequate. During 1958, the Air
Force had issued a request for proposals for the development of
ground equipment which would meet certain performance specifications, but several proposals submitted by Wiebe and the issuer had
been rejected. There was no tangible evidence of prospects of acceptance of the vehicle for commercial use, and at the time of the
filing, no commercial model had been completed, tested or demonstrated in actual operation.
The Commission stated that, regardJess of whether the issuer in
good faith believed in the merits and potential success of its product,
it must make an adequate, accurate and fair presentation of all material factors so that public investors may be able to decide for themselves whether to invest. It further stated that the presentation of
an optimistic picture of the issuer's prospects, -though qualified by
certain general concessions, but without disclosure of significant
adverse information, created a materially misleading picture even
though individual representations in another context might not be
objectionable.

ANNUAL REPORT

The Commission rejected certain evidence proffered by the issuer
after the recommended decision of the hearing examiner and exceptions thereto had been filed, which assertedly reflected certain favorable developments. It pointed out that its findings were based on
the deficiencies of the offering circular at the time it was filed and that
subsequent developments could not remedy prior misstatements and
failures to state adverse material facts.
In addition to the misstatements discussed above, the Commission
found that there were a number of other misstatements in the offering
circular, that the aggregate offering price exceeded $300,000, and that
offering circulars were mailed out earlier than permitted.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation B

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1963, 231 offering sheets and
248 amendments thereto were filed pursuant to Regulation B and were
examined by the Oil and Gas Section of the Commission's Division
of Corporation Finance. During the 1962 and 1961 fiscal years, 229
and 261 offering sheets, respectively, were filed. The following table

Exempt Offerings Under Regulation E

Regulation E provides a conditional exemption from registration
under the Securities Act of 1933 for securities of small business investment companies which are licensed under the Small Business
Investment Act of 1958, or which have received the preliminary approval of the Small Business Administration and have been notified
by the Administration that they may submit an application for such
a license.
The Regulation, which is similar in many respects to the general
exemption provided by Regulation A, requires the filing of a notifica-

36

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

tion with the Commission and, except in the case of offerings not in
excess of $50,000,the filing and use of an offering circular containing
certain specified information.
Regulation E provides for the suspension of the exemption in particular cases if the Commission finds that any of the terms and conditions of the regulation have not been met or complied with.
During the 1963 fiscal year, one notification was filed under Regulation E, covering a proposed offering of $264,000, and became
effective.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation F

Regulation F provides an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act for assessments levied upon assessable stock and for
delinquent assessment sales in amounts not exceeding $300,000in any
one year. It requires the filing of a simple notification giving brief
information with respect to the issuer, its management, principal security holders, recent and proposed assessments and other security
issues. The Regulation requires a company to send to its stockholders,
or otherwise publish, a statement of the purposes for which the proceeds from the assessment are proposed to be used. If the issuer
should employ any other sales literature in connection with the assessment, copies of such literature must be filed with the Commission.
During the 1963 fiscal year, 35 notifications were filed under Regulation F, covering assessments of $937,425. Regulation F notifications were filed in three of the nine regional officesof the Commission:
Denver, San Francisco and Seattle. Underwriters were not employed in any of the Regulation F assessments.
Regulation F provides for the suspension of an exemption thereunder, as in Regulation A, where the Regulation provides no exemption or where the offering is not made in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Regulation or in accordance with prescribed
disclosure standards.
One Regulation F filing was temporarily suspended in the fiscal
year 1963. No hearing was requested and none was ordered by the
Commission, with the result that the suspension order became
permanent on the 30th day after its entry.

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides for the registration
and regulation of securities exchanges and the registration of securities listed on such exchanges and it establishes, for issuers of securities so registered, financial and other reporting requirements,
regulation of proxy solicitations and requirements with respect to
trading by directors, officers and principal security holders. The
Act also provides for the registration and regulation of national
securities associations and of brokers and dealers doing business in
the over-the-counter market, contains provisions designed to prevent
fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative acts and practices on the
exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets and authorizes the
Federal Reserve Board to regulate the use of credit in securities
transactions. The purpose of these statutory requirements is to ensure the maintenance of fair and honest markets in securities transactions on the organized exchanges and in the over-the-counter
markets.

Each national securities exchange reports to the Commission disciplinary actions taken against any member, member firm, or person
connected therewith, for violation of any rule of the exchange, of the
Securities Exchange Act, or of any rule or regulation thereunder.
During the year 9 exchanges reported 75 cases of such disciplinary
actions, including imposition of fines ranging from $50 to $5,000 in
34 cases, with total fines aggregating $58,350; the suspension from
membership of 4 member firms and 15 individuals, 2 of whom also had
their specialist registration revoked; the expulsion of 3 individual
members and 1 allied member; the revocation of the registration of 1
member as an odd-lot and round-lot dealer; and the censure of a number of individuals and firms. Various other sanctions were imposed
against registered representatives and other employees of member
firms.
REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES

Unless a security is registered under the Exchange Act or is exempt
from such registration it is unlawful for a member of a national securities exchange or a broker or dealer to effect any transaction in
the security on an exchange. In general, the Act exempts from registration obligations issued or guaranteed by a state or the Federal Government or by certain subdivisions or agencies thereof and authorizes
the Commission to adopt rules and regulations exempting such other
securities as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate to exempt in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Under
this authority the Commission has exempted securities of certain banks,
certain securities secured by property or leasehold interests, certain
warrants and, on a temporary basis, certain securities issued in substitution for or in addition to listed securities.
Pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, an issuer may register
a class of securities on an exchange by filing with the Commission and
the exchange an application which discloses pertinent information concerning the issuer and its affairs. Information must be furnished
regarding the issuer's business and capital structure, the terms of its
securities, the persons who manage or control its affairs, the remuneration paid to its officers and directors, and the allotment of options,
bonuses and profit-sharing plans, and financial statements certified
by independent accountants must be filed as part of the application.
Form 10 is the form used for registration by most commercial and
industrial companies. There are specialized forms for certain types of
securities, such as voting trust certificates, certificates of deposit and
securities of foreign governments.

TWENTY-NINTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

39

Section 13 requires issuers having securities registered on an exchange to file periodic reports keeping current the information furnished in the application for registration.
These periodic reports
include annual reports, semi-annual reports, and current reports. The
principal annual report form is Form 10-K which is designed to keep
up-to-date the information furnished in applications filed on Form
10. Semi-annual reports required to be furnished on Form 9-K are
devoted chiefly to furnishing mid -year financial data. Current reports
on Form 8-K are required to be filed for each month in which any
of certain specified events have occurred. A report on this form deals
with matters such as changes in control of the registrant, important
acquisitions or dispositions of assets, the institution or termination of
important legal proceedings and important changes in the issuer's capital securities or in the amount thereof outstanding.
Statistics Relating to Registration of Securities on Exchanges

As of June 30, 1963, a total of 2,417 issuers had 4,048 classes of securities listed and registered on national securities exchanges, of which
2,835 were classified as stocks and 1,213 as bonds. Of these totals, 1,359
issuers had 1,578stock issues and 1,135 bond issues listed and registered
on the New York Stock Exchange. Thus, 56 percent of the issuers,
56 percent of the stock issues and 94 percent of the bond issues were
on the New York Stock Exchange.
During the 1963 fiscal year, a total of 195 applications for registration of classes of securities on exchanges was filed. Securities were
listed and registered for the first time by 115 issuers; the registration
of all securities of 103 issuers was terminated.
The following table shows the number of reports filed during the
fiscal year pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act and those filed
under Section 15(d) of the Act by issuers obligated to file reports by
reason of having publicly offered securities effectively registered under the Securities Act of 1933. As of June 30,1963, there were 2,827
such issuers, including 297 that were also registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The table also
includes the number of annual reports, quarterly reports and reports
to stockholders filed by issuers subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 30 of the Investment Company Act.

The June 30 values were as reported by the New York Stock Exchange and as estimated for all other exchanges. Volumes included
shares, warrants and rights. Comprehensive statistics of volumes on
exchanges are included among the appendix tables in this Annual
Report. Aggregate market values over the years are not strictly comparable, since they do not indicate to what extent changes are due to
new listings, mergers into listed companies, removals :from li.sting,
and the like.
Foreign Stock on Exchanges

The market value on December 31, 1962, of all shares and certificates
representing foreign stocks on the stock exchanges was reported at
about $12.7 billion, of which $10.7 billion represented Canadian and
$2.0 billion represented other foreign stocks. The market values of
the entire Canadian stock issues were included in these aggregates.
Most of the other foreign stocks were represented by American Depositary Receipts or American shares, only the outstanding amounts of
which were used in determining market values.

The number of foreign stocks on the exchanges has declined somewhat in recent years, owing principally to a reduction on the
American Stock Exchange from 152 in 1956, to 127 in 1962. Trading
in foreign stocks has fallen from 42.4 percent of the reported share
volume on this Exchange in 1956, to 18.1 percent in 1962.

TWENTY-NINTH

43

ANNUAL REPORT

Trading in foreign stocks on the New York Stock Exchange represented about 3.4 percent of the reported share volume thereon in 1956,
and about 3 percent in 1962.
Reported volumes in foreign shares during 1962 consisted of about
43.5 million Canadian shares and 12.5 million other foreign shares
on the American Stock Exchange and about 10 million Canadian
shares and 19 million other foreign shares on the New York Stock
Exchange. While the share volume on the American exceeded that
on the New York Stock Exchange, it would appear that in view of
higher average share prices, the latter Exchange had a greater dollar
volume in foreign shares.
Comparative Exchange Statistics

The number of stocks on the New York and American Stock Exchanges has continued to increase, while the aggregate number of
stocks exclusively on the other exchanges has continued to decline, in
recent years.

Comparative Over-The-Counter Statistics

So far as can be ascertained from the standard securities manuals
and from reports to the Commission, there were, as of December 31,
1962, about 4,458 stocks with 300 holders or more, of about 4,136
domestic companies, which were quoted only in the over-the-counter
market. These stocks had an aggregate market value of about $90.1
billion, including $23.4 billion for bank stocks, $21.0 billion for insurance stocks, and $45.7 billion for industrial, utility, and other
miscellaneous stocks. Registered investment companies are not included in this compilation.
Ownership of over-the-counter stocks tends to be more concentrated
in officers, directors, and other controlling persons than in the case
of listed securities, and in some instances the concentration is heavy.

In addition to the stocks mentioned above, there is a large number

continuous reporting to the Commission, and whose coverage by the

T~ENTY-~

~AL

45

REPORT

standard securities manuals is generally limited to brief announcements of the circumstances of the offerings. Their number was in
excess of 1,000 on December 31, 1962, at which time they constituted
about 25 percent of the actively quoted stocks in the National Quotation Bureau services. These stocks may be presumed to have over
300 holders each. There is a further indeterminate number of stocks
with over 300 holders, inactively quoted or not publicly quoted. So
far as can be ascertained, these are for the most part stocks of small
companies.
A comprehensive view of the number of securities quoted oyer the
counter at anyone time is afforded by data supplied by the National
Quotation Bureau, which is the principal purveyor of oyer-thecounter quotations in the United States. The following table shows
the number of stocks quoted in the daily service and the corresponding aggregate number of dealer listings, as reported for a day around
January 15th annually.

• The number annually since 1925Is shown ou p, 72 of our 26th Annual Report (1960).

About half of the stocks show substantial concentration of dealer
listings, including both bids and offers. Many of the remainder are
quoted only on the bid side, indicating sporadic dealings. Some are
listed on domestic or Canadian stock exchanges.
Reporting Under Section 15(d)

Issuers reporting pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act
continue to increase in number notwithstanding numerous reductions
occasioned by listings on the exchanges or absorption into other companies by purchase of assets or mergers. The number of such issuers
increased from 2,435 on December 31, 1961, to 2,647 on December 31,
1962. The 2,647 reporting issuers included 1,887having $34.7 billion
aggregate market value of stocks. The remaining 760 issuers included
partnerships, voting trusts duplicative of listed shares, stock purchase
and employees savings plans, companies with only bonds in public
hands, registered investment companies, and numerous issuers for
whose shares no quotation was available, including a considerable
number registering in 1962but not offering their shares until 1963.

Foreign Stocks Traded Over the Counter

About 150 foreign stocks, or American shares representing foreign
stocks, were so actively quoted in the American over-the-counter
markets at the close of 1962,as to suggest the likelihood of active daily
trading therein in the United States. In addition, there are many foreign stocks which are less actively quoted in the domestic over-thecounter markets.
DELISTING OF SECURITIES FROM EXCHANGES

Pursuant to Rule 12d2-2 (Rule 12d2-1(b) until amended February 15, 1963) under Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act,
an exchange may apply to the Commission to strike securities or
an issuer may apply to withdraw its securities from exchange listing
and registration. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1963, the
Commission granted applications to remove 68 stocks, representing
63 issuers, from listing and registration. Since 2 stocks were each
delisted by two exchanges, there was a total of 'TO removals. The
removals were as follows:

ANNUAL REPORT

In accordance with the practice in recent years, practically all of the
delisting applications were filed by exchanges. The single removal
resulting from an issuer's application removed from the American
Stock Exchange a Canadian stock whose principal exchange market
was in Toronto.
The considerable number of delistings by the American Stock Exchange and the Salt Lake Stock Exchange was a result of the adoption by those exchanges, during the 1962 fiscal year, of new rules
and criteria for retention of listed status thereon.'
Delisting Proceedings Under Section 19(a)

Section 19(a) (2) authorizes the Commission to suspend for a
period not exceeding 12 months, or to withdraw, the registration of
a security on a national securities exchange if, in its opinion, such
action is necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors
and, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission finds
that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. The
following table indicates the number of such proceedings with which
the Commission was concerned during the 1963 fiscal year.

for a period not exceeding 10 days if, in its opinion, such action is
necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors and the
public interest so requires. During the 1963 fiscal year the Commission used this authority in three instances. One of these suspensions remained in effect at the end of the fiscal year.
UNLISTED

TRADING PRIVILEGES

ON EXCHANGES

Stocks with unlisted trading privileges on exchanges which are not
also listed and registered on other exchanges continued to decline in
number, £rom 187 on June 30, 1962, to 168 on June 30, 1963. The
American Stock Exchange accounted for 17 of the 19 removals. The
Pacific Coast Stock Exchange accounted for the balance of the removals, leaving only 2 stocks thereon in the strictly unlisted category.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The distribution of unlisted stocks and share volumes therein among
the exchanges is shown in Appendix Table 8 of this annual report.
The reported volume of trading on the exchanges in stocks with only
unlisted trading privileges for the calendar year 1962, was about
28,135,000shares or about 1.7 percent of the total share volume on all
the exchanges. About 90.5 percent of this volume was on the American Stock Exchange, 8.2 percent was on the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange, and 3 other exchanges contributed the remaining 1.3 percent.
The share volume in these stocks represented about 7.6 percent of the
total share volume on the American Stock Exchange and about 4.6
percent of that on the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange.
Unlisted trading privileges on some exchanges in stocks listed and
registered on other exchanges numbered 1,570 on June 30, 1963. The
volume of unlisted trading in these stocks, for the calendar year 1962,
was reported at about 49,252,000 shares. About 14.4 percent of this
volume was on the American Stock Exchange in stocks listed on
regional exchanges, and about 85.6 percent was on regional exchanges
in stocks listed on the New York or American Stock Exchanges.
While the 49,252,000 shares amounted to less than 3 percent of the
total share volume on all the exchanges, they constituted substantial
portions of the share volumes on the leading regional exchanges,
reaching about 79 percent on Boston, 69 percent on PhiladelphiaBaltimore-Washington, 68 percent on Cincinnati, 59 percent on
Detroit, 55 percent on Pittsburgh, 30 percent on Midwest, and 22
percent on Pacific Coast Stock Exchange.
Applications for Unlisted Trading Privileges

Applications by exchanges for unlisted trading privileges in stocks
listed on other exchanges, made pursuant to Rule 12f-1 under Section
12(f) of the Securities Exchange Act, were granted by the Commission during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1963, as follows:

BWCK DISTRIBUTIONS REPORTED BY EXCHANGES

The usual method of distributing blocks of listed securities considered too large for the auction market on the floor of an exchange is
to resort to "secondary distributions" over the counter after the close of
exchange trading.

TWENTY-NINTH

49

ANNUAL REPORT

In an effort to keep as much as possible of this business on their
floors, the leading exchanges adopted Special Offering Plans commencing in 1942, and the somewhat more flexible Exchange Distribution
Plans commencing in 1953. The plans, declared effective by this Commission, include an exemption from the anti-manipulative Rule 10b-2,
as set forth in paragraph (d) thereof, with respect to payment of compensation in connection with the distribution of securities.
The largest number of Special Offerings was 87 in 1944, with $32,454,000 aggregate value. The number has declined through the years,
there being only 2 in 1961, aggregating $1,503,750, and 2 in 1962,
aggregating $587,650.
The largest number of Exchange Distributions was 57 in 1954, compared with 41 in 1962. However, the $65,459,197 total in 1962 was
larger than in any previous year.
Secondary distributions, as reported since 1942, reached a peak of
$926,514,294 during the calendar year 1961, and declined to $658,780,395during 1962.

MANIPULATION

Data for

AND STABILIZATION

Manipulation

The Exchange Act describes and prohibits certain forms of manipulative activity in any security registered on a national securities exchange. The prohibited activities include wash sales and matched
orders effected for the purpose of creating a false or misleading
appearance of trading activity in, or with respect to the market for,
any such security; a series of transactions in which the price of such
security is raised or depressed, or in which actual or apparent active
trading is created for the purpose of inducing purchases or sales of
such security by others; circulation by a broker, dealer, seller, or buyer,
or by a person who receives consideration from a broker, dealer, seller
717-943-M-5

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

or buyer, of information concerning market operations conducted for
a rise or a decline in the price of such security; and the making of
any false and misleading statement of material information by a
broker, dealer, seller, or buyer regarding such security for the purpose
of inducing purchases or sales. The Act also empowers the commission to adopt rules and regulations to define and prohibit the use
of these and other forms of manipulative activity in any security
registered on an exchange or traded over the counter.
The Commission's market surveillance staff in its Division of Trading and Markets in Washington and in its New York Regional Office
and other field officesobserves the tickertape quotations of securities
listed on the New York Stock Exchange and on the American Stock
Exchange, the sales and quotation sheets of the various regional exchanges, and the bid and asked prices published by the National Quotation Bureau for about 6,000 unlisted securities to observe any unusual
and unexplained price variations or market activity. The financial
news ticker, leading newspapers, and various financial publications
and statistical services are also closely followed.
When unusual and unexplained market activity in a security is
observed, all known information regarding the security is examined
and a decision made as to the necessity for an investigation. Most
investigations are not made public so that no unfair reflection will be
cast on any persons or securities and the trading markets will not be
upset. These investigations, which are conducted by the Commission's regional offices, take two forms. A preliminary investigation
or "quiz" is conducted to discover rapidly evidence of unlawful activity. If it appears that more intensive investigation is necessary, a
formal order of investigation, which carries with it the right to subpoena witnesses and documents, is issued by the Commission. If
violations by a broker-dealer are discovered, the Commission may institute administrative proceedings to determine whether or not to revoke
his registration or suspend or expel him from membership in the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or from a national
securities exchange. The Commission may also seek an injunction
against any person violating the Exchange Act and it may refer information obtained in its investigation to the Department of Justice
recommending that persons violating the Act be criminally prosecuted. In some cases, where the activities are essentially local in
character and state jurisdiction is not open to question, the information obtained may be referred to state agencies for injunctive action
or criminal prosecution.
The following table shows the number of quizzes and investigations
pending at the beginning of fiscal 1963, the number initiated in fiscal

When securities are to be offered to the public, their markets are
watched very closely to make sure that the price is not unlawfully
raised prior to or during the distribution. A total of 1,157 registered
offerings, having a value of $14.8 billion, and 517 offerings exempt
under Section 3 (b) of the Securities Act, having a value of about
$101 million, were so observed during the fiscal year. A total of
162 other offerings, such as secondary distributions and distributions
of securities under special plans filed by the exchanges, having a
total value of $374 million, were also kept under surveillance.
Stabilization

Stabilization involves open-market purchases of securities to prevent or retard a decline in the market price in order to facilitate a
distribution.
It is permitted by the Exchange Act subject to the
restrictions provided by the Commission's Rules 10b-6, 7 and 8. These
rules are designed to confine stabilizing activity to that necessary
for the above purpose, to require proper disclosure and to prevent
unlawful manipulation.
During 1963 stabilizing was effected in connection with stock
offerings totaling 24,435,202 shares having an aggregate public offering price of $680,107,579 and bond offerings having a total offering
price of $216,689,800. In these offerings, stabilizing transactions
resulted in the purchase of 476,799 shares of stock at a cost of $12,603,474 and bonds at a cost of $3,019,225. In connection with the stabilizing transactions, 4,337 stabilizing reports showing purchases and
sales of securities effected by persons conducting the distribution were
received and examined during the fiscal year.
INSIDERS' SECURITY HOWINGS AND TRANSACTIONS

Section 16 of the Act is designed to prevent the unfair use of
information by directors, officers and principal stockholders by giving

52

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

publicity to their security holdings and transactions and by removing
the profit incentive in short-term trading by them in securities of their
company. Such persons by virtue of their position may have knowledge of the company's condition and prospects which is unavailable
to the general public and may be able to use such information to their
personal advantage in transactions in the company's securities. Provisions similar to those contained in Section 16 of the Act are also
contained in Section 17 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935 and Section 30 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
Ownership Reports

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires every person who is a direct or indirect beneficial owner of more than 10 percent
of any class of equity securities (other than exempted securities) which
is registered on a national securities exchange, or who is a director
or officer of the issuer of such securities, to file reports with the Commission and the exchange disclosing his ownership of the issuer's
equity securities. This information must be kept current by filing
subsequent reports for any month in which a change in his ownership occurs. Similar reports are required by Section 17(a) of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of officers and directors of
public utility holding companies and by Section 30(£) of the Investment Company Act of officers, directors, principal security holders,
members of advisory boards and investment advisers or affiliated
persons of investment advisers of registered closed-end investment
companies.
All ownership reports are available for public inspection as soon
as they are filed at the Commission's officein Washington and reports
filed pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act may
also be inspected at the exchanges where copies of such reports are
filed. In addition, for the purpose of making the reported information available to interested persons who may not be able to inspect
the reports in person, the Commission summarizes and publishes such
information in a monthly "Official Summary of Security Transactions
and Holdings," which is distributed by the Government Printing Office
on a subscription basis. Subscriptions to this publication exceed
16,000.
During the fiscal year, 41,807 ownership reports were filed, a slight
decrease from the record high of 42,983 reports filed during the 1962
fiscal year.
Recovery of Short-Swing Trading Profits by Issuer

In order to prevent insiders from making unfair use of information

company, Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, Section 17(b)
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and Section 30 (f) of the
Investment Company Act provide for the recovery by or on behalf
of the issuer of any profit realized by insiders from certain purchases
and sales, or sales and purchases, of securities of the company within
any period of less than 6 months. The Commission has certain exemptive powers with respect to transactions not comprehended within the
purpose of these provisions, but is not charged with the enforcement
of the civil remedies created thereby.
REGULATION OF PROXIES
Scope of Proxy Regulation

Under Sections 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, 12(e) of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and 20 (a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Commission has adopted Regulation 14 requiring the disclosure in a proxy statement of pertinent
information in connection with the solicitation of proxies, consents
and authorizations in respect of securities of companies subject to
those statutes, in order that holders of such securities will be able to
act intelligently on such matters. The regulation provides, among
other things, that when the management is soliciting proxies, any
security holder desiring to communicate with other security holders
for a proper purpose may require the management to furnish him
with a list of all security holders or to mail his communication to
security holders for him. A security holder may also, subject to
reasonable prescribed limitations, require the management to include
in its proxy material any appropriate proposal which such security
holder desires to submit to a vote of security holders. Any security
holder or group of security holders may at any time make an independent proxy solicitation upon compliance with the proxy rules, whether or
not the management is making a solicitation. Certain additional
provisions of the regulation are applicable where a contest for control
of the management of an issuer is involved.
Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed with the Commission in preliminary form prior to the date of the proposed solicitation.
Where preliminary material fails to meet the prescribed disclosure
standards, the management or other group responsible for its preparation is notified informally and given an opportunity to avoid such
defects in the preparation of the proxy material in the definitive form
in which it is furnished to stockholders.
Statistics Relating to Proxy Statements

During the 1963fiscal year, 2,396 proxy statements in definitive form
were filed under the Commission's Regulation 14 for the solicitation of

54

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

proxies of security holders; 2,375 of these were filed by management
and 21 by nonmanagement groups or individual stockholders. These
2,396 solicitations related to 2,231 companies, some 165 of which had
more than one solicitation during the year, generally for a special
meeting not involving the election of directors.
There were 2,205 solicitations of proxies for the election of directors,
174 for special meetings not involving the election of directors, and 17
for assents and authorizations for action not involving a meeting of
security holders or the election of directors.
In addition to the election of directors, the decisions of security
holders were sought through the solicitation in the 1963 fiscal year of
their proxies, consents and authorizations with respect to the following
types of matters:
Mergers, consolidations,
acquisitions of businesses, purchases and sales of
property, and dissolutions of companies____________________________

Proposals

During the 1963 fiscal year, 56 stockholders submitted a total' of 229
proposals which were included in the 134 proxy statements of 134
companies under Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14.
Typical of such stockholder proposals submitted to a vote of security
holders were resolutions relating to amendments to charters or bylaws to provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors,
limitations on granting stock options and their exercise .by key employees and management groups, sending a post-meeting report to
all stockholders, changing the place of the annual meeting of stockholders, and the approval by stockholders of management's selection
of independent auditors.
The managements of 26 companies omitted from their proxy statements under the Commission's Rule 14a-8 a total of 61 additional
proposals submitted by 45 individual stockholders. The principal
reasons for such omissions and the numbers of times each such reason
was involved (counting only one reason for omission for each pro-

posal even though it may have been omitted under more than one provision of Rule 14a-8) were as follows:
(a) 36 proposals were withdrawn by the stockholders;
(b) 8 proposals related to the ordinary conduct of the company's business;
(c) 7 proposals were not a proper subject matter under state
law;
(d) 5 proposals were not timely submitted;
(e) 3 proposals concerned a personal grievance against the
company ;
(f) 1 proposal involved substantially the same matter as one

previously submitted to security holders;
(g) 1 proposal and reason therefor was deemed misleading.
Ratio of Soliciting to Non-solieitmg

Companies

Of the 2,417 issuers that had securities listed and registered on
national securities exchanges as of June 30, 1963, 2,254 had voting
securities so listed and registered. Of these 2,254 issuers, 3 listed
and registered voting securities for the first time after their annual
stockholders' meeting in fiscal 1963; of the remaining 2,251 issuers with
voting securities, 1,875 or 83 per cent solicited proxies for the election
of directors under the Commission's proxy rules during the 1963
fiscal year.
Proxy

Contests

During the 1963 fiscal year, 27 companies were involved in proxy
contests for the election of directors. A total of 376 persons, both
management and nonmanagement, filed detailed statements as participants under the requirements of Rule 14a-ll.
Proxy statements in
18 cases involved contests for control of the board of directors and
those in 9 cases involved contests for representation on the board.
Management retained control of the board of directors in 10 of the
18 contests for control, 1 was settled by negotiation, nonmanagement
persons won 4, and 3 were pending as of June 30, 1963. Of the 9
cases where representation on the board of directors was involved,
management retained all places on the board in 6 cases.
INVESTIGATIONS

Section 21 (a) of the Act authorizes the Commission to make such
investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether any person
has violated or is about to violate any provision of the Act or any rule

ADMINISTRATIVE

A..l\fNUAL REPORT

PROCEEDINGS

Under Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act, the Commission has
the power to deny or revoke the registration of a broker-dealer. An
order of denial or revocation will be issued, after notice and opportunity for hearing, if the Commission finds that such sanction is in the
public interest and that the applicant or registrant, or any partner,
officer, director, or other person directly or indirectly controlling or
controlled by the applicant or registrant, is subject to a statutory
disqualification. The statutory disqualifications are:
(1) willfully false or misleading statements in the application
Tor registration or documents supplemental thereto;
(2) conviction within the previous 10 years of a felony or misdemeanor involving the purchase or sale of securities or arising out
of the conduct of business as a broker-dealer;
(3) injunction by a court of competent jurisdiction against engaging in any practices in connection with the purchase or sale of
securities; and
(4) willful violation of the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act or any of the Commission's rules or regulations thereunder.
The Commission has no authority to deny or revoke registration
without finding a disqualification of the types set forth. Therefore,
bad reputation or character, or inexperience in the securities business,
or even conviction of a felony unrelated to transactions in securities is
not a basis for ordering denial or revocation of registration.
Section 15A of the Exchange Act empowers the Commission to suspend or expel a broker-dealer from membership in a registered securities association upon a finding of violation of the Federal securities
laws or regulations thereunder. The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD") is the only such association. Section
19(a) (3) of the Act gives the Commission power to take similar
action against members of national securities exchanges.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 15A(b) (4) of the Securities
Exchange Act, in the absence of Commission approval or direction, no
broker or dealer may be admitted to or continued in membership in the
NASD if the broker or dealer or any partner, officer, director, or controlling or controlled person of such broker or dealer was a cause of any
order of denial or revocation of registration or suspension or expulsion
from membership which is in effect. An individual named as a cause
often is subject to one or more statutory disqualifications under Section 15(b) and his employment by any other broker-dealer thus could
also become a basis for broker-dealer revocation or denial proceedings
against such employer.

Revocation or Denial of Registration

A summary of the cases in which the Commission revoked or denied
broker-dealer registrations during the 1963 fiscal year appears at
the end of this section. However. a few cases of unusual interest or
significance are set forth in some detail in the following paragraphs:
Mac Robbins & Co., Inc.-On remand to this Commission from
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the Commission reaffirmed its previous determination that two salesmen for the firm of
Mac Robbins & Co., Inc., had engaged in fraudulent acts and practices
and were each a cause of the revocation of the broker-dealer registration of the firm. The Commission found that these two salesmen
were aware of and participated in that firm's "boiler-room" selling
activities and had themselves made unwarranted representations to
customers,"
The salesmen, Irwin Berko and Arnold Leonard Kahn, had been
named as causes of the February 1961 revocation order against Mac
Robbins & Co., Inc. along with seven other salesmen," but neither
the firm nor the other salesmen joined in the appeal. In remanding
the case to the Commission, the Court asked the Commission to reexamine the participation by Berko and Kahn in the illegal operations of the firm, including the right of the salesmen to rely on information provided by their employer.
In its subsequent decision the Commission stated that "participation
in a high-pressure sales effort involving the use of misleading sales
materials, and the making of extravagant predictions and projections,
without basis in factual information and without adequate disclosure
of material adverse information, is inconsistent with the duty of
brokers, dealers, and their salesmen to deal fairly with their customers" and a violation of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities
Acts.
On the right of salesmen to rely upon information furnished by
their employer the Commission declared, "Whatever may be a salesman's obligation of inquiry, or his right to rely on information provided by his employer, where securities of an established issuer are

being recommended to customers by a broker-dealer who is not engaged in misleading and deceptive high-pressure selling practices,
that situation is not presented here. Certainly, there can be little, if
any, justification for a claim of reliance on literature furnished by
an employer who is engaged in a fraudulent sales campaign. In our
view, a black letter rule providing exculpation of a salesman in such
circumstances, because of reliance on his employer, would place a
premium on indifference to responsibilities at the point most directly
and intimately affecting the investor."
The Commission's position was then affirmed on a subsequent appeal
to the Court of Appeals, whose decision, sub nom. Berko v. Securities
and Ewchange Oommission, is discussed on page 116 infra.
A. J. Caradean & Co., Inc.-In
this proceeding the Commission
denied an application for broker-dealer registration by A. J. Caradean
& Co., Inc. and named. Jerome H. Truen and Jack Cohen, co-owners
and principal officers of the applicant, as causes of the denial order .•
The Commission found that Truen and Cohen, while employed as
salesmen by N. Pinsker & Co., Inc., during 1957-59, had made false
and misleading statements in the offer and sale of securities of Tyrex
Drug & Chemical Corporation and Seaford-Mar Marina, Inc., in
willful violation of the anti-fraud provisions of the Federal securities
laws. Pinsker's registration had been revoked in 1960, for fraud in
the sale of Tyrex stock." "It seems clear," the Commission stated in
summarizing its findings, "that both salesmen engaged in an intensive
high-pressure telephone campaign to sell highly speculative and promotional securities to customers irrespective of their investment needs
and objectives. Their sales techniques of highly colored representations and predictions of rapid and substantial market price rises without disclosure of adverse information and the lack of adequate information were calculated not to inform but to mislead. We do not believe
that the investing public should be exposed. to further risk of fraudulent conduct by individuals such as Truen and Cohen who have demonstrated their gross indifference to the basic duty of fair dealing
required of securities salesmen."
Alexander Reid & Co., Inc.-In
this proceeding, the Commission
revoked the registration of the firm and named as causes Alexander
Silberman, its president and sole stockholder, and the firm's salesmen, for the fraudulent offer and sale of the stock of Woodland Electronics Co., Inc," The Commission found that representations made
by the respondents regarding Woodland's contracts and production
and anticipated. appreciation in the price of its stock were false or

misleading. It stated that optimistic representations, even if couched
in terms of opinion and expectation, were fraudulent when they
lacked a reasonable basis. Respondents contended that the salesmen
honestly and reasonably believed that a machine produced by Woodland would become a success, that the company had bright prospects
and that the stock would rise in price. They argued that they had
observed a demonstration of the machine, that the company had received many letters of interest, and that its balance sheet showed
working capital of about $50,000. The Commission held, however,
that these asserted facts could not afford a basis for predictions of
specific and substantial price rises and offered no reasonable basis for
enthusiastic predictions of business success.
Heft, Kahn & Infante, Inc.-This case, in which the Commission
revoked the firm's registration for fraud in the sale of stock of United
States Communications, Inc., presented the novel question of the
responsibility of a research analyst who, pursuant to his employer's
instruction, prepared fraudulent sales literature. The Commission
found, among other things, that the analyst knew or had good reason
to suspect that the key points conveyed by the "message" in the market
letters prepared by him were completely unreliable. The Commission, in concluding that the analyst participated in and aided and
abetted the firm's willful violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the
Securities Acts, stated: "A member of the research staff of a brokerdealer may well be entitled to rely, so far as he personally is concerned,
upon materials concerning a going business supplied by an issuer or
by his employer absent facts and circumstances which would raise
doubts in the mind of a careful and responsible analyst as to the reliability of the materials or the propriety of their use for a particular
purpose. In the circumstances of this case, however, we think Binday's
defense that he followed the instructions of his employer is unavailing.
By proceeding with the preparation of the false and misleading market
letter notwithstanding his knowledge of the absence of supporting facts
and in light of the all-too-evident warnings of irregularities and the
indicated irresponsibility and lack of diligence on the part of the principals of the registrant and USC [the issuer], he became an important
part of an apparatus perpetrating a fraud. Under these facts, if a
salesman had made these statements orally to his customer, we would
have no hesitancy in finding him a cause of our order of revocation.
In his fabulist role, Binday's activities were no less reprehensible
and no less willful; indeed, the market letter was designed to reach
a much wider audience than the oral statements of a salesman." 1

Other Sanctions

During the fiscal year, the Commission suspended the following
broker-dealers from membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.: Anws Treat ,& 00., Inc., for 12 months; 8 D. F.
Bernheimer & 00., Inc., for 6 months; 9 O. A. Benson &1 00., Ino., for

In Butro Bros. & 00.,12 the Commission suspended the registrant
from membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc., for 15 days, finding that registrant and its salesmen had "arranged" for the extension of credit in violation of Section 7 (a) of
Regulation T.13 A number of registrants' customers and salesmen
had financed securities transactions through First Discount Corp., a
factoring firm which made credit available in amounts greater than
those which registrant itself could have lawfully extended under the
margin requirements of Regulation T. The illegal arrangements consisted of the conduct of salesmen who acted as intermediaries between
customers and First Discount Corp., conveyed customers' communications to the factor or vice versa, and responded to requests or directives
of the factor concerning customers' transactions.
The Commission said that through these activities of its salesmen,
the broker had become "so involved in the extension or maintenance
of credit for the customer by the lender as to be held to be arranging.

These are activities in relation to the credit absent which the credit
would not be supplied by the factor. If the broker acts for the
customer or the factor in these matters, he has involved himself in
the financial arrangements which are entirely unrelated to his function of executing his customer's orders and following the customer's
instructions as to delivery of securities and payment. If the credit
provided the customer exceeds the amount which the broker could
himself extend, we think the broker has violated Regulation T."
The Commission rejected the contention that the prohibitions of
Regulation T did not apply to a salesman who arranged for the
extension of credit through a factor for his own account or that
of a member of his family. The Commission said that a salesman
who effects transactions in his own account occupies a dual role of
customer and representative of the broker-dealer and the credit restrictions of Regulation T apply to his activities in the latter capacity.
"It is immaterial," the Commission stated, "that the salesman himself
is the instrument through whom the broker-dealer arranges for the
extension of credit."
While the Commission recognized that registrant had sought to
discourage and to forbid factoring, the Commission concluded that
registrant had not been diligent and alert enough in its supervision
procedures under all the circumstances. The Commission emphasized the need for adequate supervision of branch offices in large
organizations.
Suspension of Registration

Section 15 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to suspend a broker-dealer's registration pending final determination as to whether registration should be revoked. In order
to suspend registration, the Commission must find, after notice and
opportunity for a hearing, that suspension is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest or for the protection of investors. The registrations of four broker-dealers were suspended during the past fiscal
year after hearings at which the evidence revealed that they were
engaging in serious misconduct.v
To prevent further harm to investors the Commission determined that it was in the public interest
to suspend those registrations pending determination of the question
of revocation. The entry of a suspension order is not determinative
of the ultimate questions of willful violations or revocation itself.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Net Capital Rule

The basic purpose of Rule 15c3-1, promulgated by the Commission
under Section 15(c) (3) of the Exchange Act, is to safeguard funds
and securities of customers dealing with registered broker-dealers.
This rule, commonly known as the net capital rule, limits the amount
of indebtedness which may be incurred by a broker-dealer in relation
to its capital. It provides that the "aggregate indebtedness" of a
broker-dealer may not exceed 20 times the amount of its "net capital"
as computed under the rule.
If it appears from an examination of the reports filed by a registered
broker-dealer with the Commission, or through inspection of its books
and records, that the ratio is exceeded, the Commission normally
notifies the broker-dealer of the deficiency and affords an opportunity
for compliance. Unless the capital situation is promptly remedied,
injunctive action may be taken by the Commission and in addition
proceedings may be instituted to revoke the broker-dealer's registration. During the past fiscal year, violations of the net capital rule
were charged in 33 injunctive actions and in 25 revocation proceedings
instituted against broker-dealers.
Registered broker-dealers who participate in "firm commitment"
underwritings must have sufficient capital to permit the participation
provided by the underwriting contract without impairing the capitaldebt ratio prescribed by the rule. For the protection of issuers and
customers of the broker-dealer, the Commission's staff carefully
analyzes the latest available information on the capital position of the
participants to determine whether they will be in compliance with the
rule upon assumption of the new obligations involved in the underwritings. Acceleration of the effective date of registration statements
filed under the Securities Act will be denied where underwriting commitments may engender violations of the net capital rule by any
participating underwriter. A participant found to be inadequately
capitalized to take down his commitment is notified and given an opportunity to adjust his financial position to meet the requirements of the
rule without reducing his commitments. If he is unable to meet such
requirements, he must decrease his "firm commitment" until compliance with the rule is reached. If necessary he may have to withdraw
from the underwriting or participate on a "best efforts" basis only.
As a result of recommendations of the Special Study of Securities
Markets, the Commission presently has under consideration a proposed
rule which would establish minimum net capital requirements for
broker-dealers.

TWENTY-NINTH

ANNUAL REPORT

Financial Statements

Rule 17a-5 under Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act requires registered broker-dealers to file annual reports of financial condition with
the Commission. Such reports must be certified by a certified public
accountant or public accountant who is in fact independent, with
certain specified limited exemptions applicable to situations where
certification does not appear necessary for customer protection.
Under certain circumstances member firms of national securities exchanges are exempt from the necessity of certification and an exemption is available for a broker-dealer who, since his previous report, has
limited his securities business to soliciting subscriptions as an agent
for issuers, has transmitted funds and securities promptly, and has not
otherwise held funds or securities for or owed monies or securities to
customers. Also exempt is a broker or dealer who, from the date of
his last report, has confined his business to buying and selling evidences
of indebtedness secured by liens on real estate and has carried no
margin accounts, credit balances or securities for any customers.
After his registration, a broker-dealer's first financial report must
reflect his condition as of a date between the end of the 1st and 5th
months after the effective date of the registration. All reports must
be filed within 45 days after the date as of which the report speaks.
Through these reports the Commission and the public may evaluate
the financial position and responsibility of broker-dealers. The financial report is one means by which the staff of the Commission determines whether the registrant is in compliance with the net capital
rule. Failure to file the required reports may result in the institution
of revocation proceedings. However, it is the policy of the Commission first to advise the broker-dealer of his obligations under the rule
and to give him an opportunity to file the report.
During the fiscal year 5,197 reports of financial condition were filed
with the Commission compared to the 1962total of 5,228.
As of February 14, 1963,the last date for broker-dealers to file their
1962 annual financial reports, if prepared as of December 31, 1962,
a large number were delinquent in their filings. An effort has been
made to obtain the termination of the registrations of those brokerdealers through revocation, withdrawal or cancellation. A continuing effort will be made to secure the filing of financial reports of all
registered broker-dealers in compliance with the Commission's
requirements.
Broker-Dealer Inspections

Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act provides for regular and periodic
inspections of registered broker-dealers. During the fiscal year the
717-943-64-6

66

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

number of such inspections totaled 1,534. The inspection device is a
most useful instrument in protecting investors and detecting violations
of the Federal securities laws. The inspection, among other things,
determines a broker-dealer's financial condition, reviews his pricing
practices, evaluates the safeguards employed in handling customers'
funds and securities, and determines whether adequate and accurate
disclosures are made to customers.
The Commission's inspectors also determine whether brokers and
dealers are keeping books and records as required by the Exchange Act
and the Commission's rules thereunder and conforming to the margin
and other requirements of Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board.
Inspectors also look for excessive trading or switching in customers'
accounts. Inspectors frequently find evidence of the sale of unregistered securities or of fraudulent practices such as use of improper
sales literature or sales techniques.
When inspections reveal that a broker-dealer is violating the statutes
or rules, consideration is given to the type of violation and the effect
on the public. The Commission does not take formal action as a result
of every infraction discovered. Inspections frequently reveal inadvertent violations which are discovered before becoming serious and
before customers' funds or securities are in danger. When no harm
has come to the investing public the registrant is informed of the violations and advised to correct the improper practices. If the violation appears to be willful and the public interest is best served by
formal action against the broker-dealer, the Commission will institute
appropriate proceedings.

inspection program during the fiscal year:

The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and the principal stock exchanges also conduct inspections of their members, and
some states have inspection programs. Each inspecting agency conducts inspections in accordance with its own procedures and with
particular reference to its own regulations and jurisdiction. Inspections by the Commission are primarily concerned. with the detection

TWENTY-NINTH

ANNUAL REPORT

67

of violations of the Federal securities laws and the Commission's
regulations. The inspection programs of the self-regulatory agencies
and of the states afford added protection to the public. The Commission and certain other inspecting agencies coordinate their inspections to avoid duplication and to obtain the widest possible coverage
of brokers and dealers. Agencies now participating in this coordination program include the New York Stock Exchange, the American
Stock Exchange, the Boston Stock Exchange, the Midwest Stock Exchange, the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington Stock Exchange, the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange,
and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. It is hoped
that even closer coordination may become possible in the future as
recommended by the Special Study of Securities Markets. This program, however, does not preclude the Commission from inspecting
any broker-dealer that has also been inspected by another agency, and
such inspections are made whenever reason therefor exists.
SUPERVISION

OF ACl'IVITIES

OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF

SECURITIES DEALERS, INC.

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in Section 15A (the "Maloney
Act"), provides for the registration with the Commission of national
securities associations and establishes standards for such associations.
The rules of such associations must be designed to promote just and
equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices and to meet other statutory requirements. Such
associations are essentially disciplinary in purpose and serve as a
medium for the cooperative self-regulation of over-the-counter
brokers and dealers. They operate under the general supervision of
this Commission which is authorized to review disciplinary actions
and decisions which affect the membership of members, or of applicants for membership, and to consider all changes in the rules of associations. The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD)
is the only Association registered under the Act.
In adopting legislation permitting the formation and registration
of such associations, Congress provided an incentive to membership
by permitting such associations to adopt rules which preclude a member from dealing with a nonmember, except on the same terms and
conditions as the member affords the investing public. The NASD
has adopted such rules. Accordingly, membership is necessary to
profitable participation in underwritings and over-the-counter trading
since members may properly grant price concessions, discounts and
similar allowances only to other members. Loss or denial of membership due to expulsion or suspension or other ineligibility due to a

68

SECURITIES AL~D EXCHANGE COMMISSION

statutory disqualification, or to failure to meet standards of qualification established in NASD rules, thus imposes a severe economic
sanction.
During the year NASD membership decreased by 261 to stand at
4,664 as of June 30, 1963. This net decrease was the result of 454
admissions to and 715 terminations of membership. In the same
period the registered representative population, which generally includes all partners, officers, traders, salesmen and other persons employed by or affiliated with member firms in capacities which involve
their doing business directly with the public, declined by 15,030 to
87,375. This decline was the result of 38,292terminations of registrations, as against 9,325 initial registrations and 13,937 reregistrations.
NASD Disciplinary

Actions

The Commission receives from the NASD summaries of decisions
in all disciplinary actions against members. A complaint instituting
disciplinary action must be based on allegations that a member had
violated specified provisions of the Rules of Fair Practice, although
registered representatives of members, and persons controlling or controlled by members, may also be cited for having been the cause of a
violation.
Where violations are found one or more of the available sanctions
may be imposed. These include expulsion or suspension from membership, revocation or suspension of registration as a registered representative, fine and censure. An individual may also be found to have
been the cause of a violation and of the penalty imposed on another
party for such violation. Such a cause finding can have far-reaching
effects, particularly in the case of expulsion or suspension from membership or suspension or revocation as a registered representative. A
person found to be a cause of suspension or expulsion from membership
can be employed by a member, while such suspension or expulsion is in
effect, only with approval of the Commission. Where an individual
should have been, but was not registered as a representative, a finding
that the unregistered person was a cause of an effective expulsion,
suspension or revocation acts as a disqualification from membership,
or control of or by a member, just as if such a penalty had been imposed directly on the person found a cause of the violation underlying
the decision. In many cases more than a single penalty may be imposed so that expulsion, suspension or revocation may be accompanied
by a fine and/or censure. In cases where the penalty is a fine, censure
is customarily added.
During the year the Association reported to the Commission its
final disposition in 536 disciplinary complaint actions against 503

TWENTY-NINTH

69

different member firms and 332 registered representatives."
With
respect to 88 members and 57 representatives, complaints were either
withdrawn prior to determination or were dismissed on findings that
allegations of violations had not been sustained. In the remaining
cases violations were found and some penalties were imposed on 448
members and 275 registered representatives, or other individuals who
should have been but were not registered as representatives.
The maximum penalty of expulsion from membership was applied
against 65 different members (1 member having been expelled in each
of two separate decisions) and 16 members were suspended from
membership for periods ranging from 5 days to 2 years. In many
of these expulsion or suspension cases, fines were also imposed. In
one case the penalty included suspension from membership for 5 days,
a fine of $25,000 and an assessment of $20,000 to cover costs. In 310
cases, the major penalty imposed was fines, ranging from $50 to $8,000.
In 55 other cases the only sanction imposed was censure, although
censure was usually a secondary penalty imposed where expulsion,
suspension or fines were the major penalties imposed.
Registered representatives found in violation of rules were similarly
subjected to various penalties. The registrations of 93 representatives
were revoked and 30 had their registrations suspended for periods
ranging from 15 days to 2 years. Twenty-two individuals, some of
whom should have been but were not registered as representatives,
were found to have been causes of expulsions or suspensions of their
firms. Fines were imposed on 66 representatives in amounts ranging
from $50 to $5,000. Censure was the only penalty imposed on 65
representatives found to have acted improperly.
Commission Review of NASD Action on Membership

Section 15A(b) of the Act and the bylaws of the NASD provide
that, except where the Commission finds it appropriate in the public
interest to approve or direct to the contrary, no broker or dealer may
be admitted to or continued in membership if he, or any controlling
or controlled person, is under any of the several disabilities specified
in the statute or the bylaws. By these provisions Commission approval is a condition to admission to or continuance in Association
membership of any broker-dealer who, among other things, controls
or is controlled by a person whose registration as a broker-dealer has
been revoked or who has been and is suspended or expelled from
Association membership or from a national securities exchange, or
whose registration as a registered representative has been revoked by
15 Some members were involved in more than one such case: 17 were involved in 2 cases;
4 were involved in 3; one was involved in 4; and one was involved in 6 cases. Some decisions covered more than one complaint.

the NASD or who was found to have been a cause of such an effective
order.
A Commission order approving or directing admission to or continuance in Association membership, notwithstanding a disqualification under Section 15A (b) (4) of the Act, or under an effective Association rule adopted under that Section or Section 15A(b) (3), is
generally entered only after the matter has been submitted initially
to the Association by the member or applicant for membership.
Where, after consideration, the Association is favorably inclined, it
ordinarily files with the Commission an application on behalf of the
petitioner. A broker-dealer, however, may file an application directly
with the Commission either with or without Association sponsorship.
The Commission reviews the record and documents filed in support of
the application and, where appropriate, obtains additional evidence.
At the beginning of the fiscal year one such petition was pending
before the Commission. During the year two petitions were filed;
decisions were issued in three cases; and no petitions were pending at
the year end.
The Commission found it appropriate in the publio interest to
approve petitions filed by the Association for Commission approval
of the continuance in Association membership of two firms notwithstanding their employment of disqualified persons."
However, the Commission denied an application by Bruce WilliO/ln
Grocoff, doing business as Lloyd Securities, for an order directing
the Association to continue him as a member while employing Robert
Grocoff, his father, as a controlled person." The latter had been
president and sole stockholder of R. G. Worth & Co., Inc., whose
broker-dealer registration was revoked in 1960, for willful violations
of the Commission's net capital and record-keeping rules and the
credit requirements of Regulation T. Robert Grocoff was found
a cause of that order. The violations had extended over a 3-year
period and continued even after assurances of compliance and after
an injunction had been obtained against them. The NASD had
denied applicant's request that it seek Commission approval of his
continued membership with his father as a controlled person. At
the hearing before the NASD Board of Governors it was stated
that applicant's securities business was to be taken over by Lloyd
Securities, Inc., whose principal officers and sole stockholders
were applicant and Robert Worth, and that applicant and Worth
would manage and supervise the operations of the corporation, while
Grocoff, Sr. would be employed as a salesman and an advisor with

respect to investment situations. Both applicant and Worth had
worked for a time for Worth & Co., under the supervision of Grocoff
Sr. The NASD concluded, and the Commission agreed, that in the
light of the more limited experience of applicant and Worth, and in
view of their personal and prior business relationships with Grocoff
Sr., it was difficult to believe that the proposed arrangement of control
and supervision would be adequate under the circumstances.

Review of NASD Disciplinary

Action

Section 15A(g) of the Act provides that disciplinary actions by the
NASD are subject to review by the Commission on its own motion or
on the timely application of any aggrieved person. This Section also
provides that the effectiveness of any penalty imposed by the NASD
is automatically stayed pending determination in any matter which
comes before the Commission for review. Section 15A(h) of the Act
defines the scope of the Commission's review in proceedings to review
disciplinary action of the NASD. If the Commission finds that the
disciplined person engaged in the acts or practices, or has omitted the
acts, found by the NASD and that such acts, practices, or omissions
to act are in violation of such rules of the Association as have been
designated in the determination, and that such conduct was inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade, the Commission
must dismiss such proceedings unless it finds that the penalties imposed are excessive or oppressive, having due regard to the public
interest, in which case the Commission must cancel or reduce the penalties. At the beginning of the fiscal year 15 review cases were pending
before the Commission; during the year 19 additional petitions for
review were filed, decisions were issued in 9 cases, 2 petitions were
withdrawn prior to determination, and 23 petitions were pending at
the year end. Among the significant cases decided by the Commission during the year are the following:
The Commission sustained findings by the NASD that Palombi
8eawrities 00., Ino., Edward Palombi, president and registered representative and Harry Barath, James Dei'asquaie and Marvin Jay
Polsky, registered representatives, had violated certain of the NASD
Rules of Fair Practice and that the violations constituted conduct
inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade. It also sustained the penalties imposed by the NASD, which had expelled the
firm from membership, found Palombi a cause of the expulsion and
revoked the registrations of the individuals as registered representatives.1S
The NASD had found, among other violations, that there was
such a high ratio of cancellations of retail sales by the firm in the course

of a Regulation A offering as to indicate that the respondents had
engaged in a conspiracy to and did increase sales by sending confirmations to persons who were solicited over the telephone to purchase
stock but who did not, in fact, agree to make the purchase. The Commission held that the evidence supported the NASD finding. Among
other things, it considered "the high-pressure selling methods, characteristic of a boiler-room operation" which were used by the salesmen
and which "are often accompanied by the use of false confirmations
to generate sales." The Commission also held that in determining
whether the rate of customer cancellations was beyond normal expectations, the members of the NASD District Committee properly
utilized their experience in the securities industry.
The Commission sustained the NASD's action in expelling from
Association membership Vickers, Ohristy and 00., Inc. and revoking
the registrations of Sydney G. Vickers, Jr. and William J. Ohristy
as registered representatives. This was the first case presented to the
Commission involving the responsibilities of NASD members in hiring registered representatives. The Commission (in an opinion by
Chairman Cary) concluded that under the circumstances, the penalty
of expulsion was not excessive, and observed: "Both the NASD and
we have been concerned with raising the standards of character, competence and training of securities salesmen. . . . The salesman often
represents the major point of contact between the securities business
and the general public-a minimum level here can produce maximum
damage everywhere."
Under the NASD's rules, any member which employs any person
who is required to be registered with the NASD, must have reason to
believe upon the exercise of reasonable care, and must certify to the
NASD, that such person "is of good character and of good business
repute" and is or will be qualified by training or experience to perform the functions assigned to him. This determination is the "complete" responsibility of the member, and "improper or unwarranted
certification . . . shall be deemed to be conduct contrary to high
standards of commercial honor."
The NASD found that appellants had certified to the "good character and good business repute" of four salesmen "without having
exercised reasonable care" in investigating their background. The
investigation consisted of casual interviews and a telephone call to
Biltmore Securities Corp., a former employer of three of the salesmen. That firm was a respondent in both injunctive and administrative Commission actions. One of these salesmen had himself been
the subject of injunction proceedings based on violations of the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the Federal securities acts.

TWENTY-NINTH

ANNUAL REPORT

Moreover, the four salesmen had previously been associated with one
or more of a number of other firms against which various adverse
actions had been taken. The "superficial" nature of the firm's inquiry,
the Commission stated, was highlighted by its "asserted ignorance
of Biltmore's difficulties and the prior employment records of the
salesmen. We must doubt the depth of their interviews and investigations when they failed completely to learn of the formidable record
of the salesmen's dubious connections."
The Commission also rejeeted, as immaterial, the contention that
the NASD had not found that the salesmen in fact were not of good
character and business reputation, pointing out that "the dereliction
charged concerns appellants' duty to make a reasonable inquiry and
to certify a reasonable belief based on information." The appellants
indicated that they would not have engaged the salesmen had they
known of their past connections. "Here is the crux of the case against
them" the Commission stated; "they did not know and made no reasonable effort to find out." 19
The Commission also sustained findings by the NASD that Valley
Forge Securities Oompany, Inc., and J. William Landenberger, III
and Olaude F. McDaniel, its principal officers and stockholders, violated the Commission's net capital rule, the credit restrictions of
Regulation T and the NASD's interpretation of its Rules of Fair
Practice with respect to advertising and sales literature. The NASD
had expelled the firm from membership and revoked the registrations
as representatives of Landenberger, McDaniel and another officer who
did not seek review of the NASD action.
According to the Commission's decision the firm distributed a "Financial Bulletin" designated as "A SPECIAL MEMORANDUM
REGARDING NEW ISSUES." This brochure, headed by the words
"FROM $2.50 to $76.00 PER SHARE IN SIX MONTHS," included
a list of securities that had been the subject of initial offerings which
the firm was said to have either participated in or recommended to
its clients and which were stated to have increased in price from 33
percent to 2,900 percent in very short periods of time. The brochure
offered to place the names of interested clients on a "NEW ISSUE
LIST," which would purportedly entitle them to preferential treatment in the disposition of new issues. The NASD found that while
many of the statements were superficially true, "the general connotation of such a presentation is, in our judgment, neither wholly true,
nor in the best interest of the industry." The Commission observed
that while the NASD did not in so many words find the use of the
10

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 6872. (August 8,1962).

74

SECURITIES

A..~D EXCHA.~GE COMMISSION

bulletin to be a violation of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities
Acts, the NASD did conclude that the bulletin contained statements
whose implications might mislead and that it did not provide a fair
basis for evaluating the facts presented. It also noted that the NASD's
action was based on its published interpretation of its Rules of Fair
Practice that exaggerated or sensational statements or claims, the implications of which may mislead, are prohibited.
The Commission emphasized that both it and the NASD are "concerned with raising the standards of the industry. The phenomenon
of the 'hot issue' offers the less scrupulous broker-dealer a myriad of
opportunities to trade on the public greed and gullibility characteristic of such a 'hot market.' The public is done disservice by the distribution of sales literature which attempts to sell new issues on the
basis of a 'hot' market rather than on the merits of individual securities. This is particularly so where there is no explanation of or reference to the inherent risk in investing in new and untried enterprises.
The technique used by applicants in calling attention only to past
recommendations which were or would have been profitable is inherently misleading and deceptive because by its very nature it emphasizes
the favorable facts, ignores any which are unfavorable, and fails to
caution that investment in subsequent new issues cannot always be
expected to show results comparable to the selected instances listed.
Furthermore, its appeal is bottomed on what has been colloquially referred to as the 'bigger fool' theory. This is simply the assurance that
regardless of whether the price paid for a security is fair and/or
reflective of the intrinsic value of the security or even reflective of a
rational public evaluation of the security, the security is still a good
buy because a 'bigger fool' will always come along to take it off the
customer's hands at a higher price. To imply that this theory will
be perpetually applicable is an intolerable business practice which is
the antithesis of any acceptable standards of commercial honor."
The Commission noted that applicants did not dispute their failure
to comply with the net capital rule and Regulation T and sustained
the NASD rejection of their contentions that these violations were
inadvertent and a result of a lack of experienced employees and the
inability of their accountants to prepare and submit monthly statements on time.20

PART VI
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANY ACT OF 1935
In administering the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
the Commission regulates interstate public-utility holding-company
systems engaged in the electric utility business and/or in the retail
distribution of gas. The Commission's jurisdiction also extends to
natural gas pipeline companies and other nonutility companies which
are subsidiaries of registered holding companies. Although the
matters under the Act dealt with by the Commission and its staff
embrace a variety of intricate and complex questions of law and fact
generally involving more than one area of regulation, briefly there
are three principal regulatory areas. The first covers those provisions
of the Act, contained principally in Section neb) (1), which require
the physical integration of public-utility companies and functionally
related properties of holding-company systems and those provisions,
contained principally in Section l1(b) (2), which require the simplification of intercorporate relationships and financial structures of holding company systems. The second covers the financing operations of
registered holding companies and their subsidiaries, the acquisition
and disposition of securities and properties, and certain accounting
practices, servicing arrangements and intercompany transactions.
The third includes the exemptive provisions of the Act, the provisions covering the status under the Act of persons and companies,
and those regulating the right of a person affiliated with a publicutility company to acquire securities resulting in a second such affiliation. Matters embraced within this last area of regulation come
before the Commission and its staff frequently. Many such matters
do not result in formal proceedings and others are reflected in such
proceedings only in an indirect manner when they are related to
issues principally under one of the other areas of regulation.
The Branch of Public Utility Regulation of the Commission's Division of Corporate Regulation performs the principal functions under
the Act. It observes and examines problems which arise in connection with transactions which are or may be subject to regulation under
75

76

SECURITIES A..~D EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the Act and discusses such problems with interested persons and
companies and advises them as to the applicable Sections of the Act,
the rules thereunder and Commission policy with respect thereto.
Questions are raised with and problems are presented to the staff
daily. These include questions raised by security holders and problems presented by companies contemplating transactions requiring
the filing of an application or declaration, particularly financing operations and the acquisition and disposition of securities and properties. This day-to-day activity includes prefiling discussions and conferences, in person and by telephone, with company representatives
and with other persons where the matter under consideration affects
their interest. Members of the staff of this Division actively participate in hearings and often aid the Commission in the preparation
of its decision on a particular matter. The staff continually reexamines the status of exempt companies, examines the annual reports
filed with the Commission and those sent to stockholders and must
keep abreast of new technical developments in the electric and gas
industry, including the use of atomic energy as a source of power.
COMPOSITION OF REGISTERED HOLDING-COMPANY SYSTEMS

At the close of the fiscal year there were 24 holding companies
registered under the Act. Of these, 18 are included in the 16 remaining holding-company systems which are herein classified as
"active registered holding-company systems," 2 of the 18 being subholding companies in these active systems.' The remaining 6 registered
holding companies are of relatively small size and are excluded from
the active holding-company systems," In the 16 active systems there
are 85 electric and/or gas utility subsidiaries, 40 nonutility subsidiaries, and 13 inactive companies. These, together with the 18 parent
holding companies, totaled 156 system companies. The following
table shows the number of holding companies, the number of susidiaries, classified as utility, nonutility, and inactive, in each of the
active systems as of June 30, 1963, and their aggregate assets, less
valuation reserves, as of December 31, 1962, which amounted to
$12,458,709,000:
1 These are The Potomac Edison Co., a subsidiary
of Allegheny Power System, Inc., and
Southwestern Electric Power Co.• a subsidiary of Central and South West Corp.
S These holding companies are British. American UtlUtles Corp. ; Colonial UtUltles Corp. ;
High Plains Gas Co.; Klnzua on & Gas Corp. and its subholding company. Northwestern

Section 11 Mallers

At the close of the fiscal year, there was pending before the Commission Step 2 of a Section 11 (e) plan filed by Eastern Utilities Associates,
proposing the sale of all the outstanding common stock of Valley Gas
Co. to the public common stockholders of Blackstone Valley Gas and
Electric Co. and to the shareholders of Eastern Utilities Associates.
This will constitute the final step to be taken for divestment of the
System's gas utility properties.
Prior proceedings are discussed at
page 109 of the 27th Annual Report.
On February 20, 1958, the Commission issued its Findings, Opinion
and Order pursuant to Section l1(b) (1) permitting the retention of
all of the New England Electric System's electric properties," There• 38 S.E.C. 193.

78

SECURITIES A..~D EXCHANGE COMMISSION

after, further hearings were held to consider the retainability of the
System's gas properties; briefs were filed by New England Electric
System and by the Commission's Division of Corporate Regulation;
and oral argument was heard by the Commission. At the close of the
fiscal year the matter was under advisement.
A current problem under Section 11 (b) (1) in the Middle South
Utilities system concerns the question whether New Orleans Public
Service Inc. may retain its gas and transportation properties together
with its electric properties. On January 10, 1963, a bill was introduced
in the Congress (H.R. '742,88th Cong., 1st Sess.) providing generally
that New Orleans Public Service Inc. shall not be required to dispose
of its gas or transportation properties pursuant to any provision of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The bill was referred
to the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce which, at the
close of the fiscal year, had taken no action thereon. Two similar bills
had previously been introduced in the 87th Congress, 2d Session (H.R.
10872 and H.R. 10898). No proceedings have been instituted by the
Commission regarding this problem.'
The Commission has held, with court approval, that the existence
of public minority interests in the common stock of subsidiaries of integrated registered public-utility holding-company systems constitutes
an inequitable distribution of voting power under Section 11 (b) (2).
Such minority interests have heretofore been eliminated in most of
the holding-company systems through appropriate proceedings under
the Act, but the problem still exists in several others. During fiscal
1963, informal conferences were held between the staff and representatives of Allegheny Power System, a registered holding company, looking to the elimination of a 4.8 percent public minority interest in the
common stock of one of Allegheny's subsidiary companies, West Penn
Power Company. Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, Allegheny
filed a plan pursuant to Section 11(e) of the Act, proposing that each
share of West Penn's publicly-held common stock be surrendered in exchange for 1.7 shares of Allegheny's common stock.
Other holding-company systems in which a minority interest problem exists, and as to which no proceedings have been proposed by the
systems or instituted by the Commission, are Columbia Gas System,
Eastern Utilities Associates and New England Electric System. In
respect of the latter system, the minority interests are confined to
several of the gas utility subsidiaries the retainability of which, as
noted above, is under advisement by the Commission.
'No further actton was taken dnrIng this fiscal year with respect to certain Section
11 (b) problems of several other registered holding-company systems noted at pages 104
and 108 of the 27th Annual Report.

Other Developments

On January 28, 1963, an application-declaration was filed with the
Commission relating to the proposed construction of a nuclearpowered electric generating plant by Connecticut Yankee Atomic
Power Company, all of whose outstanding capital stock would be
owned in various proportions by a group of 12 New England utility
companies, including subsidiaries of certain registered holding companies," The proposal involves the initial issuance of $5 million par
value of Connecticut Yankee's common stock to finance part of a
total estimated construction cost of about $85 million; the necessary
approvals under Section 10 of the Act for the acquisition of their
proportionate shares of such stock by 8 of the 12 sponsor companies;
the requests of 2 of the sponsor companies, each of which proposes
to acquire more than 10 percent of Connecticut Yankee's stock, for
exemptions as holding companies under Section 3 (a) ; and Connecticut Yankee's request for permission to conduct private negotiations
to determine the type, amount and method of its permanent financing
program. Halsey, Stuart & Co., Jnc., an investment banking firm,
appeared as a participant in the proceeding in opposition to the company's request to conduct such private negotiations. After the close
of the fiscal year, the Commission issued an order granting and
permitting the application-declaration to become effective, but denying the company's request to conduct private negotiations relating
to the future sale of its senior securities,"
The Commission's Rule 45(b) (6) promulgated under the Act provides that the consolidated Federal income tax liabilities of registered
holding companies and their subsidiaries may be allocated among
the members of the consolidated group without prior approval by
the Commission-provided, among other things, that such allocation
is made in accordance with the method prescribed by Section 1552
(a) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954:. This method (frequently referred to as the source-of-income method) requires that
the consolidated tax liability be apportioned among the members
of the group in accordance with the relative amount of the consolidated taxable income which is attributable to each member of the
group having taxable income. Under the Revenue Act of 1962, taxpayers installing qualified property after December 31, 1961, were
permitted, as an "investment credit," to deduct from their Federal
income taxes otherwise payable an amount equal to a percentage
"This is the second proposal to come before the Commission under the Act, relating to
a jointly sponsored atomic energy electric generating plant. See 22nd Annual Report,
pages 162-164, relating to Yankee Atomic Electric Power Company. All but one of the
sponsor companies of Connecticut Yankee are also the sponsor companies of Yankee Atomic.
• Holding Company Act Release No. 14947 (September 26, 1963).

80

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

(generally 3 percent in the case of public-utility companies) of the
cost of such qualified property. Since the investment credit taken
in a consolidated tax return reduces the group's consolidated tax
liability as determined on the basis of consolidated taxable income,
adherence to the Commission's Rule 45 (b) (6) in such circumstances
would require, in effect, that the net consolidated tax liability (i.e.,
the consolidated tax liability as reduced by the investment credit)
be apportioned among the several members of the group under the
source-of-income method. This could result in certain inequities, inasmuch as a member which generates a relatively small portion of
the group's total investment credit could have allocated to it a
disproportionately large amount of such credit; conversely, it could
penalize a member which generates a relatively large amount of the
group's total investment credit.
To resolve the problem in a manner which would accord uniform
treatment to all registered holding-company groups filing consolidated tax returns, the Director of the Commission's Division of Corporate Regulation, on February 1, 1963, sent a letter to the chief
executive of each of the registered holding companies advising him
(1) that the consolidated tax liability after giving effect to the investment credit must be allocated in accordance with Rule 45 (b) (6)
unless an exception is granted by the Commission, and (2) that the
Division saw no basis for denying requests for such an exception
which would generally give the full benefit of its investment credit
to each individual company within a consolidated group qualifying
for the credit under the Revenue Act of 1962. By the end of fiscal
1963, 11 registered holding-company systems had applied for and
received Commission approval for allocating the investment credit
in accordance with the Division's letter of February 1, 1963; and
after the close of the fiscal year an additional registered holdingcompany system applied for and received such approval."
FINANCING OF REGISTERED PUBLIC-UTILITY HOWING COMPANIES
AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES

During the fiscal year 1963, 12 registered holding-company systems

PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS OF FIRST MORTGAGE BONDS AND PRE.
FERRED STOCKS OF PUBLICUTILITY COMPANIES

Statements of policy were adopted by the Commission in 1956, codifying the standards to which provisions covering first mortgage bonds
and preferred stocks issued under the Act must conform for the protection of investors in such securities.v' Prior to 1956 these standards
had been established by the Commission on a case-by-case basis. In
passing upon the issuance of first mortgage bonds and preferred stocks
under the Act, the Commission examines the applicable mortgage
indentures and charter provisions to insure a continuing substantial
conformity with the codified standards of the respective statements of
policy. Such conformity has been uniformly required except where,
in particular circumstances, deviations from the statements of policy
are clearly justified.12

public-utility companies subject to the Act with respect to 18 first

and 4 preferred stock issues with a total par value of

The statement of policy with respect to first mortgage bonds requires, among other things, that dividends or other distributions to
common stockholders be limited so as to preserve an "equity cushion"
beneath the claims of the bondholders. This requirement was adequately provided for in the indentures covering the bond issues as filed
or as a result of informal discussions between the Commission's staff
and representatives of the issuers.
Since the bulk of bondholders' security consists of mortgaged depreciable plant and equipment, the statement of policy for bonds also
requires the periodic renewal and replacement of such property so as
to preserve the book value of the underlying security. This requirement, in substance, obligates the issuing company to provide for new
property additions (or, alternatively, to deposit cash or outstanding
bonds with the indenture trustee) in an amount which, over the estimated useful life of the mortgaged depreciable property, will maintain
the original book cost of the mortgaged property. The statement of
policy requires that the mortgage indenture express the periodic renewal and replacement obligation as a percentage of the book cost of
the mortgaged depreciable property, but where existing indentures
express the provision on some other basis (usually as a percent of
operating revenues), such alternate provision is permitted to remain
unchanged if the issuer can satisfactorily demonstrate to the Commission that the existing provision affords substantially the same protection as that based on a percent-of-property basis. To insure observance of this standard of the statement of policy, the Commission's
staff conducts a continuous study of the depreciation requirements of
the various issuers subject to the Act.
Of the 18 bond issues filed during the fiscalyear, the indentures of 14
expressed the renewal and replacement provision as a percentage of
depreciable property deemed adequate. The indentures covering 2
of the other 4 bond issues expressed the provision as a percentage of
revenues, which afforded no less protection to the bondholders than
would be afforded on an appropriate percent-of-property basis. As
to the remaining 2 bond issues, no renewal and replacement provisions
were deemed necessary since the indenture of 1 issue provided for a 100
percent amortization of the bonds through the cash sinking fund over
the life of the issue, and the indenture of the other provided for a 70
percent amortization.

With respect to the four preferred stock issues aggregating $29.5
million, as to which applications or declarations were filed during the
fiscal year, all had charter provisions in substantial conformity with
the statement of policy for preferred stock.
During the fiscal year, the Commission has continued to require adherence to the provision contained in both the bond and the preferred
stock statements of policy that the securities be freely refundable at
the option of the issuer upon reasonable notice and payment of a
reasonable redemption premium, if any.14 During fiscal year 1963,
issuers subject to the Act took advantage of the refunding privilege to
refund outstanding bond and preferred stock issues at substantial savings in interest and dividend costs under the prevailing favorable
market conditions.

Continuing studies made by the Commission's staff for fiscal year
1963 with respect to electric and gas utility bond issues sold at competitive bidding, whether or not subject to the Act, indicated that the
presence or absence of a restriction on free refund ability has not
affected the number of bids received by an issuer at competitive bidding. With respect to the ability of the winning bidder to market
the bonds, the data for fiscal year 1963 are at some variance with the
data for the previous fiscal year and for prior periods. The 28th
Annual Report, at pages 91-93, contains a summary of the results of
an examination of all electric and gas utility bond issues (including
debentures) sold at competitive bidding between May 14, 1957, and
June 30, 1962, by companies subject to the Act as well as those not so
subject. This study was extended to include fiscal year 1963.
During the period from May 14, 1957, to June 30,1963, a total of
420 electric and gas utility bond issues, aggregating $9,255.4 million
principal amount, was offered at competitive bidding. The refundable issues numbered 316 and accounted for a total of $5,931.0 million,
while the nonrefundable issues-all being nonrefundable for a period
of 5 years, except one which was nonrefundable for a period of 7
years-numbered 104 and totaled $3,324.4 million principal amount.
The number of refundable issues thus represented 75.2 percent of
the total number of issues, while, in terms of principal amount, the
refundable issues acounted for 64.1percent,"
The weighted average number of bids received on the refundable
issues for the period was 4.64, while on the nonrefundable issues it was
4.19. The median number of bids was five on the refundable and four
on the nonrefundable issues," With respect to the success of the marketing of the bond issues, an issue was considered to have been suecessfully marketed if at least 95 percent of the issue was sold at the
syndicate price up to the date of termination of the syndicate. On this
basis, 71.2 percent of the refundable issues were successful, while
67.3 percent of the nonrefundable ones were successfulY In terms of
principal amount, 68.4 percent of the refundable issues were successful,
,. During fiscal year 1963, a total of 59 bond Issues was offered, aggregating $1,416.8

while 66.5 percent of the nonrefundable ones were successful," Extension of the comparison to include the aggregate principal amounts
of all issues which were sold at the applicable syndicate prices up to
the termination of the respective SYndicates, regardless of whether a
particular issue met the definition of a successful marketing, indicates
that 86.8 percent of the combined principal amount of all the refundable issues were so sold, as compared with 83.1 percent for the nonrefundable issues.> While the statistics for the total period from
May 14,1957, to June 30,1963, developed in respect of the two groups
of bond issues support the Commission's policy of requiring free refundability of utility bond issues subject to the Act, the Commission's
staff will continue its studies of refundability provisions, particularly
in light of the inconsistent marketing results in fiscal year 1963.

Request for Declaratory Order

On May 26, 1963, a hearing was held with respect to an application
filed by Pacific Northwest Power Company pursuant to Section 5 (d)
of the Administrative
Procedure Act for a declaratory order requesting a determination as to when, in the construction of a hydroelectric plant, it will become an electric utility company within the
meaning of Section 2(a) (3) of the Act. Pacific Northwest's common
stock is owned equally by Pacific Power and Light Company, Montana Power Company, Washington Water Power Company, and
Portland General Electric Company. The application was held in
abeyance pending the outcome of proceedings before the Federal
Power Commission, in which the granting of a license to Pacific
Northwest was contested by certain public utility districts.
During
fiscal 1962, an examiner of the Federal Power Commission issued an
opinion recommending the grant of a license to Pacific Northwest.
The license proceeding before the Federal Power Commission was
reopened at the request of the Secretary of the Interior and, at the
end of fiscal 1963, the matter was under advisement by that Commission, and briefs were being prepared by the interested persons
with respect to the proceeding before this Commission.

PART VII
PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT

The Commission'srole under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act,
which provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations in the
United States district courts, differs from that under the various
other statutes which it administers. The Commissiondoesnot initiate
Chapter X proceedings or hold its own hearings, and it has no authority to determine any of the issues in such proceedings. The
Commission participates in proceedings under Chapter X in order
to provide independent, expert assistance to the courts, the participants, and investors in a highly complex area of corporate law
and finance. It pays special attention to the interests of public
security holders who may not otherwise be effectivelyrepresented.
Where the scheduled indebtedness of a debtor corporation exceeds
$3 million, Section 172 of Chapter X requires the judge, before
approving any plan of reorganization, to submit it to the Commission
for its examination and report. If the indebtedness does not exceed
$3 million, the judge may, if he deems it advisable to do so, submit
the plan to the Commission before deciding whether to approve it.
Where the Commissionfiles a report, copies or a summary must be
sent to all security holders and creditors when they are asked to vote
on the plan. The Commissionhas no authority to veto or to require
the adoption of a plan of reorganization.
The Commissionhas not considered it necessary or appropriate to
participate in every Chapter X case. Apart from the excessiveadministrative burden, many of the cases involve only trade or bank
creditors and few public investors. The Commission seeks to participate principally in those proceedingsin which a substantial public
investor interest is involved. However, the Commission may also
participate because an unfair plan has been or is about to be proposed, public security holders are not adequately represented, the
reorganization proceedings are being conducted in violation of important provisions of the Act, the facts indicate that the Commission
can perform a useful service, or the judge requests the Commission's
participation.
87

88

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The Commission has lawyers, accountants and financial analysts
in its New York, Chicago and San Francisco regional officeswho are
actively engaged in Chapter X cases in which the Commission has
filed its appearance. Supervision and review of the regional offices'
Chapter X work is the responsibility of the Division of Corporate
Regulation of the Commission, which, through its Branch of Reorganization, also serves as a field officein cases arising in the Atlanta
and Washington, D.C. regional areas.
SUMMARY OF ACI1VITIES

The Commission's activities in Chapter X this year increased over
the previous year and will probably be even more extensive in
fiscal year 1964. In fiscal 1963, the Commission entered its appearance in 32 new proceedings under Chapter X involving companies
with aggregate stated assets of approximately $152,451,000 and aggregate indebtedness of approximately $142,965,000. They involved
the rehabilitation of corporations engaged in the operation of varied
businesses, including, among others, shell home construction, chain
retail and discount stores, consumer finance, and real estate and
mortgage investment.
During the year, the Commission participated in a total of 91 reorganization proceedings, including the new proceedings.' The stated
assets of the companies in all these proceedings totaled approximately
$743,311,000 and their indebtedness totaled approximately $692,199,000. The proceedings were scattered among district courts in 31
states and the District of Columbia, as follows: 14 proceedings in
New York; 8 each in California and Florida; 7 in Illinois; 5 each in
Kentucky and Colorado; 4 each in North Carolina and Oklahoma;
3 each in Maryland, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Texas and Michigan; 2 each
in New Jersey and Montana; and 1 each in Connecticut, West Virginia, Tennessee, Utah, Washington, Indiana, Virginia, Kansas,
Georgia, Mississippi, New Mexico, Arkansas, Ohio and the District
of Columbia. Proceedings involving 13 principal debtor corporations were closed during the year. Thus, at the end of the year the
Commission was participating in 78 reorganization proceedings.
PROCEDURAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE MATI'ERS

In Chapter X proceedings in which it participates, the Commission
seeks application of the procedural or substantive safeguards to which
all parties are entitled. The Commission also attempts in its interpretations of the statutory requirements to encourage uniformity in the

construction of Chapter X and the procedures thereunder.
In Florida Southern Oorporation,z. the second mortgagee appealed
from an order of the district court approving the debtor's Chapter X
petition for reorganization. On appeal the court of appeals affirmed,
holding, as urged by the Commission, that a petition is not lacking in
"good faith" within the meaning of Section 146(3) merely because a
class of secured creditors announced in advance that it will not agree
to a plan of reorganization,"
In Flora Swn Corporations: this ruling was reaffirmed by the court
of appeals," This case also held, as urged by the Commission, that
where creditors filed an answer controverting material allegations of
the debtor's Chapter X petition, it was error for the district court
to approve the petition summarily, without a hearing, when the answer presented a triable issue of fact. The court also agreed with
the Commission that a corporation can be subject to Chapter X even
though, as argued, it was owned and controlled by a single shareholder.
In G.F.E. Industries, Ina.,6 the lessor of certain properties occupied
by the debtor urged, among other things, that the lease had terminated
pursuant to the provisions of Section 70b of the Bankruptcy Act
which provides, in part, that a lease not assumed or rejected by the
trustee within 60 days after adjudication or within 30 days after
qualification of the trustee, whichever is later, is deemed to be rejected.
The Commission urged that Section 70b is in conflict with the provisions of Chapter X regarding rejection of leases and therefore is
not applicable in proceedings under Chapter X. The district court
did not reach this question, since it found that the lessor had waived
this statutory provision. On appeal by the lessor, the Commission
again urged the inapplicability of this provision of Section 70b in
Chapter X proceedings.'

ing for lack of proper venue, arguing that a prior bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the subsidiary was pending in another district
court and that in such circumstances Section 129 does not permit a
nonresident subsidiary to file a Chapter X petition in the reorganization forum of its parent. The Commission's memorandum supporting
the Chapter X trustee's opposition to the motion reviewed the present
state of the law and the legislative history of Section 129 and its
broad policy that the administration of parent and subsidiary estates
should be centralized in a single reorganization proceeding. At the
close of the fiscal year the matter was pending before the Chapter X
court.
In Walao Buildim.g OO1'po1'ation/o the owners of land petitioned the
district court to vacate, for lack of jurisdiction, an order which specifically enjoined them from interfering with the debtor's or trustee's
rights on the ground that because of prior defaults the debtor no
longer had a valid leasehold interest. While this petition was pending, the owners filed an action for a declaratory judgment in the
state court with respect to the same matter. The district court
then entered another order specifically enjoining the owners from
further prosecuting that action. On appeal," the Commission's brief
urged that the appeal was premature since the questions raised by
appellants were pending before the district court, which had power to
preserve the status quo.
TRUSTEE'S INVESTIGATION

A complete accounting for the stewardship of corporate affairs by
the old management is a requisite under Chapter X. One of the primary duties of the trustee is to make a thorough study of the debtor
to assure the discovery and collection of all assets of the estate, including claims against officers, directors, or controlling persons who may
have mismanaged the debtor's affairs. The staff of the Commission
often aids the trustee in his investigation.
In Automatic Washer Oompanyr as noted in a prior report,ls the
trustee obtained a judgment for more than $500,000 for fraud in
the alleged sale of rubber machinery to the debtor. On appeal, the
court reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial.> Thereafter,
this claim and others were compromised for $90,000. In addition, as
the result of an investigation in which the staff of the Commission
participated, the trustee brought suit for fraud against Bankers Life

damages in the amount of $6 million against the American Stock
Exchange, Lowell M. Birrell, Edward T. McCormick, Joseph F.
Reilly, Re, Re and Sagarese, William P. Hoffman & Co., Ira Haupt &
Co., Swiss American Corporation, and others. The action was based
primarily upon the facts developed in the Commission's investigation
of the Res, specialists on the Exchange, with respect to their unlawful
sale of Swan-Finch stock. The district court denied a motion to
dismiss the complaint, holding that the complaint sufficiently stated
claims under Sections 6 and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, Section '70e of the Bankruptcy Act and in common law conversion." In another step to recover assets for the debtor, the court
also granted the trustees' application for the appointment of a receiver to take possession of and collect the rents on certain property
which, as alleged by the trustee, had been transferred by Lowell Birrell to his brother to defraud creditors. Subsequent to the end of
the fiscal year, the trustees settled certain other litigation and pursuant to the settlements received from various parties defendant an
aggregate amount of $80,000 and 31,500 shares of Swan-Finch stock."
ADVISORY REPORTS ON PLANS OF REORGANIZATION

Generally, a formal advisory report is prepared only in a case involving a substantial public investor interest and presenting significant problems. When no such formal report is filed, the Commission
may state its views briefly by letter, and authorize its counsel to make
an oral or written presentation to amplify the Commission's views.
In TMT Trailer Ferry, Inc.,19 the Commission and the stockholders'
committee objected to approval and confirmation of an internal plan
of reorganization which excluded stockholders from any participation.
It was urged that the record on valuation was inadequate to justify
exclusion of the stockholders, especially since the plan allowed some
$2 million of seriously contested claims; and that the court should
not have rejected summarily the stockholders' contentions that they

were entitled to rescind their purchases of the debtor's stock sold in
alleged violation of the anti-fraud provisions of the Federal securities
laws and that, as a consequence, they should be classified as general
creditors for purposes of the plan. The Commission also objected
to the provisions of the plan which would permit the trustee to become
president of the reorganized company. The district court approved
and confirmed the plan, overruling these contentions.
The Commission is supporting the pending appeal of the stockholders' committee."
In Third Avenue Transit Corporation." the plan of reorganization,
consummated in 1957, reserved to the trustee, with the approval of the
court, the right to reject, assume, or assume as modified, a pension
plan adopted by the debtor prior to the reorganization proceeding.
The authority was never exercised by the trustee, and the reorganized
debtor continued to pay the pensions to employees who had retired
prior to the consummation of the plan of reorganization.
When, in
1962, the properties of the reorganized debtor were seized in condemnation proceedings, the trustee petitioned the court for authority to reject the pension plan. Pursuant to a request by the court, the Commission advised, and the court agreed, that the reservation did not
appear in the circumstances to be related or ancillary to the consummation of the plan of .reorganization and that to permit its exercise now
would involve the kind of tutelage over reorganized debtors which the
courts have disapproved.
ACITVITIES WITH REGARD TO ALLOWANCES

Every reorganization case ultimately presents the difficult problem
of determining the allowance of compensation to be paid out of the
debtor's estate to the various parties for services rendered and for
expenses incurred in the proceeding.
The Commission, which under
Section 242 of the Bankruptcy Act may not receive any allowance
from the estate for the services it renders, has sought to assist the
courts in protecting debtors' estates from excessive charges and at the
same time in equitably allocating compensation on the basis of the
claimants' contributions to the administration of estates and the formulation of plans. During the fiscal year 187 applications for compensation totaling about $7.3 million were reviewed.
In Food Town, Inc.,22 the Commission recommended that the
trustee's accountant should be denied compensation because the audit
report had failed to include certain information bearing upon a possible $300,000 preference by the debtor. The court, in reducing the aceo The Protective Gommittee for Independent Stockholder" etc. v. Anderaon (C.A. 5. No.

countant's compensation, stated that accountants retained by the
trustee pursuant to an order of the court are quasi-officers of the court;
that as such they owe their primary duty to the court; and that reliance
upon statements made by adverse parties, and acquiescence therein by
the trustee's counsel, will not relieve the accountants of their responsibility to advise the court fully of all pertinent matters coming to their
attention."
The court also allowed some compensation to former
counsel for the trustee, although the Commission had urged total disallowance because, in reliance on the accountant's audit report, he had
omitted the same information from the trustee's report under Section
16'7, and for the additional reason that he had delegated substantially
all his responsibilities to counsel for debtor who, under Section 158 (3),
is not disinterested."
In Parker Petrolewm 00., Inc.,25 the Commission recommended
denial of four applications for compensation totaling $93,000 by reason
of Section 249 of Chapter X. The district court disallowed three
of the applications for a total of $53,000, as recommended by the Commission, but held that Section 249 was not applicable to the fourth
applicant and allowed $10,000 as the reasonable value of services
rendered.
The Commission also urged that no compensation should
be allowed to the chairman of the creditors' committee or to its attorney
because the committee represented both secured and unsecured creditors. The court denied an allowance to the committee chairman,
but on the ground that no compensable service had been rendered.
While recognizing the conflict, the court allowed the attorney $21,000
as against his request for $106,000.
In Selected I'MJ68fJment8 Oorporation,28 as reported previously," the
Commission successfully argued that a fee applicant who was denied
compensation because he had represented conflicting interests could
not thereafter obtain a fee from the reorganized company in settlement of an appeal by the applicant from the district court's order
which had denied him compensation.
As urged by the Commission,
the court of appeals affirmed the ruling of the district court. 28

COMMISSION

INTERVENTION IN CHAPTER XI PROCEEDINGS

Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act provides a procedure by which
debtors can effect arrangements with respect to their unsecured debts
under court supervision. Where a proceeding is brought under that
Chapter but the facts indicate that it should have been brought under
Chapter .x, Section ,328 of Chapter XI authorizes the Commission to
make application to the court to dismiss the Chapter XI proceeding
unless the debtor's petition is amended to comply with the requirements
of Chapter X, or a creditors' petition under Chapter X is filed.
GraysO'lIrRobinson Stores, Inc.,29 through numerous subsidiaries, operated a chain consisting of specialty stores and leased departments in
discount stores, each selling women's and children's apparel, and additional stores or departments selling photographic equipment and supplies. The debtor also owned 51 percent of the stock of A. S. Beck
Shoe Corporation, which manufactures shoes and operates a retail shoe
store chain of over 250 units. Pursuant to agreement executed in 1960,
the debtor operated the 130 stores of Darling Stores Corporation,
whose outstanding stock is owned by Maxwell H. Gluck, chairman
of the board of the debtor. The debtor's balance sheet as of July 28,
1962, showed total assets of about $33 million and liabilities of $33.7
million. The debtor's 803,507 shares of common stock, listed on the
New York Stock Exchange, are held by about 3,470 investors. Approximately 32 percent of the stock is owned by Gluck, either individually .or through Darling. In its motion under Section 328, the Commission stressed, among other things, the debtor's substantial liabilities,
both secured and unsecured, the operating losses under the Gluck man-agement, the depletion of cash, the unsuccessful attempts to refinance
by proposed debenture offerings to the public, and the consequent need
of an overall reorganization and an inquiry by a disinterested trustee.
The district court denied. the. Commission's motion. 30 On appeal by
the Commission, the court of appeals affirmed and in a 6-3 decision
denied, without opinion, the Commission's petition for rehearing
bane. In dissenting from the denial of a rehearing, Judge Clark indicated that the court's original decision appeared contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States and prior decisions
in the Second Circuit, stating, inter alia, "that the battle for public
supervision won in 1940 has all -to be done llgai:h-if it can' be rewon
after this setback." 31 ~

dismiss the Grayson-Robinson Chapter XI proceeding on the ground that the
proceeding should have been brought under Chapter X. The Solicitor General
does not believe that the case presents a proper, question for consideration by
the Supreme Court at this time.
.
The decision not to seek Supreme Court review in this case, however, should
not be construed as acquiescence by the Commission in the decision of the Court
of Appeals or concurrence with the views expressed in the opinion.-

American Trailer Eental« Oompany S2 had sold to more than' 1,300
public investors automobile utility trailers which were then leased back
to debtor and rented to the public. The debtor's plan of arrangement
under Chapter XI proposed to offer trailer owners common stock of
another company in exchange for their trailers and nothing for pastdue rentals. It provided participation for the common stock of the
debtor, over 61 percent of which was held by the debtor's management,
who would also be included in the management of such other company.
The Commission's motion under Section 328 stressed the need for an
independent investigation of the past acts of management, the public
investors' need for independent advice, and that Chapter XI was not
the proper forum for an overall reorganization of the debtor as contemplated by the plan of arrangement.
The district court denied the
Commission's motion, and at the close of the :fiscal year an appeal by
the Commission was pending."
The Commission also :filed a separate
motion for leave to intervene and to restrain the stock offering pursuant
to the plan of arrangement' because of alleged violations of the antifraud. provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. For further details,

had outstanding 500,000 shares of preferred stock and 204,199 shares
of common stock, held in the aggregate by over 1,100 investors. The
Commission's motion under Section 328 was based largely on the asserted inadequacy of Chapter XI to assure that public investors would

are to retain their stock interest undiminished.
Crumpton's debentures, in the principal amount of $1,425,660, are held by 600 public
investors. The president of the debtor and his wife own 39 percent of
the debtor's common stock; the balance of the common stock is held
by approximately 2,100 public investors. The Commission's motion
under Section 328, in which the indenture trustee joined, stated, among
other things, that the provisions of the proposed arrangement raised
substantial questions as to fairness and equity to the debenture holders
which required the application of the procedural and substantive safeguards found only in Chapter X. The court denied the Commission's
motion without opinion, and the Commission has appealed."

ADMINISTRATION OF THE T~UST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939

The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes,
debentures and similar securities publicly offered for sale, except as
specifically exempted by the Act, be issued under an indenture which
meets the requirements of the Act and has been duly qualified with the
Commission. The Act requires that indentures to be qualified include
specified provisions which provide means by which the rights of
holders of securities issued under such indentures may be protected
and enforced. These provisions relate to designated standards of
eligibility and qualification of the corporate trustee to provide reasonable financial responsibility and to minimize conflicting interests. The
Act outlaws exculpatory provisions formerly used to eliminate all
liability of the indenture trustee and imposes on the trustee, after default, the duty to use the same degree of care and skill "in the exercise
of the rights and powers invested in it by the indenture" as a prudent
man would use in the conduct of his own affairs.
The provisions of the Trust Indenture Act are closely integrated
with the requirements of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant to
the Securities Act of securities to be issued under a trust indenture
subject to the Trust Indenture Act is not permitted to becomeeffective
unless the indenture conforms to the requirements of the latter Act,
and necessary information as to the trustee and the indenture must
be contained in the registration statement. In the case of securities
issued in exchange for other securities of the same issuer and securities
issued under a plan approved by a court or other proper authority
which, although exempted from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, are not exempted from the requirements of the Trust
Indenture Act, the obligor must file an application for the qualification of the indenture, including a statement of the required information concerning the eligibility and qualification of the trustee.

PART IX
ADMINISTRATION' OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF
1940
The Investment Company Act of 1940 provides for the registration
and regulation of companies primarily engaged in the business of
investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities. The
Act, among other things, requires disclosure of the finances and investment policies of such companies, prohibits changing the nature of their
business or their investment policies without shareholder approval,
regulates the means of custody of the companies' assets, requires management contracts to be submitted to security holders for approval,
prohibits underwriters, investment bankers, and brokers from constituting more than a minority of the directors of such companies, and
prohibits transactions between such companies and their officers, directors, and affiliates except with approval of the Commission. The
Act also regulates the issuance of senior securities and requires faceamount certificate companies to maintain reserves adequate to meet
maturity payments upon their certificates.
,The securities of investment companies which are offered to the
public are also required to be registered under the Securities Act of
1933 and the companies must file periodic reports. Such companies
are also subject to the Commission's proxy rules and closed-end companies are subject to "insider" trading rules. The Division of Corporation Finance and the Division of Corporate Regulation both assist
the Commission in the administration of the statute, the former being
concerned with the disclosure provisions and the latter with regulatory
provisions.
'
COMPANIES REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT

As of June 30, 196,3,there were 727 investment companies registered
under the 4.ct, including 71 small business investment companies, and
the estimated aggregate market value of their assets on that date was
approximately $36 billion. Compared with the corresponding totals
at June 30.,1962, these figures represent an overall increase of approximately $8.7 billion in the market value of assets while the number of
registered companies remained the same. The registered companies

INSPECTION AND INVESTIGATION PROGRAM

Pursuant to the statutory authority conferred by Section 31 (b) of
the Investment Company Act, a total of 84 inspections of investment
companies was completed during fiscal year 1963. The number of
inspections compares favorably with the total of 165 inspections that
had been conducted in all prior years since the inception of the program in 1957 and with the 52 inspections in fiscal 1962. These inspections were planned and supervised by a Branch of Inspections and Investigations which was newly created for such purpose in the Division
of Corporate Regulation.
As part of the Commission's expanding program in this area, Investment Company Act training seminars for staff members in the regional
officeswere conducted for the first time, with a total of some 75 participants. The object of the seminars was to train personnel in the teachnical aspects of inspection of investment companies and to coordinate
the activities of the various regional officesin regard to the inspection
and enforcement program.
In a majority of the inspections conducted during the fiscal year,
violations of various provisions of the Investment Company Act,
as well as violations of other statutes administered by the Commission,
were brought to light. While many of the violations thus uncovered
were of a minor nature and, when called to the attention of those involved, were corrected or discontinued, serious violations have also
been discovered. Instances were discovered in which investment advisory contracts had not been entered into or continued in accordance
with provisions of Section 15 of the Act with the consequence that the
investment adviser was collecting fees based upon a void contract. In
one such instance, the board of directors had failed to renew the advisory contract as required by Section 15(c) . In another instance, the
inspection and resulting investigation developed information indicating that certain directors were acting as investment advisers to the
investment company in violation of Section 15 (a) . The inspection
of investment companies has also disclosed in several instances violations of Section 17 by persons affiliated with the investment companies.
During the fiscal year, the responsibility for conducting investigations in matters involving violations of the Investment Company Act
was transferred to the Division of Corporate Regulation from the
Division of Trading and Exchanges now Trading and Markets).
A
total of 29 investigations was commenced during the year through
the Branch of Inspections and Investigations, chiefly as a result of
information gained during the course of the inspection program.
As a consequence of the inspection and investigation program, situations were brought to light warranting the institution of civil actions

102

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

by the Commission in nine separate matters. Of the nine actions, one
has been concluded with the entry of a consent decree and the appointment of receivers to liquidate the company.' In another action, S.E.O.
v. The Keller Oorporatioa et al.,2 a preliminary injunction was entered
December 20, 1962, enjoining certain defendants from further violations of the Investment Company Act and the Securities Act of 1933
and appointing a trustee and receiver for an unregistered investment
company. As of July 1, 1963, there were eight actions still in process.
In addition, as pointed out on p. 8, 8upra, the inspection and investigation program in certain instances produced tangible benefits for
investment companies or their shareholders.
SPECIAL STAFF STUDY OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES

Shortly after the beginning of fiscal year 1963 the Wharton School
of the University of Pennsylvania submitted to the Commission its
Study of Mutual Funds, which the Commission in turn submitted to
the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives. The Study, based on responses to questionnaires, relates
to the problems created by the growth in size of investment companies.
It constitutes the most comprehensive analysis of the mutual fund
industry since the Commission's study made more than 20 years ago,
prior to the adoption of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The
Study analyzes the growth, organization and control, investment policy
and performance of open-end investment companies or mutual funds,
their impact on securities markets, the extent of control of portfolio
companies, and the financial and other relationships of mutual funds
with their investment advisers and principal underwriters.
As the Commission stated in its transmittal letter, many of the
comments in the Study raise questions of broad policy whether some
of the practices and patterns which originated in an earlier time and
under different conditions and which have become conventional within
the broad tolerances of the 1940 Act should be reconsidered.
The
Study draws attention to the potential for divided loyalties arising
from the typical structure of the industry under which a significant
part of the funds' activities are performed by affiliated organizations
such as advisers, underwriters, and brokers, who control or are represented on the boards of directors of the funds. Questions are raised
by the Study as to the relationship or lack of relationship between the
growth, size and performance of funds, and sales commissions and

one hand, and advisory fees and costs of operation of the funds and
of the advisers, including fees charged by advisers to other clients,
on the other hand. The Study comments upon the role of and in general questions the effectiveness of "unaffiliated" directors of the typical
fund.
The Wharton School Study, as noted, is a report to the Commission
and not by the Commission. In forwarding the Study to the Congress,
the Commission stated that it would be premature to attempt an
evaluation of the conclusions in the Study, but that it was apparent
that the Commission's rules under the 1940 Act and indeed some of the
provisions of the statute itself might require reassessment. The Commission accordingly directed its staff to conduct a detailed analysis of
the Study with a view to making such recommendations as may seem
appropriate. During fiscal 1963members of the staff of the Division of
Corporate Regulation have been engaged in conducting this staff
study, including intensive field visits to selected investment companies
and complexes of different types, and interviews with persons in the
industry, including "unaffiliated" directors. Its scope includes a review of the structure of the investment company industry generally,
and a reassessment of the provisions of the Investment Company Act
and the Commission's rules and regulations thereunder.
This staff project has been coordinated with the work of the Special
Study of Securities Markets, which considered certain aspects of the
investment company industry not covered by the Wharton School
Study, namely sales techniques, the adequacy of training and supervision of salesmen, "contractual" or "front-end load" plans for the
purchase of investment company shares and the possible use of inside
information with respect to portfolio transactions by those closely
affiliated with investment companies. The conclusions and recommendations of the Special Study in these areas are contained in Chapter XI of the Special Study report, transmitted by the Commission to
the Congress shortly after the close of the fiscal year 1963. In one of
the areas covered, that of "contractual" plans, the Special Study
made recommendations of a tentative nature, suggesting that final
recommendations be made only after completion of the comprehensive
staff study.
It is contemplated that the staff study will be completed during
fiscal 1964, and that its analysis, together with the reports of the
Wharton School and the Special Study of Securities Markets, will
aid the Commission in determining whether specific legislative recommendations should be made to the Congress with respect to the 1940
Act and what action, if any, should be taken to strengthen the rules
and regulations under the Act.

CURRENT INFORMATION

The Commission's rules promulgated under the Act require that
the basic information contained in notifications of registration and in
registration statements of investment companies be kept current,
through periodic and other reports, except in cases of certain inactive
unit trusts and face-amount companies. The following reports and
documents were filed during the 1963 fiscal year:

The foregoing statistics do not reflect the numerous filings of revised
prospectuses by open-end mutual funds and unit investment trusts
making a continuous offering of their securities. These prospectuses,
which must be checked for compliance with the Act, are required to
show material changes which have occurred in the operations of the
companies since the last effective date of the prospectuses on file. In
this respect registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933
covering securities of such companies are essentially different from
registration
statements relating to the usual type of corporate
securities.
APPLICATIONS

AND PROCEEDINGS

Under Section 6 (c) of the Act, the Commission, by rules and regulations, upon its own motion or by order upon application, may exempt
any person, security, or transaction from any provision of the Act if
and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in
the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and
the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
Other Sections, such as 6(d), 9(b), 10(f), 11(b), and 23(c), contain
specific provisions and standards pursuant to which the Commission
may grant exemptions from particular Sections of the Act or may
approve certain types of transactions.
Also, under certain provisions
of Sections 2, 3, and 8 the Commission may determine the status of
persons and companies under the Act. One of the principal activities
of the Commission in its regulation of investment companies is the
consideration of applications for orders under the Sections referred to.
During the fiscal year, 238 applications filed under various Sections
of the Investment Company Act were before the Commission. The
Sections of the Act with which these applications were concerned and
their disposition are shown in the following table:

Some of the more significant matters in which applications were
considered are summarized below:
The Commission's Annual Report for fiscal 19623 referred to applications pursuant to Section 2 (a) (9) filed by shareholders of
Fundomentai Inoestors, Ino., Investors Mutual, Ino., and TelevisionElectronics Fwnd, Inc., registered open-end investment companies,
alleging that certain directors of these companies who were represented to be unaffiliated with the respective investment advisers in
fact had been and were now controlled by such investment advisers.
Prior to ordering a hearing on the factual questions raised by the
applications, the Commission directed that the parties and other interested persons file briefs with respect to certain specified common
legal issues raised by the applications.'
Following oral argument on
these issues, the Commission held that a shareholder of a registered
investment company is an "interested person" within the meaning of
Section 2(a) (9) with standing to file an application seeking a determination under that Section, that the Commission is empowered
to determine whether or not a natural person is controlled even though
control of a company is not at issue, and that a determination of status
by the Commission pursuant to Section 2(a) (9) is not limited in
application to the period of time subsequent to such a determination. However, since the same issues and parties were before courts
of competent jurisdiction in pending suits brought prior to the filing
of the instant applications, and there were no policy reasons why the
Commission should decide these issues first, the Commission applied

the doctrine of comity and dismissed the applications without
prejudice,"
On December 19, 1962, Randolph Phillips, a stockholder of Inuestors Mut'lUil, Inc. and other registered mutual funds for which
Lnmeetors Dioersified. Seroioee, Inc. ("IDS"), also a registered investment company, serves as investment adviser, filed an application
under Section 2(a) (9) of the Act requesting a determination that
Bertin C. Gamble, Gamble-Skogmo, Inc. and General Outdoor Advertising Company, acting collectively (referred to in the application as the "Gamble Group"), either alone or in concert with John D.
Murchison, Clint W. Murchison, Jr. and others (referred to as the
"Murchison Group"), had acquired control of Alleghany Corporation
and of IDS, about 47.5% of whose voting securities are owned by
Alleghany.
On January 2, 1963, the Commission ordered that a
hearing be held with respect to these questions of control." On
February 15, 1963, the Commission, upon the applications of IDS
and Gamble-Skogmo, issued an order pursuant to Section 6 (c) of the
Act exempting all persons named in the application of Phillips from
that part of Section 2(a) (9) of the Act which provides that if an
application is not granted or denied within 60 days, the determination sought shall be deemed to have been temporarily granted pending
final determination,"
The exemption was to remain in effect until
May 18, 1963, subject to earlier termination.
On February 15, 1963, IDS filed an application under Section
2(a) (9) seeking determinations that (a) Murchison Brothers; (b)
Allan P. Kirby; (c) Kirby and certain associates; and (d) Murray
D. Lincoln and/or companies controlled by or associated with him,
controlled Alleghany and that Alleghany controlled IDS. This application was consolidated for purposes of hearing with the Phillips
application,"
On May 17, 1963, the Commission granted applications filed pursuant to Section 6 (c) of the Act by certain of the persons named in the
IDS application seeking exemptions from the operation of the "60-day
provision" of Section 2 (a) (9).9 These exemptions were to remain in
effect until final determination, subject to earlier modification or
termination.
The exemptions with respect to the Phillips application
were extended so as to be co-extensive. The hearings in these consolidated proceedings were concluded after the close of the fiscal year.

On January 22, 1963, the Commission issued its opinion and order
denying an application by The Prudential Life Ineuranoe Oompany of
America for exemption from the Act or, in the alternative, for exemption from certain provisions thereof.10 In its opinion the Commission found that Prudential established a separate fund to be
invested in securities exclusively for the benefit and at the risk of
purchasers of the variable annuity contracts Prudential proposes to
sell. The Commission held that such fund was an investment company, required to be registered under the Act. The Commission
granted in part and denied in part Prudential's alternative application requesting exemptions from various specific provisions of the
Act. Prudential filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit for review of the Commission's order, insofar as it held the
separate fund to be an investment company required to be registered
under the Act.n Following the end of the fiscal year, the Court
affirmed the order.
The Commission granted an application by American Manufacturing Oompany, 1'lUJ.,for an order under Section 3(b) (2) of the Act
declaring that it was primarily engaged in a business or businesses
other than that of investing in securities, either directly or (A)
through majority-owned subsidiaries or (B) through controlled companies conducting similar types of businesses." In its decision, the
Commission held that in determining primary business engagement
under the statute, it could add to businesses in which the applicant
engaged directly and through its majority-owned subsidiaries, the
businesses engaged in through controlled companies conducting, as
among themselves, similar types of businesses, irrespective of whether
or not such businesses were of types similar to those engaged in by the
applicant or its majority-owned subsidiaries, or to those of any controlled companies which it was not necessary to add in order to arrive
at the primary business engagement.
Pursuant to the Commission's order of April 12, 1962r hearings
continued on an application filed by Growth OapitaZ, Ino., a small
business investment company, seeking to exempt conditionally C. B.
McDonald, a director of Growth Capital and also the managing partner of McDonald & Company, an investment banking firm, from the
provisions of Section 30(f) of the Act which makes applicable to
directors of closed-end investment companies the provisions of Section
16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to insiders'
transactions.
The application was opposed by the Commission's

PART X
ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF

1940
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration of
persons engaged for compensation in the business of advising others
with respect to securities. Certain advisers are exempt from the requirement of registration, including those who advise only investment
companies or insurance companies and those who, within the last 12
months, had fewer than 15 clients and who do not hold themselves out
generally to the public as investment advisers. Furthermore, the registration requirements do not apply to an adviser whose investment
advice is given only to persons resident in the state in which he maintains his principal place of business, as long as the advice does not concern securities listed on a national securities exchange or admitted to
unlisted trading privileges on such an exchange.
Section 206 of the Act, as amended in September 1960, prohibits an
investment adviser from engaging in fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative acts or practices and gives the Commission authority, by rules
and regulations, to define and to prescribe means reasonably designed
to prevent such acts and practices.' In accordance with this provision,
the Commission, during the 1962 fiscal year, adopted Rule 206(4)-1,
effective January 1, 1962, which defines certain advertisements by
investment advisers as fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative.
During the 1963 fiscal year an informal program was instituted to secure
compliance with Rule 206(4)-1 by those investment advisers whose
advertising continued to be objectionable.
The cooperation of the
investment advisers who were contacted has resulted in a marked
reduction in the publication and distribution of advertising material
violative of Rule 206 (4)-1.
Investment advisers who also effect transactions as brokers and
dealers must disclose any interest they may have in transactions effected for clients if acting as an investment adviser with regard to
such transactions.
The Act prohibits any investment adviser not
exempt from registration from basing his compensation upon a share
'In S.E.a. v, aapltal Galns Research Bureau, Ino., an Important action under the antifraud provisions of the Act as in effect prior to its amendment, the Supreme Court In
December 1963 reversed lower court decisions denying the Commission's motion for a preliminary injunction.
See pp. 112-118, Infra.

109

of the capital gains or appreciation of his client's funds. The Act
also makes it unlawful for any such investment adviser to enter into,
extend or renew any investment advisory contract or to perform such
contract if the contract provides for compensation to the investment
adviser on the basis of a share of capital gains or capital appreciation
of the funds or any portion of the funds of the client or fails to provide that no assignment of such contract shall be made by the investment adviser without the consent of the other party to the contract.
Under Rule 206(4)-2, which became effective in April 1962, an investment adviser who has custody of funds or securities of any client
is required to segregate them, maintain them in the manner provided
in the rule, and to comply with other conditions specified in the rule.
Moreover, every investment adviser who is not exempt from registration is required, since the 1960 amendments, to make, keep and preserve such books and records as may be prescribed by the Commission
and the Commission is empowered to inspect such books and records.
The books and records to be maintained by investment advisers are
specified in Rule 204-2, which became effective in July 1961.
Inspection procedures have been revised to obtain information concerning compliance with the new rules. During the fiscal year 1963,
219 inspections were completed and 131 violations of the new rules
were disclosed. It is anticipated that the number of inspections will
increase annually until the investment advisers registered with the
Commission are subject to a regular cycle of inspections.
Investment advisers who violate any of the provisions of the Act
are subject to appropriate administrative, civil or criminal remedies. With respect to administrative remedies, the Act provides, in
Section 203(d), that the Commission shall deny, revoke, or suspend
for not more than 12 months, the registration of an investment adviser
if it finds that such action is in the public interest and that the investment adviser or any partner, officer, director or controlling or controlled. person o:f the investment adviser- is subject to a specified
disqualification.
These disqualifications include willful misstatements in' an application or report filed with the Commission, the existence of a conviction or injunction based on or related to specified
types of misconduct, willful violation of any provision of the Securities Act, Securities Exchange Act or Investment Advisers Act or any
rule or regulation thereunder, or aiding and abetting any other person's violation of such provisions, rules or regulations.
At the close of the fiscal year, 1,564 investment advisers were
registered with the Commission. The following tabulation contains
statistics with respect to registrations and applications for registration during fiscal year 1963:

An extensive program pursued during the year resulted in the

investment advisers who failed to file supplements to their registration as required by the Act.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS

At the beginning of the fiscal year, 10 revocation proceedings and 1
denial proceeding were pending. With respect to these, the Commission during the year revoked 5 registrations; :I in the denial proceedings, it held that denial of the application for investment adviser
registration was not required in the public interest and permitted the
application to become effective, subject to certain conditions designed
to ensure that the applicant would confine his activities exclusively
to those of an investment adviser." During fiscal 1963, the Commission instituted revocation proceedings against 7 registered investment
advisers. These proceedings, and the remaining 5 revocation proceedings previously instituted, were pending at the close of the year .

OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION
CIVD.. LITIGATION

The several statutes administered by the Commission authorize
the Commission to seek injunctions against continuing or threatened
violations of such statutes. Such violations may involve a wide range
of illegal practices, including the purchase Or sale of securities by
fraud, and the sale of securities without compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Commission also participates in various other types of proceedings, including appearances
as asndou« curiae in litigation between private parties where it is important that its view regarding the interpretation of the statutes be
furnished to the court.
At the beginning of the fiscal year 1963 there were pending in the
courts 105 injunctive and related enforcement proceedings instituted
by the Commission to prevent fraudulent and other illegal practices
in the sale or purchase of securities. During the year 121 additional
proceedings were instituted and 105 cases were disposed of, leaving 121
such proceedings pending at the end of the year. In addition the
Commission participated in a number of corporate reorganization
cases under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, in 10 proceedings in
the district courts under Section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act, and in 14 miscellaneous actions. The Commission also
participated in 46 civil appeals in the United States courts of appeals.
Of these, 19 came before the courts on petition for review of an administrative order, 15 arose out of corporate reorganizations in which
the Commission had taken an active part, 2 were appeals in actions
brought by or against the Commission, 3 were appeals from orders
entered pursuant to Section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and 6 were appeals in cases in which the Commission appeared as amiou« curiae. The Commission also participated in 9 petitions for or memoranda in opposition to certiorari before the United
States Supreme Court resulting from these or similar actions.
Complete lists of all cases in which the Commission appeared before a Federal or state court during the fiscal year, either as a party
or as amioue curiae, and the status of such cases at the close of the
year are contained in the appendix tables. This section describes a

few of the more noteworthy cases, not including, however, any cases
arising under the Public Utility Holding Company Act or Chapter X
of the Bankruptcy Act; cases arising under those statutes are discussed
in the sections of this report dealing with such statutes.
Since publication of the last Annual Report, the United States
Supreme Court has rendered two significant decisions in the field of
securities regulation, one relating to the permissible scope of regulation by a stock exchange of its members, the other to the interpretation
of anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
In SiJAJer v, New York Stock EaJchange,I the Supreme Court,
reversing the court of appeals, held that the stock exchange violated
Section 1 of the Sherman Act in ordering several of its member firms
to remove telephone wire connections previously in operation between
their offices and those of a nonmember-a broker-dealer trading in
over-the-counter securities-without
giving the nonmember notice,
assigning him any reason for the action or affording him an opportunity to be heard. The court found that such action by the exchange
would constitute a per se anti-trust violation had it occurred in a context free from other Federal regulation, but agreed with the court
of appeals that the exchange's rules governing its members' relationships with nonmembers are within its duty of self-regulation under
the Securities Exchange Act, even where the particular nonmember
deals only in "unlisted" securities. The court held, however, that
particular applications of these rules by the exchange are outside the
purview of the anti-trust laws only when justified by its self-regulatory duty and that the Exchange Act affords no justification for
anti-competitive collective action taken without according fair
procedures.
In Securities and EaJchange Oowmission v, Oapital Gains Research
Bureau, Inc.,2 decided subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the
Supreme Court held that it was fraudulent and deceptive within the
meaning of Sections 206 (1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940 for a registered investment adviser to fail to disclose to his
clients a practice-known
in the trade as "scalping"-of
purchasing
shares of a security for his own account shortly before recommending
that security for long-term investment and then immediately selling
the shares at a profit upon the rise in the market price following the
recommendation. The court pointed out the conflict of interests
present in such a situation by noting that "[a]n adviser who, like
respondents, secretly trades on the market effect of his own recom'373 U.S. 341 (1963). Earlier stages ot the litigation in thIs eaee are discussed In the

mendation, may be motivated-eonsciously or unconsciously-to recommend a given security not because of its potential for long-run
price increase (which would profit the client), but because of its
potential for short-run price increase in response to anticipated activity from the recommendation (which would profit the adviser)."
The court rejected the interpretations of the lower courts to the effect
that the Act requires the Commission to establish intent to injure
and actual injury to the adviser's clients in order to obtain a preliminary injunction requiring disclosure of such practices. It pointed
out that "Congress intended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to
be construed like other securities legislation 'enacted for the purpose
of avoiding frauds,' not technically and restrictively, but rather
flexibly to effectuate its remedial purposes." [Footnote omitted.]
Among the numerous actions instituted in the Federal district
courts by the Commission, seeking injunctions against continuing or
threatened violations of the Securities Act or Securities Exchange Act,
and related types of proceedings, the following were of particular
interest or significance :
In Securities and Ewchange Oommlssioi: v. Ohamberlain Assooiatee,
et 01.,8 the Commission sought to enjoin an issuing corporation and a
person retained as public relations counsel for the issuer from offering
and selling securities without registration in violation of Section 5
of the Securities Act and from engaging in practices operating as a
fraud upon purchasers in violation of Section 17(a) of that Act. The
public relations counsel had prepared a "Report to Stockholders"
which was a verbatim copy of a letter by the company's president.
The letter contained false and misleading statements concerning the
issuer. The public relations counsel displayed the report and other
material to various broker-dealers, encouraged them to establish
markets at prices he suggested and on one occasion placed a purchase
order for 200 shares. In this manner, the broker-dealers were induced to buy and sell some 3,000 shares, most of which emanated from
a Canadian source and as to which no registration statement had been
filed and no exemption appeared to be available.
The district court concluded that the Commission was entitled to a
permanent injunction. It held that the activities of the public relations counsel amounted to a solicitation of offers to buy and thus constituted offers to sell, as defined in Section 2(3) of the Securities Act,
and that he was an underwriter as defined in Section 2 (11) of that
Act. The court concluded that his activities were therefore in violation of Section 5 of that Act. It further held that the counsel also

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

violated the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(11.)of the Act, stating
that he could not shirk responsibility for the misleading statements in
the Report to Stockholders by claiming that he relied upon the
representations of others. The court made it clear that since it was
through his efforts that the stock was to pass to the public, he had a
duty to investigate further.
In Securities and E(lJchange Oommiesion. v. Penn-Tee Lana ana
Oattle 00., et al.,4 the Commission sought to enjoin a corporation, its
president and certain other officers from offering and selling investment contracts and profit-sharing agreements without registration in
violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. The securities
took the form of grazing lease agreements between the corporation and
investors who placed cattle with the defendants for care, feeding and
breeding. Th investors agreed to pay a stipulated service charge
per head of cattle plus one-half the calf crop or a monthly fee. While
the defendants neither sold cattle to investors nor purchased from
them, defendants offered to arrange purchases and sales for investors.
The court entered a preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction was consented to.
The case of Securities and E(lJchange Oommission v, Electronics Security Oorp.,:; was an action for injunction against further violations
of Section 17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10 (b)
and 15(c) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rules 10b-6 and
15cl-8 thereunder by a registered broker-dealer corporation and its
president.
The defendants consented to the entry of a preliminary
injunction.
At the time of the hearing on the permanent injunction
the defendants urged that no injunction be entered on the ground of
mootness, inasmuch as the defendant corporation had previously surrendered its dealer's license to the state authorities and had ceased to
exist as an active corporation.
The district court, however, issued
an injunction," citing United States v. Parke, Daois &: 00., 365 U.S.
125 (1961) ; 362 U.S. 29 (1960), where the Supreme Court had rejected
similar arguments.
In Securities and E(lJchange 0 ommission v, American Trailer Rentals
Oompany,1 the Commission petitioned for leave to intervene in proceedings for an arrangement under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy
Act to show that an offering of securities of Capitol Leasing Corporation, pursuant to the plan of arrangement proposed by the debtor,
violated the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities
Act of 1933. The Commission stated to the bankruptcy court that its

responsibility for enforcement of the anti-fraud provisions is in no
way lessened by the fact that the violator is involved in bankruptcy
proceedings or that the sanctions afforded by the statute might be
imposed. in connection with an arrangement proceeding under Chapter XI. It pointed out that it was confronted with a choice between
instituting an independent proceeding in a Federal district court
having jurisdiction under Section 20 of the Securities Act or taking
steps to bring to the attention of the bankruptcy court that proceedings
therein were being employed in a manner violative of the Securities
Act. The Commission noted that if it had obtained an injunction
against further offerings or sales by Capitol Leasing Corporation
through an independent action, the proceedings for arrangement in
the bankruptcy court would have been rendered moot. It therefore
appeared to the Commission both more seemly and more consonant
with the best interests of the arrangement proceeding to apply to the
bankruptcy court for relief.
The referee in bankruptcy denied the Commission's petition to
intervene on procedural grounds and also decided that the Commission
had not shown facts necessary to entitle it to relief. On review,
district court held that it was error to deny the Commission leave to
intervene but that the referee's holding that there was not adequate
evidence in the record to support the Commission's claim could not
be set aside as "clearly erroneous." An appeal has been taken by the
Commission to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit where the
matter is now pending,"
In Seourities and Exchange Oommission v. Paul Iiiobter, doing business as Meade &: Oompany,9 the court had preliminarily enjoined a
registered broker-dealer from violating the net capital and bookkeeping requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and had
appointed a receiver of all of the defendant's assets. A bank moved
the court for an order authorizing it to sell certain securities pledged to
it by the defendant as collateral for loans. The receiver and the Commission opposed the motion on the grounds that at least certain of the
stock certificates held by the bank contained forged endorsements, that
many other complaints of forgeries had been received from defendant's
customers, and that many customers complained of having bought or
sold shares without having received certificates or money therefor. The
court held that it appeared there might be a cloud on the bank's title
to the certificates and therefore denied the bank's motion but without
prejudice to another application on timely notice to all persons whose
rights might be affected by a sale.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in
Berko v. Securities and Eechanqe Comanissioti 10 is of considerable
significance to the Commission in connection with its enforcement
activities directed against fraudulent sales of securities, particularly
through so-called "boiler-rooms." As described in the last Annual
Report.v' Berko had been found a cause of the revocation of the
broker-dealer registration of Mac Robbins & Co., Inc. He sought
review of that finding and the court had remanded to the Commission, which thereafter issued an Opinion and Order 12 reaffirming its
previous finding. In April 1963, the court affirmed that order as
being supported by substantial evidence. It stated that Berko worked
in an officewhich was plainly established to be a "boiler-room" and
which he knew to be a "boiler-room," and held that these facts justified the Commission in holding him chargeable with knowledge of
the contents of brochures utilized by him which he should have known
to be misleading. The court accepted the Commission's conclusion
that a salesman working in a "boiler-room" has a higher duty to prospective customers than one working out of a legitimate sales operation, and does not meet his obligation when he has no knowledge of
the issuer other than opinions and brochures furnished by his employer without an investigation of their correctness.
During the year, the Commission participated as amious curiae in
several cases in which there was an issue regarding the validity or
interpretation of provisions of the Securities Acts, or the rules promulgated thereunder by the Commission. Among those cases were
the following:
Kornfeld v, Eaton 13 was an action brought by stockholders of the
Norwich Pharmacal Company under Section 16(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act to recover on behalf of Norwich the profits realized by
defendant Eaton, an officer and director of the company, through
"Short-swing" transactions in Norwich common stock. Although the
purchase and sale of the stock by Eaton occurred within a 6-month
period, the purchase was made pursuant to the exercise of an option
which had been granted to him by the company several years earlier.
Following a demand by the plaintiffs that the company institute suit
against Eaton to recover the profits from the transactions, Eaton paid
to the company a sum computed in accordance with the Commission's
Rule 16b-6, which limits the amount of profits that are recoverable
from transactions of this type to the market increment occurring
within the Short-swing period surrounding the sale of the stock, thus

excluding the increment arising from the long-term holding of the
option. The plaintiffs claimed that the rule is invalid, urging that
it is inconsistent with the purpose of Section 16(b) and that it exceeds the Commission's statutory authority to exempt transactions
from the operation of that Section. The district court, agreeing
with the views expressed in a memorandum which the Commission
filed as amicus curiae, rejected the plaintiffs' contentions and upheld
the rule as a valid exercise of the Commission's rulemaking authority
under the Act. Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, the Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed."
Fuller v. Dilbert,15 was an action by the guarantors of a purchaser's obligations under a contract for the sale of stock to have the
contract declared void as in violation of Section 5 of the Securities
Act and Section 16(c) of the Securities Exchange Act. The sellers
moved for summary judgment, and the Commission filed a memorandum amicus curiae. The contract was for the sale of a control block
of unregistered stock, and it was contemplated that the purchaser
would not take all of the stock himself but would designate unidentified
other persons as co-purchasers or sub-purchasers. It was expressly
provided, however, that purchaser "and his designees" would take
only for investment so that the transaction would be exempt fr0111the
registration requirements of the Securities Act, under Section 4(1)
of that Act, as a transaction not involving an "issuer, underwriter or
dealer." The Commission in its memorandum took the position that
the contract could be performed without violating the Securities Act.
Since any performances which violated the Securities Act would constitute a breach of the contract, the contract did not have to be declared
void.
The other ground advanced by plaintiffs in support of their contention that the contract was void was predicated on the fact that
certain shares included in its terms, which had been bequeathed to
the sellers by their father, had not as yet been distributed to them at the
time the contract was executed. It was urged that the sellers therefore
did not "own" the stock which they were purporting to sell and that,
since they were insiders, the contract was void as being in violation
of Section 16(c) of the Securities Exchange Act, which prohibits any
sale by an insider of equity securities of his corporation if he "does
not own the security sold." The Commission urged, among other
matters, that there is no particular form of legal or equitable title
required to satisfy the requirements of ownership within the meaning
of this Section, although some property interest is clearly required.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE CO:MMISSION

Though it cannot be said what this property interest might be in every
case, the sellers here could be considered to "own" the equity securities,
without giving rise to the abuses with respect to "short sales" which
the statute seeks to prevent.
The district court denied summary judgment on the ground that
there were issues of fact which could not be decided upon affidavits
or motion papers.
In B01'ak v. J. 1. Oaee Oo.,IG plaintiff, a stockholder of J. I. Case
Co., sought a declaration that the 1956merger between Case and American Tractor Corporation was void, as well as damages and other
retrospective relief, claiming that the merger had been approved at
a stockholders' meeting at which proxies, solicited in violation of
Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and the proxy rules
thereunder, were voted. The district court, relying upon the case of
Dann v. Studebaker-Packard
Oorp.,17 held that it had no jurisdiction
under the Exchange Act to award damages and other retrospective
relief, that claims for such relief were claims arising under state law
and that the state security-for-expense statute was therefore applicable to the complaint insofar as it sought other than declaratory
relief. Plaintiff appealed and the Commission filed a brief amicus
curiae urging the court of appeals to hold that in a private suit based
upon Section 14(a) and the proxy rules thereunder a Federal district
court has jurisdiction under Section 27 of the Act to grant damages
or any other retrospective relief as the merits of the particular case
may require. The court of appeals adopted the Commission's position and reversed, expressly disagreeing with the Damn decision
insofar as it held to the contrary. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal
year the Supreme Court granted certiorari. IS
The fiscal year saw further significant developments in litigation
under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The institution of action in the case of Securities and Eeohanqe
Oommission v, llfidwest Technical Development Corporation. 19 was
described in the last Annual Report.2o In that case the Commission
charged certain officers and directors of that corporation, a registered
closed-end investment company, with gross abuse of trust and various
violations of the Investment Company Act. The primary charge 'of
gross abuse of trust stemmed from the activities of certain directors in
purchasing the same securities which the investment company presently held in, or proposed to introduce into, its portfolio of securities.

In addition to charging that irreconcilable conflicts of interest resulted
from the directors' ownership of portfolio securities, the Commission
also alleged in its complaint that the personal securities-trading activities of the directors constituted the effecting of transactions in joint
arrangements and joint enterprises with the investment company in
violation of Section 17(d) of the Investment Company Act and Rule
17d-l thereunder. It was also charged that the defendants caused
the investment company to enter into prohibited transactions with
affiliated persons in violation of Section 17(a) of the Investment Company Act, that the company had violated Sections 13 and 21 of the
Act in issuing guarantees which in effect were indirect loans contrary to its stated investment policy, and that it had issued senior
securities in violation of Section 18 of the Act.
On July 5, 1963, the district court issued its opinion. It agreed
with the Commission that the activities of the directors in purchasing
securities which were also represented or were intended to be included
in the investment company's portfolio constituted joint arrangements
in violation of Section 17(d) of the Act and Rule 17d-l thereunder.
The court held, however, that such conduct alone or together with the
other violations alleged did not constitute gross abuse of trust. The
court viewed the evidence as showing that the directors did not fully
appreciate the conflicts of interest which were involved and that they
unintentionally failed to seek approval of the joint transactions from
the Commission. The court also held, among other things, that the
issuance of the guarantees by the investment company in connection
with loans made by third persons to companies in which the investment company had invested, or in which it intended to invest, violated
the investment company's investment policy concerning the amount of
loans which the company could make without stockholder approval.

Seourities and Exchange Oommission. v, United Benefit Life Ins.
00.21 is an action by the Commission to enjoin the defendant, a Nebraska corporation, from the offering and sale of a contract described
by the company as an Annual Flexible Fund Retirement Annuity. In
its complaint, the Commission contended that the contracts being sold
are securities within the meaning of the Securities Act and that they
may not be offered for public sale without prior registration with the
Commission under that Act. The Commission further contended that
certain guarantees of partial repayment made by the company to the
purchasers of the contracts also constituted a security required to be
registered with the Commission under the Securities Act.
In addition, the Commission contended that the defendant had
created and manages a separate fund for the purpose of investing in
21

120

COMMISSION

securities, and that such fund constitutes an "investment company," as
defined in the Investment Company Act, and must be registered under
that Act. The defendant has filed an answer controverting the Commission's contentions, and, as of the end of the fiscal year, discovery
proceedings were being conducted.
In Pruden tid Life I-nsurance Oompany of America Y. Securities and
Ewchange Oomsnissiorc" Prudential petitioned the Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit for review of a Commission order which denied
Prudential's request for exemptions from the Investment Company
Act of 1940 for the separate variable annuity contract business which
Prudential proposes to conduct,"
Following the close of the fiscal
year, the Court affirmed the Commission order.
In Taussig, et d. v. Wellington Fund, Ino., et al., a suit by stockholders of an investment company, Wellington Fund, Inc., against
its corporate investment adviser and another investment company,
V\Tellington Equity Fund, and its adviser, the district court held that
Section 35(d) of the Investment Company Act conferred an implied
private right of action, and then relied upon pendent jurisdiction to
resolve common law claims of unfair competition." It enjoined the
advisers and Wellington Equity Fund from employing the name,
"Wellington" in the investment company field, but denied damages.
On appeal, the Commission, as amicus curiae, filed a brief which
urged that implied rights of action flow from violations of provisions
of the Investment Company Act, including Section 36. The brief
also pointed out that no inference should be drawn from the
nonaction of the Commission or from its acceleration of the registration of shares as to whether names, proxy material or other material
is deceptive or misleading.
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that there was a "substantial Federal question" whether
there can be a private implied right of action under Section 35 (d) in
these circumstances and that the existence of this question provided
the basis for retaining pendent jurisdiction to decide the case on
common law principles of unfair competition."
Securities and Ewchange Oommission v, The Keller Corporation;
et
al.,26 involved a fraudulent scheme involving the sale of securities of
an unregistered investment company. The Commission filed a complaint seeking to enjoin the corporate defendants and certain of their
principals from further fraudulent sales of Keller securities and to
enjoin Keller from continuing certain activities which, under Section

7(a) of the Investment Company Act, unregistered investment companies may not engage in. In view of the fraud practiced upon the
public investors in Keller, both through the fraudulent sales of Keller
stock and through the fraudulent mismanagement of Keller's portfolio and affairs, the Commission also sought the appointment of a
trustee or receiver. The district court entered a preliminary injunction enjoining the corporate defendants and two of the principals from further fraudulent sales of Keller stock and enjoining
Keller from continuing any of the prohibited activities. The court
also appointed a trustee and receiver for Keller. Subsequent to the
close of the fiscal year, the court of appeals affirmed the lower court
in all respects."
The remaining cases discussed in this section include two actions
to enforce subpoenas, one in connection with an administrative proceeding, the other in connection with an investigation, and three
proceedings instituted against the Commission to enjoin, respectively,
the conduct of an investigation, the continuation of administrative
proceedings, and the institution of such proceedings.
In Securities and Exchange Ilommdssion. v, Parrott 28 the Commission sought to enforce subpoenas issued by one of its hearing examiners in the course of an administrative proceeding involving a
broker-dealer. The subpoenaed persons, who were to be witnesses
in the administrative hearings, contended it was unfair to require
them to testify or produce records prior to the trial of two injunctive
actions brought by the Commission in which they were named defendants. Upon the Commission's application for enforcement of the
subpoenas, the district court delayed enforcement for 90 days. It
was expected that one of the trials would be completed within that
period. The court indicated that depositions would be permitted if
they were taken in Denver, the home of the witnesses. The parties
to the administrative proceeding, which was pending in Washington,
D.C., would not consent to a transfer of the proceeding to Denver
and contended that they were unable to afford the expense of being
present at the taking of depositions there. In addition, the hearing
examiner ruled in the administrative proceeding that depositions were
not appropriate since he desired to hear live testimony. The district
court extended the delay period on two occasions and the Commission appealed, contending that the existence of the injunctive actions
was not a ground for delaying enforcement of the subpoenas and that
the interests of parties to the administrative proceeding were para'" C.A. 7, No. 14,116 .

mount to the interests of witnesses. The court of appeals, without
opinion, directed that the subpoenas be enforced.
In Securities and Exchange Oommission v, National Bank of Oommerce of Seattle,29 the Commission sought enforcement of a subpoena
directed to a bank calling for the production of certain bank records
relating to the accounts of customers who were being investigated
for possible violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities
Acts. The court ordered the bank to comply with the subpoena even
though the customers who were the subjects of the investigation had
directed the bank not to produce the records. The court held not
only that the customers of the bank had no privilege with respect to
the records, but that they did not have sufficient property rights
therein or any other interests sufficient to make them necessary parties
to the subpoena enforcement proceeding.
.
In Howard P. Oarroll, et al. v. Securities and Exohange Oommission, et al.,so plaintiffs sought to enjoin the Commission from exercising its subpoena power in aid of an investigation into sales of
Certain securities by plaintiffs and sought to quash a subpoena issued
by a grand jury sitting in California.
Plaintiffs alleged that the
Commission was exercising its subpoena power to discover evidence
for use in prosecution of a criminal indictment then pending in California against certain of the plaintiffs.
Similar charges were made
concerning the grand jury subpoena. The court granted the Commission's motion to dismiss, holding that it had no jurisdiction to
enjoin the Commission in the conduct of its investigation or to quash
a subpoena not issued in the court's district.
In B. A. Holman &: 00., 1M. v, Securities and Exohange Oommission,sl the plaintiff sought to have the Commission enjoined
from continuing broker-dealer revocation proceedings against it,
claiming that one of the members of the Commission was disqualified
from adjudicating the case because he had previously been Director
of the Commission's Division of Corporation Finance at a time when
that Division had processed a registration statement, which processing ultimately led to the institution of the revocation proceedings.
As noted in the last Annual Report," the district court granted
plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction.
During fiscal 1963,
the court of appeals reversed the order of the district court, holding that plaintiff had not made a record sufficient to excuse him from
exhausting his administrative remedies." Plaintiff has filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court."

The Wolf Oorporation v. Securities and Ewchange Oommission "
was an action seeking to enjoin the institution of stop-order preceedings against plaintiff's registration statement under the Securities Act
of 1933. The complaint alleged irregularities in the taking of evidence during the preliminary investigation conducted pursuant to
Section 8 (e) of the Act, and plaintiff argued that the order authorizing a public hearing pursuant to Section 8 (d) was rendered unlawful because it was based. on the results of that investigation. The
District Court for the District of Columbia denied plaintiff's motion
for preliminary injunction," holding that the issues raised in the
complaint were not subject to judicial review until plaintiff had exhausted its administrative remedies. The court of appeals affirmed," holding that the complaint failed to state a cause of action
on which relief could be granted. A motion for a stay pending
petition for a writ of certiorari was thereafter denied by the court
of appeals, and a similar motion was denied by the Chief Justice of
the United States Supreme Court.
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

The statutes administered by the Commission provide that the
Commission may transmit evidence of violations of any provisions
of these statutes to the Attorney General, who in turn, may institute
criminal proceedings. Where facts ascertained as a result of an investigation by a regional officeof the Commission or at times its headquarters office appear to warrant criminal prosecution, a detailed
report is prepared. After careful review by the General Counsel's
Office, the recommendations of the regional office and the General
Counsel's Office are considered by the Commission and, if the Commission believes criminal prosecution is appropriate, the case is referred to the Attorney General and to the appropriate United States
Attorney. Commission employees familiar with the case generally
assist the United States Attorney in the presentation of the facts to
the Grand Jury, the preparation of legal memoranda for use in the
trial, the conduct of the trial, and the preparation of briefs on appeal.
During fiscal year 1963, the Commission referred 49 cases to the
Department of Justice for prosecution. In the course of the year,
40 indictments were returned, in cases referred prior to and during
the fiscal year, against 117 defendants and 115 convictions were had in
50 cases, while convictions were affirmed in 11 cases.

trict Courts in 753 cases developed by the Commission and 1,695
convictions have been obtained. The record of convictions obtained
and upheld in completed cases is over 85 percent for the 29-year life
of the Oommission."
As in prior years, the majority of the criminal cases prosecuted
involved the offer and sale of securities by fraudulent representations
and other fraudulent practices. These activities included high-pressure long-distance telephone "boiler-room" frauds, conversion of customers' funds and securities by broker-dealers or their salesmen, frauds
involving the sale of securities by new as well as established businesses,
and fraudulent securities sales in connection with the promotion of
insurance companies, mortgage companies, oil and gas and other mining ventures, and other types of enterprises. It is not feasible to describe individually each of the many criminal matters pending during
the year." However, two landmark criminal prosecutions which occurred during the fiscal year are discussed below.
On July 14, 1961, an indictment was returned by a Grand Jury
sitting in the Southern District of New York charging 33 individuals
and corporations with manipulating the market price of United Dye
and Chemical Corporation stock on the New York Stock Exchange and
with fraudulently distributing to the public unregistered shares of
this stock. (United States v. Garfield, et d.)
Certain defendants were severed, and others pleaded guilty before
or during the trial, which commenced in March 1962. The trial continued until February 1963, when a jury found the remaining defendants, Virgil D. Dardi, Charles Rosenthal, Charles M. Berman,
Robert B. Gravis and R. B. Gravis, Inc. guilty. Sentences which
had been imposed as of the close of the fiscal year on individual defendants included imprisonment up to '( years and fines up to $50,000.
The evidence at the trial showed that Alexander Guterma, who was
named as a co-conspirator and testified for the Government, and defendants Garfield and Pasternak acquired control of United Dye and
Chemical Corporation by purchasing a controlling block of stock from
Lowell M. Birrell in 1955. Virgil Dardi, who arranged this purchase, received a percentage of the proceeds. Thereafter, in a series
of transactions, Guterma, Garfield and Pasternak caused United Dye
and Chemical to issue 575,000 shares of stock to them for Handridge
Corporation which they controlled. Thus, without any outlay of cash,
asAppendix table 25 contafns a condensed statistical summary of all criminal cases developed by the Commission from fiscal 1934 through fiscal 1963.

the year and In which Indictments have been returned, and the status of each case, are

the Commission which were pending as of June 30, 1963.

125

they received United Dye and Chemical stock which had a then
market value of over $5 million.
In order to distribute this large block of stock to the public
without depressing the market, the services of various "boiler-rooms"
were utilized, including Rockwell Securities Corporation, J. H.
Lederer Co., Cornelia DeVroedt, Inc., :McGrath Securities, Inc., I. F.
Stillman & Co., Inc., R. B. Gravis, Inc. and G. F. Rothschild & Co., Inc.
These "boiler-rooms" employed the typical fraudulent high-pressure
selling practices. Contemporaneously the defendants manipulated
the price of the stock upwards on the New York Stock Exchange by
purchasing large amounts on the Exchange while, at the same time,
selling the stock previously acquired and the stock being purchased
on the Exchange to the public through the "boiler-rooms."
The trial of this one complex fraud and manipulation case to a
lay jury presented litigation problems of great magnitude. At the
conclusion of the trial, which was the longest in the annals of United
States criminal prosecutions, Judge Herlands noted:
. . . There never was a case that was presented with such detail, such documentation, letters, books, records, confirmations, witnesses. There never was a
case that was proved to the hilt the way thse case leas proved (emphasis added).
[The prosecuting attorneys] have been assisted by two very able representatives of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Ralph H. Tracy and Allen
S. Kilmer. It is evident that they performed Herculean labors by way of investigation and ferreting out the facts, and I think that the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Tracy and Mr. Kilmer, deserve commendation for the
way in which they are discharging their function of acting as the financial watchdog for the investment public.
It took years of unremitting labor in the face of all kinds of investigative
difficulties to develop the facts that were presented to the jury, and if the case
took 11 months to present the evidence, one can only imagine how long it took
to dig up the evidence.
I therefore want the Securities and Exchange Commission to know that its
efforts have been recognized, and that the Securities and Exchange Commission
and its facilities and personnel should be implemented and strengthened so that
they could carryon with even greater effectiveness the task of protecting the
securities markets and the investing public from frauds and swindles and other
sophisticated types of chicanery.

The court emphasized the efficientmanner in which the prosecuting
attorneys prepared and conducted their case and stated that the length
of the trial was not attributable to any inadequacy on their part. On
the other hand, the court pointed out, defense counsel's tactics were
designed to create delay and to cause the judge to "lose his temper and
say something which would be grounds for a mistrial."
The convictions of Gerard and Jerry He, former specialists on the
American Stock Exchange, and the other defendants in United States
v. Re, et al., are also of the utmost significance to the Commission's

126

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

enforcement program. The Res and others were charged with participating with Lowell M. Birrell, presently a fugitive in Brazil, in
manipulating the price of Swan-Finch Oil Corporation stock on the
American Stock Exchange and in fraudulently distributing unregistered shares of this stock on the Exchange and through "boilerrooms" which used the manipulated market price as one of the
fraudulent selling devices.
The Res themselves distributed at least 578,000 shares of SwanFinch stock over the Exchange at an aggregate sales price of over $3
million. To prepare the market to absorb these large blocks of SwanFinch stock, the Res made short sales from their specialist's accounts
over a period of time and later covered them with stock from at least
18 nominee accounts controlled by them. They also, on occasion, prevented others from effecting sales of large blocks of stock on the Exchange, "painted the tape" to show considerable ,trading in the stock
at crucial periods, and so executed sales as to close the market in this
stock on the "up tick."
In addition to the large sums realized through the sales of this stock,
the Res received approximately one-quarter of a million dollars from
Birrell as payment for their services.
The importance of the convictions of the Res can best be appreciated
when the specialists' role and function in the securities markets are
considered. As stated at page 23 in the Staff Report on Organization,
Management, and Regulation of Oo'lU1uatof Members on the American
Stock Eeehanqe:
In his unique capacity the specialist stands at the heart of the exchange market
mechanism. He has intimate knowledge of the past market actions of the stock
in which he specializes. He also has sole 'accessto the specialist book showing
outstanding orders both below and above market, which affords him a great competitive advantage over the public. In addition, he exercises a significant Influence on the public appraisal of a security since he is the one who quotes the
market. For all these reasons, it is a matter of tremendous importance in the
maintenance of a fair and orderly market that a specialist's transactions as
principal be only of such kinds and amounts as are consistent with his function
of acting as broker at the vital center of the auction market.

These convictions, as well as the many convictions obtained in other
cases throughout the country, are of the utmost importance to the
Commission in performing its task of protecting the investing public
and deterring further violations.
OFFICE OF PROGRAM

PLANNING

Pursuant to the recommendations of the Special Study of Securities
Markets, a new Office of Program Planning was created subsequent
to the close of the fiscal year. The principal function of this Office

TWENTY-NINTH

is to assist the Commission in establishing policy by analyzing legal,
economic and industrial developments affecting the regulation of the
securities markets. The Office recommends to the Commission the
institution or modification of programs commensurate with the needs
and trends of the securities markets.
The initial task of the Office will be to assist and advise the Commission in the implementation of the recommendations of the Special
Study of Securities Markets. This work involves, in coordination
with other Commission offices and divisions, changes in the rules,
regulations and policies of the Commission and self-regulatory agencies; recommendations for legislation; proposals for modifications of
industry practices and procedures for gathering and analyzing economic data about the securities markets; and conferring, where appropriate, with the self-regulating agencies and the financial community
regarding such proposals.
It is anticipated that, as the recommendations of the Special Study
are implemented, the work of this Office will gradually shift in emphasis to the principal function described above.
COMPLAINTS

AND INVESTIGATIONS

Each of the Acts administered by the Commission specifically
authorizes investigations to determine whether violations of the
Federal securities laws have occurred.
The nine regional offices of the Commission, with the assistance of
their respective branch offices, are chiefly responsible for the conduct
of investigations.
In addition, the Office of Enforcement of the Division of Trading and Markets of the Commission's headquarters office
conducts investigations dealing with matters of particular interest or
urgency, either independently or assisting the regional offices. The
Office of Enforcement also exercises general supervision over and coordination of the investigative activities of the regional offices. Its
staff examines and analyzes the investigative findings and recommendations of the regional offices and recommends appropriate action to
the Commission.
There are available to the Commission several sources of information concerning possible violations of the provisions of the Federal
securities laws. The primary source of information is complaints by
members of the general public concerning the activities of certain
persons in securities transactions.
The Division of Trading and
Markets and the regional offices give careful consideration to this information and, if it appears that violations of the Federal securities
laws may have occurred, an investigation is commenced. Other
sources of information which are of assistance to the Commission in

128

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

carrying out its enforcement responsibilities are the national securities
exchanges, brokerage firms, state and Canadian securities authorities,
better business bureaus, the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. and various law enforcement agencies.
It is the Commission's general policy to conduct its investigations
on a confidential basis. Such a policy is necessary to effective law
enforcement and to protect persons against whom unfounded or
unconfirmed charges might be made. The Commission investigates
many complaints where no violation is ultimately found to have
occurred. To conduct such investigations publicly would ordinarily
result in hardship or embarrassment to many interested persons and
might affect the market for the securities in question, resulting in
injury to investors with no countervailing public benefits. Moreover, members of the public would have a tendency to be reluctant
to furnish information concerning violations if they thought their
personal affairs would be made public. Another advantage of confidential investigations is that persons under suspicion of having
violated the law are not made aware that their activities are under
surveillance, since such awareness might have the effect of frustrating
or obstructing the investigation. Accordingly, the Commission does
not generally divulge the result of a nonpublic investigation unless it
is made a matter of public record in proceedings brought before the
Commission or in the courts.
When it appears that a serious violation of the Federal securities
laws has occurred or is occurring, a case is opened and a full investigation is conducted. Under certain circumstances it becomes necessary for the Commission to issue a formal order of investigation which
appoints members of its staff as officers to issue subpoenas, to take
testimony under oath and to require the production of documents.
Usually this step is taken when the subjects of the investigation and
others who may be involved are uncooperative and it becomes necessary to use the subpoena power to complete the investigation of the
case. During the past year 213 formal orders were issued in connection with investigations handled through the Division of Trading
and Markets.
In addition, there were 11 formal orders issued upon the recommendation of the Division of Corporate Regulation and 27 upon the
recommendation of the Division of Corporation Finance. The latter
Division conducts certain investigative work in connection with the
processing of filings under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
"When an investigation has been completed and enforcement action
appears appropriate, the Commission may proceed in one of several

T~ENTY-NINTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

ways. It may refer the case to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.
The Commission may also, when appropriate, authorize the institution of civil proceedings for injunctive relief to halt
further violations of the Federal securities laws. In such event a
complaint is filed in the appropriate United States District Court and
the case is presented by a member of the Commission's staff. Finally,
the Commission may institute administrative proceedings when its
investigation indicates that a registration statement or report filed
with it is false or misleading or omits required information, or that
a broker-dealer or investment adviser registered with it is violating
the Federal securities laws.

activities of the Commission during fiscal 1963 :

ENFORCEMENT PROBLEMS WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN SECURITIES

Progress was again made during fiscal 1963 in reducing the unlawful offer and sale of Canadian securities in the United States.
The continuing cooperation of responsible Canadian officials and segments of the Canadian securities industry has resulted in even fewer
enforcement problems with respect to such activities than last year.
This decrease, however, has been offset by an increasing number of
fraudulent promotions from other sources outside the United States.
During the past fiscal year United States residents have been subjected to massive mail campaigns from such diverse areas as Panama,
Ireland, Switzerland and the Bahamas.
In its efforts to deal with
these problems, the Commission has employed new and simplified
procedures for obtaining issuance of foreign postal fraud orders.
The success of this program is due in large measure to the continuing
cooperation of the Post Office Department.
The Commission is still hampered by jurisdictional problems, including the status of the Supplementary Extradition Convention with
Canada."
The Commission continues to maintain its Canadian Restricted List,
which is a list of Canadian companies whose securities the Commission
'" See 26th Annual Report pp. 202-203 for a description of some of these problems.

has reason to believe are being, or recently have been, distributed in
the United States in violation of the registration requirements of
the Securities Act of 1933. The list and supplements thereto are
issued to and published by the press, and copies are mailed to all
registered broker-dealers and are available to the public. As a practical matter, most United States broker-dealers refuse to. execute transactions in such securities.
The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the
Commission's right to publish the Canadian Restricted List in K ukatush Mining Oorporation v. Seourities and Ewahange Oom;mission.41
In its opinion, the court pointed out that the list does not charge
anyone with any wrongdoing, and that the Commission expressly disavows any comment on the investment merits of the securities listed.
The court said that listing simply states "a fact-that
the securities
have not been registered-which
the American public has a right to

know."
Eleven supplements to the list were issued in fiscal 1963. As a
result of more effective enforcement activities here and in Canada,
it was necessary to add only '7 names to the list during the year, compared to 9 names added in fiscal 1962, 47 in fiscal 1961, and 82 in fiscal
1960. Twelve names were deleted during the year, leaving 253 names
on the list as of June 30, 1963.

SECTION OF SECURITIES

VIOLATIONS

A Section of Securities Violations is maintained by the Commission
as a part of its enforcement program to provide a further means of
detecting and preventing fraud in securities transactions. The Section maintains files providing a clearinghouse for other enforcement

TWENTY-NINTH

133

agencies for information concerning persons who have been charged
with violation or found in violation of various Federal and state securities statutes. Considerable information is also available concerning
Canadian violators. The specialized information in these files is kept
current through the cooperation of the U.S. Post Office Department,
The Federal Bureau of Investigation, parole and probation officials,
state securities authorities, Federal and state prosecuting attorneys,
police officers, better business bureaus, chambers of commerce, the
NASD and other agencies. At the end of the fiscal year these records
contained information concerning 78,216 persons against whom Federal or state action had been taken in connection with securities violations. In keeping these records current there were added during the
fiscal year items of information concerning 8,985 persons, including
2,995 persons not previously identified in these records. A total of
3,779 names was removed from the files since the information concernmg them was believed to be obsolete.
The Section issues and distributes quarterly a securities violations
bulletin containing information received during the period concerning
alleged and actual violators and showing new charges and developments in pending cases. The bulletin includes a "wanted" section
listing the names of persons wanted on securities violations charges
and references to bulletins containing descriptive information regarding them. The bulletin is distributed to a limited number of officials
of cooperating law enforcement and other agencies in the United
States and Canada.
The bulletin also includes a new section reporting on NASD disciplinary actions which resulted in the expulsion or suspension of an
Association member, or in the revocation or suspension of the registration of a representative of a member. Information in this section includes a brief description of the findings in each reported case and
identifies the disciplined member or representative.
Extensive use is made of the information available in these records
by regulatory and law enforcement officials. Numerous requests are
received each year for special reports on individuals in addition to the
information supplied by regular distribution of the quarterly bulletin.
All available information is supplied in response to inquiries from la w
enforcement agencies. During the fiscal year the Commission received
and disposed of 2,778 "securities violations" letters or reports and dispatched 491 communications to cooperating agencies.
APPLICATIONS

FOR NONDISCWSURE

OF CERTAIN INFORMATION

The Commission is authorized under the various Acts administered
by it to grant requests for nondisclosure of certain types of information which would otherwise be disclosed to the public in applications,

134

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

reports or other documents filed pursuant to these statutes. Thus,
under paragraph (30) of Schedule A of the Securities Act of 1933,
disclosure of any portion of a material contract is not required if the
Commission determines that such disclosure would impair the value
of the contract and is not necessary for the protection of investors.
Under Section 24(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trade
secrets or processes need not be disclosed in any material filed with the
Commission. Under Section 24(b) of that Act, written objection to
public disclosure of information contained in any material filed with
the Commission may be made to the Commission which is then authorized to make public disclosure of such information only if in its
judgment such disclosure is in the public interest. Similar provisions
are contained in Section 22 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935 and in Section 45 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
These statutory provisions have been implemented by rules specifying
the procedure to be followed by applicants for a determination that
public disclosure is not necessary in a particular case.
The number of applications granted, denied or otherwise acted upon
during the year are set forth in the following table:

ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMMISSION IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

The several Acts administered by the Commission recognize the
importance of dependable informative financial statements which
disclose the financial status and earnings history of a corporation
or other commercial entity. These statements, whether filed in compliance with the requirements under those statutes or included in
other material available to stockholders or prospective investors,
are indispensable to investors as a basis for investment decisions.
The Congress, cognizant of the fact that such statements lend themselves readily to misleading inferences or even deception, whether
or not intended, included, in the various Acts, express provisions
with respect to disclosure requirements. Thus, for example, the
Securities Act requires the inclusion in the prospectus of balance

TWENTY-NINTH

ANNUAL REPORT

135

sheets and profit and loss statements "in such form as the Commission shall prescribe" 42and authorizes the Commission to prescribe
the "items or details to be shown in the balance sheet and earnings
statement, and the methods to be followed in the preparation of
accounts ... " 43 Similar authority is contained in the Securities
Exchange Act,44 and even more comprehensive power is embodied in
the Investment Company Act 45and the Public Utility Holding Company Aet."
Pursuant to the broad rule-making power thus conferred with
respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements, the
Commission has prescribed uniform systems of accounts for companies
subject to the Holding Company Act; 47has adopted rules under the
Securities Exchange Act governing accounting and auditing of securities brokers and dealers; 4Sand has promulgated rules contained in a
single comprehensive regulation, identified as Regulation S_X,49which
governs the form. and content of financial statements filed in compliance with the several Acts. This regulation is supplemented by
the Commission's Accounting Series Releases, of which 97 have so
far been issued. These releases were inaugurated in 1937 and were
designed as a program for making public from time to time opinions on accounting principles for the purpose of contributing to the
development of uniform. standards and practice in major accounting questions. The rules and regulations thus established, except
for the uniform systems of accounts which are regulatory reports,
prescribe accounting principles to be followed only in certain limited
areas. In the large area of financial reporting not covered by such
rules, the Commission's principal means of providing investors protection from inadequate financial reporting, fraudulent practices and
over-reaching by management is by requiring a certificate of an independent public accountant based on an audit performed in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards which expresses an opinion as to whether the financial statements are presented fairly in
conformity with accounting principles and practices which are recognized as sound and which have attained general acceptance .

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The Securities Act provides that the financial statements required
to be made available to the public through filing with the Commission
shall be certified by "an independent public or certified accountant." 50
The other three statutes permit the Commission to require that such
statements be accompanied by a certificate of an independent public
accountant." and the Commission's rules require, with minor exceptions, that they be so certified. The value of certification by qualified
accountants has been conceded for many years, but the requirement as
to independence, long recognized and adhered to by some individual
accountants, was for the first time authoritatively and explicitly introduced into law in 1933. The Commission's rules accept an accountant
who is qualified to practice in his own state as qualified to practice
before the Commission unless he has entered into disqualifying relationships with a particular client, such as becoming a promoter, underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer,employee, or stockholder; 52 or,
in rare cases, has demonstrated incompetence, subservience to the management, or has engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct.53 The Commission endeavors to encourage and foster the
independence of the accountant in his relationships with his client
so that he may better be able to perform the service to the public contemplated by the Congress in the various Acts.
The Commission is vigilant in its efforts to assure itself that the
audits which it requires are performed by independent accountants;
that the information contained in the financial reports represents full
and fair disclosure and that appropriate auditing and accounting practices and standards have been followed in their preparation.
In addition it recognizes that changes and new developments in financial and
economic conditions affect the operations and financial status of the
several thousand commercial and industrial companies required to file
statements with the Commission and that accounting and auditing
procedures cannot remain static and continue to serve well a dynamic
economy. The Commission's accounting staff, therefore, studies
the changes and new developments for the purpose of establishing and
maintaining appropr-iate accounting and auditing policies, procedures
nnd practices for the protection of investors. The primary responsibility for this program rests with the Chief Accountant of the Commission, who has general supervision with respect to accounting and
auditing policies and their application.

Progress in these activities requires continuing contact and consultation between the staff and accountants both individually and
through such representative groups as, among others, the American
Accounting Association, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, the American Petroleum Institute, the Financial Analysts Federation, the Financial Executives Institute, and the National
Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, as well as many
Government agencies. Recognizing the importance of cooperation in
the formulation of accounting principles and practices, adequate disclosure and auditing procedures which will best serve the interests of
investors, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the
Financial Analysts Federation and the Financial Executives Institute
appoint committees which maintain liaison with the Commission's
staff. The Commission on its part has authorized its Chief Accountant to continue to serve as a member of an advisory committee to the
Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants and of a somewhat similar committee of the
American Accounting Association.
The many daily decisions to be made require the attention of some
of the Chief Accountant's staff. These include questions raised by
each of the operating divisions of the Commission, the regional offices,
and the Commission. As a result of this day-to-day activity of the
Commission and the need to keep abreast of current accounting problems, the Chief Accountant's staff continually reexamines accounting
and auditing principles and practices. From time to time members
of the staff are called upon to assist in field investigations, to participate in hearings and to review opinions insofar as they pertain to
accounting matters.
Prefiling and other conferences, in person or by telephone, with
officials of corporations, practicing accountants and others are also an
important part of the work of the staff. Resolution of questions and
problems in this manner saves registrants and their representatives
both time and expense.
Many specific accounting and auditing problems are disclosed in the
examination of financial statements required to be filed with the Commission. Where examination reveals that the rules and regulations
of the Commission have not been complied with or that applicable
generally accepted accounting principles have not been adhered to,
the examining division usually notifies the registrant by an informal
letter of comment. These letters of comment and the correspondence
or conferences that follow continue to be a most convenient and satisfactory method of effecting corrections and improvements in financial
statements, both to registrants and to the Commission's staff. 'Where

138

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

particularly difficult or novel questions arise which cannot be settled by
the accounting staff of the divisions and by the Chief Accountant, they
are referred to the Commission for consideration and decision.
Difficulties often arise in connection with initial filings because
accountants and other advisers who serve the registrant have not had
any prior experience with the Commission. In some cases these persons have not familiarized themselves with the rules and regulations
of the Commission-particularly
the instructions as to financial statements required by the forms, the rules relating to independence of the
certifying accountant, and those relating to the form and content of
financial statements as set forth in Regulation S-X. In an effort to
improve this situation several members of the a.ccounting staff of the
Commission, at the invitation of the sponsor, the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants, participated in a course on filings
with the Commission. This course, in which the enrollment quota
was filled each time it was presented, was given in Chicago, Los
Angeles, New York, and San Francisco.
It appears that the course
will be offered during the next fiscal year in cities located in other
sections of the United States.
In 1961, the Commission adopted Form 8-11, a new form designed
to provide adequate disclosure of certain special problems found in
filings made by real estate companies."
In June 1962, the Commission
also adopted new Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act and new Form 7-K to require such companies to file
quarterly reports showing profit and loss, cash generated, cash distributions to stockholders and cash balance."
At the time these new forms and rules were adopted it was believed
that information filed pursuant to these requirements would provide
adequate disclosures with respect to the financial condition and operations of real estate companies. However, late in 1962 a number of
cases came to the attention of the Commission in which the gross profits
on certain real estate transactions were taken into income under circumstances which indicated that they were not realized in the period
in which the transactions were recorded.
In some of the situations coming before the Commission it appeared
from the attendant circumstances that the sale of property was a mere
fiction designed to create the illusion of profits or value as a basis for
the sale of securities. Moreover, even in bona fide transactions the
degree of uncertainty as to the ultimate realization of profits appeared
to be so great that business prudence, as well as generally accepted

accounting principles, precluded the recognition of gain at the time
of sale. In view of the foregoing the Commission issued Accounting
Series Release No. 9556 in which it listed circumstances which tend to
raise a question as to the propriety of current recognition of profit and
stated that while any of the circumstances taken alone might not preclude the recognition of profit in an appropriate amount the degree
of uncertainty may be accentuated by the presence of a combination of
the circumstances listed in the release.
The Chief Accountant's Office cooperated with the Division of Corporate Regulation in the preparation of amendments to Rules 31a-1
and 31a-2 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and of a new
Rule 31a-3, which were adopted by the Commission in November
1962.57 These rules, which are discussed in more detail at page 19,
supra, relate to records to be maintained and preserved by registered
investment companies, certain majority-owned subsidiaries thereof,
and other persons having transactions with registered investment companies.
The Chief Accountant and his staff continued to cooperate with
other divisions of the Commission and the industry in the preparation
of a proposal to amend Regulation S-X which would add to that
regulation provisions governing the form and content of financial
statements and related schedules to be filed by life insurance companies.
The Commission's guide to the form and content of financial statements is found in Regulation S-X which is supplemented by a series
of accounting releases. Number 4 in this series was published April
25, 1938, and still is the significant statement of the Commission's
administrative policy on financial statements. This policy was re-emphasized in January 1963, when the Commission found it necessary
to issue an accounting release 56 expressing some views on accounting
for the "investment credit," a new idea in the United States tax law
which stirred up considerable difference of opinion in business and
professional accounting circles.
In view of the substantial diversity of opinion that exists in this
matter, the Commission stated, in its release, that it will accept with
certain limitations either the method endorsed by the Accounting
Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 59 or the 48-52 percent method or, in the case of regulated industries, the 100 percent flow-through method when authorized or
required by regulatory authorities. This release also specified that the
balance sheet credit should not be made directly to the asset account,

and that income tax should not be stated in excess of the amount payable for the year, and included other comments regarding adequate
disclosure, details of certain other accounts, and acceptance of appropriately qualified certificates in cases where an alternative accounting
treatment acceptable to the Commission is followed by the registrant.
Shortly before the close of the fiscal year the Commission issued
its Findings, Opinion and Order in Harmon R. Stone, a proceeding
under Rule 2 (e) of its Rules of Practice." The Commission found
that Stone, a certified public accountant, had inadequately performed
his professional duties and engaged in activities incompatible with required professional independence. In his audits of a broker-dealer,
Stone omitted many of the Commission's Minimum Audit Requirements applicable to Form X-17A-5 relating to reports of registered
broker-dealers and failed to comply with generally accepted auditing
standards in that he did not properly obtain confirmation of customers' accounts and closed accounts; did not properly balance securi -

ties positions or verify securities in transfer; did not take physical
control of all cash, securities and other transferable evidence of ownership and maintain such control until those items were inspected,
counted, and compared with the records and did not perform other
additional verification procedures. Stone's failure to properly perform these procedures negated the effectiveness of his audit; and
consequently his audit fell far short of the objective review required
for the purpose of safeguarding funds and securities of customers and
failed to give the public the protection which an audit is designed to
achieve. Stone's certificates stating that his examinations were made
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards were accordingly false and misleading. Stone's lack of independence resulted
from the fact that he acquired a personal financial interest in the repayment of loans made by a company in which he was a principal
stockholder to salesmen and customers of his client, a registered
broker-dealer. In reaching its conclusion the Commission took into
consideration the fact that Stone had been a certified public accountant
since 1950. Apart from these proceedings there was no evidence that
his professional conduct had ever been questioned and he submitted statements from a large number of persons who attested to his
character and competence in other accounting work. The Commission did not believe that its findings in these proceedings raised a
basic question as to his personal integrity and noted that Stone responded to its staff's examination into this matter with full cooperation and candor. However, because Stone's conduct constituted a
serious breach of the standards of his profession and of his responsieoAccounting Series Release No. 97 (May 21, 1963).

the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 securities issued, or guaranteed
as to both principal and interest, by the International Bank for R~construction and Development. The Bank is required to file with the
Commission such annual and other reports with respect to such securities as the Commission shall determine to be appropriate in view
of the special character of the Bank and its operations and necessary

INTER.AMERICAN

DEVEWPMENT

BANK

The Inter-American Development Bank Act, which authorizes the
United States to participate in the new Inter-American Development
Bank, provides an exemption for certain securities which may be
issued by the Bank similar to that provided for securities of the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Acting
pursuant to this authority, the Commission adopted Regulation I.A,
which requires the Bank to file with the Commission substantially the
same information, documents and reports as are required from the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Bank
is also required to file a report with the Commission prior to the sale
of any of its primary obligations to the public in the United States.
During the year ended June 30, 1963, the Bank made 22 loans totaling the equivalent of $146,109,191from its ordinary capital resources,
bringing the gross total of loan commitments outstanding at June
30, to 69 loans aggregating $294,966,049. During the year, the Bank
sold or agreed to sell $4,749,772 in 'participations in the aforesaid
loans, all of such participations being without the guarantee of the
Bank. The loans from the Bank's ordinary capital resources were
made in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico,

STATISTICS AND SPECIAL STUDIES

During the past fiscal year the Branch of Economic Research continued its regular work in connection with the statistical activities of
the Commission and the overall Government statistical program under
the direction of the Office of Statistical Standards, Bureau of the
Budget. In addition, the Branch of Exchange Regulation continued
its compilation of data on the stock market.
The statistical series described below are published in the Commission's Statistical Bulletin and in addition, except for data on
registered issues, on corporate pension funds, and on the stock market,
current figures and analyses of the data are published in quarterly
press releases.
Issues Registered Under the Securities Act

or

Monthly statistics are compiled on the number and volume of
registered securities, classified by industry of issuer, type of security,
and use of proceeds. Summary statistics for the years 1935-63 are
given in Appendix Table 1 and detailed statistics for the fiscal year
1963 appear in Appendix Table 2.
New Securities Offerings

This is a monthly and quarterly series covering all new corporate
and noncorporate issues offered for cash sale in the United States.
The series includes not only issues publicly offered but also issues
privately placed, as well as other issues exempt from registration
under the Securities Act such as intrastate offerings and railroad
securities. The offerings series includes only securities actually offered for cash sale, and only issues offered for account of issuers.
Annual statistics on new offerings for recent years as well as monthly

to investors for securities retired. Data on gross issues, retirements
and net change in securities outstanding are presented for all corporations and for the principal industry groups.
Individuals' Saving

The Commission compiles quarterly estimates of the volume and
composition of individuals' saving in the United States. The series
represents net increases in individuals' financial assets less net increases in debt. The study shows the aggregate amount of saving
and the form in which the saving occurred, such as investment in
securities, expansion of bank deposits, increases in insurance and
pension reserves, etc. A reconciliation of the Commission's estimates
with the personal saving estimates of the Department of Commerce,
derived in connection with its national income series, is published
annually by the Department of Commerce as well as in the Securities
and Exchange Commission Statistical Bulletin.
Corporate Pension Funds

An annual survey is made of pension plans of all United States
corporations where funds are administered by corporations themselves, or through trustees. The survey shows the flow of money into
these funds, the types of assets in which the funds are invested and
the principal items of income and expenditures.
Financial Position of Corporations

The series on the working capital position of all United States corporations, excluding banks, insurance companies and savings and
loan associations, shows the principal components of current assets
and liabilities, and also contains an abbreviated analysis of the sources
and uses of corporate funds.
The Commission, jointly with the Federal Trade Commission,
compiles a quarterly financial report of all United States manufacturing concerns. This report gives complete balance sheet data
and an abbreviated income account, data being classified by industry
and size of company.

exchanges for accounts of members and nonmembers, odd-lot stock
transactions on the New York exchanges, special offerings and secondary distributions.
It also computes indexes of stock market

stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
This stock price
index and data on round-lot and odd-lot trading on the two New York
exchanges are released weekly. The other statistical data mentioned
above, as well as these weekly series, are published regularly in the
Commission's Statistical Bulletin.
OPINIONS OF THE COMMISSION

Administrative proceedings under the statutes administered by the
Commission and under its Rules of Practice generally culminate in
the issuance of an opinion by the Commission, which includes findings of fact and conclusions of law. The' extent to which the factual
and legal issues are discussed in these opinions depends largely on
their importance and novelty.
In the preparation of opinions, the Commission, or the individual
Commissioner to whom a case may be assigned for the preparation
of an opinion, is generally assisted by the Office of Opinion Writing.
This Office is directly responsible to the Commission and is completely
independent of the operating divisions, consistent with the principle
of separation of functions embodied in the Administrative Procedure
Act. Where the parties to a proceeding waive their right to such
separation, the operating division of the Commission which participated in the proceeding may assist in the drafting of the Commission's decision.
The Commission's opinions are publicly released and are distributed
to the' press and to persons on the Commission's mailing list. In
addition, they are printed and published periodically by the Government Printing Office in bound volumes entitled "Securities and
Exchange Commission Decisions and Reports."

DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

The dissemination of information included in the various corporate
reports and financing proposals filed in compliance with the securities
laws is an important function of the Commission. The information in such reports and proposals, which are public documents available for inspection by investors and other interested persons, is not
only reprinted and circulated through the medium of published
securities manuals but is frequently and widely reported in business
and financial sections of newspapers and national magazines.
In order to keep the public better informed of the pertinent information included in the corporate financing and other proposals filed
with the Commission as well as actions taken by it under the securities
laws, the Commission issues a daily News Digest containing a resume
of each filing, as well as a summary of each order, decision or other
action of the Commission. The Digest is not only made available
to the press, but is also distributed on a subscription basis by the Government Printing Office to some 2,169 investors, securities firms and
other interested persons. During the year, the Digest included a resume of each of the 985 registration statements filed with the Commission
(not including investment company filings which added additional
securities by way of amendments to previous statements) ; and it also
included summaries of the 1,293 orders, decisions, rules and other
actions of the Commission. The Commission also makes a more limited distribution of the full text of its decisions and other pronouncements to registrants, practicing lawyers and others.
Members of the Commission and its staff frequently deliver addresses before professional, business and other groups, and participate
in "briefing" and other conferences in order to explain important rules
and policies and otherwise contribute to a better understanding of the
role of the Commission by individuals and firms subject to its jurisdiction as well as by the investing public.
Information

Available for Public Inspection

The many thousands of registration statements, applications, declarations, and annual and other periodic reports filed each year .are
available for public inspection at the Commission's principal office in
Washington, D.C. In addition, copies of recent reports filed by companies having securities listed on exchanges other than the New York
Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange, and copies of current reports of many nonlisted companies which have registered securities for public offering under the Securities Act, may be examined in
the Commission's New York regional office; and recent reports filed
by companies whose securities are listed on the New York and American Stock Exchanges may be examined in the -
Commission's Chicago

regional office. Moreover, there are available for examination in all
regional officescopies of prospectuses relating to recent public offerings
of securities registered under the Securities Act; and all regional offices
have copies of broker-dealer annual financial reports and Regulation
A letters of notification filed in their respective regions. Reports of
companies whose securities are listed on the various exchanges may be
seen at the respective exchange offices.
In order to facilitate a wider dissemination of financial and other
information contained in corporate reports filed with the Commission
under the Federal securities laws (an objective strongly urged by the
Special Study Report), the Commission has arranged to take standing
orders, on an experimental basis, for photocopies of Form 1D-K annual
reports filed. This service may be extended later to other reports,
depending upon public reception and the experience gained in supplying copies of annual reports.
Under a new contract with Cooper-Trent, Inc., for reproducing material in the Commission's files in response to requests of members of
the public, photocopies may now be obtained at a reduced cost of 111;2
cents for pages not exceeding 81;2" x 14" in size (plus postage). A
detailed Table of Charges may be obtained from the Section of Public
Reference. The charge for each certification of any such document by
the Commission is $2.
So that corporate reports may be more readily available for examination by interested members of the public, the Commission also has made
arrangements for the Form lO-K annual reports to be placed on open
shelves in the public area of its public reference room in Washington,
D.C., thus making these reports available for immediate inspection.
Moreover, a coin-operated photocopier has been installed which will
enable vistors to make immediate reproductions of these and other
reports at a cost of 25 cents per page. Reproductions prepared by
this method can not be certified by the Commission.
Each year many thousands of requests for photocopies of and information from the public files of the Commission are received by the
public reference room in Washington, D.C. During the year 5,009
persons examined material on file in the Washington, D.C. office, and
several thousand others examined files in the New York and Chicago
regional offices. About 249,424 photocopy pages were sold pursuant
to 4,120 individual orders.
PUBLICATIONS

In addition to the daily News Digest, and releases concerning Commi~sion action under the Acts administered by it and concerning Iiti-

The following organizational changes have been made since June 30,
1962, in accordance with the Commission's policy of continuing review
of its organization and functional alignments:
As noted in last year's report," a Branch of Investment Company
Inspections was established in the Division of Corporate Regulation in July 1962, to plan and supervise the Commission's investment
company inspection program.
In December 1962, this Branch was
assigned the responsibility for investigations and enforcement actions
with respect to investment companies, and is now called the Branch of

Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, was also given responsibility forits functions under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act; and a staff unit
was established to assist the Commission in policy planning under theInvestment Company Act of 1940.
There was a realignment of functions in the New York Regional
Office in August 1962, involving principally the consolidation of enforcement activities under an Assistant Regional Administrator and
the appointment of another Assistant Regional Administrator with
responsibility for the Commission's functions under Chapter X of the
Bankruptcy Act and for the investment company and investment adviser inspection programs.
Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, certain organizational
changes were effected pursuant to recommendations of the .special
Study of Securities Markets. A new Office of Program Planning was
organized, whose functions have been described on an earlier page."
In addition, the Division of Trading and Exchanges was renamed the
Division of Trading and Markets, and its functions were realigned.
As reconstituted, the Division consists of six units-The
Offices of
Chief Counsel, Criminal Reference, Enforcement, Regulation, Special
Proceedings, and Statistical Studies.
PERSONNEL

AND FINANCIAL

MANAGEMENT

The recruitment program of the Commission is designed to attract
outstanding college and law school graduates for starting professional
level positions such as financial analyst, attorney and investigator.
The passage of the Federal Salary Reform Act of 1962, helped to
alleviate the disparity between the Government and private industry
as to starting salaries, and the Commission was successful in appointing to its staff a number of well-qualified applicants.
The average grade level of positions in the Commission as of June
30, 1963, was G8-9.63, compared with G8-S.76 for 1962. This was
a relatively small increase, considering the fact that more than 65 percent of the positions are in the professional category and ever- increasing duties and responsibilities are being assigned to the incumbents.
To better acquaint supervisory personnel and other employees with
the provisions of the Federal Salary Reform Act of 1962, the Commission's Director of Personnel conducted a series of 10 meetings with
employees of the Headquarters Office. Written guidelines for determining the new standard of "acceptable level of competence" for
periodic step increases, and for granting within-grade step increases
for quality performance were approved by the Commission and published on May 24, 1963.

151

The Commission continued to supplement its on-the-job training
of newly appointed professional employees with more formalized
training sessions conducted after office hours. This permitted utilization of senior officials as lecturers or instructors; solved classroom space
problems; 'and enabled work production to continue without interruption.
Several of the regional offices conducted instructional
sessions for newly employed attorneys and investigators and the
Division of Corporate Regulation sponsored one-week sessions on the
Investment Company Act of 1940 in the N ew York, Chicago and San
Francisco Regional Offices.
New or revised personnel policy statements were issued dealing with
such subjects as appeals from adverse actions, employee management
cooperation, equal employment opportunity and position classification. The Office of Personnel also published and distributed to the
staff an employee handbook containing information on the personnel
policies of the Commission, including its Regulation Governing the
Conduct of Members and Employees and Former Members and
Employees.
At the Commission's Seventh Annual Service and Merit Awards
Ceremony, held in October 1962, the Commission recognized the long
service of its career employees by presenting pins to 22 employees
with 25 years of Commission service. An additional 62 employees
received 20- 15- and lO-year service pins. Length-of-service pins were
also awarded to employees for combined Federal service. One employee received a pin for 35 years, 3 employees for 30 years, 11 employees for 25 years, 41 employees for 20 years, 25 employees for 15
years and 39 employees for 10 years. Cash awards totaling $8,955
and certificates of merit were presented to 83 employees. Twenty-four
employees were granted additional within-grade increases in recognition of high quality performance.
The Commission is singularly proud of the special recognition which
has been accorded certain members of the staff. Mention has already
been made of the commendation of Ralph H. Tracy and Allen S.
Kilmer, of the Division of Corporation Finance, by the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, for their participation in the United Dye and Chemical Corporation case. 53 In
May 1963, Andrew Barr, Chief Accountant of the Commission, was
elected to the Accounting Hall of Fame, sponsored by Ohio State University. Elections to the Hall of Fame (there have been 27 since its
