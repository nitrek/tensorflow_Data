ORDER POSTPONING HEARING
AND DIRECTING THE PARTIES TO
HOLD AN INITIAL PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

On August 16, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondents. A hearing is currently scheduled for September 19,
2016. On August 24, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a motion to postpone the hearing
and schedule a telephonic prehearing conference.
I POSTPONE the hearing and direct the parties to hold an initial prehearing conference
without the hearing officer by September 9, 2016, to discuss each numbered item in Rule of
Practice 221(c), 17 C.F.R. § 201.221(c), including the date by which each item will be
accomplished. By September 14, 2016, the parties shall file a joint prehearing conference
statement which: (1) addresses each numbered item in Rule 221(c), including proposed due
dates where applicable (the parties may denote that an item is “not applicable” in their filing);
(2) establishes the date the OIP was served on Respondents in accordance with 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.141; (3) indicates whether Respondents waive their right to a hearing between thirty and
sixty days after service of the OIP, see 15 U.S.C. §§ 77h-1(b), 78u-3(b); and (4) states whether
the parties will elect to have the recently amended Rules of Practice apply to this proceeding, and
proposes a procedural schedule that will result in a hearing commencing within the timeframes
provided those rules, depending on which version applies.1

pkg/FR-2016-07-29/pdf/2016-16987.pdf. In the release announcing the amended rules, the
Commission provided that for proceedings initiated between July 13, 2016, and the effective date
of the amended rules, the parties may elect to have the amended rules apply by every party
submitting, within fourteen days of service of the OIP, a written request to the Secretary for
application of the amended rules to the proceeding. Id. at 50228-29 & n.184. If the parties elect

The prehearing statement should also address a potential hearing location and how many
days might be necessary to complete the hearing. Based on this statement, a subsequent
prehearing conference with the hearing officer will be scheduled if appropriate. If the parties are
unable to hold a prehearing conference by September 9, 2016, the Division shall notify my office
before that date.
