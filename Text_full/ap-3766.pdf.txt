The parties have communicated to my office their agreement to reschedule the hearing in

preserving their constitutional arguments.

California, at a location to be determined.

The parties are reminded that all filings must be filed in hard copy with the Office of the
Secretary. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.151, .152. They are asked to always email courtesy copies of
filings to alj@sec.gov in Word and in PDF text-searchable format. Electronic copies of exhibits
should not be combined into a single PDF file, but sent as separate attachments, and should be
provided in text-searchable format whenever practicable.
Lastly, the guidelines set forth in my March 16 order remain in effect.
