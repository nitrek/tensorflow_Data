In the Matter of
ALAN SHEINWALD

ORDER DENYING REQUEST TO VACATE BARS
Alan Sheinwald seeks to vacate an administrative order, dated April 2, 2014 (the
"Order"), to the extent that it bars him from association with any nationally recognized statistical
rating organization ("NRSRO") or municipal advisor.1
The Order barred Sheinwald from "association with any broker, dealer, investment
adviser, municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent" and from "participating in any offering of
a penny stock, including: acting as a promoter, finder, consultant, agent or other person who
engages in activities with a broker, dealer or issuer for purposes of the issuance or trading in any
penny stock, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock. . . ." It
did not, however, bar him from association with an NRSRO or a municipal advisor.
Accordingly, Alan Sheinwald's request to vacate NRSRO and municipal advisor bars is denied.
By the Commission.
