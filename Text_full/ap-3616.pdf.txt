In the Matter of
ORDER
HUDSON CAPITAL PARTNERS CORPORATION

On January 13, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondent pursuant to Section 203(e) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. On February 5, 2016, I postponed the hearing in this matter and ordered
the Division of Enforcement to file a declaration addressing whether service of the OIP had been
accomplished in accordance with Rule of Practice 141, 17 C.F.R. § 201.141. Hudson Capital
Partners Corp., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3579, 2016 SEC LEXIS 485.
On February 12, 2016, the Division filed a declaration establishing that: Respondent is a
New York corporation, the New York Secretary of State is an agent for Respondent upon whom
process may be served, and Respondent was served with the OIP via personal delivery to the
New York Secretary of State on February 8, 2016. I find that Respondent was served in
accordance with Rule 141(a)(2)(ii). 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii). Accordingly, Respondent’s
answer is due by February 29, 2016. See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(a), .220(b). If
Respondent fails to timely file an answer or otherwise defend the proceeding, it will be deemed
in default and the proceeding will be determined against it. See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), .220(f).
While Respondent was found in default in the civil action against it,1 Respondent has
prevailed in a recent private litigation where it was represented by counsel. See Rose v. Rahfco
Mgmt. Grp., LLC, No. 13-cv-5804, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 182269 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 2014)
(granting Respondent’s motion to dismiss). Therefore, I encourage the Division to reach out to
Respondent and its former or current counsel to determine what Respondent’s intentions are for
this matter, if any.
