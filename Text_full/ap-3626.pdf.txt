File No. 3-16836

In the Matter of
STEVEN J. MUEHLER,
ALTERNATIVE SECURITIES MARKETS
GROUP CORP., AND
BLUE COAST SECURITIES CORP., dba
GLOBALCROWDTV, INC., AND BLUE
COAST BANC

ORDER AS TO KOOROSH RAHIMI

The hearing in this proceeding is scheduled to begin on February 22, 2016. Yesterday,
my office received an email from Koorosh Rahimi, a witness subpoenaed at the request of
Respondent Steven J. Muehler to testify at the hearing. Rahimi informed that he would not
appear at the hearing for two reasons: 1) subpoenas in the state of California need to be twenty
days before a court hearing, whereas the Commission subpoena was “only 4 days before the
hearing”; and 2) he will be “out of town next week on a pre-arranged trip.”
No authority supports the notion that a California procedure governs Commission
administrative proceedings. Furthermore, although the hearing will begin on February 22,
Muehler’s presentation of witnesses will not begin that day. Therefore, Rahimi is directed to
comply with the subpoena and appear at the hearing on Monday, February 29, 2016, at 9:30 a.m.
at the following location: U.S. District Court, 312 North Spring Street, Courtroom 24, Los
Angeles, California.
Rahimi is warned that if he fails to comply with the subpoena, he may be referred for
subpoena enforcement proceedings in federal district court.
