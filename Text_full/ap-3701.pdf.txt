On February 25, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in
their periodic filings. On March 1, I postponed the hearing in this matter and scheduled a
prehearing conference for April 7, 2016. Chardan China Acquisition Corp., Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3660, 2016 SEC LEXIS 772.
Respondents were served with the OIP on February 27, 2016, and their answers were due
by March 11, 2016. Id. To date, no Respondent has filed an answer.

the registrations of their securities should not be revoked by default due to their failures to file
answers or otherwise defend this proceeding. Any Respondent that fails to respond to this order
will be deemed in default, the proceeding will be determined against it, and the registration of its
securities will be revoked. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
