September 2, 2016

Kevin M. Murphy appeals from a FINRA order barring him from association with any
FINRA member in any capacity for failing to provide information and documents in connection
with a FINRA investigation. FINRA requests that we dismiss Murphy’s application for review
because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before FINRA. For the reasons stated
herein, we remand this case to FINRA.

I.

Background

On December 17, 2015, BMO Harris Financial Advisors (“BMO”) terminated Murphy
for purportedly violating firm policy by using its name in a personal situation. After BMO filed
a Form U5 disclosing Murphy’s termination, FINRA commenced an inquiry to determine
whether violations of the federal securities laws or FINRA, NASD, NYSE, or MSRB rules had
occurred.
On February 26, 2016, FINRA requested that Murphy provide certain documents and
information bearing on his termination and other matters by March 11, 2016.1 FINRA served the
request on Murphy by both certified and first-class mail at his address of record in its Central
Registration Depository (“CRD”) system and a second address also noted in the system.2
On March 14, 2016, FINRA sent a second request after Murphy failed to respond.
FINRA again served its second request on Murphy by both certified and first-class mail at his
CRD address and the second address. Each of these eight mailings was returned to FINRA. The
United States Postal Service (“USPS”) marked the mailings to Murphy’s CRD address as “not
deliverable as addressed” and “unable to forward.” USPS also marked each of the mailings to
the second address as “unable to forward,” and the first-class mailings to that address contained a
handwritten notation stating “Return to Sender! Not at this address.” USPS records3 show that it
returned the certified mailings sent to Murphy’s CRD address to FINRA on March 30, 2016,4
and the certified mailings sent to the second address to FINRA on April 5, 2016.5 The mailings
sent by first-class mail were returned to FINRA around the same time as the certified mailings.

On April 18, 2016, FINRA sent Murphy a notice pursuant to FINRA Rule 9552 notifying
him that he would be suspended from association with any FINRA member on May 9, 2016, if
he did not provide the requested information and documents (the “Presuspension Notice”).6 The
basis for the notice was Murphy’s failure to provide the information and documents FINRA
requested he provide in its two previous requests. In the Presuspension Notice, FINRA
explained to Murphy that he could stay the suspension before it took effect by requesting a
hearing.7 FINRA also informed Murphy that if he were suspended, he could file a written
request for termination of his suspension on the grounds that he had fully complied with
FINRA’s requests. FINRA explained that if the suspension took effect and Murphy failed to
request that it be terminated by July 18, 2016, he would be barred automatically.8
FINRA sent the Presuspension Notice by certified and first-class mail to Murphy’s CRD
address. According to a declaration submitted with its motion to dismiss, FINRA searched the
LEXIS Public Records database before sending the notice; the database listed Murphy’s CRD
address as his current address.9 Neither the declaration nor any other portion of the record shows
what consideration, if any, FINRA gave to the returned mailings or why it sent the Presuspension
Notice to no address other than Murphy’s CRD address.10 FINRA’s mailings of the

See FINRA Rule 9552(a) (stating that if a “person associated with a member” fails to
provide information requested pursuant to FINRA rules then FINRA staff may provide written
notice to such person “specifying the nature of the failure and stating that the failure to take
corrective action within 21 days after service of the notice will result in suspension of
membership or of association of the person with any member”).

See FINRA Rule 9552(e) (stating that a “request for a hearing shall be made before the
effective date of the notice,” which is 21 days after service of the notice).

See FINRA Rule 9552(h) (“A member or person who is suspended under this Rule and
fails to request termination of the suspension within three months of issuance of the original
notice of suspension will automatically be expelled or barred.”). July 18, 2016, is three months
after the date of the April 18, 2016 Presuspension Notice.

FINRA requests that we admit the declaration under Rule of Practice 452. Rule 452
provides that a party may file a motion for leave to adduce additional evidence that shows that
the evidence is “material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such
evidence previously.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.452. We find that the declaration is material to our
consideration of the issue of service in this case and that FINRA acted quickly to supplement the
record once the issue of service was first raised in Murphy’s application for review.

Presuspension Notice were again returned to it as “not deliverable as addressed” and “unable to
forward.” USPS records show that it returned the certified mailing to FINRA on May 2, 2016.11
On May 9, 2016, FINRA sent Murphy a letter by certified and first-class mail to his CRD
address informing him that he had been suspended from association with any FINRA member in
any capacity due to his failure to comply with FINRA’s requests (the “Suspension Notice”).
FINRA again informed Murphy that he would be barred automatically if he did not request
termination of the suspension on the ground of full compliance by July 18, 2016. Before sending
the Suspension Notice, FINRA searched the LEXIS database which continued to list Murphy’s
CRD address as his current address. But that search also listed a former address for Murphy (the
“third address”) that was not previously listed. FINRA sent the Suspension Notice only to
Murphy’s CRD address, but not to the third address, and its mailings were again returned.
On July 18, 2016, FINRA sent Murphy a notice notifying him that he had been barred
automatically from association with any FINRA member in any capacity (the “Bar Notice”) and
stating that he could appeal the decision to the Commission within 30 days of his receipt of the
notice. Before sending the Bar Notice, FINRA again searched the LEXIS database, which now
listed the third address referenced above as Murphy’s residential address. FINRA sent the Bar
Notice to Murphy by certified and first-class mail at his CRD address and the third address.
Although the mailings to Murphy’s CRD address and the certified mailing to the third address
were returned to FINRA, the first-class mailing to the third address was not returned.
On August 17, 2016, Murphy filed a timely application for review of the bar order. In his
application, Murphy asserts that he asked BHO to update his CRD address in December 2015
before he was terminated and that BHO had told him it would process the change. In his
application for review, Murphy provided some of the information FINRA requested under Rule
8210 and asserted that he did not have various requested documents.

Analysis

FINRA requests that we dismiss Murphy’s application for review because he failed to
exhaust his administrative remedies before FINRA before appealing its action to us.12 As

In this regard, “we will not consider an application for review if that applicant failed to
exhaust FINRA’s procedures for contesting the sanction at issue.” Caryl Trewyn Lenahan,
Exchange Act Release No. 73146, 2014 WL 4656403, at *2 (Sept. 19, 2014) (quoting Ricky D.
Mullins, Exchange Act Release No. 71926, 2014 WL 1390384, at *3 (Apr. 10, 2014) and citing
other authority) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have explained that it is “clearly proper
to require that a statutory right to review be exercised in an orderly fashion, and to specify
procedural steps which must be observed as a condition to securing review.” MFS Sec. Corp.,

support for this argument, FINRA relies on two principal contentions. First, FINRA contends
that Murphy failed to follow its procedures by “[1] taking corrective action” by producing the
information and documents it asked him to provide, “[2] requesting a hearing in response to the
notice of suspension, or [3] filing for termination of the suspension.”13 Murphy does not assert
in his application for review that he did any of these things. Rather, the crux of his application is
that he did not receive FINRA’s requests for information or Presuspension or Suspension
notices.
Second, FINRA contends that it properly served the Presuspension Notice on Murphy.
Although FINRA does not directly address Murphy’s assertion that he relied on BHO to update
his CRD address, FINRA correctly notes that it is the individual’s responsibility to ensure that
his CRD address is current.14 FINRA argues that because it is entitled to rely on its records,15 it
properly served Murphy at his CRD address, and that it did so consistent with its rules.
FINRA Rule 9552(b) required FINRA to serve the Presuspension Notice on Murphy “in
accordance with Rule 9134.”16 Rule 9134(b)(1) provides that “Papers served on a natural person
may be served at the natural person’s residential address, as reflected in the Central Registration
Depository, if applicable.”17 FINRA asserts that it therefore properly served the Presuspension
Notice on Murphy at his CRD address and that it went above and beyond its obligations under
Rule 9134 by also searching the LEXIS database to determine Murphy’s current address.
Rule 9134(b)(1) also provides, however, that if there is “actual knowledge that the natural
person’s Central Registration Depository address is out of date, duplicate copies shall be served
on the natural person at the natural person’s last known residential address . . . .” That the
requests for information sent to Murphy’s CRD address were returned to FINRA suggests that
FINRA had actual knowledge that Murphy’s CRD address was out of date. But the record does
not contain any information as to what FINRA did to satisfy its obligation under Rule 9134(b)(1)
to send the Presuspension Notice to Murphy’s “last known residential address.” The record does
not indicate whether FINRA believed that the second address, also listed in the CRD, was

Murphy’s “last known residential address.” Nor does the record contain FINRA’s rationale for
sending the Presuspension Notice only to his CRD address and not to the second address despite
having sent the two requests for information to both addresses.
In addition, before it served the Suspension Notice, FINRA had knowledge of the third
address. But FINRA does not explain—and the record contains no indication—why it did not
serve the Suspension Notice on Murphy at the third address, a new address it discovered after
conducting a LEXIS Public Records search. FINRA did serve the Bar Notice at the third
address, once it was listed as a residential address, but it did not serve “duplicate copies” of any
of the prior mailings, including the two requests for information on which the suspension and bar
were predicated or the Presuspension Notice, on this newly discovered residential address.
Again FINRA does not explain—and the record is silent as to—why it did not do so, or whether
it believes that its rules require it to mail all previously returned mailings to a new address once it
becomes aware that such an address is a current residential address.
We “have previously remanded to [FINRA] proceedings brought under similar [FINRA]
provisions where, among other things, the record raised questions about whether [FINRA] was
aware that its information requests and notices were not reaching the respondent.”18 Because the
record does not contain sufficient evidence for us to determine if FINRA complied with its
service rules, we similarly remand this case to FINRA for further consideration of the basis for
its action and the appropriateness, under the circumstances, of barring Murphy in an expedited
proceeding.19 Should FINRA determine it is appropriate to bar Murphy using this expedited
process, it should explain (1) what it did to satisfy its obligation to send the Presuspension Notice
to Murphy’s “last known residential address,” whether it believed the second address listed in the
CRD was Murphy’s “last known residential address,” and its rationale for not sending the
Presuspension Notice to the second address; (2) why it was not required to mail the Suspension
Notice to the third address despite having knowledge of that address; and (3) whether it was

We have considered the arguments that Murphy advanced in his petition for review and
that FINRA advanced in its motion to dismiss for failing to exhaust administrative remedies.
Given the state of the record, we find that it would not significantly aid the decisional process to
order full briefing on Murphy’s appeal. We find that it would serve the interests of justice and
cause no prejudice to FINRA under the circumstances to dispense with further briefing. See
Rule of Practice 100(c), 17 C.F.R. § 201.100(c) (“The Commission, upon its determination that
to do so would serve the interests of justice and not result in prejudice to the parties to the
proceeding, may by order direct, in a particular proceeding, that an alternative procedure shall
apply or that compliance with an otherwise applicable rule is unnecessary.”).
