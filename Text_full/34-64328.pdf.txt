ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-12400

In the Matter of
PRUDENTIAL EQUITY GROUP, LLC,
formerly known as PRUDENTIAL
SECURITIES, INC.,

ORDER DIRECTING
DISBURSEMENT OF
DISTRIBUTION FUND

Respondent.

On December 4, 2009, the Commission published a notice of the Plan of Distribution
(“Plan”) proposed by the Division of Enforcement in connection with this proceeding (Exchange
Act Release No. 61117). No comments were received, and on February 4, 2010, the Plan was
approved (Exchange Act Release No. 61501).
The Plan of Distribution provides that a Distribution Fund consisting of $270,000,000 in
disgorgement, plus any accrued interest, be transferred to Deutsche Bank to be distributed by the
Plan Administrator to injured investors according to the methodology set forth in the Plan. The
Plan (Paragraph 67) provides that “[t]he proceeds of stale and voided checks shall be deposited
to the asset base of the Eligible Mutual Fund to which the distribution relates” (the “residual
distribution”).
The Plan provides that the Commission staff will arrange for transfer of the appropriate
amount of the Distribution Fund when a Payment File listing the payees with the identification
information required to make the distribution has been received and accepted. The Payment File
for the residual distribution in the amount of $27,427,576.14 has been received and accepted.
Because there are funds totaling $23,331,845.71 at Deutsche Bank from the prior distributions in
this matter, a total of $4,095,730.43 should be transferred to Deutsche Bank for the residual
distribution.

Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Commission staff shall transfer $4,095,730.43 of
the Distribution Fund to Deutsche Bank, and the Plan Administrator shall distribute the residual
distribution as provided for in the Plan of Distribution.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Elizabeth M. Murphy
Secretary
