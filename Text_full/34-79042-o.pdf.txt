UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
October 5, 2016

In the Matter of
Boreal Water Collection, Inc.

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of complete
and accurate information concerning the securities of Boreal Water Collection, Inc. (“Boreal”)
because of questions that have been raised about the accuracy and reliability of publicly available
information concerning Boreal’s financial condition, and specifically the reliability of Boreal’s
2012, 2013, and 2014 financial statements contained in Boreal’s Forms 10-K for the years-ended
2012, 2013, and 2014 respectively. Additionally, Boreal has not filed its Forms 10-Q for the
periods ended June 30, 2015, September 30, 2015, March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, and its Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Boreal is a Nevada corporation based in Kiamesha
Lake, New York. Its securities are quoted on OTC Link (previously “Pink Sheets”) operated by
OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the ticker symbol “BRWC.”
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors
require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed company.

THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on October 5, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT on October 18, 2016.
By the Commission.
