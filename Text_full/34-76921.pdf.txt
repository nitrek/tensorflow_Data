Claimant #1 provided a detailed analysis to the Commission showing

This information was provided to the Commission before
the enactment of the whistleblower award program and, therefore, could not serve as the basis
for an award.2

In

program as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010—
Claimant #1 provided additional analysis to the Commission. This additional analysis showed

The CRS preliminarily
determined that this additional analysis constituted original information, that Claimant #1
voluntarily provided it to the Commission, and that this information significantly contributed to
the successful enforcement of the Covered Action. See Section 21F(b)(1) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 21F-3(a) thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-3(a).

The CRS also preliminarily determined to recommend that Claimant #1’s award be set in

the amount of
of the monetary sanctions collected in the Covered Action,
which will equal payment of more than $700,000. In arriving at this recommendation, the CRS
considered the factors set forth in Rule 21F-6, 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-6, in relation to the facts and
circumstances of Claimant #1’s application.

pursuant to Rule 21F-10(f), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-10(f), the Preliminary Determination became
the Proposed Final Determination of the CRS.
Upon due consideration under Rules 21F-10(f) and (h), 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.21F-10(f)
and (h), and for the reasons set forth in the Preliminary Determination, it is hereby ORDERED
Redacted
that Claimant #1 shall receive
of the monetary sanctions collected in the
Covered Action.
III.

Claimant #4’s Claim Is Denied
A. Preliminary Determination and Claimant #4’s Response

On June 5, 2015, the CRS also preliminarily determined to deny Claimant #4’s award
application because Claimant #4 did not provide any information that led to the successful
enforcement of the Covered Action. See Section 21F(b)(1) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 21F3(a) thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-3(a).
On October 3, 2015, Claimant #4 submitted a written response contesting the Preliminary
Determination (hereinafter, “Response”). In the Response, Claimant #4 failed to identify any
specific tip or complaint
made to the Commission in connection with the Covered Action.
Claimant #4 also attached various documents to the Response, but none of these materials had
any apparent relevance to the question of whether Claimant #4 had provided information to the
Redacted

Commission that led to the successful enforcement of the Covered Action.3
B. Analysis
To qualify for an award under Section 21F of the Exchange Act, a whistleblower must
voluntarily provide the Commission with original information that leads to the successful
enforcement of a covered judicial or administrative action or related action. 15 U.S.C. § 78u6(b)(1). As relevant here, original information “leads to” a successful enforcement action if
either: (i) the original information caused the staff to open an investigation, reopen an
investigation, or inquire into different conduct as part of a current investigation, and the
3

Redacted

These materials included:

3

Commission brought a successful action based in whole or in part on conduct that was the
subject of the original information; or (ii) the conduct was already under examination or
investigation, and the original information significantly contributed to the success of the action.
Rule 21F-4(c)(1)-(2), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-4(c)(1)-(2).
We find that none of the information Claimant #4 submitted led to the successful
enforcement of the Covered Action. First, none of the tips that Claimant #4 has submitted to the
Commission was provided to investigative staff for further inquiry or for use in connection with
any investigation; instead, each of Claimant #4’s tips was designated for “no further action.”
Moreover, at no point prior to the settlement of the Covered Action did the staff members
responsible for the Covered Action have any contact with, or receive any information from,
Claimant #4. Second, based on our own assessment of the information that Claimant #4
submitted, we cannot see how this information could have led to the successful enforcement of
the Covered Action given the absence of relevant factual connections between the two.
Because the record demonstrates that Claimant #4’s information did not lead to the
successful enforcement of the Covered Action and
has not shown otherwise in
request
for reconsideration of the Preliminary Determination, we deny Claimant #4’s application for an
Redacted

In
Response, Claimant #4 contends that the OWB unlawfully withheld from
the
materials underlying the CRS’s Preliminary Determination. We disagree. Under Exchange Act
Rule 21F -12(b), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-12(b), individuals requesting Preliminary Determination
materials may be required by staff in the OWB to sign a confidentiality agreement as a
prerequisite to receiving a copy of the record. In accordance with this Commission rule, it is
standard practice of OWB staff to require all claimants seeking copies of the record to sign a
confidentiality agreement to prevent the disclosure of potentially sensitive information. On
July 8 and again on July 17, OWB staff sent Claimant #4 a standard confidentiality agreement.
OWB staff also advised Claimant #4 that
would not be provided with the record materials if
declined to sign the confidentiality agreement. After receiving an extension of time to
consider the draft agreement, Claimant #4 ultimately refused to sign it. As a result,
was not
provided with the record in accordance with Rule 21F-12(b).
