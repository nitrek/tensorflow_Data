ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(Exchange Act) on April 6, 2016. The OIP alleges that each Respondent is a corporation with a
class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act
and has repeatedly failed to file required periodic reports. The Division of Enforcement is
seeking to revoke the registrations of Respondents’ securities.
The OIP provides that each Respondent’s Answer is due within ten days of service of the
OIP on it. See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). Each Respondent was served with the OIP by
April 12, 2016, by USPS Express Mail delivery or attempted delivery at “the most recent address
shown on [its] most recent filing with the Commission.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii).
Expleo Solutions, Inc., has answered, noting its Form 15 Certification and Notice of
Termination of Registration, which was filed on April 12, 2016, and will become effective 90
days after that date. The Division of Enforcement may wish to consider asking the Commission
to dismiss the proceeding against Expleo Solutions.
To date, Numida, Inc., has failed to file an Answer within the time provided.
Accordingly, Numida, Inc., IS ORDERED TO SHOW CAUSE, by May 9, 2016, why it should
not be deemed to be in default and the registration of its securities revoked. See OIP at 3; 17
C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f).
