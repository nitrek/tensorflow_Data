In the Matter of
GEORGE CHARLES CODY PRICE

EXTENSION ORDER

On June 30, 2016, the Commission received a petition for review of an initial decision of
an administrative law judge by George Charles Cody Price (“Respondent”). On July 21, 2016,
the Commission issued an Order Granting Petition for Review and Scheduling Briefs, in which the
Commission ordered, pursuant to Rule of Practice 450(a), that a brief in support of the petition for
review be filed by August 22, 2016, a brief in opposition be filed by September 21, 2016, and any
reply brief be filed by October 5, 2016. On August 23, 2016, Respondent filed a motion for a
30-day extension of the Commission’s briefing schedule. On August 24, 2016, the Division of
Enforcement (the “Division”) filed an Opposition to Respondent’s Motion for Extension of Time.1
The briefing schedule noted that pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 161,2
extensions of time are disfavored. It appears appropriate, however, to grant a limited extension as
set forth below.

1

The Division attached its opposition brief to a motion for leave to submit an opposition
brief. We note that briefs in opposition to motions are generally authorized under Rule of Practice
154(b). 17 C.F.R. § 201.154(b). But see 17 C.F.R. § 201.470(b). Nevertheless, we construe the
Division’s motion as a request for leave to submit an additional brief, and it is hereby granted.

17 C.F.R. § 201.161.

Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the time for Respondent to file his brief in support of the
petition for review shall be extended to September 7, 2016. A brief in opposition shall be filed by
October 7, 2016, and any reply brief shall be filed by October 21, 2016.
For the Commission, by its Secretary and by the Office of the General Counsel, pursuant to
delegated authority.3
