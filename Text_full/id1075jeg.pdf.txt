In the Matter of
DANIEL CHRISTIAN STANLEY POWELL

INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
November 1, 2016

APPEARANCE:

David J. Van Havermaat for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

James E. Grimes, Administrative Law Judge
Summary

I grant the Division of Enforcement’s motion for sanctions. Respondent Daniel Christian
Stanley Powell is permanently barred from associating with any broker, dealer, investment
adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized
statistical rating organization, and from participating in the issuance of a penny stock.
Procedural Background
The Commission initiated this proceeding in April 2016 by issuing an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) under Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. OIP at 1; see 15
U.S.C. § 78o(b). This proceeding is a follow-on proceeding based on the permanent injunction
entered in SEC v. Christian Stanley, Inc., No. 11-cv-7147 (C.D. Cal., final judgment issued Feb.
24, 2016).
The Division originally alleged in the OIP that from May to September 2009, Powell was
a registered representative associated with a broker-dealer registered with the Commission. OIP
at 1. It also alleged that in February 2016, the United States District Court for the Central
District of California permanently enjoined Powell from committing future violations of Sections
5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5
thereunder. Id. at 2. The Division concluded its allegations by describing what it alleged in its
injunctive complaint. Id.
I held a telephonic prehearing conference on May 26, 2016, which was attended by
counsel for the Division and by Powell, who was unrepresented. See Daniel Christian Stanley
Powell, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3880, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1908, at *1 (ALJ May 27,

2016). During the conference, I granted Powell until June 21, 2016, to file an answer to the OIP
and I set a schedule for filing motions for summary disposition or for sanctions. Id.; see Tr. 21,
23. Division counsel also alerted Powell that although the OIP alleges that Powell was
associated with a broker-dealer from May to September 2009, based on conversations with
Powell’s former employer, “[i]t appears that the correct date[s] [were] March 2010 through
September 2010.” Tr. 19-20. In light of counsel’s statement and certain statutory amendments
enacted in July 2010, I asked whether the Division might need to move to amend the OIP, but
left it to counsel to decide how he wished to proceed.1 Tr. 27-28.
Powell did not answer the OIP. Daniel Christian Stanley Powell, Admin. Proc. Rulings
Release No. 3954, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2290, at *1 (ALJ June 29, 2016). As a result, I ordered him
to show cause why this proceeding should not be determined against him. Id. at *1-2. Powell
has not responded to the order to show cause.
After I ordered Powell to show cause, the Division filed a motion for summary
disposition or, in the alternative, for sanctions. The Division’s motion is supported by sixteen
exhibits, designated as exhibits 1 through 16. These exhibits include the Commission’s
injunctive complaint in SEC v. Christian Stanley, Inc. (Ex. 1), the first superseding indictment in
United States v. Powell, No. 13-cr-98 (C.D. Cal.) (Ex. 2), the verdict form from United States v.
Powell (Ex. 3), the judgment in United States v. Powell (Ex. 4), the district court’s ruling on the
Commission’s injunctive complaint in SEC v. Christian Stanley, Inc. (Ex. 5), and the judgment
on that complaint (Ex. 6).
In August 2016, the Division moved to amend the OIP to allege that Powell was
associated with a registered broker-dealer from March 2010 to September 2010, rather than from
May to September 2009. Powell did not respond to the Division’s motion, which I granted on
August 26, 2016. Daniel Christian Stanley Powell, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4095,
2016 SEC LEXIS 3041.
Under Rule of Practice 323, 17 C.F.R. § 201.323, I take official notice of the dockets in
Powell’s civil and criminal cases and the filings reflected therein.

1

Section 15(b)(6)(A) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to impose collateral
bars—bars to participating in the securities industry in capacities in addition to the capacity in
which an individual functioned at the time of his or her misconduct at issue. 15 U.S.C.
§ 78o(b)(6)(A). Effective July 22, 2010, Section 925(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act added to this list and authorized the Commission to impose bars to
associating with a municipal advisor or a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
See Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376. The District of Columbia Circuit later held on
retroactivity grounds that the Commission cannot rely on conduct predating Dodd-Frank to bar a
respondent from associating with municipal advisors or rating organizations. See Koch v. SEC,
793 F.3d 147, 157-58 (D.C. Cir. 2015).

Findings of Fact
The findings and conclusions in this initial decision are based on the record and on facts
officially noticed under Rule of Practice 323, 17 C.F.R. § 201.323. Because Powell did not file
an answer to the OIP or respond to the Division’s dispositive motion, he is in default.2 See 17
C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). As a result, I have accepted as true the factual allegations in
the OIP. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a). In making the findings below, I have applied
preponderance of the evidence as the standard of proof.3
Powell was associated with a broker-dealer from March to September 2010. OIP ¶ 1;
Daniel Christian Stanley Powell, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3041; Ex. 10. He was the founder of
Christian Stanley, Inc. Ex. 7 at 17. From 2006 through at least August 2011, Powell served as
Christian Stanley’s chairman, CEO, and president. Ex. 7 at 16-17, 42; Ex. 8 at 41. In those
capacities, he was “responsible for managing” Christian Stanley’s “day-to-day operations.” Ex.
7 at 42. In approximately 2009, Powell founded Daniel Christian Stanley Powell Realty
Holdings (Holdings), which he described as a company he “us[ed] for asset acquisitions.” Ex. 8
at 50-51. During investigative testimony, Powell said that Holdings had acquired “a gold reserve
property” in Nevada and “a coal property” in Kentucky. Id. at 51. The gold mine interest was “a
stock transaction” in which $15,000 in investor funds were used. Id. at 260. The coal mine
acquisition was also a stock transaction. Id.
Powell induced investment by offering investors “debentures” purporting to pay fixed
interest of between ten to fifteen percent over a set term. Ex. 8 at 104; see id. at 158-59, 174;
Exs. 14-15. Investors were told that the debentures were secured by reverse life insurance
policies, coal mines, or coal mine leases. Ex. 8 at 259-60; Ex. 12 at 2; Ex. 13 at 1; Ex. 14 at 4;
Ex. 15 at 4. Powell financed the interest payments through a “debt pool” that he “structured.”
Ex. 8 at 104. The debt pool was comprised of funds invested in exchange for the debentures. Id.
at 105. Powell also used the debt pool to pay for Christian Stanley’s operations. Id. Powell was
thus running a Ponzi scheme. When asked, Powell was unable to say whether any investor knew
or was told that interest payments were paid from the debt pool. Id. at 115.
Powell used independent contractors or consultants to solicit investments. Ex. 8 at
115-16, 121-22, 124. These contractors were paid a retainer or consulting fees. Id. at 116-18.
When asked, Powell could not precisely say how these fees were calculated, but said they ranged

Powell may move to set aside the default in this case. Rule 155(b) permits the
Commission, at any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and
on such conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a
default shall be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or
defend, and specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.

administrative proceedings”).

between two and five percent of the amount invested. Id. at 116-22. In total, Powell paid the
contractors $785,000 from investor funds. Ex. 11:1 at 4.4
Powell eventually took in over $5 million in investor funds. Ex. 11:1 at 3; Ex. 11:5 at 1.
After subtracting principal and interest payments made to investors, he was left with over $4.4
million. Ex. 11:1 at 3; see Ex. 4 at 1 (ordering Powell to pay that amount in restitution). Of that
amount, Powell spent approximately $90,000 on the purported purpose of the debentures—the
purchase of coal leases and gold mine interests. Ex. 11:1 at 4. Between 2009 and August 2011,
Powell spent most of his investors’ funds on things that had nothing to do with what he told
investors he would use the funds for. In addition to paying his consultants $785,000, he spent
$470,000 on purported salaries, $212,000 on luxury cars, over $160,000 on hotels, limousines,
nightclubs, and restaurants, $371,000 on promotional activity, $482,000 on renovations to one of
his companies’ facilities, $290,000 on retail purchases via a check card, $237,000 on cash
withdrawals, $27,750 on his father and brother, and nearly $107,000 on rent for the residences of
a woman whom Powell said was like a mother to him and another woman whose connection to
Powell or his firms was not known. Id. at 4-5. By late July 2011, his companies’ bank accounts
held just over $400,000. Id. at 6; Ex. 11:5 at 2. Within weeks, after Powell gave investigative
testimony, the amount in the accounts dropped less than $30,000. Ex. 11:1 at 6.
Based on the foregoing activity, the Commission filed an injunctive complaint against
Powell in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Ex. 1. Powell
was also later indicted on five counts of mail fraud, five counts of wire fraud, and three counts
obstruction of justice. Ex. 2 at 5-12; see 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 (mail fraud), 1343 (wire fraud),
1512(c)(2) (obstruction). A jury convicted Powell on all criminal charges in November 2014.
Ex. 3. In June 2015, the district court sentenced Powell to 121 months’ imprisonment and
ordered him to pay his victims over $4.4 million in restitution.5 Ex. 4 at 1-2.
In February 2016, the district court granted summary judgment on the Commission’s
injunctive complaint and permanently enjoined Powell from violating Securities Act Sections 5
and 17(a), Exchange Act Section 10(b), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5. Ex. 6. Noting that
Powell was convicted based on the same conduct that was alleged in the Commission’s
injunctive complaint, the court held that principles of collateral estoppel entitled the Commission
to judgment on the Section 17(a), Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 claims. Ex. 5 at 3-4. The court
also held that Powell’s admissions, the Commission’s evidence, and the jury’s verdict in
Powell’s criminal case supported granting summary judgment on the Section 5 claim. Id. at 4-5.
The court concluded by stating that: (1) “Powell’s criminal trial” “established” “that he
knowingly perpetrated [a] fraud, which lasted several years”; (2) “Powell’s conviction for
obstruction of justice suggests that he has not recognized the wrongful nature of his actions”; and
4

Exhibit 11 consists of five separate exhibits, which I have identified by using a colon
followed by a numerical sub-designation.

Neither Powell’s indictment nor his conviction were alleged in the OIP. Nonetheless,
matters not alleged in the OIP may be considered in relation to sanctions. See Nature’s Sunshine
Prod., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 WL 137145, at *6 n.27 (Jan. 21, 2009).

(3) “Powell’s occupation, which involved the management and operation of a Ponzi-like scheme,
also suggests a risk of future violations.” Id. at 5.
Conclusions of Law
Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act gives the Commission authority to impose a
collateral bar6 and penny stock bar against Powell if, as is relevant here, (1) he was associated
with or seeking to become associated with a broker or dealer at the time of the misconduct at
issue; (2) he was enjoined “from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice . . . in
connection with the purchase or sale of any security”; and (3) imposing a bar is in the public
interest. 15 U.S.C. § 78o(b)(4)(C), (6)(A)(iii).
The above-factors are met in this case. During part of the time he carried out his scheme,
Powell was a registered representative associated with a registered broker-dealer. OIP at 1. And
the district court enjoined Powell based on conduct that “involved the offer or sale and purchase
or sale” of securities. Ex. 5 at 4. Finally, imposing a bar is also in the public interest.
In this latter regard, I must consider the factors described in Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d
1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981), when deciding whether
the public interest supports imposing a bar. See Thomas C. Gonnella, Advisers Act Release No.
4476, 2016 WL 4233837, at *12 (Aug. 10, 2016). The public interest factors include:
the egregiousness of the respondent’s actions; the isolated or
recurrent nature of the infraction; the degree of scienter involved;
the sincerity of the respondent’s assurances against future
violations; the respondent’s recognition of the wrongful nature of
his conduct; and the likelihood that the respondent’s occupation
will present opportunities for future violations.
Id. The Commission also considers the deterrent effect of administrative sanctions. David R.
Wulf, Exchange Act Release No. 77411, 2016 WL 1085661, at *4 (Mar. 21, 2016). The public
interest inquiry is “flexible” and “no one factor is dispositive.” Conrad P. Seghers, Advisers Act
Release No. 2656, 2007 WL 2790633, at *4 (Sept. 26, 2007), pet. denied, 548 F.3d 129 (D.C.
Cir. 2008).
Before imposing a collateral bar, an administrative law judge must determine, based on
the evidence presented, “whether such a remedy is necessary or appropriate to protect investors
and markets.” Ross Mandell, Exchange Act Release No. 71668, 2014 WL 907416, at *2 (Mar.
7, 2014), vacated in part on other grounds, Exchange Act Release No. 77935, 2016 WL
3030883 (May 26, 2016). I must therefore “‘review [Powell’s] case on its own facts’ to make
6

A collateral bar, also referred to as an industry bar, is a bar that prevents an individual
from participating in the securities industry in capacities in addition to those in which the person
was participating at the time of his or her misconduct. See Toby G. Scammell, Advisers Act
Release No. 3961, 2014 WL 5493265, at *1 & n.1 (Oct. 29, 2014); see also 15 U.S.C.
§ 78o(b)(6)(A) (listing the capacities in which a respondent can be barred).

findings regarding [his] fitness to participate in the industry in the barred capacities.” Id.
(quoting McCarthy v. SEC, 406 F.3d 179, 188 (2d Cir. 2005)). A decision to impose a collateral
bar “should be grounded in specific ‘findings regarding the protective interests to be served’ by
barring the respondent and the ‘risk of future misconduct.’”7
The evidence shows that the public interest supports imposing a full collateral bar.
Powell perpetrated a fraud “which lasted several years.” Ex. 5 at 5. He lied to investors at every
turn. He told investors that the debentures he sold them involved very little risk and were
secured by reverse life insurance policies, coal mines, or coal mine leases. Ex. 8 at 259-60; Ex.
12 at 2; Ex. 13 at 1; Ex. 14 at 4; Ex. 15 at 4. None of these assertions were true. Powell issued
investors what purported to be “secured corporate debenture indentures,” documents which
appeared to be genuine and thus gave an air of legitimacy to the fraud Powell perpetrated. See
Exs. 14, 15. In reality, these documents merely evidenced the breadth of Powell’s lies.
Not counting the money he returned to them, Powell caused his victims significant
harm—over $4.4 million in losses. Ex. 11:1 at 3. Of the millions he received from his victims,
Powell used only $90,000 on the purported purpose of the debentures. Id. at 4. The balance was
spent seemingly on whatever Powell felt like spending it on: salaries; luxury cars; hotels,
limousines, nightclubs, and restaurants; retail purchases; cash withdrawals; payments to or for
the benefit of his family and friends; and promotional activity and payments to soliciting
consultants, i.e., efforts to attract more victims. Id. at 4-5.
The Commission’s interest in protecting the investing public and deterring similar
misconduct would be served by barring Powell from the securities industry. It is axiomatic that a
respondent who chooses to operate a Ponzi scheme is not someone who should be permitted to
remain in the securities industry.
Lying to potential investors in order to obtain their money to support one’s Ponzi scheme
and lifestyle easily qualifies as egregious. By its nature, a Ponzi scheme involves recurrent
fraud; attracting ever more investors is necessary in order to keep the scheme operating.
Similarly, Powell did not lure in his victims through inadvertence. Rather, he acted with a high
degree of scienter, lying to them about the risk of investing and what he intended to do with their
funds. He also lied every time he gave an investor a seemingly legitimate debenture certificate
because he knew the debentures were bogus. The egregiousness of Powell’s conduct is
underscored by the fact that the district court sentenced him to over ten years in prison.
Powell has made no assurances that his misconduct will not recur nor shown that he
recognizes the wrongful nature of his conduct. To the contrary, the district court explained that
“Powell’s conviction for obstruction of justice suggests that he has not recognized the wrongful
nature of his actions.” Ex. 5 at 5. Finally, the fact and nature of Powell’s misconduct “raises an

future risk the respondent poses to investors.”), vacated in part on other grounds, Advisers Act

inference that” he will repeat it.8 Indeed, the district court concluded that “Powell’s occupation,
which involved the management and operation of a Ponzi-like scheme, also suggests a risk of
future violations.” Ex. 5 at 5.
In light of the factors discussed above, I find that it is in the public interest to impose a
full collateral bar against Powell.
