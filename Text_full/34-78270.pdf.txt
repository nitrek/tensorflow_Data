In the Matter of

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Toni

been by name . . . permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or
her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting the
violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder.

which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to
the Commission’s jurisdiction over her and the subject matter of these proceedings, and the findings
contained in Section III.2 below, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order
Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of
Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:
1.
Chen, age 47, was a certified public accountant licensed to practice in the State of
California from 1997 through approximately October 2014.
2.
On June 29, 2016, a judgment was entered by consent against Chen, permanently
enjoining her from future violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933
(“Securities Act”), Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, in the

The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that from approximately

complaint also alleged that Chen sold unregistered securities and acted as an unregistered brokerdealer.
