SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
September 16, 2016

In the Matter of
All Energy Corp., and
As Seen On TV, Inc.
ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING
File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of All Energy Corp. (CIK No.
1103384), a delinquent Delaware corporation with its principal place of business listed as
Johnston, Iowa, with stock quoted on OTC Link (previously, “Pink Sheets”) operated by
OTC Markets Group, Inc. (“OTC Link”) under the ticker symbol AFSE, because it has
not filed any periodic reports since the period ended September 30, 2014. On December
16, 2014, All Energy Corp. was sent a delinquency letter by the Division of Corporation
Finance requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations, and All Energy Corp.
received the delinquency letter on December 22, 2014, but failed to cure its
delinquencies.
It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of As Seen On TV, Inc. (CIK
No. 1432967), a Florida corporation with its principal place of business listed as Austin,

Texas, with stock quoted on OTC Link under the ticker symbol ASTV, because it has not
filed any periodic reports since the period ended December 31, 2014. On December 9,
2015, As Seen On TV, Inc. was sent a delinquency letter by the Division of Corporation
Finance requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations, and As Seen On TV,
Inc. received the delinquency letter on December 12, 2015, but failed to cure its
delinquencies.
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of
investors require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed company.
Therefore, it is ordered, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on September 16, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT on
September 29, 2016.
By the Commission.
