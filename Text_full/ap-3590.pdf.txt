ORDER

On January 26, 2016, Respondents submitted their witness list consisting of eight
witnesses that they intend to call during the upcoming hearing in this matter. According to the
revised procedural schedule, subpoenas for such witnesses were due by February 1, 2016.
Steven J. Muehler, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3433, 2015 SEC LEXIS 5267 (ALJ Dec.
23, 2015). To date, Respondents have not requested the issuance of any subpoenas for
witnesses.
One of the witnesses on Respondents’ witness list, Mr. Weslie Watt Johnson, also
appears on the Division of Enforcement’s witness list, and a subpoena requested by the Division
for Mr. Johnson’s appearance has already been issued. Mr. Johnson and five other of
Respondents’ listed witnesses share an employer, ASMX Capital, and four of those share a work
address in Marina Del Rey, California.
Although the deadline for requesting witness subpoenas has passed, I will allow
Respondents until February 16, 2016, to submit subpoena requests for their witnesses to ensure
availability and to provide the witnesses with sufficient notice prior to the hearing. 1 To the
extent the witnesses are represented by counsel, as it appears Mr. Johnson is according to the
1

As I noted during the January 4 prehearing conference, a witness subpoena may be
accompanied by a request for that witness to testify telephonically if in-person attendance would
be difficult. Tr. 45. I also indicated that Respondents should not rely solely on the Division’s
subpoena of a witness to secure that witness’s attendance at the hearing because the Division
could elect not to call that witness. Tr. 47-48.

Division’s witness list, the subpoena should be directed to the witness’s counsel after my office
returns a signed version to Respondents.
In regards to the last witness on Respondents’ list, Ms. Earth Baynard, an analyst at
FINRA, I encourage the parties to stipulate to this witness’s expected testimony. If stipulation is
impossible, Respondents should arrange to have this witness testify by phone.
