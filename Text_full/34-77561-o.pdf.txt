UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
April 8, 2016
In the Matter of

Royale Globe Holding Inc.

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of current and
accurate information concerning the securities of Royale Globe Holding Inc. because of
questions regarding the accuracy of publicly available information about the company’s
operations and securities ownership, including details about its affiliation with Maxim Capital
Limited, a purported investment company operating under the name Maxim Trader. Royale
Globe Holding Inc. is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed
any periodic reports since it filed its Form 10-Q for the period ended July 31, 2015. Royale
Globe Holding Inc. (CIK No. 0001383145), is a Nevada corporation with its principal place of
business listed as Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia with stock quoted on OTC Link (previously, “Pink
Sheets”) operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the ticker symbol ROGP.
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors
require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed company.
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT, April 8, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT, on April 21, 2016.
By the Commission.
