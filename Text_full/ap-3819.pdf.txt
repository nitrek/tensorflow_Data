In the Matter of

ORDER GRANTING EXTENSION OF
BRIEFING DATE

MARK A. LOPEZ

This proceeding began with an order instituting proceedings (OIP) on February 24, 2016.
Respondent received the OIP, and participated in a prehearing conference on March 21, 2016,
but has not filed an answer, as required. See Mark A. Lopez, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No.
3726, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1060 (ALJ Mar. 22, 2016). On April 25, 2016, I ordered Respondent to
show cause by May 5, 2016, why this proceeding should not be determined against him due to
his failure to file an answer or otherwise defend this proceeding, and I ordered the Division of
Enforcement to file an appropriate dispositive motion by May 9, 2016. Mark A. Lopez, Admin.
Proc. Ruling No. 3806, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1512.
On May 2, 2016, the Division filed a motion to extend the due date for its dispositive
motion from May 9 to May 20, 2016, because the type of motion it files will depend on whether
Respondent files an answer or responds to the order to show cause by May 5, and the Division
faces logistical problems in assembling the motion and exhibits by May 9.
Ruling
I will not wait for opposition to the motion because time is short and Respondent will not
be disadvantaged by my ruling. For good cause shown, I GRANT the motion because the
request has a reasonable basis and the extension is for a brief period of time. The due date for
the Divisionâ€™s dispositive motion is extended to May 20, 2016.
