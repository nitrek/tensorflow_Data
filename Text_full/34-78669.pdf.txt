Christopher A. Parris (“Parris”) appeals from a FINRA order barring him from
association with any FINRA member. FINRA suspended Parris for failing to produce all
documents responsive to requests for information and informed Parris that he would be barred
unless he requested that his suspension be terminated within three months. Parris made a timely
request that FINRA Enforcement terminate his suspension, which it denied. On the same day,
FINRA barred him pursuant to Rule 9552(h), which provides that a person who “fails to request
termination of [a] suspension within three months of issuance of the original notice of suspension
will automatically be expelled or barred” (emphasis added). In barring Parris, FINRA did not
mention Parris’s request to terminate his suspension, and did not explain how FINRA had
applied Rule 9552(h) to bar Parris notwithstanding his request.

2
We conclude that the “specific grounds” on which FINRA barred Parris have no basis in
the record.1 FINRA imposed the bar based on a default, i.e., a failure to request a termination of
a suspension, although Parris did make such a request. FINRA’s letter barring Parris did not
acknowledge Parris’s request to terminate his suspension or discuss how Rule 9552 operates
when such a request has been filed. We accordingly set aside the bar.2 Parris did not appeal his
suspension, and that suspension remains in effect.
I.

Regulatory background

Because it lacks subpoena power, FINRA relies on its Rule 8210 “to police the activities
of its members and associated persons.”3 FINRA may, “[f]or the purpose of an investigation” or
other authorized proceeding, “require a member, person associated with a member, or any other
person subject to FINRA’s jurisdiction to provide information orally, in writing, or
electronically” or to testify.4 “A failure to comply with Rule 8210 is a serious violation because
it subverts [FINRA’s] ability to execute its regulatory responsibilities.”5
FINRA rules provide two avenues to enforce compliance with its requests for
information. First, FINRA can file a disciplinary complaint alleging a violation of Rule 8210.6
In that case, the person alleged to have violated Rule 8210 may defend those allegations under
the procedures established by FINRA’s disciplinary rules.
Second, FINRA Rule 9552 “provide[s] a procedural mechanism for FINRA to address”
violations of Rule 8210 “more expeditiously than would be possible using the FINRA
disciplinary process.”7 “If a member, person associated with a member or person subject to
FINRA’s jurisdiction fails to provide any information . . . or testimony requested . . . , FINRA
staff may provide written notice to such member or person specifying the nature of the failure

and stating that the failure to take corrective action within 21 days after service of the notice will
result in suspension of membership or of association of the person with any member.”8
A recipient of a Rule 9552 notice generally may stay his suspension by filing a request
for a hearing that “set[s] forth with specificity any and all defenses to the FINRA action.”9
Subject to the expedited hearing procedures provided in Rule 9559, a FINRA “Hearing Officer
or, if applicable, Hearing Panel, may approve, modify or withdraw any and all sanctions or
limitations imposed by the notice, and may impose any other fitting sanction.”10
Under Rule 9552(e), “[a] request for a hearing shall be made before the effective date of
the notice” (i.e., the date the suspension becomes effective).11 Where a person does not file a
request for a hearing before the effective date, the person “may file a written request for
termination of the suspension on the ground of full compliance with the notice,” which generally
must be filed with “the head of the FINRA department or office that issued the notice” who
“may grant relief for good cause shown.”12 Other than by settlement,13 this is the only means by
which a suspended person may request that a suspension be vacated.
Rule 9552 also contains a “Default” procedure that applies when a person fails to timely
pursue the options discussed above: “A member or person who is suspended under [Rule 9552]
and fails to request termination of the suspension within three months of issuance of the original
notice of suspension will automatically be expelled or barred.”14
II.

Factual background

This matter arises out of FINRA’s investigation of First American Securities (“FAS”), a
FINRA member firm. Parris is a 50% owner of FAS’s parent entity. In connection with its
investigation, FINRA took on-the-record testimony from Parris on September 10 and 11, 2015.
Although he provided testimony, Parris asserted that he was not subject to FINRA’s jurisdiction
and that he had appeared voluntarily, rather than pursuant to FINRA’s request under Rule 8210.

4
On September 15, 2015, FINRA sent Parris a letter memorializing requests for
documents and information that it made during his testimony. Pursuant to Rule 8210, FINRA
requested that Parris provide the documents and information no later than September 22, 2015.
In response, Parris’s counsel reiterated his objection to FINRA’s jurisdiction and stated that “we
will provide as many or as few responsive documents as we deem appropriate,” and “whatever
production we make may or may not be in accordance with your stated deadline.”
On September 23, 2015, FINRA sent Parris a letter stating that it had not received the
requested information and that, as a result, Parris was “in violation of FINRA Rule 8210.”
FINRA informed Parris that if he did not produce the requested information by September 30,
2015, “he may be subject to the institution of a non-summary or formal disciplinary proceeding
leading to sanctions, including a bar from the securities industry.” On October 1, 2015, FINRA
sent Parris another letter stating that “none of the information requested in [its] initial letter dated
September 15, 2015, or [its] second letter dated September 23, 2015, have been received.” Parris
subsequently provided some requested documents to FINRA.
In a letter dated October 16, 2015, FINRA informed Parris that, because he had failed to
provide information requested under Rule 8210, he would be suspended from association with
any FINRA member on November 9, 2015. The letter stated that if Parris took “corrective action
by complying with the requests before the Suspension Date, the suspension will not take effect,”
but he “may still be subject to a disciplinary action.”
FINRA informed Parris that “[u]nder FINRA Rule 9552(e), you may request a hearing in
response to this Notice” before November 9, 2015, which would stay the effective date of any
suspension. FINRA also told Parris that “[u]nder FINRA Rule 9552(f), if you are suspended,
you may file a written Request for Termination of the Suspension on the ground of full
compliance with this Notice.” And under the heading “Default,” FINRA stated that “[i]f you fail
to request termination of the suspension within three (3) months of the date of this Notice of
Suspension, i.e., by January 19, 2016, you will automatically be barred from associating with any
FINRA member in any capacity. See FINRA Rule 9552(h).”
Parris subsequently reiterated his jurisdictional objection and produced some, but not all,
documents in response to FINRA’s requests. He did not request a hearing.
On November 9, 2015, FINRA sent Parris a letter notifying him that, effective that same
date, he had been suspended from association with any FINRA member in any capacity. The
notice reminded Parris that he could request termination of his suspension on the ground of full
compliance and warned him that “[i]f you fail to request termination of the suspension within
three (3) months of the date of the original Notice of Suspension, you will automatically be
barred on January 19, 2016 from associating with any FINRA member in any capacity.”15 Parris
subsequently produced additional documents. On January 6, 2016, FINRA sent Parris another
letter identifying documents that FINRA believed he still had not produced.

15

January 16, 2016—exactly three months after the date of the original suspension notice—
was a Saturday, and the following Monday, January 18, 2016, was a holiday.

5
On January 19, 2016, Parris produced additional documents and responded to FINRA’s
January 6 letter. Parris objected to producing certain responsive documents on the grounds that
they were not relevant to the investigation or that Parris was not subject to FINRA’s jurisdiction.
He also explained his basis for contending that other requests were satisfied. On the same day,
Parris sent a separate letter to the head of FINRA Enforcement that, pursuant to Rule 9552(f),
“request[ed] that the suspension imposed upon him on November 9, 2015 be terminated on the
grounds that he has fully complied with FINRA’s 8210 requests.”
On January 21, 2016, FINRA Enforcement informed Parris that it had denied his request
to terminate his suspension because it was “not aware of any facts that would constitute good
cause to terminate the suspension.” The letter further stated that Parris “has not responded to at
least two request items” and that, “[w]ith respect to the other items, [FINRA] staff is working to
determine whether [his] last minute response dated January 19, 2016, is sufficient to satisfy those
requests.”
Also on January 21, 2016, in a separate letter FINRA notified Parris that, pursuant to
FINRA Rule 9552(h) and “in accordance with FINRA’s Notice of Suspension letter dated
October 16, 2015, and the Suspension from Association letter dated November 9, 2015, you were
barred from associating with any FINRA member in any capacity on January 19, 2016.” The
October 16 and November 9 letters warned Parris that if he failed to request termination of his
suspension by January 19, 2016, he would be automatically barred. The January 21, 2016 letter
did not mention Parris’ January 19 letter seeking termination of the suspension, FINRA
Enforcement’s separate January 21 letter denying Parris’s request to terminate his suspension, or
provide any other basis, besides the October 16 and November 9 letters, for FINRA’s decision to
bar Parris.
III.

Analysis

We review a FINRA decision to impose a bar pursuant to Rule 9552(h) under the
standard set forth in Exchange Act Section 19(f).16 To sustain such action, we must find (among
other things) that “the specific grounds on which such . . . bar . . . is based exist in fact.”17
Otherwise, we must set the bar aside.18

FINRA may not impose a bar on a basis not supported by the record.19 The specific
grounds that FINRA articulated for the bar in its January 21, 2016 letter to Parris do not exist in
fact. In that letter, FINRA informed Parris that he had been barred pursuant to FINRA Rule
9552(h) and in accordance with prior letters cautioning that he could be barred if he “fail[ed] to
request termination of the suspension” from association “by January 19, 2016.” Rule 9552(h) is
titled “Defaults,” and provides that FINRA may bar an associated person who has failed to
request a termination of his suspension. But Parris did not default; he timely requested that his
suspension “be terminated on the grounds that he has fully complied with FINRA’s 8210
requests.”
Nor may FINRA rely on a basis not articulated in the January 21 letter barring Parris to
impose a bar. FINRA contends that the order barring Parris was consistent with a reasonable
application of Rule 9552 because its “structure, purpose, and text reinforce the conclusion that a
meritless request to terminate a suspension is the same as not requesting termination.” But we
will not consider this explanation because FINRA provided it for the first time in its brief on
appeal.20

See CleanTech Innovations, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 69968, 2013 WL 3477086,
at *10 (July 11, 2013) (setting aside NASDAQ delisting decision under Exchange Act Section
19(f) because “the record does not show that the grounds on which NASDAQ relied in delisting
CleanTech exist in fact”); cf. Kent M. Houston, Exchange Act Release No. 66014, 2011 WL
6392264, at *8-9 (Dec. 20, 2011) (setting aside bar imposed in disciplinary proceeding where,
although “NASD deemed [applicant]’s failure to appear for [on-the-record testimony] as a failure
to respond in any manner to a request for information issued pursuant to Rule 8210,” he “did
respond in some manner to NASD’s request”).
20

CleanTech, 2013 WL 3477086, at *6 n.44 (declining to consider “NASDAQ’s arguments
in support of the grounds on which it based its delisting decision” because they were “not
supported by facts established by the record, but only by assertions made in its briefs”). FINRA
cannot rewrite the bar notice (and thus amend the evidentiary record) by articulating a new basis
for its action on appeal. See Richard T. Sullivan, Exchange Act Release No. 40671, 1998 WL
786943, at *6 (Nov. 12, 1998) (“It is important that a self-regulatory organization clearly explain
the basis for its conclusions. If it fails to do so, an applicant is impaired in his or her ability to
urge a contrary position to us, and we cannot discharge our review function.”).

7
FINRA may also not rely on FINRA Enforcement’s separate January 21 letter denying
Parris’s request to terminate his suspension as a basis for sustaining the bar because that letter
did not purport to bar Parris. And the January 21 letter imposing the bar did not acknowledge
that Parris requested termination of his suspension.21 Accordingly, we set aside the bar.22
In so doing, we leave in place FINRA’s November 9, 2015 suspension of Parris. Parris
did not appeal the suspension, and FINRA’s bar order did not terminate it. We reject FINRA’s
argument that Parris is now subject to a “perpetual suspension.” FINRA has previously
terminated a suspension, even after imposing a bar, on the ground of full compliance with its
requests for information.23 And FINRA has done so after previously refusing to terminate the
suspension until there was full compliance with its information requests.24

21

FINRA argues that this case is indistinguishable from Norman Chen, Exchange Act
Release No. 65345, 2011 WL 4336720 (Sept. 16, 2011). In Chen, we granted FINRA’s motion
to dismiss Chen’s application for review because we found that “Chen’s conduct ‘amounted to a
complete failure to respond,’” and Chen’s written request for termination of the suspension was
not “on the ground of full compliance.” Id. at *3. That is not the case here. Parris gave
testimony and provided documents in response to FINRA’s requests and, consistent with FINRA
Rule 9552(f), Parris filed his written request for termination of the suspension on the ground that
he had fully complied with FINRA’s requests under Rule 8210. In any event, FINRA informed
Parris that he would be barred pursuant to Rule 9552(h) if he failed to request termination of his
suspension on the ground of full compliance and, in imposing the bar, FINRA could not ignore
that Parris had in fact done so.
22

We reject FINRA’s request that we dismiss Parris’s appeal for failure to exhaust
administrative remedies. FINRA argues that Parris waived any right to contest the bar because
he did not request a FINRA hearing before his suspension came into effect. We disagree.
Although the Commission has consistently held that “we will not consider an application for
review if that applicant has failed to exhaust FINRA’s procedures for contesting the sanction at
issue,” see Lenahan, 2014 WL 4656403, at *2, the “sanction at issue” in this matter is the bar,
not the suspension. Rule 9552(h) does not authorize a bar based on a failure to request a hearing;
it authorizes a bar based on a failure to request that a suspension be terminated. That failure did
not occur. Parris’s decision to forgo a hearing on his suspension three months earlier does not
preclude him from challenging a bar that was imposed subsequently on a basis inconsistent with
the record.

bar” after Evansen provided the information that FINRA had requested).

FINRA may still take any action against Parris permitted under its rules, and Parris may
appeal any subsequent action taken against him in a manner consistent with the Exchange Act.25
An appropriate order will issue.26

See id. at *2-4 (sustaining bar imposed pursuant to disciplinary proceeding for violating
Rule 8210 after FINRA had vacated a bar that it imposed pursuant to Rule 9552). FINRA’s
September 23, 2015 letter to Parris suggests that it believes it has a basis to proceed against
Parris in a disciplinary hearing for violation of Rule 8210, and Parris contends that FINRA
should afford him a hearing with respect to his compliance with its requests. We do not intend to
suggest that FINRA take any particular action in this matter.
26

We have considered all of the parties’ contentions. We have rejected or sustained them
to the extent that they are inconsistent or in accord with the views expressed in this opinion.
