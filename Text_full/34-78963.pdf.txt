SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
17 CFR Part 240
[Release No. 34-78963; File No. S7-23-16]
RIN 3235-AL48
Definition of “Covered Clearing Agency”
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rule amendments.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”) proposes to
amend the definition of “covered clearing agency” under Rule 17Ad-22 to mean a registered
clearing agency that provides the services of a central counterparty (“CCP”), central securities
depository (“CSD”), or a securities settlement system (“SSS”). The Commission also proposes a
definition of “securities settlement system” and proposes to amend the definitions of “central
securities depository services” to facilitate the proposed amendment to “covered clearing
agency.” In addition, the Commission proposes to amend the definition of “sensitivity analysis”
under Rule 17Ad-22 to expand the scope of covered clearing agencies subject to requirements
thereunder. These amendments are proposed pursuant to Section 17A of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and the Payment, Clearing, and Settlement Supervision Act of
2010 (“Clearing Supervision Act”), enacted in Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission proposes to amend the definition of
“covered clearing agency” in Rule 17Ad-22(a)(5) to mean a registered clearing agency that
provides the services of a CCP, CSD, or SSS. The Commission further proposes to define
“securities settlement system” under Rule 17Ad-22 to mean a clearing agency that enables
securities to be transferred and settled by book entry according to a set of predetermined
multilateral rules. 1 The Commission also proposes to amend Rule 17Ad-22(a)(3) to define
“central securities depository” to mean a clearing agency that is a securities depository as
described in Section 3(a)(23)(A) of the Exchange Act. 2
In addition, the Commission proposes to amend the definition of “sensitivity analysis” in
Rule 17Ad-22(a)(16) to expand its coverage, so that the policies and procedures of all covered
clearing agencies that are CCPs provide for a sensitivity analysis that considers the most volatile
relevant periods, where practical, that have been experienced by the markets served by the
covered clearing agency. 3
In developing these proposed amendments, Commission staff has consulted with the
Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”), Commodity Futures Trading Commission
1

To facilitate this proposed addition, the Commission would renumber the remaining
definitions in Rule 17Ad-22(a).
2

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(23)(A).

3

If the proposed definition of “securities settlement system” is adopted, the definition of
“sensitivity analysis” would move to Rule 17Ad-22(a)(17).

(“CFTC”), and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”). 4 The Commission
has also considered the relevant international standards as required by Section 805(a)(2)(A) of
the Clearing Supervision Act. 5 The relevant international standards for CCPs, CSDs, and SSSs
are the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (“PFMI”). 6

International Organization of Securities Commissions (“CPSS-IOSCO”), Principles for Financial
Market Infrastructures (Apr. 16, 2012), available at http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss101a.pdf.
The PFMI sets forth twenty-four principles for financial market infrastructures (“FMIs”),
each of which includes a headline standard and a list of key considerations that further explain
the headline standard. Accompanying explanatory notes further discuss the objectives of and
rationales for the standards, as well as provide guidance on how the standards can be
implemented. See id. at 17. Commission staff co-chaired the working group within CPSSIOSCO that drafted both the consultative and final versions of the PFMI. In 2014, the CPSS
became the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (“CPMI”).
CPMI-IOSCO has published subsequent guidance relevant to implementation of the
PFMI. See PFMI: Disclosure framework and Assessment methodology (Dec. 2012), available at

I. Introduction
The Commission preliminarily believes that amending the definition of “covered clearing
agency” would further the Commission’s ongoing efforts to enhance the regulatory framework

8

for clearing agencies. 7 As discussed below, the Commission preliminarily believes that
registered clearing agencies providing the services of CCPs, CSDs, and SSSs perform a critical
role for the U.S. securities markets and the broader U.S. financial system by helping to reduce
risk and by providing transparency to the markets. In light of this critical role, the Commission
preliminary believes that the definition of “covered clearing agency” should be expanded to
include all such clearing agencies, which would make them subject to the enhanced requirements
of Rule 17Ad-22(e).
A. Regulatory Framework
Below is an overview of the relevant regulatory requirements for registered clearing
agencies and for clearing agencies operating pursuant to an exemption from registration
(“exempt clearing agencies”).
1. Exchange Act
Section 17A of the Exchange Act directs the Commission to facilitate the establishment
of (i) a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions and (ii) linked or coordinated facilities for clearance and settlement of securities
transactions. 8 In facilitating the establishment of the national clearance and settlement system,
the Commission must have due regard for the public interest, the protection of investors, the

7

With these proposed rule amendments and guidance, the Commission is not re-opening
comment on the rules adopted by the Commission in the CCA Standards adopting release with
respect to those entities already subject to the adopted rules. See Exchange Act Release No. 3478961, (Sept. 28, 2016) (“CCA Standards adopting release”).
8

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(a)(2); see also Report of the Senate Committee on Banking,
Housing & Urban Affairs, S. Rep. No. 94-75, at 4 (1975) (urging that “[t]he Committee believes
the banking and security industries must move quickly toward the establishment of a fully
integrated national system for the prompt and accurate processing and settlement of securities
transactions”).

9

safeguarding of securities and funds, and maintenance of fair competition among brokers and
dealers, clearing agencies, and transfer agents. 9
As discussed further below, clearing agencies are broadly defined in the Exchange Act
and undertake a variety of functions. 10 Under Section 17A and Rule 17Ab2-1, 11 an entity that
meets the definition of a clearing agency is required to register with the Commission or obtain
from the Commission an exemption from registration prior to performing the functions of a
clearing agency. To grant registration to a clearing agency, the Exchange Act requires the
Commission to determine that the rules and operations of the applicant clearing agency meet the
standards set forth in Section 17A. 12 Specifically, Section 17A(b)(3) provides that a clearing
agency shall not be registered unless the Commission determines that the clearing agency’s rules
are consistent with the Exchange Act. In so doing, the Commission must determine that, among
other things, (i) the clearing agency is so organized and has the capacity to be able to facilitate
the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to safeguard
securities or funds in its custody or control, (ii) the rules of the clearing agency assure a fair
representation of its members and participants in the selection of its directors and administration
of its affairs, (iii) the rules of the clearing agency provide for the equitable allocation of

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(23)(A); see also infra note 40 and accompanying text (setting forth
the definition of “clearing agency” under the Exchange Act).
11

See 17 CFR 240.17Ab2-1.

12

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(A)–(I) (identifying nine determinations that the Commission
must make regarding the rules and structure of a clearing agency to grant registration). In 1980,
the Commission published a statement of the views and positions of Commission staff regarding
the requirements of Section 17A. See Exchange Act Release No. 16900 (June 17, 1980), 45 FR
41920 (June 23, 1980).

10

reasonable dues and fees, and (iv) the rules of the clearing agency are designed to promote the
prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. 13 Section 17A(b)(1)
further provides that upon the Commission’s motion or upon a clearing agency’s application, the
Commission may conditionally or unconditionally exempt a clearing agency from any provision
of Section 17A of the Exchange Act or the rules or regulations thereunder if the Commission
finds that such exemption is consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, and
the purposes of Section 17A, including the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of
securities and funds. 14
Following this registration process, the Commission supervises registered clearing
agencies using various tools. One of these tools is Rule 17a-1 under the Exchange Act, which
requires every registered clearing agency to keep and preserve at least one copy of all
documents, including all correspondence, memoranda, papers, books, notices, accounts, and
other such records as shall be made or received by it in the course of its business as such and in
the conduct of its self-regulatory activity for a period not less than five years and, upon request
of any representative of the Commission, to promptly furnish to the possession of such
representative copies of any such documents required to be kept. 15 Another of these tools is the
rule filing process for self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”), 16 set forth in Section 19(b) of the
Exchange Act and rules and regulations thereunder. A registered clearing agency is required to

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(A), (C), (D), (F).

14

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(1).

15

See 17 CFR 240.17a-1(a)–(c); see also 15 U.S.C 78q(a)(1), (2).

16

Upon registration, registered clearing agencies are SROs under Section 3(a)(26) of the
Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26).

11

file with the Commission any proposed rule or proposed change in, addition to, or deletion from
the registered clearing agency’s rules. 17 The Commission publishes all proposed rule changes
for comment and reviews them. Proposed rule changes are generally required to be approved by
the Commission prior to going into effect; however, certain types of proposed rule changes take
effect upon filing with the Commission. 18 When reviewing a proposed rule change, the
Commission considers the submissions of the clearing agency together with any comments
received on the proposed rule change in making a determination of whether the proposed rule
change is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act. In addition, Section 17A of the
Exchange Act further provides the Commission with authority to adopt rules as necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of
the purposes of the Exchange Act and prohibits a clearing agency from engaging in any activity
in contravention of such rules and regulations. 19
In addition, Commission staff conducts examinations of registered and exempt clearing
agencies to assess, among other things, existing and emerging risks, compliance with applicable
statutory and regulatory requirements (including any terms and conditions set forth in an order
granting registration or an exemption from registration), and a clearing agency’s oversight of
compliance by its participants with its rules. Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act provides the
17

An SRO must submit proposed rule changes to the Commission for review and approval
pursuant to Rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act. A stated policy, practice, or interpretation of an
SRO, such as its written policies and procedures, would generally be deemed to be a proposed
rule change. See 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1); 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
18

See 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A) (setting forth the types of proposed rule changes that take
effect upon filing with the Commission). The Commission may temporarily suspend those rule
changes within 60 days of filing and institute proceedings to determine whether to approve or
disapprove the rule changes. See 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(C).

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(d).

Commission with authority to initiate and conduct investigations to determine if there have been
violations of the federal securities laws. 20 Section 19(h) of the Exchange Act also provides the
Commission with authority to institute civil actions seeking injunctive and other equitable
remedies and/or administrative proceedings arising out of such investigations. 21
2. Dodd-Frank Act
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act provides the Commission with authority to regulate
certain over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives. Specifically, Title VII added provisions to the
Exchange Act that (i) require entities performing the functions of a clearing agency with respect
to security-based swaps (“security-based swap clearing agencies”) to register with the
Commission, and (ii) direct the Commission to adopt rules with respect to security-based swap
clearing agencies. 22
The Clearing Supervision Act, enacted in Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act, provides for
the enhanced regulation of certain financial market utilities (“FMUs”). 23 FMUs include clearing
agencies that manage or operate a multilateral system for the purpose of transferring, clearing, or

20

See 15 U.S.C. 78u(a).

21

See 15 U.S.C. 78s(h).

22

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(i), (j); Dodd-Frank Act, Sec. 763(b), 124 Stat. at 1768–69 (adding
paragraphs (i) and (j) to Section 17A of the Exchange Act).
23

The objectives and principles for the risk management standards prescribed under the
Clearing Supervision Act shall be to (i) promote robust risk management; (ii) promote safety and
soundness; (iii) reduce systemic risks; and (iv) support the stability of the broader financial
system. Further, the Clearing Supervision Act states that the standards may address areas such
as risk management policies and procedures; margin and collateral requirements; participant or
counterparty default policies and procedures; the ability to complete timely clearing and
settlement of financial transactions; capital and financial resources requirements for designated
FMUs; and other areas that are necessary to achieve the objectives and principles described
above. See 12 U.S.C. 5464(b), (c).

13

settling payments, securities, or other financial transactions among financial institutions or
between financial institutions and the FMU. 24 FSOC has designated certain FMUs as
systemically important or likely to become systemically important (“SIFMUs”). 25 SIFMUs are
required to file 60-days advance notice of changes to rules, procedures, and operations that could
materially affect the nature or level of risk presented by the SIFMU (“advance notice”). 26 The
Clearing Supervision Act authorizes the Commission to object to changes proposed in such an
advance notice, which would prevent the clearing agency from implementing the change. 27 The
Clearing Supervision Act also provides for enhanced coordination between the Commission and
FRB by allowing for regular on-site examinations and information sharing. 28 The Clearing
Supervision Act further provides that the Commission and CFTC shall coordinate with the FRB

24

See 12 U.S.C. 5462(6). The definition of “financial market utility” in Section 803(6) of
the Clearing Supervision Act contains a number of exclusions that include, but are not limited to,
certain designated contract markets, registered futures associations, swap data repositories, swap
execution facilities, national securities exchanges, national securities associations, alternative
trading systems, security-based swap data repositories, security-based swap execution facilities,
brokers, dealers, transfer agents, investment companies, and futures commission merchants. See
12 U.S.C. 5462(6)(B).
25

See 12 U.S.C. 5463. An FMU is systemically important if the failure of or a disruption to
the functioning of such FMU could create or increase the risk of significant liquidity or credit
problems spreading among financial institutions or markets and thereby threaten the stability of
the U.S. financial system. See 12 U.S.C. 5462(9).
26

See 12 U.S.C. 5465(e)(1)(A); 17 CFR 240.19b-4(n). The Commission published a final
rule concerning the filing of advance notices for designated clearing agencies in 2012. See
Exchange Act Release No. 34-67286 (June 28, 2012), 77 FR 41602 (July 13, 2012); see also 17
CFR 240.17Ad-22(a)(8) (defining “designated clearing agency”).

to jointly develop risk management supervision programs for SIFMUs. 29 In addition, the
Clearing Supervision Act provides that the Commission and CFTC may each prescribe risk
management standards governing the operations related to payment, clearing, and settlement
activities (“PCS activities”) of SIFMUs for which each is the supervisory agency, in consultation
with the FSOC and FRB and taking into consideration relevant international standards and
existing prudential requirements. 30
3. Rule 17Ad-22
In 2012, the Commission adopted Rule 17Ad-22 under the Exchange Act to strengthen
the substantive regulation of registered clearing agencies, promote the safe and reliable operation
of registered clearing agencies, and improve efficiency, transparency, and access to registered
clearing agencies. 31 At that time, the Commission noted that the implementation of Rule 17Ad22 would be an important first step in developing the regulatory changes contemplated by Titles
VII and VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act. 32 In this regard, Rule 17Ad-22(b) established certain

See 12 U.S.C. 5464(a)(2). The Commission notes that, under Rule 17Ad-22(a)(8), a

requirements for clearing agencies that provide CCP services, and Rule 17Ad-22(d) established
requirements for the operation and governance of all registered clearing agencies. 33
Contemporaneously with this proposal, the Commission has taken another step in its
development of an enhanced regulatory regime for clearing agencies and expanded the
requirements under Rule 17Ad-22 by adopting new paragraph (e). 34 Rule 17Ad-22(e) builds on
the existing framework by establishing requirements for registered clearing agencies that meet
the definition of a “covered clearing agency,” as discussed further below. Rule 17Ad-22(e)
requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to address the following topics concerning its operation and
governance:
•

general organization (including legal basis, governance, a framework for the
comprehensive management of risks, and recovery planning);

•

financial risk management (including credit risk, collateral, margin, and liquidity risk);

•

settlement (including settlement finality, money settlements, and physical deliveries);

•

CSDs and exchange-of-value settlement systems;

•

default management (including default rules and procedures and segregation and
portability);

•

business and operational risk management (including general business risk, custody and
investment risks, and operational risk);

33

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b), (d).

34

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 463–477.

16

•

access (including access and participation requirements, tiered participation
arrangements, and links);

•

efficiency (including efficiency and effectiveness and communication procedures and
standards); and

•

transparency.
As described in the CCA Standards adopting release, a covered clearing agency is subject

to the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e), whereas a registered clearing agency that is not a
covered clearing agency is subject to the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(d). 35 As noted in the
CCA Standards adopting release, the Commission continues to believe that the availability of
Rules 17Ad-22(d) and (e) help ensure that the Commission can efficiently regulate registered
clearing agencies depending on the specific activity and risks that each type of clearing agency
poses to the U.S. markets. 36 In particular, Rule 17Ad-22(d) provides a set of requirements for
registered clearing agencies that are not covered clearing agencies. The Commission expects to
continue to use these two sets of requirements to regulate the national system for clearance and
settlement as the varied entities that constitute it, including both covered clearing agencies and
registered clearing agencies that are not covered clearing agencies, continue to emerge and
evolve.
35

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 36–40. Rule 17Ad-22(d) sets forth
minimum requirements for the operation and governance of registered clearing agencies. Under
this rule proposal, all registered clearing agencies and covered clearing agencies would remain
subject to the requirements in Section 17A of the Exchange Act and the relevant Commission
rules and regulations thereunder, including Rules 17Ad-22(a) and (c). Covered clearing agencies
would also remain subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e), and registered clearing agencies that are not
covered clearing agencies would remain subject to Rule 17Ad-22(d). Registered clearing
agencies that provide CCP services would also remain subject to Rule 17Ad-22(b).

B. Distinctions among Clearing Agencies
Section 17A of the Exchange Act was adopted in response to the paperwork crisis of the
late 1960s that nearly brought the securities industry to a standstill and directly or indirectly
resulted in the failure of large numbers of broker-dealers because the industry’s clearance and
settlement procedures were inefficient and lacked automation. 37 When Congress added Section
17A to the Exchange Act as part of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, it made the
following four findings: (i) the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions, including the transfer of record ownership and the safeguarding of securities and
funds related thereto, are necessary for the protection of investors and persons facilitating
transactions by and acting on behalf of investors; (ii) inefficient procedures for clearance and
settlement impose unnecessary costs on investors and persons facilitating transactions by and
acting on behalf of investors; (iii) new data processing and communications techniques create the
opportunity for more efficient, effective, and safe procedures for clearance and settlement; and
(iv) the linking of all clearance and settlement facilities and the development of uniform
standards and procedures for clearance and settlement will reduce unnecessary costs and increase
the protection of investors and persons facilitating transactions by and acting on behalf of
investors. 38 Congress therefore directed the Commission to facilitate the establishment of a

37

The paperwork crisis resulted from sharply increased trading volumes and historic
industry inattention to securities processing, as demonstrated by inefficient, duplicative and
highly manual clearance and settlement system, poor records, insufficient controls over funds
and securities, and use of untrained personnel to perform processing functions. See, e.g.,
Commission, Study of Unsafe and Unsound Practices of Brokers and Dealers, H.R. Doc. No.
231, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1971).
38

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(a)(1)(A)–(D).

18

national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. 39
The Commission’s ability to achieve these goals and its supervision of the national system for
clearance and settlement is based upon the regulation of the various entities that operate as
clearing agencies.
In defining “clearing agency,” Section 3(a)(23) of the Exchange Act contemplates a
broad variety of roles and functions. Pursuant to Section 3(a)(23), a “clearing agency” is any
person who does the following:
•

acts as an intermediary in making payments or deliveries or both in connection with
securities transactions;

•

provides facilities for the comparison of data regarding the terms of settlement of
securities transactions, to reduce the number of settlements of securities transactions, or
for the allocation of securities settlement responsibilities;

•

acts as a custodian of securities in connection with a system for the central handling of
securities whereby all securities of a particular class or series of any issuer deposited
within the system are treated as fungible and may be transferred, loaned, or pledged by
bookkeeping entry, without physical delivery of securities certificates (such as a
securities depository); or

•

otherwise permits or facilitates the settlement of securities transactions or the
hypothecation or lending of securities without physical delivery of securities certificates
(such as a securities depository). 40

39

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1 et seq.; see also supra note 8.

40

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(23)(A); see also supra note 10 and accompanying text. In light of
its potential breadth, the definition excludes, among others, any national securities exchange or
19

From these broad categories, a number of different types of clearing agencies have
emerged under the Commission’s regulatory oversight of the national system for clearance and
settlement. 41 As discussed below, the Commission’s historical approach in drawing distinctions
among the various clearing agencies operating within the national system for clearance and
settlement has, to a large degree, been predicated on the range of clearing agency functions
performed within that system and whether, in response to these and other elements, the
appropriate regulatory response is registration or an exemption from registration. Where
registration is required, the complete set of regulation adopted by the Commission pursuant to its
authority under Section 17A of the Exchange Act applies. As discussed above, those clearing
agencies that perform on a broad basis CCP and CSD services have been required to register and
are subject to the full range of Commission rules and regulations for clearing agencies. 42 Where
the Commission has granted an exemption from registration, exemptive conditions tailored to the
particular clearing agency functions performed by the clearing agency operate as the primary
regulatory requirements.

registered securities association solely by reason of its providing facilities for comparison of data
respecting the terms of settlement of securities transactions effected on such exchange or by
means of any electronic system operated or controlled by such association. See 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(23)(B)(ii).
41

In addition to those discussed below in Part I.B, the Commission has also previously
stated that entities called “clearing corporations” fall within the definition of “clearing agency”
under the Exchange Act. Clearing corporations provide a range of clearance and settlement
services but may not necessarily fall within the definition of “CCP” or “CSD.” See Exchange
Act Release No. 20221 (Sept. 23, 1983), 48 FR 45167 (Oct. 3, 1983) (order approving the
clearing agency registration of four depositories and four clearing corporations).
42

The Commission has also granted an exemption from registration as a clearing agency to
certain entities that perform a limited amount of CSD services for U.S. securities in certain
instances. See infra note 54.

20

1. Registered Clearing Agencies
Three common functions of registered clearing agencies are the functions of a CCP,
CSD, and SSS. Each is described below.
A clearing agency performs the functions of a CCP when it interposes itself between the
counterparties to a trade, acting functionally as the buyer to every seller and the seller to every
buyer. 43 Currently, CCPs make up five of the six active clearing agencies registered with the
Commission, and four of those five CCPs are covered clearing agencies subject to Rule 17Ad22(e). 44
A clearing agency performs the functions of a CSD when it (i) acts as a custodian of
securities in connection with a system for the central handling of securities whereby all securities
of a particular class or series of any issuer deposited within the system are treated as fungible and
may be transferred, loaned, or pledged by bookkeeping entry without physical delivery of
securities certificates, or (ii) otherwise permits or facilitates the settlement of securities
transactions or the hypothecation or lending of securities without physical delivery of securities
certificates. 45 A CSD may also provide asset services, which may include the administration of
corporate actions and redemptions. One of the six active registered clearing agencies provides
securities depository services for the U.S. securities markets and is commonly referred to as a

43

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(a)(1); Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note
31, at 66229.
44

The CCPs that make up five of the six active clearing agencies registered with the
Commission are Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”), ICE Clear Credit (“ICC”), ICE
Clear Europe (“ICEEU”), National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”), and The Options
Clearing Corporation (“OCC”). As discussed in more detail below, of those five CCPs, ICC is
the only CCP that is currently not a covered clearing agency subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e).
45

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(23)(A); 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(a)(2).

21

CSD. 46 This clearing agency providing CSD services is also a covered clearing agency subject
to Rule 17Ad-22(e).
A clearing agency also may perform the functions of an SSS. An SSS is generally
understood to be a clearing agency that enables securities to be transferred and settled by book
entry according to a set of predetermined multilateral rules. 47 In the Commission’s experience,
SSS functions may be performed in a single registered clearing agency that also provides CSD
services. For example, on prior occasions the Commission has included book-entry transfers as
among the functions of a CSD. 48 In the U.S. securities markets, such functions are currently
performed by the one registered clearing agency providing securities depository services noted
above, which is a covered clearing agency subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e). 49
Five of the six active registered clearing agencies noted above are SIFMUs—i.e., they
have been designated systemically important by FSOC pursuant to the Clearing Supervision
Act. 50 As previously discussed, the Clearing Supervision Act provides for, among other things,
46

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(a)(3); Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note
31, at 66229. This registered clearing agency is the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”).
47

See infra notes 83-88 and accompanying text (describing the range of services that a
clearing agency may provide in connection with the settlement of securities transactions).
48

See, e.g., Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 31, at 66253.

See, e.g., Exchange Act Release No. 34-77991 (June 3, 2016), 81 FR 37232, 37232–33
(June 9, 2016) (notice describing in part the relationship between DTC’s depository and bookentry services).
50

On July 18, 2012, the FSOC designated as systemically important the following thenregistered clearing agencies: CME Group (“CME”), DTC, FICC, ICC, NSCC, and OCC. The
Commission is the supervisory agency for DTC, FICC, NSCC, and OCC, and the CFTC is the
supervisory agency for CME and ICC. The Commission jointly regulates ICC and OCC with the
CFTC. In addition, the Commission jointly regulates ICE Clear Europe (“ICEEU”), which has
not been designated as systemically important by FSOC, with the CFTC and Bank of England.
DTC, FICC, NSCC, OCC, and ICEEU are covered clearing agencies subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e).

the enhanced regulation of SIFMUs, reflecting the fact that such entities are critical market
infrastructures that may pose a systemic risk to the U.S. financial system. Each of the SIFMUs
have generally been described as providing the services of a CCP or CSD. 51
2. Exempt Clearing Agencies
In addition to registered clearing agencies, currently the Commission has granted
exemptions from clearing agency registration to five exempt clearing agencies. 52 The
Commission’s exemptive orders contain tailored conditions that, among other things, take into
account the range of clearing agency functions performed by each entity. Three exempt clearing
agencies provide trade matching services, which are services that generally constitute
comparison of data respecting the terms of settlement of securities transactions. 53 The remaining
two exempt clearing agencies are non-U.S. entities that perform a limited range of clearing
agency functions, including certain CSD and collateral management services. 54
In addition, prior to the effective date of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, the
Commission issued a temporary exemption from the registration requirements for clearing

51

See, e.g., FSOC, 2012 Annual Report, at 163–187, available at
https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/2012%20Annual%20Report.pdf.
52

The five exempt clearing agencies are Clearstream, Euroclear Bank SA/NV, Omgeo
Matching Services – US, LLC, Bloomberg STP LLC, and SS&C Technologies, Inc. See infra
notes 53–54 (citing the exemption orders for each).

20494 (Apr. 23, 2001); see also Exchange Act Release No. 34-39829 (Apr. 6, 1998), 63 FR

agencies in Section 17A(b) of the Exchange Act to entities providing certain services, now
sometimes referred to as post-trade processing services, for security-based swaps (“SBS
exemption order”). 55 To date, six entities providing a range of such post-trade processing
services are relying upon the SBS exemption order. The Commission stated that the exemptive
order was necessary because the Dodd-Frank Act had expanded the definition of “security” to
include security-based swaps, and therefore entities performing the functions of a clearing
agency with respect to security-based swaps would be required to register under Section
17A(b)(1) of the Exchange Act upon the effective date of Title VII. 56 Those functions, as
described by the Commission in the SBS exemption order, generally constitute certain collateral
management, trade matching, and tear up or compression functions. 57
II. Proposed Amendments under Rule 17Ad-22
The Commission adopted Rule 17Ad-22(e) to strengthen the substantive regulation of
clearing agencies, promote the safe and reliable operation of covered clearing agencies, and
improve efficiency, transparency, and access to covered clearing agencies. Rule 17Ad-22(e)

55

See Exchange Act Release No. 34-64796 (July 1, 2011), 76 FR 39963 (July 7, 2011).

56

In addition, as part of its consideration of whether future rulemaking for post-trade
processing clearing agencies would be appropriate, the Commission noted that it may consider
whether to apply rules to clearing agencies engaged in PCS activities identified in the Clearing
Supervision Act. See Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 31, at 66228. In
particular, the Clearing Supervision Act identifies the following as PCS activities: (i) calculation
and communication of unsettled financial transactions between counterparties; (ii) netting of
transactions; (iii) provision and maintenance of trade, contract, or instrument information; (iv)
management of risks and activities associated with continuing financial transactions; (v)
transmittal and storage of payment instructions; (vi) movement of funds; (vii) final settlement of
financial transactions; and (viii) other similar functions that the FSOC may determine. See 12
U.S.C. 5462(7); see also supra note 30 and accompanying text.
57

An expanded explanation of these different functions can be found in the SBS exemption
order. See SBS exemption order, supra note 55, at 39964.

24

includes requirements for covered clearing agencies intended to address the activity and risks
that their size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets, the risks inherent in
the products they clear, and the goals of both the Exchange Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. Of
particular note, the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e) that address policies and procedures for
transparency, governance, financial risk management, and operational risk management help
ensure that covered clearing agencies are robust and stable. 58
The Commission is proposing to expand the coverage of Rule 17Ad-22(e) so that all
registered clearing agencies performing the functions of a CCP, CSD, or SSS would be subject to
Rule 17Ad-22(e). To facilitate this amendment, the Commission is proposing in Part II.B a
definition of “securities settlement system” and in Part II.C to amend the definition of “central
securities depository services.” In addition, the Commission also is proposing in Part II.D to
amend the definition of “sensitivity analysis” to expand its coverage, so that the policies and
procedures of all covered clearing agencies that are CCPs provide for a sensitivity analysis that
considers the most volatile relevant periods, where practical, that have been experienced by the
markets served by the covered clearing agency. In Part II.E, the Commission seeks comment on
each of the proposed amendments.
A. Definition of “Covered Clearing Agency”
Rule 17Ad-22(a)(5) currently defines a covered clearing agency as a registered clearing
agency that: (i) has been designated as systemically important by the FSOC and for which the
Commission is the supervisory agency under the Clearing Supervision Act (“designated clearing
agency”); or (ii) provides CCP services for security-based swaps or is determined by the
58

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 475–477, 463, 464–471, 474; see
also supra note 34 and accompanying text.

25

Commission to be involved in activities with a more complex risk profile (“complex risk profile
clearing agency”), for which the CFTC is not the supervisory agency under the Clearing
Supervision Act. 59 In the CCA Standards proposing release, the Commission sought comment
on whether the scope of Rule 17Ad-22(e) was appropriate and whether the definition of “covered
clearing agency” was appropriate and sufficiently clear given the requirements proposed. 60
In the CCA Standards adopting release, the Commission took an important first step to
establish coverage of the enhanced requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e) over an initial group of
registered clearing agencies. In light of the comments received on the CCA Standards proposing
release, the Commission is now proposing to amend the definition of a “covered clearing
agency” to broaden this coverage so that it encompasses all registered clearing agencies
performing the functions of a CCP, CSD, or SSS. These functions are critical to the U.S.
securities markets and the broader U.S. financial system and implicate the types of activities and
risks that Rule 17Ad-22(e) is designed to address. Specifically, the Commission proposes that
the definition of “covered clearing agency” be amended to mean a registered clearing agency that
provides the services of a CCP, CSD, or SSS.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed amendment to the “covered
clearing agency” definition, which takes into account the specific functions performed by
registered clearing agencies, would lead to greater regulatory consistency among all registered
clearing agencies that perform these critical functions. Additionally, by focusing on functions
rather than designation as systemically important, activities with a more complex risk profile, or
the presence of another regulator, the proposed definition of “covered clearing agency” would
59

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(a)(5).

60

See id. at 29516–17.

26

ensure that all clearing agencies performing these critical functions are subject to enhanced
requirements that address the particular services provided by and risks inherent in these critical
functions.
1. Critical Functions Common among CCPs, CSDs, and SSSs
Although the definition of “clearing agency” in the Exchange Act is broad, there are
certain activities which, by virtue of their significance to the U.S. financial system generally, and
the national system for clearance and settlement in particular, support the application of
enhanced requirements. Among these are those clearing agency activities that, at a general level,
concern the concentration and management of risk and the potential transmission of systemic
risk. Registered clearing agencies that provide CCP, CSD, or SSS services perform common
functions that implicate the concentration and management of risk and the resulting systemic risk
concerns. The Commission therefore believes that it is appropriate to propose to expand the
definition of “covered clearing agency” to subject all such registered clearing agencies to Rule
17Ad-22(e) because Rule 17Ad-22(e) includes enhanced requirements that help mitigate the
systemic risk concerns raised by these activities, such as a requirement for policies and
procedures regarding a framework for the comprehensive management of such risk and
requirements for policies and procedures that address, among other things, financial and general
business risk management, settlement risks, and transparency. 61
Financial risk management is an essential aspect of the role that each of these registered
clearing agencies provides for the U.S. securities markets, both for their own participants and
participants in the broader U.S. financial system. Establishing requirements for policies and
procedures governing such risk management practices is a cornerstone of Rule 17Ad-22(e). For
61

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(3)–(10), (15), (23).

27

example, with respect to credit risk, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) requires that each covered clearing
agency establish, implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to effectively identify, measure, monitor, and manage its credit exposures to
participants and those arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement processes. 62 With
respect to liquidity risk, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) requires that each covered clearing agency establish,
implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
effectively measure, monitor, and manage the liquidity risk that arises in or is borne by the
covered clearing agency, including measuring, monitoring, and managing its settlement and
funding flows on an ongoing and timely basis and its use of intraday liquidity. 63 Rule 17Ad22(e)(5) and (6) also include enhanced requirements for policies and procedures to manage
collateral and maintain a risk-based margin, with particular requirements that help to ensure
resilient stress testing of a covered clearing agency’s financial resources. 64
General business risk is another potential risk that these types of registered clearing
agencies, as entities that concentrate risk, must manage, and Rule 17Ad-22(e) includes enhanced
requirements for policies and procedures that manage general business risk. Specifically, Rule
17Ad-22(e)(3) requires policies and procedures that provide for a comprehensive risk
management framework that addresses a variety of risks, including both financial risk and

62

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(3). While Rule 17Ad-22(d) also includes some
requirements for policies and procedures related to credit risk, Rule 17Ad-22(e) includes
enhanced requirements related to, among other things, stress testing.
63

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(7). Rule 17Ad-22(d) does not include requirements for
policies and procedures related to the management of liquidity risk.
64

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(5), (6).

28

general business risk. 65 Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) further requires that each covered clearing agency
establish, implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to identify, monitor, and manage the covered clearing agency’s general business risk and hold
sufficient liquid net assets funded by equity to cover potential general business losses so that the
covered clearing agency can continue operations as a going concern if those losses materialize. 66
Other requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e) flow from the management of these risks as well.
Notably, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) requires policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that
a covered clearing agency establishes plans for the recovery and orderly wind-down of the
covered clearing agency necessitated by credit losses, liquidity shortfalls, losses from general
business risk, or any other losses. 67 Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) complements this requirement with
requirements for policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for holding liquid net
assets funded by equity equal to the greater of either six months of its current operating expenses
or the amount determined by the board of directors to be sufficient to ensure a recovery or
orderly wind-down of critical operations and services of the covered clearing agency, as
contemplated by the plans established under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3). 68 The Commission
preliminarily believes that a registered clearing agency that provides CCP, CSD, or SSS services
should be subject to enhanced requirements for maintaining policies and procedures that manage
business risk and provide for recovery and wind-down plans. These enhanced business risk
65

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(3). Rule 17Ad-22(d) does not include comparable
requirements.
66

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(15). Rule 17Ad-22(d) does not include requirements for
policies and procedures related to the management of business risk.

68

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(15)(ii).

requirements would benefit not only the clearing agency but also participants and the public.
Likewise, recovery and wind-down plans help ensure that CCPs, CSDs, SSSs, and policymakers
can plan for and mitigate the potential systemic consequences of a wind-down or failure.
Facilitating settlement and mitigating settlement risks is another essential role played by
these registered clearing agencies, CSDs and SSSs in particular, and another important
component of Rule 17Ad-22(e) is enhanced requirements for policies and procedures governing
settlement. For example, Rule 17Ad-22(e) includes requirements directed to settlement finality,
physical delivery, and money settlements. 69 Importantly, it also includes rules with enhanced
requirements for depository functions and settlement systems. 70
Providing transparency to the markets is another essential role that these registered
clearing agencies facilitate in the markets they serve by each maintaining a set of rules and
procedures that govern their participants, their clearance and settlement services, and their risk
management framework. Each registered clearing agency that provides CCP, CSD, or SSS
services has rules that, while they may vary according to the characteristics of the markets they
serve, generally govern how they clear transactions or trades submitted by participants, calculate

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(11). Rule 17Ad-22(d)(10) also includes requirements for

certificates and the transfer of them by book entry, but does not include requirements for, among
other things, policies and procedures relating to ensuring the integrity of securities issues,
safeguarding the rights of securities issuers and holders, preventing the unauthorized creation or
deletion of securities, or conducting periodic and at least daily reconciliation of securities issues.
See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(10).

money, and pay participants that are owed money. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv) also requires a
covered clearing agency to have policies and procedures that provide for a comprehensive public
disclosure of its material rules, policies, and procedures regarding the requirements in Rule
17Ad-22(e). 71 Increased transparency helps market participants manage their risks, thereby
reducing systemic risk concerns across the U.S. financial system.
Each of the above roles, common across the registered clearing agencies that provide
CCP, CSD, and SSS services, is addressed by the enhanced requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e),
and therefore the Commission believes that expanding the definition of “covered clearing
agency” to include those registered clearing agencies that are integral in either performing these
functions or managing these risks, as appropriate, will help to further strengthen the national
system for clearance and settlement and help to further mitigate risk to the broader U.S. financial
system.
2. Critical Functions Specific to CCPs, CSDs, or SSSs
In addition to the critical roles common across CCPs, CSDs, and SSSs, each such
clearing agency also performs unique functions that support expanded coverage of the “covered
clearing agency” definition and, through it, application of Rule 17Ad-22(e) to such clearing
agencies because, as discussed further below, Rule 17Ad-22(e) also includes enhanced
requirements with respect to these functions.
First, with respect to CCPs, the Commission is proposing that the definition of “covered
clearing agency” be expanded so that CCPs would be subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e) in all
circumstances. The Commission has, on previous occasions, noted that increasing reliance by
71

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv). No comparable requirement exists in Rule 17Ad-

22(d).

31

market participants on CCPs supports the application of enhanced regulatory requirements that
address the risks posed by such activity. 72 For example, market participants may rely on CCPs
because clearing and settling a high volume of financial transactions multilaterally through a
CCP can allow for greater efficiency and lower costs than settling bilaterally. 73 In addition,
CCPs are often able to manage risks for their participants related to the clearing and settling of
financial transactions more effectively, and, in some cases, reduce certain risks such as the risk
that a purchaser of a security will not receive the security or that a seller of a security will not
receive payment for the security. 74 CCPs have also become increasingly important given the
mandated central clearing of certain swaps and security-based swaps that is required by the DoddFrank Act. 75

CCPs confer certain benefits to the markets in which they operate, but can also pose
substantial risk not only to individual market participants but also to the broader financial
system, due in part to the fact that central clearing concentrates risk. Disruption to such
functions, or failure on the part of the clearing agency to meet its obligations, could, result in
significant costs to the clearing agency itself and its members and create a potential source of
contagion affecting other market participants or the broader U.S. financial system. 76 As a result,

Standards adopting release, supra note 31, at 66264–65 (noting, among other things, that the

aspects of the infrastructure of the market it serves).

proper management of the risks associated with central clearing is necessary to ensure the
stability of the U.S. securities markets and the broader U.S. financial system. Each CCP
determines how best to manage its credit and liquidity risks, consistent with its regulatory
framework and as appropriate for the products it clears and the market it serves. For example,
participants must meet membership requirements to join a CCP. Each CCP determines who
meets its membership criteria and continues to monitor its membership to ensure that the
members continue to meet these criteria. Similarly, each CCP is responsible for determining its
own margin models and ensuring that each member meets its obligations under the margin
models. When the Commission adopted Rule 17Ad-22(e), it sought to impose enhanced
requirements to an initial group of registered clearing agencies that concentrated risk because
available at http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr424.pdf (“If a CCP is successful
in clearing a large quantity of derivatives trades, the CCP is itself a systemically important
financial institution. The failure of a CCP could suddenly expose many major market participants
to losses. Any such failure, moreover, is likely to have been triggered by the failure of one or
more large clearing members, and therefore to occur during a period of extreme market
fragility.”); Craig Pirrong, The Inefficiency of Clearing Mandates, Policy Analysis, No. 655, at

CCP’s failure to effectively price counterparty risks may lead to moral hazard and adverse
selection problems, that the main effect of clearing would be to “redistribute losses consequent to
a bankruptcy or run,” and that clearing entities have failed or come close to failing in the past,

they were either designated systemically important or engaged in activities with a more complex
risk profile. Now, the Commission believes it is appropriate to propose to expand the coverage
of the “covered clearing agency” definition to include all CCPs because, as described above,
CCP operations generally concentrate risk and can also act as a transfer mechanism for risk, and
Rule 17Ad-22(e) includes enhanced requirements that help mitigate the risks that CCP functions
carry. In particular, Rule 17Ad-22(e) includes requirements for the management of credit and
liquidity risk, the development of recovery and wind-down plans, and tiered participation
arrangements, 77 and the Commission believes that applying these requirements to all CCPs will
help further mitigate systemic risk to the U.S. financial system.
Second, the Commission is similarly proposing that a clearing agency providing CSD
services also be a covered clearing agency. The Commission has noted on previous occasions
the importance of CSDs to the U.S. securities markets. For example, the Commission has noted
that CSDs are critical elements of the national system for clearance and settlement, 78 and that the
establishment of consistent standards for CCP and CSD operations is an important goal that
underpinned the enactment of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. 79 CSDs play a key role in
modern financial markets, where, for many issuers, transactions in securities often involve no
transfer of physical certificates. 80 Such paperless trading generally improves transactional
efficiency but for such benefits to accrue, market participants must have confidence that CSDs

77

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(4), (7), (19).

78

See BSTP and SS&C exemption, supra note 53, at 75398 (noting that a CSD is “a critical
element of the national system for clearance and settlement”).

34

can correctly account for the number of securities in their custody and for the book entries that
allocate securities across participant accounts. The Commission therefore is proposing that
CSDs also be subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e) in all circumstances because of the important role they
play in the national system for clearance and settlement of securities. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)
established enhanced requirements specific to CSDs. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(i) requires a covered
clearing agency that provides central securities depository (“CSD”) services to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain securities in an immobilized or dematerialized form for their transfer by book entry,
ensure the integrity of securities issues, and minimize and manage the risks associated with the
safekeeping and transfer of securities. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(ii) requires a covered clearing
agency that provides CSD services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to implement internal auditing and other controls to
safeguard the rights of securities issuers and holders, prevent the unauthorized creation or
deletion of securities, and conduct periodic and at least daily reconciliation of securities issues it
maintains. Finally, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(iii) requires a covered clearing agency that provides
CSD services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to protect assets against custody risk through appropriate rules and
procedures consistent with relevant laws, rules, and regulations in jurisdictions where it
operates. 81 In addition, Rule 17Ad-22(e) generally strengthens the substantive regulations of
clearing agencies through, among other things, requirements for the comprehensive management
of risk and the development of recovery and wind-down plans, which are equally important to

81

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 472.

35

CSDs. 82 Therefore, the Commission believes that applying Rule 17Ad-22(e) to all clearing
agencies providing CSD services will further help mitigate risk to the U.S. financial system.
Lastly, while in the U.S. securities markets the functions of an SSS are typically
performed by a registered clearing agency that also provides CSD services, the Commission has
also noted that clearing agencies provide a broad range of services in connection with the
settlement of securities transactions. 83 For example, the Commission has previously noted that
clearing agencies “provide differing clusters of services for their participants.” 84 In particular,
“[c]learing corporations generally receive trade data respecting exchanges or [over-the-counter]
trades between broker-dealers and compare, account for and settle the netted securities
transactions.” 85 Over the years, the Commission has registered a number of entities as clearing
agencies that provide a variety of securities settlement services. These services include
facilitating the settlement of transactions executed by specialists on an exchange, 86 providing
clearance and settlement services for mortgage-backed securities transactions, 87 and facilitating

the clearance and settlement of cross-border transactions. 88 These SSSs play a vital role in
fostering the proper functioning of financial markets, but if they are not effectively managed they
have the potential to act as transmission channels for financial shocks, particularly on days of
market stress.
The Commission also believes that a clearing agency providing SSS services can raise
credit, market, and operational risk concerns. 89 The Commission preliminarily believes that
these functions, whether performed independently or consolidated with other clearing agency
functions in a single registered clearing agency, support application of the enhanced standards in
Rule 17Ad-22(e). 90 In recent years, the Commission has adopted requirements for the policies
and procedures of certain clearing agencies under Rule 17Ad-22 to help achieve delivery versus
payment and eliminate principal risk, 91 both of which relate to the provision of SSS services.
The Commission adopted Rule 17Ad-22(e) to strengthen the substantive regulations applicable
to clearing agencies to address, among other things, credit, market, and operational risk.

88

(order approving temporary registration as a clearing agency of the International Securities
Clearing Corporation).
89

The Commission notes that, currently, no registered clearing agency provides only SSS
services in the United States. Nonetheless, the Commission preliminarily believes that SSSs,
because they are financial market infrastructures that provide centralized services similar to
CCPs and CSDs, can also serve as potential transmission mechanisms for systemic risk and
should therefore also be subject to the same requirements as CCPs and CSDs. In this regard, the
Commission notes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) includes requirements specific to settlement
systems. See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 472.

single definition of “clearing agency” in the Exchange Act).
91

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(13), (e)(12).

37

Because SSS operations present these types of risk, the Commission is proposing to apply Rule
17Ad-22(e) to all entities performing these SSS functions.
3. Increasing Scrutiny of CCP, CSD, and SSS Functions
In response to the CCA Standards proposing release, the Commission received a number
of comments on the proposed scope of the definition of covered clearing agency asking the
Commission to expand the scope of the covered clearing agency definition and therefore the
coverage of Rule 17Ad-22(e). 92 Specifically, one commenter endorsed efforts to promote
financial stability through the application of heightened standards for covered clearing agencies,
particularly those that provide CCP services for security-based swaps and other derivatives,
noting that the mandatory clearing of OTC derivatives introduced following the 2008 financial
crisis has heightened the need for enhanced standards for CCPs. 93 A second commenter
suggested that the Commission apply Rule 17Ad-22(e) to all clearing agencies to reduce the risk
of failure and the problems such a failure would cause for investors, citing the size of the
derivatives markets, and the potential for disruption and systemic risk that these markets may
have on covered clearing agencies. 94 A third commenter recommended that any provision of the
proposed rules that reflects best practices should be applied across all clearing agencies. 95 Each
of these comments supports an approach under which registered clearing agencies are subject to
the enhanced standards in Rule 17Ad-22(e) where they perform critical clearing agency
functions that concentrate risk and could serve as mechanisms for the transfer of systemic risk.

See DTCC at 4.

38

Consistent with these comments, the proposed application of Rule 17Ad-22(e) to all registered
clearing agencies that provide CCP, CSD, and SSS services would strengthen the Commission’s
substantive regulation of clearing agencies by imposing enhanced requirements for risk
management policies and procedures that help mitigate systemic risk.
In contrast to the above commenters, one commenter endorsed the Commission’s adopted
definition of “covered clearing agency” and supported not applying Rule 17Ad-22(e) to
registered clearing agencies that were dually registered with the CFTC and SEC, where the
CFTC is the supervisory authority under the Clearing Supervision Act. 96 The commenter also
believed that subjecting a dually registered clearing agency to requirements under Rule 17Ad22(e) and the CFTC’s regime would result in duplicative regulation. 97 The Commission
preliminarily believes that, as discussed in Part II.A.4 below, although the proposed amendment
to the definition of “covered clearing agency” would subject some dually registered clearing
agencies to similar regulations under the Commission’s and CFTC’s comparable regimes,
expanding the definition to include dually registered clearing agencies is nonetheless appropriate.
4. Expanded Coverage under the Definition of “Covered Clearing Agency”
The proposed amendment to the definition of “covered clearing agency” would differ in
two ways from the existing definition of “covered clearing agency.” First, it would no longer
reference whether a clearing agency has been designated systemically important by the FSOC
and for which the Commission is the supervisory agency under the Clearing Supervision Act.
Second, it would remove references to clearing agencies that provide CCP services for securitybased swaps or are involved in activities the Commission determines to have a more complex
96

See CME at 2.

97

See id.

39

risk profile, unless the CFTC is the supervisory agency under the Clearing Supervision Act.
Amending the definition of “covered clearing agency” in this way would replace these two
categories of clearing agencies with clearing agencies providing the services of a CCP, CSD, or
SSS and thereby expand the range of entities that fall within the definition of “covered clearing
agency.” Accordingly, under the proposed amendment to the definition, whether a registered
clearing agency is a SIFMU or dually registered with the Commission and the CFTC would no
longer be relevant to application of the “covered clearing agency” definition or Rule 17Ad-22(e).
Thus, the potential for registered clearing agencies to be subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e)
would increase under the proposed amendment. In particular, under the proposed amendment to
the definition, the narrower set of complex risk profile clearing agencies for which the CFTC is
not the supervisory agency would be replaced with the full universe of registered clearing
agencies that provide CCP, CSD, or SSS services. In light of the discussion above regarding the
critical functions common among and specific to CCPs, CSDs, and SSSs, the Commission
preliminarily believes that such an expansion is appropriate in order to help further mitigate
systemic risk to the U.S. financial system.
Preliminarily, the Commission believes that such an approach is appropriate even though
it may subject clearing agencies that are dually registered with the Commission and CFTC to
similar requirements in some instances. In this regard, the Commission first notes that the staff
has consulted with the CFTC, FRB, and FSOC in the development of these rules to, in part,
avoid unnecessarily duplicative or inconsistent regulation with respect to clearing agencies that
are dually registered in the United States. With respect to such clearing agencies—as well as
clearing agencies regulated by authorities in other jurisdictions—the Commission is nonetheless
mindful, pursuant to the comprehensive framework for regulating swaps and security-based

40

swaps established in Title VII, that the SEC has been given regulatory authority over securitybased swaps. 98 CCPs that clear security-based swaps present risks to the securities markets that
must be subject to appropriate risk management. As noted in the CCA Standards adopting
release, the Commission’s intent with respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e) was, in part, to take an
incremental step under Rule 17Ad-22 to ensure that these risks are appropriately managed
consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act, the Clearing Supervision Act, and Title VII of
the Dodd-Frank Act. 99 The Commission believes that the proposed amendments to the definition
of “covered clearing agency” represent another incremental step to help ensure that these risks
are appropriately managed consistent with each of the above statutes. The Commission has,
through Rule 17Ad-22(e) sought to apply requirements commensurate and appropriate to the risk
posed by the clearing agency functions and activities specific to covered clearing agencies as
they exist in, and serve, the U.S. securities markets. The Commission acknowledges that other
rules and regulations may apply to a covered clearing agency that are similar in scope or purpose
to Rule 17Ad-22(e). However, the presence of similar regulations does not negate the
Commission’s obligation to ensure that risk in the U.S. securities markets is appropriately
managed consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act, the Clearing Supervision Act, and
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Further, because Rule 17Ad-22(e) and other comparable
98

This dual framework for the regulation of CCPs for swaps and security-based swaps by
the Commission and the CFTC was recently recognized by the European Commission in its
equivalence decision for the CFTC. The European Commission has indicated that it will conduct
a separate equivalence analysis for CCPs clearing securities and security-based swaps. See
Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/377 of 15 March 2016 on the equivalence of the
regulatory framework of the United States of America for central counterparties that are
authorised and supervised by the CFTC to the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of
the European Parliament and of the Council, available at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016D0377.
99

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 45.

41

regulations—including those of the CFTC—are consistent with the same international
standards, 100 the potential for inconsistent regulation is low.
Further, in the CCA Standards adopting release, the Commission addressed comments
regarding the risk of duplicative regulation that may result for clearing agencies dually registered
with the Commission and the CFTC, 101 and noted that the Commission has previously addressed
concerns about duplication in the rule filing process by streamlining the process under Rule 19b4 for dually registered clearing agencies. 102 Specifically, for rule filings that primarily concern
the clearing operations of a registered clearing agency that do not pertain to securities clearing
operations but only to clearing of products under the authority of the CFTC, the Commission
made a policy decision to provide a streamlined process for such rule filings to become effective
upon filing with the Commission, without pre-effective notice and opportunity for comment. 103
Finally, with respect to the proposed removal of designated clearing agencies from the
“covered clearing agency” definition, the Commission notes that each designated clearing
agency under Title VIII provides either CCP or CSD services and, therefore, would remain a
covered clearing agency under the proposed amendment to the definition of “covered clearing
agency.” 104 Moreover, the proposed shift to a function-oriented definition of “covered clearing
agency” would not cause any of the registered clearing agencies that currently fall within the

42

definition to be excluded. DTC, FICC, ICEEU, NSCC, and OCC all perform CCP, CSD, and/or
SSS services.
The proposed amendment to the definition would expand the scope of covered clearing
agencies by one additional clearing agency, ICC. Although ICC is a designated SIFMU and
provides CCP services for security-based swaps, the CFTC is its supervisory agency, so it is not
a covered clearing agency under the adopted definition.
B. Definition of “Securities Settlement System”
To facilitate the proposed amendment to the definition of “covered clearing agency,” the
Commission is also proposing to define “securities settlement system” to mean a clearing agency
that enables securities to be transferred and settled by book entry according to a set of
predetermined multilateral rules. The Commission understands that this is the generally
accepted meaning of the term. 105 The Commission preliminarily believes that this definition
appropriately captures the critical functions performed by SSSs described above, including the
role that SSSs have in concentrating and managing risk on behalf of their participants. The
proposed definition would, among other things, include a clearing agency that facilitates the
settlement of transactions executed by specialists on an exchange, provides clearance and
settlement services for mortgage-backed securities transactions, or facilities the clearance and
settlement of cross-border transactions. 106
C. Definition of “Central Securities Depository”
Consistent with the proposed amendment to the definition of “covered clearing agency,”
and to improve consistency with both the definition of “central counterparty” in Rule 17Ad105

See supra note 6.

106

See supra notes 83–88.

43

22(a)(2) and the proposed definition of “securities settlement system,” the Commission is
proposing to amend the definition of “central securities depository services” in Rule 17Ad22(a)(3). Rule 17Ad-22(a)(3) as adopted defines “central securities depository services” to mean
services of a clearing agency that is a securities depository as described in Section 3(a)(23)(A) of
the Exchange Act. The Commission is proposing to amend Rule 17Ad-22(a)(3) so that it would
instead define “central securities depository” to mean a clearing agency that is a securities
depository as described in Section 3(a)(23)(A) of the Exchange Act.
This modification would not alter the meaning of Rule 17Ad-22(a)(3) other than to
improve consistency with (i) the definition of “central counterparty” and its use throughout Rule
17Ad-22, and (ii) the proposed definition of “securities settlement system” and its proposed use
under Rule 17Ad-22. The Commission preliminarily believes that this proposed modification is
therefore appropriate so that the definition of “covered clearing agency” is workable.
D. Definition of “Sensitivity Analysis”
The Commission is also proposing to amend the definition of “sensitivity analysis” under
Rule 17Ad-22 to remove the reference to “a covered clearing agency involved in activities with a
more complex risk profile” from paragraph (ii). Pursuant to the proposed amendment, all
covered clearing agencies that are CCPs, rather than just those involved in activities with a more
complex risk profile, as part of developing and maintaining policies and procedures for
performing sensitivity analysis pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6), would need to consider the most
volatile relevant periods, where practical, that have been experienced by the markets served by
the clearing agency.
Under the existing definition of “sensitivity analysis,” the Commission applies the
requirements for policies and procedures regarding volatile relevant periods only to covered

44

clearing agencies that are complex risk profile clearing agencies. While this approach applies
the requirements related to sensitivity analysis to CCPs that clear security-based swaps, it does
not apply the requirements to other clearing agencies that provide CCP services. Under the
Commission’s proposed amendment to the “sensitivity analysis” definition, these requirements
for policies and procedures would apply to all covered clearing agencies that are CCPs. The
Commission believes that policies and procedures for considering the most volatile relevant
periods, where practical, that have been experienced by the markets served by a covered clearing
agency promote sound risk management and help mitigate systemic risk. The Commission
therefore preliminarily believes that expanding the coverage of this requirement to all CCPs will
help mitigate risks to the U.S. financial system. In light of the Commission’s proposal to expand
the coverage of the “covered clearing agency” definition to all CCPs, the Commission
preliminarily believes it is important to also require that any currently registered CCP or CCP
that may register with the Commission in the future be subject to the same requirement to help
mitigate risks to the U.S. financial system. Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission
preliminarily believes that all active CCPs currently registered with the Commission have
policies and procedures for sensitivity analysis though they may vary in their application.
In addition, in order to improve consistency within the definition of sensitivity analysis,
the Commission is proposing to separate the two elements that appear in current paragraph (i)
into two separate paragraphs and renumber the existing paragraphs accordingly. Thus,
“sensitivity analysis” would mean an analysis that involves analyzing the sensitivity of a model
to its assumptions, parameters, and inputs that (i) considers the impact on the model of both
moderate and extreme changes in a wide range of inputs, parameters, and assumptions, including
correlations of price movements or returns if relevant, which reflect a variety of historical and

45

hypothetical market conditions; (ii) uses actual portfolios and, where applicable, hypothetical
portfolios that reflect the characteristics of proprietary positions and customer positions; (iii)
considers the most volatile relevant periods, where practical, that have been experienced by the
markets served by the clearing agency; and (iv) tests the sensitivity of the model to stressed
market conditions, including the market conditions that may ensue after the default of a member
and other extreme but plausible conditions as defined in a covered clearing agency’s risk
policies. This proposed modification would not alter the meaning or application of the definition
of “sensitivity analysis,” but is designed to improve clarity regarding the number of discrete
elements contained in the definition.
E. Request for Comments
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed amendments to the
definitions of “covered clearing agency,” “central securities depository,” and “sensitivity
analysis” and the proposed definition of “securities settlement system,” including whether the
definitions are sufficiently clear and, if not, how they should be changed. In addition, the
Commission requests comment on the following specific issues. In all cases, responses should be
supported by detailed explanation and analysis and, where possible, empirical evidence.
•

In describing the functions or services of a covered clearing agency as those of a CCP,
CSD, or SSS, has the Commission’s proposal appropriately classified the
functions/services of a covered clearing agency? Are there other clearing agency
functions or services that the Commission should consider including in the definition of
“covered clearing agency?” If so, explain why these functions or services should be
included and how these functions relate to the policy goals and requirements in Rule
17Ad-22(e). In addition, please explain whether any of the clearing agency functions

46

included in the proposed definition of “covered clearing agency” should be excluded and
why such an exclusion is appropriate.
•

Will the proposed approach to expanding the definition of “covered clearing agency”
result in duplicative costs for CCPs, CSDs, and SSSs? If so, what are these costs?

•

Should any of the requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e) be altered as they relate to the
new entities under the proposed expansion of the “covered clearing agency” definition?
Please explain.

•

In referencing a securities depository as described in Section 3(a)(23)(A) of the Exchange
Act, does the proposed definition of “central securities depository” sufficiently describe
the functions of a CSD? Why or why not? What other functions, if any, should be
included in the definition of “central securities depository?”

•

The definition of “central securities depository” would continue to appear in Rule 17Ad22(d)(14). 107 However, as a result of the proposed amendment to the “covered clearing
agency” definition, a registered clearing agency that performs CSD services would be a
covered clearing agency subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e) and would not be subject to the
requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(d). Accordingly, should the Commission modify Rule
17Ad-22(d)(14) in light of the proposed amendments? If so, how should the Commission

107

Rule 17Ad-22(d)(14) requires a registered clearing agency other than a covered clearing
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to institute risk controls, including collateral requirements and limits to cover the
clearing agency’s credit exposure to each participant family exposure fully, that ensure timely
settlement in the event that the participant with the largest payment obligation is unable to settle
when the clearing agency provides CSD services and extends intraday credit to participants. See
17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(14).

47

apply Rule 17Ad-22(d)(14) to a registered clearing agency that is not a covered clearing
agency?
•

Do commenters agree with the proposed definition of “securities settlement system?”
Should there be another definition? If so, why? Does the definition sufficiently describe
the functions of an SSS? Is it sufficiently clear what “according to a set of predetermined
multilateral rules” means? Please provide examples of SSS activities.

•

In light of the proposed amendment to the definition of “sensitivity analysis,” would a
covered clearing agency have to make changes to its policies and procedures for
conducting sensitivity analysis to comply with the new definition? If so, explain the
current policies and procedures of covered clearing agencies relevant to conducting
sensitivity analysis and how they would need to be changed. The Commission also
requests information regarding the anticipated costs of any such changes to policies and
procedures. The Commission also requests information regarding the potential benefits.

III. Economic Analysis
The Commission is sensitive to the economic consequences and effects of the proposed
amendments, including their benefits and costs. Under Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act,
whenever the Commission engages in rulemaking under the Exchange Act and is required to
consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, it must
consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. 108 Further, as noted above, Section 17A of the Exchange Act
directs the Commission, when using its authority to facilitate the establishment of a national

108

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(f).

48

system for clearance and settlement of securities transactions, to have due regard for the public
interest, the protection of investors, the safeguarding of securities and funds, and maintenance of
fair competition among brokers and dealers, clearing agencies, and transfer agents. 109 Section
23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act also prohibits the Commission from adopting any rule that would
impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of
the Exchange Act. 110
The proposed amendments to three definitions in Rule 17Ad-22(a) would generally
expand the scope of registered clearing agencies subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e). The Commission
is proposing to amend the definition of “covered clearing agency” in Rule 17Ad-22(a)(5) by
focusing directly on clearing agency functions. Thus the amended definition of “covered
clearing agency” covers all clearing agencies that provide the services of a CCP, CSD, or SSS.
The Commission is also proposing a conforming amendment to the definition of “central
securities depository services” in Rule 17Ad-22(a)(3), and the Commission is proposing to
amend the definition of “sensitivity analysis” in Rule 17Ad-22(a)(17). As discussed in more
detail below, the Commission preliminarily believes the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad22(a) would cause one additional registered clearing agency to fall within the definition of
“covered clearing agency” and become subject to requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e).
A. Economic Background
The Commission believes that the proposed amendments would support improvements in
risk management at registered clearing agencies not currently subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e) as

109

adopted with respect to systemic risk, as well as with respect to legal, credit, liquidity, general
business, custody, investment, and operational risk.
As noted in the CCA Standards adopting release, registered clearing agencies have
become an essential part of the infrastructure of the U.S. securities markets. 111 While central
clearing generally benefits the markets in which it is available, clearing agencies can pose
substantial risk to the financial system as a whole, due in part to the fact that central clearing
concentrates risk in the clearing agency. Disruption to a clearing agency’s operations, or failure
on the part of a clearing agency to meet its obligations, could therefore serve as a potential
source of contagion, resulting in significant costs not only to the clearing agency itself or its
members but also to other market participants or the broader U.S. financial system. 112 As a

result, proper management of the risks associated with central clearing is necessary to ensure the
stability of the U.S. securities markets and the broader U.S. financial system. The mandate in
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act for central clearing of security-based swaps, wherever possible
and appropriate, further reinforces this need. 113 When a clearing agency provides CCP services,
central clearing replaces bilateral counterparty exposures with exposures against the clearing
agency. Consequently, a move from voluntary clearing to mandatory clearing of security-based
swaps, holding the volume of security-based swap transactions constant, would increase
economic exposures against clearing agencies that centrally clear security-based swaps.
Increased exposures in turn raise the possibility that these clearing agencies may serve as a
transmission mechanism for systemic events.
As the Commission discussed in the CCA Standards adopting release, clearing agencies
have incentives to implement a risk management framework that can effectively manage the
risks posed by central clearing. 114 First, the ongoing viability of a clearing agency depends on its
reputation and the confidence that market participants have in its services. Clearing agencies
therefore have an incentive to reduce the likelihood that a member default or operational outage
would disrupt settlement of a particular transaction or set of transactions. Second, some clearing
agencies operate as member-owned utilities and mutualize default risk across their members, and
thus non-defaulting participants are subject to losses that occur above the defaulter’s margin and
clearing fund. Clearing agencies that operate under such models thus have an economic interest

in sound risk management to reduce the expected level of losses that must be mutualized. Other
clearing agencies are publicly traded and therefore could have different incentives because nonmember-owners have a lower economic stake in the clearing agency than member-owners under
a mutualized structure.
Such an ownership structure could increase the incentive for owners, particularly those
that are non-members, to take risks, though these incentives may be tempered by rules of the
clearing agency that are consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Exchange Act, which
requires that the clearing agency’s rules assure fair representation of its shareholders and
participants in the selection of the clearing agency’s directors and administration of its affairs. 115
Nevertheless, incentives for sound risk management may be tempered by pressures to
reduce costs and maximize profits that are distinct from goals set forth in governing statutes. 116
This tension may result in a clearing agency making decisions that result in tradeoffs between the
costs and benefits of risk management that may not fully reflect the costs and benefits that accrue
to other financial market participants as a result of its decisions. For example, because the
current market to provide central clearing is characterized by high barriers to entry and limited
competition, 117 the market power exercised by clearing agencies in the markets they serve may
reduce incentives to invest in risk management systems. 118 Further, even if clearing agencies do
internalize costs that they impose on their clearing members, they may fail to internalize the

consequences of their risk management decisions on other entities within the financial system
that are connected to them through relationships with their clearing members. 119 Such a failure
represents a financial network externality imposed by clearing agencies on the broader financial
system and suggests that financial stability, as a public good, may be under-produced in
equilibrium.
B. Baseline
In order to perform its analysis of the likely economic effects of the proposed
amendments to Rule 17Ad-22(a), the Commission is using an economic baseline that considers
the current market for clearance and settlement services as it exists at the time of this proposal.
As discussed above, 120 the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed amendment to
the definition of “covered clearing agency” will likely result in one additional registered clearing
agency, ICC, becoming subject to the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e). Further, as discussed
below, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed amendments potentially affect
ICEEU even though the amendment to the definition of “covered clearing agency” will not
change ICEEU’s current status as a covered clearing agency. 121 The Commission’s baseline
therefore includes the two entities in the market for clearance and settlement services – ICC and
ICEEU – that the Commission believes would be affected by the proposed amendments. In
addition to current market practices at these entities, the baseline includes rules adopted by the
Commission, including rules adopted in the CCA Standards adopting release, as well as rules

adopted by other regulators, including those in other jurisdictions to the extent that these rules
affect the cost structure, business and market practices of the above-mentioned entities. The
following section discusses the elements of the baseline that are relevant for the economic
analysis of the proposed amendments.
Pursuant to the adoption of amendments to Rule 17Ad-22, 122 five registered clearing
agencies—DTC, FICC, ICEEU, NSCC and OCC—currently meet the definition of “covered
clearing agency.” Table 1 below provides basic membership statistics for the two clearing
agencies—ICC and ICEEU—that the Commission preliminarily believes would be affected by
the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22(a).

To further assess the economic effects of the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22(a),
including possible effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation, the Commission is
also considering as part of the baseline (i) the current regulatory framework for registered
clearing agencies, and (ii) the current practices of the entities that would be affected by the
proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22(a). Each is discussed further below.

1. Regulatory Framework for Registered Clearing Agencies
As previously discussed, the current regulatory framework for registered clearing
agencies begins with Section 17A of the Exchange Act, which directs the Commission to
facilitate the establishment of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and
settlement of securities transactions and provides for the registration of clearing agencies. 124
Section 19 of the Exchange Act sets forth the general registration requirements for clearing
agencies as SROs, their responsibility as SROs to file proposed rule changes with the
Commission for review and approval, and, in general, the provisions relating to Commission
oversight of SROs. 125 Titles VII and VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act have expanded the
Commission’s role with respect to the regulation of central clearing. Specifically, Title VII
amended Section 17A of the Exchange Act by adding new paragraphs (g) through (j), which
provide the Commission with authority to adopt rules governing security-based swap clearing
agencies. 126 The Clearing Supervision Act, adopted in Title VIII, provides for enhanced
regulation of SIFMUs and, more generally, for enhanced coordination among the Commission,
CFTC, and FRB by facilitating examinations and information sharing. 127 As noted above, on
July 18, 2012, the FSOC designated as SIFMUs five registered clearing agencies. 128
In 2012, the Commission adopted Rule 17Ad-22 under the Exchange Act to strengthen
the substantive regulation of registered clearing agencies, promote the safe and reliable operation

of registered clearing agencies, and improve efficiency, transparency, and access to registered
clearing agencies. 129 In its economic analysis of the Clearing Agency Standards release, the
Commission noted that the economic characteristics of clearing agencies, including economies of
scale, barriers to entry, and the particulars of their legal mandates, may limit competition and
confer market power on such clearing agencies, which may lead to lower levels of service,
higher prices, or under-investment in risk management systems. 130 To address these potential
market failures, Rule 17Ad-22 was adopted to strengthen the substantive regulation of clearing
agencies, promote the safe and reliable operation of clearing agencies, improve efficiency,
transparency, and access to clearing agencies, and promote consistency with international
standards. 131
Today, the Commission adopted amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and new Rule 17Ab2-2.
Rule 17Ad-22(a)(5) provides the definition of “covered clearing agency,” and Rule 17Ad-22(e)
establishes standards for the operation and governance of registered clearing agencies that meet
the definition of a covered clearing agency. Rule 17Ab2-2 provides a process by which the
Commission may determine or rescind past determinations about, whether a covered clearing
agency is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions, and whether any of the activities of a
clearing agency providing CCP services, including clearing agencies registered with the
Commission for the purpose of clearing security-based swaps, have a more complex risk
profile. 132

56

Finally, efforts by the CFTC to adopt rules that are consistent with the PFMI are also
relevant to the economic analysis of the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22(a). 133 The
CFTC has issued rules for derivatives clearing organizations and systemically important
derivatives clearing organizations (“SIDCOs”) which it indicated are intended to be consistent
with the PFMI. 134 ICC, the registered clearing agency that the Commission anticipates will fall
into the revised covered clearing agency definition, is a clearing agency registered with the
Commission that is also supervised by the CFTC as a SIDCO under subpart C of Part 39 of the
Commodity Exchange Act.
2. Current Practices
Current industry practices are a critical element of the economic baseline for registered
clearing agencies. Registered clearing agencies must operate in compliance with Rule 17Ad-22,
though they may vary in the particular ways they achieve such compliance. Some variation in
practices across registered clearing agencies derives from the products they clear and the markets
they serve.
As discussed above, 135 the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed revision
to Rule 17Ad-22(a) will likely result in one additional registered clearing agency, ICE Clear
Credit, falling within the definition of covered clearing agency. Further, the Commission
preliminarily believes that the proposed amendments may affect ICE Clear Europe (ICEEU)
even though these amendments will not change ICEEU’s current status as a covered clearing

agency. 136 An overview of the current practices of these entities is set forth below and includes
discussion of clearing agency policies and procedures regarding general organization and risk
management, including the management of legal, credit, liquidity, business, custody, investment,
and operational risk. This discussion is intended solely for the purpose of analyzing the
economic effects of the proposed amendments and is based on the Commission’s general
understanding of current practices as of the date of this proposal, informed by information
published by registered clearing agencies, as well as the Commission’s experience supervising
registered clearing agencies.
a. General Organization
i. Legal Risk
Legal risk is the risk that a registered clearing agency’s rules, policies, or procedures may
not be enforceable and concerns, among other things, its contracts, the rights of members, netting
arrangements, discharge of obligations, and settlement finality. Cross-border activities of a
registered clearing agency may also present elements of legal risk.
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(1) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for a wellfounded, transparent, and enforceable legal framework for each aspect of its activities in all
relevant jurisdictions. 137 Each registered clearing agency makes a large portion of these policies
and procedures available to members and participants. In addition, each also publishes their rule

58

books and other key procedures publicly in order to promote the transparency of their legal
framework. 138
ii. Governance
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(8) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to have governance
arrangements that are clear and transparent to fulfill the public interest requirements in Section
17A of the Exchange Act applicable to clearing agencies, to support the objectives of owners and
participants, and to promote the effectiveness of the clearing agency’s risk management
procedures. 139 Important elements of a registered clearing agency’s governance arrangements
include its ownership structure; its charter, bylaws, and charters for committees of its board and
management committees; its rules, policies, and procedures; the composition and role of its
board, including the structure and role of board committees; reporting lines between
management and the board; and the processes that provide for management accountability with
respect to the registered clearing agency’s performance.
Each registered clearing agency has a board that governs its operations and supervises
senior management. Each registered clearing agency also has an independent audit committee of
the board and has established a board committee or committee of members tasked with
overseeing the clearing agency’s risk management functions.
iii. Amended Framework for the Comprehensive Management
of Risks
138

The rule book of each registered clearing agency, as well as select policies and
procedures, are publicly available on each registered clearing agency’s website.
139

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(8); see also Clearing Agency Standards adopting release,
supra note 31, at 66251–52.

59

Rules 17Ad-22(b) and (d) require registered clearing agencies to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to measure and
mitigate credit exposures, identify operational risks, evaluate risks arising in connection with
cross-border and domestic links for the purpose of clearing or settling trades, achieve DVP
settlement, and implement risk controls to cover the clearing agency’s credit exposures to
participants. 140 Rule 17Ad-22(d)(4) requires a registered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
establish business continuity plans setting forth procedures for the recovery of operations in the
event of a disruption. 141 Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11) further requires a registered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to make key aspects of the clearing agency’s default procedures publicly available and establish
default procedures that ensure that the clearing agency can take timely action to contain losses
and liquidity pressures and to continue meeting its obligations in the event of a participant
default. 142
In addition to meeting these requirements, the Commission understands that registered
clearing agencies also specify actions to be taken when their resources are insufficient to cover

losses faced by the registered clearing agency. 143 These actions may include assessment rights
on clearing members, forced allocation, and contract termination.
b. Financial Risk Management
Registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services have a variety of options
available to mitigate the financial risks to which they are exposed. While the manner in which a
CCP chooses to mitigate these financial risks depends on the precise nature of the CCP’s
obligations, a common set of procedures have been implemented by many CCPs to manage
credit and liquidity risks. Broadly, these procedures enable CCPs to manage their risks by
reducing the likelihood of member defaults, limiting potential losses and liquidity pressure in the
event of a member default, implementing mechanisms that allocate losses across members, and
providing adequate resources to cover losses and meet payment obligations as required.
Registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services must be able to effectively
measure their credit exposures in order to properly manage those exposures. A CCP faces the
risk that its exposure to a member can change as a result of a change in prices, positions, or both.
CCPs can ascertain current credit exposures to each member by, in some cases, marking each
member’s outstanding contracts to current market prices and, to the extent permitted by their
rules and supported by law, by netting any gains against any losses. Rule 17Ad-22 includes
certain requirements related to financial risk management by CCPs, including requirements to
measure credit exposures to members and to use margin requirements to limit these exposures.
These requirements are general in nature and provide registered clearing agencies flexibility to

61

measure credit risk and set margin. Within the bounds of Rule 17Ad-22, CCPs may employ
models and choose parameters that they conclude are appropriate to the markets they serve.
The current practices of registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services generally
include the following procedures: (1) measuring credit exposures at least once a day; (2) setting
margin coverage at a 99% confidence level over some set period; (3) using risk-based models;
(4) establishing a fund that mutualizes losses of defaults by one or more participants that exceed
margin coverage; (5) maintaining sufficient financial resources to withstand the default of at
least the largest participant family, 144 and (6), in the case of security-based swap transactions,
maintaining enough financial resources to be able to withstand the default of their two largest
participant families. 145

i. Credit Risk
Rule 17Ad-22(b)(1) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to measure their credit exposures at least once per day. 146 Several CCPs have policies and
procedures designed to require measuring credit exposures multiple times per day.
Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to maintain sufficient financial resources to withstand, at a minimum, a default by the participant
family to which it has the largest exposure in extreme but plausible market conditions. 147 It
further requires CCPs for security-based swaps to establish, implement, maintain and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain additional financial resources
sufficient to withstand, at a minimum, a default by the two participant families to which it has
the largest exposures in extreme but plausible market conditions, in its capacity as a CCP for
security-based swaps. 148 Accordingly, the Commission notes that Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3) imposes a
“cover two” requirement on CCPs for security-based swaps in order to protect such CCPs from
the extreme jump-to-default risk and nonlinear payoffs associated with the nature of the financial
products they clear and the participants in the markets they serve. Meanwhile, CCPs that clear

products other than security-based swaps are subject to a “cover one” requirement. 149 Rule
17Ad-22(b)(3) also states that such policies and procedures may provide that additional financial
resources be maintained by the CCP in combined or separately maintained funds. 150
Under existing rules, CCPs collect contributions from their members for the purpose of
establishing guaranty or clearing funds to mutualize losses under extreme but plausible market
conditions. Currently, the guaranty funds or clearing funds consist of liquid assets and their sizes
vary depending on a number of factors, including the products the CCP clears and the
characteristics of CCP members. In particular, the guaranty funds for CCPs that clear securitybased swaps are relatively larger, as measured by the size of the fund as a percentage of the total
and largest exposures, than the guaranty or clearing funds maintained by CCPs for other
financial instruments. CCPs generally take the liquidity of collateral into account when
determining member obligations. Applying haircuts to assets posted as margin, among other
things, mitigates the liquidity risk associated with selling margin assets in the event of a
participant default.
ICC recently modified its policies and procedures related to stress testing frameworks
indicating that the modifications were designed to ensure that it meets regulatory requirements
under Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3). 151

64

Rule 17Ad-22(b)(2) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to use margin requirements to limit their exposures to participants. 152 This margin can also be
used to reduce a CCP’s losses in the event of a participant default.
Registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services take positions as substituted
counterparties once their trade guarantee goes into effect. Therefore, if a counterparty whose
obligations the registered clearing agency has guaranteed defaults, the covered clearing agency
may face market risk, which can take one of two forms. First, a covered clearing agency is
subject to the risk of movement in the market prices of the defaulting member’s open positions.
Where a seller defaults and fails to deliver a security, the covered clearing agency may need to
step into the market to buy the security in order to complete settlement and deliver the security to
the buyer. Similarly, where a buyer defaults, the covered clearing agency may need to meet
payment obligations to the seller. Thus, in the interval between when a member defaults and
when the covered clearing agency must meet its obligations as a substituted counterparty in order
to complete settlement, market price movements expose the covered clearing agency to market
risk. Second, the covered clearing agency may need to liquidate non-cash margin collateral
posted by the defaulting member. The covered clearing agency is therefore exposed to the risk
that erosion in market prices of the collateral posted by the defaulting member could result in the
covered clearing agency having insufficient financial resources to cover the losses in the
defaulting member’s open positions.
To manage their exposure to market risk resulting from fulfilling a defaulting member’s
obligations, registered clearing agencies compute margin requirements using inputs such as
152

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(2).

65

portfolio size, volatility, and sensitivity to various risk factors that are likely to influence security
prices. Moreover, since the size of price movements is, in part, a function of time, registered
clearing agencies may limit their exposure to market risk by marking participant positions to
market daily and, in some cases, more frequently. CCPs also use similar factors to determine
haircuts applied to assets posted by members in satisfaction of margin requirements. To manage
market risk associated with collateral liquidation, CCPs consider the current prices of assets
posted as collateral and price volatility, asset liquidity, and the correlation of collateral assets and
a member’s portfolio of open positions. Further, because CCPs need to value their margin assets
in times of financial stress, their rulebooks may include features such as market-maker
domination charges that increase clearing fund obligations regarding open positions of members
in securities in which the member serves as a dominant market maker. The reasoning behind this
charge is that, should a member default, liquidity in products in which the member makes
markets may fall, leaving these positions more difficult to liquidate for non-defaulting
participants.
Rule 17Ab-22(b)(2) also requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services
to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to provide for risk-based models and parameters to set margin requirements. 153 The
generally recognized standard for such models and parameters is, under normal market
conditions, price movements that produce changes in exposures that are expected to breach
margin requirements or other risk controls only 1% of the time (i.e., at a 99% confidence
interval) over a designated time horizon. 154 Currently, CCPs use margin models to ensure
153

See id.

154

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(a)(4).
66

coverage at a single-tailed 99% confidence interval. Losses beyond this level are typically
covered by the CCP’s guaranty fund. This standard comports with existing international
standards for bank capital requirements, which require banks to measure market risks at a 99%
confidence interval when determining regulatory capital requirements. 155
Rule 17Ad-22(b)(2) also requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services
to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to review such margin requirements and the related risk-based models and parameters
at least monthly. 156 CCPs are accordingly required to establish a model validation process that
evaluates the adequacy of margin models, parameters, and assumptions. Additionally, CCPs are
required to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to provide for an annual model validation consisting of evaluating the

Mortgage Mkts, Sept. 1998), available at
http://www.freddiemac.com/finance/smm/july98/pdfs/hen_hirt.pdf.
Prior to this standard, banks measured value-at-risk using a range of confidence intervals
from 90–99%. See BCBS, An Internal Model-Based Approach to Market Risk Capital
Requirements, at 12 (Apr. 1995), available at http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs17.pdf. When
determining the minimum quantitative standards for calculating risk measurements, the BCBS
noted then the importance of specifying “a common and relatively conservative confidence
level,” choosing the 99% confidence interval over other less conservative measures. See id.
Since its adoption in 1998, the standard has become a generally recognized practice of
banks to quantify credit risk as the worst expected loss that a portfolio might incur over an
appropriate time horizon at a 99% confidence interval. See Kenji Nishiguchi, Hiroshi Kawai &
Takanori Sazaki, Capital Allocation and Bank Management Based on the Quantification of
Credit Risk, at 83 (FRBNY Econ. Policy Rev., Oct. 1998), available at

performance of the CCPs’ margin models and the related parameters and assumptions associated
with such models by a qualified person who is free from influence from the persons responsible
for the development or operation of the models being validated. 157
To meet resource requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3), 158 ICC recently adjusted its
risk calculations and models to account for accumulation of wrong-way risk at the portfolio
level. 159
iii. Liquidity Risk
In addition to credit risk and the aforementioned market risk, registered clearing agencies
also face liquidity or funding risk. Currently, covered clearing agencies have varying degrees of
formality with respect to their standards and practices relating to liquidity shortfalls. To
complete the settlement process, registered clearing agencies that employ netting rely on
incoming payments from participants in net debit positions in order to make payments to
participants in net credit positions. If a participant does not have sufficient funds or securities in
the form required to fulfill a payment obligation immediately when due (even though it may be
able to pay at some future time), or if a settlement bank is unable to make an incoming payment
on behalf of a participant, a registered clearing agency may face a funding shortfall. Such
funding shortfalls may occur due to a lack of financial resources necessary to meet delivery or
payment obligations, however even registered clearing agencies that do hold sufficient financial

68

resources to meet their obligations may not carry those in the form required for delivery or
payments to participants.
A registered clearing agency that provides CCP services may hold additional financial
resources to cover potential funding shortfalls in the form of collateral. As noted above, CCPs
may take the liquidity of collateral into account when determining member obligations.
Applying haircuts to illiquid assets posted as margin mitigates the liquidity risk associated with
selling margin assets in the event of participant default. Some registered CCPs also arrange for
liquidity provision from other financial institutions using lines of credit. Additionally, some
registered clearing agencies enter into prearranged funding agreements with their members
pursuant to their rules. For example, members of one registered clearing agency are obligated to
enter into repurchase agreements against securities that would have been delivered to a
defaulting member.
ICC has disclosed a liquidity management program that includes stress testing of liquidity
requirements to meet settlement obligations over a range of different horizons under extreme but
plausible market conditions. 160 ICC also reports that its liquidity resources include cash, U.S.
Treasury securities, and committed repurchase agreements. 161
c. Settlement
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(5) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to employ money
settlement arrangements that eliminate or strictly limit the clearing agency’s settlement bank

160

See ICE Clear Credit Disclosure Framework, note 145 supra, at 18.

161

69

risks and require funds transfers to the clearing agency to be final when effected. 162 Rule 17Ad22(d)(12) further requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that final settlement
occurs no later than the end of the settlement day. 163 Accordingly, for example, certain
registered clearing agencies have policies and procedures that provide for final settlement of
securities transfers no later than the end of the day of the transaction. Rule 17Ad-22(d)(15) also
requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to state to its participants the clearing agency’s
obligations with respect to physical deliveries and identify and manage the risks from these
obligations. 164
d. CSDs and Exchange-of-Value Settlement Systems
i. CSDs
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(10) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CSD services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to maintain securities in an immobilized or dematerialized form for transfer by book entry to the
greatest extent possible. Currently, some securities, such as mutual fund securities and
government securities, are issued primarily or solely on a dematerialized basis. Dematerialized
shares do not exist as physical certificates but are held in book entry form in the name of the
owner (which, where the master security holder file is not maintained on paper due to the use of
technology, is also referred to as electronic custody). Other types of securities may be issued in
162

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(5).

163

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(12).

164

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(15).

70

the form of one or more physical security certificates, which could be held by the CSD to
facilitate immobilization. Alternatively, securities may be held by the beneficial owner in record
name, in the form of book-entry positions, where the issuer offers the ability for a security holder
to hold through the direct registration system. Whether immobilization occurs at the CSD or
through direct registration depends on what is provided for by the issuer.
When a trade occurs, the depository’s accounting system credits one participant account
and debits another participant account. Transactions between counterparties in dematerialized
shares are recorded by the registrar responsible for maintaining the paper or electronic register of
security holders, such as by a transfer agent, and reflected in customer accounts.
Registered CSDs currently reconcile ownership positions in securities against CSD
ownership positions on the security holders list daily, mitigating the risk of unauthorized creation
or deletion of shares.
ii. Exchange-of-Value Settlement Systems
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(13) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to eliminate principal
risk by linking securities transfers to funds transfers in a way that achieves delivery versus
payment, 165 which serves to link obligations by conditioning the final settlement of one upon the
final settlement of the other. One registered clearing agency, for example, operates a Model 2
DVP system that provides for gross securities transfers during the day followed by an end-of-day
net funds settlement. Under the rules governing the clearing agency’s system, the delivering
party in a DVP transaction is assured that it will be paid for the securities once they are credited
165

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(13); see also Clearing Agency Standards adopting release,
supra note 31, at 66256.

71

to the receiving party’s securities account. DVP eliminates the risk that a buyer would lose the
purchase price of a security purchased from a defaulting seller or that a seller would lose the sold
security without receiving payment for a security acquired by a defaulting buyer.
For example, one registered clearing agency has rules governing its continuous net
settlement (“CNS”) system, under which it becomes the counterparty for settlement purposes at
the point its trade guarantee attaches, thereby assuming the obligation of its members that are
receiving securities to receive and pay for those securities, and the obligation of members that
are delivering securities to make the delivery. Unless the clearing agency has invoked its default
rules, it is not obligated to make those deliveries until it receives from members with delivery
obligations deliveries of such securities; rather, deliveries that come into CNS ordinarily are
promptly redelivered to parties that are entitled to receive them through an allocation algorithm.
Members are obligated to take and pay for securities allocated to them in the CNS process.
These rules also provide mechanisms to allow receiving members a right to receive high priority
in the allocation of deliveries, and also permit a member to buy-in long positions that have not
been delivered to it by the close of business on the scheduled settlement date.
e. Default Management
i. Participant-Default Rules and Procedures
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to make key aspects of
its default procedures publicly available and establish default procedures that ensure it can take
timely action to contain losses and liquidity pressures and to continue meeting its obligations in
the event of a participant default. The rules of registered clearing agencies typically state what
constitutes a default, identify whether the board or a committee of the board may make that

72

determination, and describe what steps the clearing agency may take to protect itself and its
members. In this regard, registered clearing agencies typically attempt, among other things, to
hedge and liquidate a defaulting member’s positions. Rules of registered clearing agencies also
include information about the allocation of losses across available financial resources. The
registered clearing agency the Commission anticipates will fall within the definition of covered
clearing agency as a result of the proposed amendments conduct testing of its default procedures
at least annually, including participation by clearing members.
ii. Segregation and Portability
No rule under the Exchange Act currently requires a registered clearing agency through
its written policies and procedures to enable the portability of positions of a member’s customers
and the collateral provided in connection therewith. Additionally, no rule under the Exchange
Act currently requires a registered clearing agency through its written policies and procedures to
protect the positions of a member’s customers from the default or insolvency of the member. 166
ICC maintains rules and procedures that facilitate the segregation and portability of
positions of a clearing member’s customers and the collateral provided to it with respect to those
positions. 167 ICC’s rules are designed to comply with the CFTC’s requirements addressing
custody, segregation, and investment of customer margin provided in respect of cleared swaps.
ICC thus segregates customer funds pursuant to the “legally segregated, operationally

166

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 189–193 (discussing existing rules
applicable to registered broker-dealers that address customer security positions and funds in cash
securities and listed option markets, thereby promoting segregation and portability at the brokerdealer level).
167

See ICE Clear Credit Disclosure Framework, supra note 145, at 26.

73

commingled” (“LSOC”) model found under Part 22 of the CFTC Regulations. 168 Under the
LSOC model if a customer defaults, ICC may apply clearing member funds and defaulting
customer funds to cover losses, but may not use collateral provided by non-defaulting customers.
Additionally, under ICC rules, each clearing member that carries customer positions must, upon
request of a customer, transfer or novate that customers position to one or more other clearing
members designated by the customer, subject to the consent of the transferee; satisfaction by the
customer of any margin requirements imposed by the transferor on any positions remaining at
the transferor; and the completion of all required transfer documentation. 169
f. General Business and Operational Risk Management
i. General Business Risk
Business risk refers to the risks and potential losses arising from a registered clearing
agency’s administration and operation as a business enterprise that are neither related to member
default nor separately covered by financial resources designated to mitigate credit or liquidity
risk. While Rule 17Ad-22 sets forth requirements for registered clearing agencies to identify,
monitor, and mitigate or eliminate a broad array of risks through written policies and procedures,
no rule under the Exchange Act expressly requires a registered clearing agency through its
written policies and procedures to identify, monitor, and manage general business risk or to meet
a capital requirement. Registered clearing agencies currently have certain internal controls in
place to mitigate business risk. Some clearing agencies, for instance, have policies and
procedures that identify an auditor who is responsible for examining accounts, records, and
transactions, as well as other duties prescribed in the audit program. Other registered clearing
168

See id.

169

See id.

74

agencies allow members to collectively audit the books of the clearing agency on an annual
basis, at their own expense.
ICC maintains financial resources that, pursuant to regulation as a SIDCO by the
CFTC, 170 are sufficient to cover twelve months of operating costs. 171 ICC has publicly stated its
belief that an orderly wind-down of its business would take between six and twelve months. 172
ii. Custody and Investment Risks
Registered clearing agencies face default risk from commercial banks that they use to
effect money transfers among participants, to hold overnight deposits, and to safeguard
collateral. Rule 17Ad-22(d)(3) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to (i) hold assets in a
manner that minimizes risk of loss or delay in its access to them; and (ii) invest assets in
instruments with minimal credit, market, and liquidity risks. 173 Registered clearing agencies
currently seek to minimize the risk of loss or delay in access by holding assets that are highly
liquid (e.g., cash, U.S. Treasury securities, or securities issued by a U.S. government agency) and
by engaging banks to custody the assets and facilitate settlement. Typically, registered clearing
agencies take steps to ensure that assets held in custody are protected from claims from the
custodian’s creditors using trust accounts or equivalent arrangements. Additionally, designated
clearing agencies may have access to credit at a Federal Reserve Bank or other relevant central

170

bank, to the extent such services are not already available as the result of other laws and
regulations. 174
ICC’s Treasury Operations Policies and Procedures provide for the use of a Federal
Reserve Account, the use of a committed repurchase facility and outside investment managers to
invest guarantee fund and margin cash. 175
iii. Operational Risk
Operational risk refers to a broad category of potential losses arising from deficiencies in
internal processes, personnel, and information technology. Registered clearing agencies face
operational risk from both internal and external sources, including human error, system failures,
security breaches, and natural or man-made disasters. Rule 17Ad-22(d)(4) requires a registered
clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to identify sources of operational risk and to minimize those risks through
the development of appropriate systems, controls and procedures. 176 It also requires a registered
clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to (i) implement systems that are reliable and secure, and have adequate,
scalable capacity; and (ii) have business continuity plans that allow for timely recovery of
operations and fulfillment of a clearing agency’s obligations. 177

174

As a result, registered clearing agencies have developed and currently maintain plans to
ensure the safeguarding of securities and funds, the integrity of automated data processing
systems, and the recovery of securities, funds, or data under a variety of loss or destruction
scenarios. 178 These plans may include turning operations over to a secondary site that is located
a sufficient distance from the primary location to ensure a distinct geographic risk profile. In
addition, registered clearing agencies generally maintain an internal audit department to review
the adequacy of their internal controls, procedures, and records with respect to operational risks.
Some registered clearing agencies also engage independent accountants to perform an annual
study and evaluation of the internal controls relating to their operations. 179
The Commission adopted Regulation SCI in November 2014, in part, to reduce the
occurrence of systems issues, and enhance resiliency when systems problems do occur at certain
SROs, such as registered clearing agencies. In particular, Regulation SCI requires that clearance
and settlement systems be designed to accomplish end-of-day settlement on the day of a widescale disruption. Accordingly, Regulation SCI requires registered clearing agencies to have
policies and procedures in place for business continuity as well as disaster recovery plans that
include maintaining sufficiently resilient and geographically diverse backup and recovery
capabilities that are reasonably designed to achieve two-hour resumption of critical SCI systems
following a wide-scale disruption. 180
178

Many of these practices had been previously developed pursuant to other Commission
requirements. See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 19–21, 181–182, 294–295
(discussing related requirements under Regulation SCI).

g. Access
i. Access and Participation Requirements
Rule 17Ad-22(b)(5) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to provide the opportunity for a person that does not perform any dealer or security-based swap
dealer services to obtain membership on fair and reasonable terms at the clearing agency to clear
securities for itself or on behalf of other persons. 181 Rule 17Ad-22(b)(6) requires a registered
clearing agency that provides CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to have membership standards that do not require
participants to maintain a portfolio of any minimum size or a minimum transaction volume. 182
Rule 17Ad-22(b)(7) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to provide a person that maintains net capital equal or greater than $50 million with the ability to
obtain membership at the clearing agency, provided such persons are able to comply with
reasonable membership standards, with higher net capital requirements permissible subject to
Commission approval. 183
In addition, Rule 17Ad-22(d)(2) requires a registered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require
participants to have sufficient financial resources and robust operational capacity to meet
obligations arising from participation in the clearing agency, have procedures in place to monitor
181

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(5).

78

that participation requirements are met on an ongoing basis, and have participation requirements
that are objective and publicly disclosed, and permit fair and open access. 184 Typically, a
registered clearing agency’s rulebook requires applicants for membership to provide certain
financial and operational information prior to being admitted as a member and on an ongoing
basis as a condition of continuing membership. Registered clearing agencies review this
information to ensure that the applicant has the operational capability to meet the other demands
of interfacing with the clearing agency. In particular, registered clearing agencies typically
require that an applicant demonstrate that it has adequate personnel capable of handling
transactions with the clearing agency and adequate physical facilities, books and records, and
procedures to fulfill its anticipated commitments to, and to meet the operational requirements of,
the clearing agency and other members with necessary promptness and accuracy. As a result, an
applicant needs to demonstrate that it has adequate personnel capable of handling transactions
with the clearing agency and adequate physical facilities, books and records, and procedures to
conform to conditions or requirements in these areas that the clearing agency reasonably may
deem necessary for its protection. Registered clearing agencies have published these
requirements on their websites.
Registered clearing agencies use an ongoing monitoring process to help them understand
relevant changes in the financial condition of their members and to mitigate credit risk exposure
of the clearing agency to its members. The risk management staff analyzes financial statements
filed with regulators, as well as information obtained from other SROs and gathered from
various financial publications, so that the clearing agency may evaluate, for instance, whether

184

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(2).

79

members maintain sufficient financial resources and robust operational capacity to meet their
obligations as participants in the clearing agency pursuant to existing Rule 17Ad-22(d)(2)(i).
Table 1 contains membership statistics for the registered clearing agencies likely to be
affected by the proposed rule amendment. 185 Current membership generally reflects features of
cleared markets. The decision to become a clearing member depends on the products being
cleared, the structure of these asset markets as well as the current state of regulation for cleared
markets.
ii. Tiered Participation Arrangements
Tiered participation arrangements occur when clearing members (direct participants)
provide access to clearing services to third parties (indirect participants). No rule under the
Exchange Act currently requires a registered clearing agency through its written policies and
procedures to identify, monitor, and manage material risks arising from tiered participation
arrangements. The Commission understands, however, that certain registered clearing agencies
have policies and procedures currently in place in order to identify, monitor, or manage such
arrangements. Specifically, such clearing agencies rely on information gathered from, and
distributed by, direct participants in order to manage these tiered participation arrangements. For
example, under some covered clearing agencies’ rules, direct participants generally have the
responsibility to indicate to the clearing agency whether a transaction submitted for clearing
represents a proprietary or customer position. Such rules further require direct participants to
calculate, and notify the clearing agency of the value of, each customer’s collateral. Direct
participants also communicate with indirect participants regarding the clearing agency’s margin
and other requirements.
185

See supra Part III.B.

80

ICC does not currently have tiered participation arrangements. 186
iii. Links
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(7) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to evaluate the
potential sources of risks that can arise when the clearing agency establishes links either crossborder or domestically to clear or settle trades, and ensure that the risks are managed prudently
on an ongoing basis. 187
Each registered clearing agency is linked to other clearing organizations, trading
platforms, and service providers. For instance, a link between U.S. and Canadian clearing
agencies allows U.S. members to clear and settle valued securities transactions with participants
of a Canadian securities depository. The link is designed to facilitate cross-border transactions
by allowing members to use a single depository interface for U.S. and Canadian dollar
transactions and eliminate the need for split inventories. 188 Registered clearing agencies that
provide CCP services currently establish links to allow members to realize collateral and other
operational efficiencies. ICC does not offer inter-operability links with other CCPs.

agency to be cost-effective in meeting the requirements of participants while maintaining safe
and secure operations. 189 Registered clearing agencies have procedures to control costs and to
regularly review pricing levels against operating costs. These clearing agencies may use a
formal budgeting process to control expenditures, and may review pricing levels against their
costs of operation during the annual budget process. Registered clearing agencies also analyze
workflows in order to make recommendations to improve their operating efficiency.
ii. Communication Procedures and Standards
Although no rule under the Exchange Act expressly requires a registered clearing agency
through its written policies and procedures to use or accommodate relevant internationally
accepted communication procedures and standards, the Commission believes that registered
clearing agencies already use these standards. Registered clearing agencies typically rely on
electronic communication with market participants, including members. For example, some
registered clearing agencies have rules in place stating that clearing members must retrieve
instructions, notices, reports, data, and other items and information from the clearing agency
through electronic data retrieval systems. Some registered clearing agencies have the ability to
rely on signatures transmitted, recorded, or stored through electronic, optical, or similar means.
Other clearing agencies have policies and procedures that provide for certain emergency
meetings using telephonic or other electronic notice.
i. Transparency
Transparency requirements and disclosures by registered clearing agencies serve to limit
the size of potential information asymmetries between registered clearing agencies, their
members, and market participants. Rule 17Ad-22(d)(9) requires a registered clearing agency to
189

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(6).

82

establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to provide market participants with sufficient information for them to identify and evaluate risks
and costs associated with using the clearing agency’s services. 190 Information regarding the
operations and services of each registered clearing agency can be viewed publicly either on the
clearing agency’s website or a website maintained by an affiliate of the clearing agency.
Because registered clearing agencies are SROs, 191 they must file with the Commission any
proposed rule or any proposed change, in addition to, or deletion from its rules, and the
Commission reviews all proposed rule changes and publishes them for comment. 192
Besides providing market participants with information on the risks and costs associated
with their services, registered clearing agencies regularly provide information to their members
to assist them in managing their risk exposures and potential funding obligations. Some of these
disclosures may be common to all members—such as information about the composition of
clearing fund assets—while other disclosures that concern particular positions or obligations may
only be made to individual members.
As required by CFTC regulations, 193 ICC completes and publicly discloses its responses
to the Disclosure Framework for Financial Market Infrastructures published by the CPMIIOSCO. Besides a principle-by-principle narrative disclosure describing the registered clearing
agency’s approach to observing the PFMI, the public disclosure also includes an executive
summary, a summary of major changes since the last update of the disclosure, and a general

C. Consideration of Benefits, Costs, and the Effect on Competition, Efficiency, and
Capital Formation
The discussion below sets forth the potential economic effects stemming from the
proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22(a) and considers the effects of the rules on efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. The aggregate economic effects arising from the proposed
amendments arise from two sources, the proposed amendments’ likely effects on existing
registered clearing agencies and the proposed amendments’ likely effects on clearing agencies
that may register with the Commission in the future. In this section, we consider the potential
benefits, costs, and likely effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation that may arise
from these two sources separately. As discussed below, the Commission acknowledges that,
when viewed in isolation, the economic effects related to existing registered clearing agencies
are likely to be low in magnitude. Nevertheless, when taken together with the economic effects
related to future registrants, the Commission preliminarily believes that the economic effects of
the proposed amendments could be substantial, particularly insofar as they subject future
registrants that are CCPs, CSDs, and SSSs, and are thus likely to play critical roles in the
clearance and settlement system, to the enhanced requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e).
1. Economic Effects Related to Registered Clearing Agencies
As noted above, the Commission anticipates that, as a result of the proposed amendments
to Rule 17Ad-22(a), one additional registered clearing agency, ICC, would meet the definition of
194

See ICE Clear Credit Disclosure Framework, supra note 145, at 2.

84

covered clearing agency. The Commission preliminarily believes that the addition of ICC as a
covered clearing agency will incrementally extend the systemic benefits of risk management
discussed in the CCA Standards adopting release. These benefits consist of improved financial
stability, 195 a reduction in the ambiguity associated with holding cleared assets in the presence of
credit and settlement risk, and a reduction in market fragmentation arising from different
requirements across regulatory regimes. 196 The Commission preliminarily believes that the
extension of these benefits will likely be incremental and only appear to the extent that the
proposed amendments would result in changes to ICC policies and procedures because, as
mentioned above, ICC is also regulated as a SIDCO by the CFTC 197 and because Rule 17Ad22(e) is consistent with comparable regulatory provisions adopted by the CFTC. 198 The
following section attempts to estimate particular benefits that could accrue to ICC and its
members as a result of ICC being more likely to qualify as a QCCP under the proposed rules. 199
The sections that follow also discuss the costs and the effect on efficiency, competition and
capital formation of ICC becoming a covered clearing agency.

The BCBS capital framework, as well as the rules adopted by the FRB and Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency consistent with that framework, applies lower risk weights of two or
four percent to indirect exposures of banks to QCCPs. See Capital Requirements for Bank
Exposures to Central Counterparties (Apr. 2014), available at
http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs282.pdf (“BCBS capital framework”); See also Regulatory Capital
Rules: Regulatory Capital, Implementation of Basel III, Capital Adequacy, Transition
Provisions, Prompt Corrective Action, Standardized Approach for Risk-weighted Assets, Market
Discipline and Disclosure Requirements, Advanced Approaches Risk-Based Capital Rule, and
Market Risk Capital Rule, 76 FR 62017, 62099 (Oct. 11, 2013), at 62103.

85

a. Benefits
Pursuant to the proposed amendments ICC will be more likely to qualify as a QCCP with
respect to cleared security-based swap transactions in non-U.S. jurisdictions that have adopted
the BCBS capital framework’s QCCP definition. Under the BCBS capital framework, a QCCP is
defined as an entity operating as a CCP that is prudentially supervised in a jurisdiction where the
relevant regulator has established, and publicly indicated that it applies to the CCP on an ongoing
basis, domestic rules and regulations that are consistent with the PFMI. Because Rule 17Ad22(e) is consistent with the PFMI, the Commission preliminarily believes that foreign bank
clearing members as well as foreign banks clearing indirectly through clearing members of ICC
may benefit from its qualification as a QCCP. In particular ICC’s qualification as a QCCP
would result in its foreign bank clearing members and foreign bank indirect participants facing
lower capital requirements with respect to cleared security-based swap transactions because,
under the BCBS capital framework, capital requirements for bank exposures to QCCPs are lower
than capital requirements for bank exposures to non-qualifying CCPs for these products.
Moreover, ICC’s non-U.S. bank clearing members may experience lower capital requirements
with respect to cleared security-based swap transactions relative to the baseline in which foreign
banking regulators do not determine ICC to be a QCCP.

200

The BCBS capital framework affects capital requirements for bank exposures to central
counterparties in two important ways. The first relates to trade exposures, defined under the
BCBS capital framework as the current and potential future exposure of a clearing member or
indirect participant in a CCP arising from OTC derivatives, exchange-traded derivatives
200

The Commission notes that benefits to bank clearing members may be contingent upon
regulators in other jurisdictions taking action to recognize the QCCP status of the registered
clearing agency that will become a covered clearing agency due to the proposed amendments.

86

transactions, and securities financing transactions. If these exposures are held against a QCCP,
they will be assigned a risk weight of 2%. In contrast, exposures against non-qualifying CCPs
do not receive lower capital requirements relative to bilateral exposures and are assigned risk
weights between 20% and 100%, depending on counterparty credit risk. Second, the BCBS
capital framework imposes a cap on risk weights applied to default fund contributions, limiting
risk-weighted assets (subject to a 1250% risk weight) to a cap of 20% of a clearing member’s
trade exposures against a QCCP. This is in contrast to treatment of exposures against nonqualifying CCPs, which are uncapped and subject to a 1250% risk weight. Because QCCP status
generally impacts capital treatment, any benefits of ICC attaining QCCP status will likely accrue
at least in part, to its foreign clearing members or its foreign indirect participants subject to the
BCBS capital framework with respect to their cleared security-based swap transactions. 201 As a
result of lower risk weights applied to exposures and a cap on capital requirements against
default fund obligations, ICC’s qualification as a QCCP may, for those of its clearing members
that are subject to the BCBS capital framework, lead to an improved capital position relative to
bank members of non-QCCPs with respect to their cleared security-based swap transactions.
This may lower funding costs for bank members of QCCPs.
In quantifying the benefits of achieving QCCP status, the Commission based its estimate
on publicly available information with regard to ICC. To estimate the upper bound for the
potential benefits accruing to bank clearing members at ICC as a result of its QCCP status, the
Commission identified a sample of 15 bank clearing members at ICC and, for each bank,
collected information about total assets, risk weighted assets, net income and tier one capital

For a discussion of the effects of QCCP status on competition between bank and nonbank clearing members, see CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 317–322.

87

ratio at the holding company level for 2015. 202 The Commission then allocated trade exposures
and default fund exposures across the sample of bank clearing members based on the level of
risk-weighted assets. 203 The Commission measured the impact on risk-weighted assets for nonU.S. bank clearing members under two different capital treatment regimes. The first regime is in
the absence of QCCP status, assuming a 100% risk weight applied to trade exposures and 1250%
risk weight applied to default fund exposures for non-U.S. members. In the second regime, ICC
obtains QCCP status, and banks are allowed to apply a 2% risk weight to trade exposures and a
1250% risk weight to default fund exposures up to a total exposure cap of 20% of trade
exposures. 204 If ICC is determined to be a QCCP, then the increase in risk weighted assets will
202

The Commission used the set of entities it identified as banks on ICC’s member list,
available at https://www.theice.com/clear-credit/participants. For U.S. bank holding companies,
2015 total assets, risk weighted assets, net income, and tier 1 capital ratios were collected from
Y-9C reports available at the National Information Center,
https://www.ffiec.gov/nicpubweb/nicweb/nichome.aspx. For non-U.S. bank holding companies,
Commission staff obtained corresponding data from financial statements and supplementary
financial materials posted to bank websites. Where necessary, values were converted back to
U.S. dollars at December 31, 2015 exchange rates obtained from the Federal Reserve,
http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/hist/.
203

For example, one bank in the sample, with 5.06% of total risk-weighted assets, was
assigned 5.06% of the total trade and default fund exposures while another bank in the sample,
with 3.51% of total risk weighted assets, was assigned 3.51% of these exposures. Because trade
exposures of ICC members against ICC are nonpublic, the Commission used the balance of ICC
margin deposits and deposits in lieu of margin held at ICC, $14.2 billion, as a proxy for trade
exposures. ICC’s 2015 clearing fund deposits were valued at $1.56 billion. See ICC, 2015
Annual Report, available at
https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/regulatory_filings/ICE_Clear_Credit_Financial_Statements_
2014_2015.pdf
204

The BCBS capital framework allows banks to compute default fund exposures in two
ways. Method 1 involves computing capital requirements for each member proportional to its
share of an aggregate capital requirement for all clearing members in a scenario where to average
clearing members default. The Commission currently lacks data necessary to compute default
fund exposures under this approach, instead we use Method 2, which caps overall exposure to a
QCCP at 20% of trade exposures. See BCBS capital framework, supra note 199, Annex 4, paras.
121–25 (outlining two methods for computing default fund exposures).
88

be smaller in magnitude, implying a smaller adjustment at lower cost. The Commission estimates
that benefits associated with ICC obtaining QCCP status stemming from lower capital
requirements against trade exposures to QCCPs as a result of the adopted rules to have an upper
bound of $12.9 million per year, or approximately 0.01% of the total 2015 net income reported
by bank clearing members at ICC. 205
The Commission’s analysis is limited in several respects and relies on several
assumptions about the nature of trade exposures to ICC. First, a limitation of our proxy for trade
exposures and our use of ICC’s clearing fund is that the account balances include deposits by
bank clearing members, who would experience lower capital requirements under the BCBS
capital framework, and non-bank clearing members who would not. As a result, the
Commission assumes, for the purposes of establishing an upper bound for the benefits to market
participants that are associated with QCCP status for ICC under the adopted rules, that the
balance of both ICC’s margin account and ICC’s default fund are attributable only to bank
clearing members. Additionally, we assume an extreme case where, in the absence of QCCP
status, trade exposures against a CCP would be assigned a 100% risk weight, causing the largest
possible shock to risk-weighted assets for affected banks.

205

The Commission first quantified the benefits related to ICC’s attaining QCCP status for
ICC’s bank clearing members and bank indirect participants with respect to all reported
exposures. Over the period March 2009 through August 2016 the gross notional value of
security-based swap transactions cleared by ICE Clear Credit comprised 9% of the total value of
all CDS transactions cleared (see: https://www.theice.com/clear-credit). Based on this
information the Commission arrived at the benefits to ICC’s bank clearing members and bank
indirect participants from ICC’s attaining QCCP status with respect to security-based swap
transactions by multiplying the total benefits by 0.09.

89

Lower capital requirements on trade exposures to ICC would produce effects in the real
economy only under certain conditions. First, agency problems, taxes, or other capital market
imperfections could result in banks targeting a particular capital structure. Second, capital
constraints on bank clearing members subject to the BCBS capital framework must bind so that
higher capital requirements on bank clearing members subject to the BCBS capital framework in
the absence of QCCP status would cause these banks to exceed capital constraints if they chose
to redistribute capital to shareholders or invest capital in projects with returns that exceed their
cost of capital in the absence of QCCP status for ICC for security-based swap clearing. Using
publicly available data, however, it is not currently possible to determine whether capital
constraints will bind for bank clearing members when rules applying the BCBS capital
framework come into force, so to estimate an upper bound for the effects of QCCP status on
bank clearing members we assume that tier one capital constraints for all bank clearing members
of ICC would bind in an environment with zero weight placed on bank exposures to CCPs. 206
For the purposes of quantifying potential benefits from QCCP status, the Commission has
also assumed that banks choose to adjust to new capital requirements by deleveraging. In
particular, the Commission assumed that banks would respond by reducing risk-weighted assets
equally across all risk classes until they reach the minimum tier one capital ratio under the Basel
206

The Commission notes that, at present, no bank in its sample of bank clearing members
of ICC is bound by capital requirements under the BCBS capital framework. For U.S. bank
holding companies tier 1 capital ratios were collected from Y-9C reports available at the
National Information Center, https://www.ffiec.gov/nicpubweb/nicweb/nichome.aspx. For nonU.S. bank holding companies, Commission staff obtained corresponding data from financial
statements and supplementary financial materials posted to bank websites. The Commission
used data from 2013–2016 for its sample of U.S. bank clearing members, and from 2012–2015
for non-U.S. bank clearing members and assumed no bank-specific countercyclical capital
buffers for these banks. This suggests a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 10.5%, exceeding the
BCBS capital framework’s minimum by 2.0%.

90

framework of 8.5%. We measure the ongoing costs to each non-U.S. bank by multiplying the
implied change in total assets by each bank’s return on assets, estimated using up to 12 years of
annual financial statement data. 207
The BCBS capital framework for exposures to CCPs yields additional benefits for
QCCPs that the Commission is currently unable to quantify due to lack of data concerning client
clearing arrangements by banks. For client exposures to clearing members, the BCBS capital
framework allows participants to reflect the shorter close-out period of cleared transactions in
their capitalized exposures. The BCBS capital framework’s treatment of exposures to CCPs also
applies to client exposures to CCPs through clearing members. This may increase the likelihood
that bank clients of bank clearing members that are subject to the BCBS capital framework share
some of the benefits of QCCP status.
Furthermore, the fact that the BCBS capital framework applies to bank clearing members
may have important implications for competition and concentration. While Rule 17Ad-22(e)
may extend lower capital requirements against exposures to QCCPs to the QCCP’s non-U.S.
bank clearing members, the benefits of QCCP status will still be limited to bank clearing
members. However, the costs associated with compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e) may be borne
by all clearing members, regardless of whether or not they are supervised as banks. A potential
consequence of this allocation of costs and benefits may be a “crowding out” of members of
QCCPs that are not banks and that will not experience benefits with respect to the BCBS capital
framework. This may result in an unintended consequence of an increased concentration of
clearing activity among ICC’s bank clearing members. This increased concentration could mean
207

This data has been taken from Compustat. Due to data limitations, for certain banks a
shorter window was used for this calculation. The minimum sample window was nine years.

91

that each of the remaining clearing members becomes more important from the standpoint of
systemic risk transmission since, for example, clearing agencies would have fewer nondefaulting members to take on defaulting members’ portfolios, and clearing agencies that rely on
clearing members to participate in default auctions would hold auctions with fewer participants.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the benefits of ICC attaining QCCP status
may depend on whether foreign bank clearing members of ICC are currently able to shift their
clearing business from ICC to alternative clearing agencies that serve similar markets. In this
regard, the Commission notes that ICC and ICEEU have several overlapping members and ICC
clears all the contracts that ICEEU clears. Thus in a situation where ICEEU is a QCCP while
ICC is not, common foreign bank members of the two agencies may obtain many of the benefits
of ICC having QCCP status by moving their clearing business to ICEEU.
However, under such a scenario, the benefits of ICC having QCCP status for securitybased swaps would not be fully realized for a number of reasons. First, not all clearing members
of ICC are also clearing members of ICEEU. These members will not be able to move their
clearing business to ICEEU. Second, ICEEU only clears a subset of the contracts that ICC does.
Thus even common foreign bank members of ICC and ICEEU may not be able to move their
entire clearing business from ICC to ICEEU. The Commission therefore preliminarily believes
that the extent to which foreign bank clearing members of ICC could obtain QCCP benefits by
moving their clearing business from ICC to ICEEU is limited.
b. Costs
As noted above, ICC is a SIDCO that is also regulated by the CFTC. Based on its
consultation and coordination with other regulators, the Commission believes Rule 17Ad-22(e) is
consistent and comparable, where possible and appropriate, with the rules and policy statements
adopted by the FRB and the rules adopted by the CFTC, as each of the three rule sets are
92

intended to be consistent with the headline principles in the PFMI. The Commission’s rules
differ from those requirements adopted by the CFTC and FRB in terms of the specific portions of
the key considerations and explanatory text in the PFMI that are, or are not, referenced or
emphasized.
Because of the abovementioned similarities between the CFTC’s regulatory regime for
SIDCOs and Rule 17Ad-22(e), the Commission preliminarily believes that, at the time of this
proposal, ICC’s policies and procedures are already likely to be in compliance with many of the
requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e). The Commission further notes that ICC’s principle-byprinciple summary narrative disclosure suggests that it would be unlikely to need to make
significant changes to its operations, policies, and procedures in order to comply with Rule
17Ad-22(e). 208
In light of the abovementioned similarity between the CFTC’s regulatory regime for
SIDCOs and Rule 17Ad-22(e), the Commission preliminarily believes the economic costs that
ICC will bear as a result of the proposed amendments will be related to the establishment,
implementation and maintenance of certain policies and procedures under Rule 17Ad-22(e). We
preliminarily estimate these costs will at most include one-time costs of approximately
$667,917 209 and annual costs of approximately $146,249. 210

75 hours at $313 dollars per hour) + (Senior Risk Management Specialist for 114 hours at $338
per hour)) = $667,917.

93

c. Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation
The proposed amendments do not alter the covered clearing agency status of DTC, FICC,
NSCC and OCC. The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed amendments will not
change the behavior of market participants associated with these entities and will therefore not
generate any economic benefits or costs for these entities. Further, even though the proposed
amendments do not alter the covered clearing agency status of ICEEU, the Commission
preliminarily believes that they are likely to generate economic effects for this entity. This is
because ICC clears all security-based transactions that are cleared by ICEEU. Because the
proposed amendments are likely to result in uniform regulatory requirements for similar risks at
both clearing agencies, they could potentially cause business to shift from ICEEU to ICC. This
could translate into a loss of economies of scale for ICEEU which, in turn, would result in higher
clearing fees and higher transaction costs in cleared products.

210

Calculated as ((Administrative Assistant for 20 hours at $76 per hour) + (Compliance
Attorney for 279 hours at $345 per hour) + (Computer Operations Department Manager for 12
hours at $416 per hour) + (Risk Management Specialist for 183 hours at $188 per hour) +
(Senior Business Analyst for 22 hours at $259 per hour) + (Senior Risk Management Specialist
for 10 hours at $338 per hour)) = $146,249 per year. To monetize the internal costs the
Commission staff used data from the SIFMA publications, Management and Professional
Earnings in the Security Industry—2013, and Office Salaries in the Securities Industry—2013,
modified by the Commission staff to account for an 1800 hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35
(professionals) or 2.93 (office) to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and
overhead. These figures have been adjusted for inflation using data published by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. Commission staff also estimated an hourly rate for a Chief Financial Officer.
The website www.salary.com reports that median CFO annual salaries in 2016 were $306,789.
A Grant Thornton LLP survey estimated that in 2016 public company CFOs will receive an
average annual salary of $303,975. Using an approximate midpoint of these two estimates of
$305,000 per year, and dividing by an 1800-hour work year and multiplying by the 5.35 factor
which normally is used to include benefits but here is used as an approximation to offset the fact
that New York salaries are typically higher than the rest of the country, the result is $906 per
hour.

94

2. Economic Effects Related to Future Registrants
Besides affecting the application of Rule 17Ad-22 to the existing set of registered
clearing agencies, the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 would, if adopted, affect the
regulation of clearing agencies that register with the Commission in the future. In particular,
under the proposed revision to Rule 17Ad-22(a)(5), any clearing agency that provides the
services of a CCP, CSD, or SSS would be a covered clearing agency. This means that covered
clearing agencies would no longer be limited to those that have been designated as systemically
important by the FSOC or are involved in activities that meet the definition of activities with a
complex risk profile, nor would clearing agencies for which the CFTC is the supervisory agency
under the Clearing Supervision Act be excluded.
Because the Commission is unable to predict with any precision the number of clearing
agencies likely to register in the future, much less the number that are likely to be CCPs, CSDs,
or SSSs, it is unable to quantify the aggregate economic effects that would flow as a result of the
effect of the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22(a) on future registrants. The Commission
notes, however, that it preliminarily believes that the proposed amendments would generally
increase the likelihood Rule 17Ad-22(e) would apply to a new registrant. Where possible, the
Commission has attempted to estimate the benefits and costs it would expect the proposed
amendments to Rule 17Ad-22(a) to have on a single new registrant.
a. Benefits
The Commission preliminarily believes that a benefit of the proposed amendments may
be that they reduce the costs that potential entrants into the market for clearance and settlement
services could expect to face to determine whether they would face regulation as covered
clearing agencies. Under the proposed amendments, any registered clearing agency that expects
to provide the services of a CCP, CSD, or SSS would also expect to be subject to Rule 17Ad95

22(e) without requiring additional information about FSOC designation or a Commission
determination that its activities have a more complex risk profile. To the extent that this reduces
the need for potential entrants that engage in those services to assess whether they are likely to
be regulated as covered clearing agencies, the proposed amendments could reduce the costs
associated with registration. The Commission preliminarily believes that a reasonable estimate
of cost reduction a single registrant is likely to experience is $3,382, attributable to reduced legal
expenses associated with determining whether or not the registrant will also be regulated as a
covered clearing agency. 211
In the absence of the proposed amendments, without designation by the FSOC or a
Commission determination, a registered clearing agency would be subject to Rule 17Ad-22(d).
The proposed amendments increase the likelihood that new entrants into the market for clearance
and settlement services would be subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e). Generally, to the extent that the
requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e) impose higher risk management standards on potential
entrant CCPs, CSDs, and SSSs than they would impose on themselves while subject to Rule
17Ad-22(d), the Commission preliminarily believes the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad22(a) may improve financial stability. As discussed in the CCA Standards adopting release,
some of this increased stability may come as a result of lower activity as Rule 17Ad-22(e) causes
participants of these new entrants to internalize a greater proportion of the costs that their activity
imposes on the financial system, reducing the costs of default, conditional on a default event
occurring. 212 Increased stability may also come as a result of the higher risk management
211

The Commission calculated this reduction in costs as ((Assistant General Counsel for 2
hours at $440 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney for 3 hours at $300 per hour) + (Outside
Counsel for 5 hours at $400 per hour = $3,382.
212

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 380.
96

standards at potential entrants effectively lowering the probability that either the entrant clearing
agencies or their members default.
b. Costs
In the absence of the proposed amendments, without designation by the FSOC or a
Commission determination, a registered clearing agency would be subject to Rule 17Ad-22(d).
To the extent that requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e) would impose additional costs on
potential entrants who would otherwise be regulated under Rule 17Ad-22(d), the Commission
believes that the proposed amendments may impose additional costs on potential entrants.
In the CCA Standards adopting release, 213 the Commission estimated specific costs that
registered clearing agencies would bear related to holding sufficient qualifying liquid resources
under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7). These estimates depended on information about the current operation
of registered clearing agencies that are subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e) and so the Commission is
unable to provide precise estimates of costs associated with these requirements that potential
entrants may bear as a result of the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22(a). However if a
potential entrant resembles the average covered clearing agency, the Commission would expect
compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) to cost the entrant between $24 million and $40 million. 214
In addition, the Commission estimates the startup compliance costs associated with policies and
procedures for a potential entrant that is not a CSD to be substantially similar to the costs

213

See id. at 346.

214

To arrive at this range, the Commission divided the maximum and minimum costs
associated with compliance estimated in the CCA Standards adopting release by 5 covered

estimated in the CCA Standards adopting release, $608,578. 215 Furthermore, Rules 17Ad22(e)(3), (4), (6), (7), (15) and (21) all include elements of review by either a covered clearing
agency’s board or its management on an ongoing basis. The Commission estimates the cost of
ongoing review for these adopted rules at approximately $39,376 per year for a potential entrant,
as estimated in the CCA Standards adopting release. 216
c. Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation
The Commission preliminarily believes there are unlikely to be substantial direct effects
on efficiency and capital formation from the proposed amendments’ impact on potential entrants.
The Commission acknowledges, however, that there are potential effects on competition that
may arise from how the proposed amendments would affect the regulatory treatment of
registered clearing agencies and the barriers to entry into the market for services provided by
CCPs, CSDs, and SSSs.

215

The total initial cost for an entrant that is not a CSD and does engage in activities with a
more complex risk profile was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 428 hours
at $467 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney for 365 hours at $310 per hour) + (Administrative
Assistant for 2 hours at $72 per hour) + (Computer Operations Department Manager for 300
hours at $361 per hour) + (Senior Business Analyst for 85 hours at $245 per hour) + (Senior Risk
Management Specialist for 114 hours at $249 per hour) + (Chief Compliance Office for 102
hours at $441 per hour) + (Senior Programmer for 53 hours at $282 per hour) + (Chief Financial
Officer for 50 hours at $892 per hour) + (Financial Analyst for 70 hours at $245 per hour)) =
$592,215. Because only Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) applies solely to CSDs and many of the other
parts of Rule 17Ad-22(e) do not apply to CSDs, the Commission believes the initial cost of an
entrant that is a CSD would be lower.
216

To estimate the cost of board review, the Commission used a recent report by Bloomberg
stating that the average director works 250 hours and earns $251,000, resulting in an estimated
$1000 per hour for board review. As a proxy for the cost of management review, the
Commission is estimating $461 per hour, based upon the Director of Compliance cost data from
the SIFMA table, see infra note 778. The Commission estimates the total cost of review for each
clearing agency as follows: ((Board Review for 32 hours at $1000 per hour) + (Management
Review for 16 hours at $461 per hour)) = $39,376. The Commission requests comment on this
estimate.

98

The proposed amendments would likely result in more consistent regulatory treatment of
firms that provide similar services to securities markets. By imposing Rule 17Ad-22(e) on all
CCPs, CSDs, and SSSs, regardless of FSOC designation or their engagement in activities with a
more complex risk profile, the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22(a) would mitigate the risk
that registered clearing agencies with similar businesses would be subject to substantially
different regulatory regimes. The Commission preliminarily believes that more uniform
treatment under the proposed amendments may provide a more level playing field for CCPs,
CSDs, and SSSs. By contrast, in the absence of the proposed amendments, an entrant CCP,
CSD, or SSS, that did not engage in activity with a more complex risk profile could initially
receive a competitive advantage by being regulated under 17Ad-22(d) until becoming a
designated clearing agency because they may internalize less of the risk they pose to the
financial system.
On the other hand, as discussed in the CCA Standards adopting release, costs resulting
from regulation under Rule 17Ad-22(e) as a result of the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad22(a) may have the effect of raising already high barriers to entry. 217 As the potential entry of
new clearing agencies becomes more remote, existing clearing agencies may be able to reduce
service quality, restrict the supply of services, or increase fees above marginal cost in an effort to
earn economic rents from participants in cleared markets. 218
3. Alternatives
As an alternative to the proposed approach, the Commission considered alternative
definitions of “covered clearing agency.” Specifically, the Commission considered more limited
217

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 317–318.

218

See, e.g., Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 31, at 66263 n.481.

99

definitions that would not have included CSDs or SSSs along with CCPs within the definition.
An alternative approach that included only CCPs within the definition of “covered clearing
agency” would still include ICC in the set of covered clearing agencies. The Commission
preliminarily believes that such an approach compares unfavorably to the proposed approach
because, as discussed in Parts II.A.1 and 2, CSDs perform a critical role in the U.S. securities
settlement markets by helping to reduce risk and by providing transparency to the markets and,
hence, it is appropriate to apply enhanced requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e) to CSDs.
Similarly, the Commission could have proposed to exclude SSSs from the definition of
covered clearing agency. This would have no effect on the set of registered entities that would
be covered clearing agencies and no effect on the immediate economic effects of the proposed
amendments. However, this could potentially mean that an entrant clearing agency that solely
performs the functions of an SSS would be subject only to Rule 17Ad-22(d). As above, the
Commission preliminarily believes that it is appropriate to apply enhanced requirements under
Rule 17Ad-22(e) to SSSs because of the critical role they play in the national system for
clearance and settlement.
IV. Paperwork Reduction Act
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”) imposes certain requirements on federal
agencies in connection with the conducting or sponsoring of any “collection of information.” 219
An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of
information unless it displays a currently valid control number. Further, 44 U.S.C. 3507(a)
provides that, before adopting or revising a collection of information requirement, an agency
must, among other things, publish notice in the Federal Register stating that the agency has
219

See 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.; 44 U.S.C. 3502(3).

100

submitted the proposed collection of information to the Office of Management and Budget
(“OMB”) and setting forth certain required information, including (i) a title for the collection of
information; (ii) a summary of the collection of information; (iii) a brief description of the need
for the information and the proposed use of the information; (iv) a description of the likely
respondents and proposed frequency of response to the collection of information; (v) an estimate
of the paperwork burden that shall result from the collection of information; and (vi) notice that
comments may be submitted to the agency and director of OMB. 220
Certain provisions of Rule 17Ad-22(e) impose collection of information requirements
under the PRA. The Commission submitted these collections of information to the OMB for
review in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507 and 5 CFR 1320.11. Because the Commission is
proposing to revise the respondents under Rule 17Ad-22(e) to account for the proposed
amendment to the definition of “covered clearing agency” and related amendments, the
Commission will use the same title and control number: “Clearing Agency Standards for
Operation and Governance,” OMB Control No. 3235-0695.
A. Summary of Collection of Information and Use of Information 221
1. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for a well-founded,

220

See 44 U.S.C. 3507(a)(1)(D); see also 5 CFR 1320.5(a)(1)(iv).

221

In addition to the discussion of the purposes of the collections of information set forth in
Part IV.A, the Commission notes that the policies and procedures would also be used by the
Commission as part of its ongoing efforts to monitor and enforce compliance with the federal
securities laws through, among other things, examinations and inspections.

101

clear, transparent and enforceable legal basis for each aspect of its activities in all relevant
jurisdictions. 222
The purpose of this collection of information is to reduce the potential for legal risk at
covered clearing agencies, such as the risk that participants face legal uncertainty due to a lack of
clarity or completeness regarding conflicts with applicable laws.
2. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)
Rules 17Ad-22(e)(2)(i) through (iii) require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
for governance arrangements that are clear and transparent, clearly prioritize the safety and
efficiency of the covered clearing agency, and support the public interest requirements of Section
17A of the Exchange Act, and the objectives of owners and participants. Rules 17Ad22(e)(2)(iv) and (v) require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to establish that the board of
directors and senior management have appropriate experience and skills to discharge their duties
and responsibilities and to specify clear and direct lines of responsibility. Rule 17Ad22(e)(2)(vi) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to consider the interests of participants’
customers, securities issuers and holders, and other relevant stakeholders of the clearing
agency. 223
The purpose of this collection of information is to prioritize the safety and efficiency of
covered clearing agencies, to help ensure that each covered clearing agency’s governance

102

arrangements consider the interests of relevant stakeholders, to promote the establishment of
boards of directors at covered clearing agencies that are composed of qualified members with
clear and direct lines of responsibility, and to promote accountability of the board of directors
and senior management.
3. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain a sound risk
management framework for comprehensively managing legal, credit, liquidity, operational,
general business, investment, custody, and other risks that arise in or are borne by the covered
clearing agency. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(i) requires a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
for risk management policies, procedures, and systems designed to identify, measure, monitor,
and manage the range of risks that arise in or are borne by the covered clearing agency, and
subject them to review on a specified periodic basis and approval by the board of directors
annually. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(ii) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure it establishes
plans for the recovery and orderly wind-down of the covered clearing agency necessitated by
credit losses, liquidity shortfalls, losses from general business risk, or any other losses. Rule
17Ad-22(e)(iii) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide risk management and internal
audit personnel with sufficient authority, resources, independence from management, and access
to the board of directors. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(iv) requires a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide

103

risk management and internal audit personnel with oversight by and a direct reporting line to a
risk management committee and an independent audit committee of the board of directors,
respectively. Rule 17A-22(e)(3)(v) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for an
independent audit committee. 224
The purpose of this information collection is to enhance each covered clearing agency’s
ability to identify, monitor, and manage the risks that covered clearing agencies face, including
by subjecting the relevant policies and procedures to regular review, and to facilitate an orderly
recovery and wind-down process in the event that a covered clearing agency is unable to
continue operating as a going concern.
4. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to effectively identify, measure,
monitor, and manage its credit exposures to participants and those exposures arising from its
payment, clearing, and settlement processes.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain sufficient
financial resources to cover its credit exposure to each participant fully with a high degree of
confidence. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii) requires a covered clearing agency that provides CCP
services, and that is “systemically important in multiple jurisdictions” or “a clearing agency
involved in activities with a more complex risk profile,” to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain additional financial
224

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(3); CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 464.

104

resources, to the extent not already maintained pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i), at a minimum
level necessary to enable it to cover a wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios, including but
not limited to the default of the two participant families that would potentially cause the largest
aggregate credit exposure for the covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible market
conditions. Meanwhile, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iii) requires a covered clearing agency that is not
subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii) to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to maintain additional financial resources, to the extent not
already maintained pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i), at the minimum to enable it to cover a
wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios, including the default of the participant family that
would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for the covered clearing agency in
extreme but plausible market conditions. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iv) requires a covered clearing
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to include prefunded financial resources, exclusive of assessments for additional
guaranty fund contributions or other resources that are not prefunded, when calculating the
financial resources available to meet the standards under Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iii), as
applicable. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(v) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain the
financial resources required under proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii) and (iii), as applicable, in
combined or separately maintained clearing or guaranty funds.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to test the sufficiency
of its total financial resources available to meet the minimum financial resource requirements
under Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iii), as applicable, by conducting stress testing of its total

105

financial resources at least once each day using standard predetermined parameters and
assumptions. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi) also requires a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to conduct
a comprehensive analysis on at least a monthly basis of the existing stress testing scenarios,
models, and underlying parameters and assumptions, and consider modifications to ensure they
are appropriate for determining the covered clearing agency’s required level of default protection
in light of current market conditions. When the products cleared or markets served by a covered
clearing agency display high volatility or become less liquid, or when the size or concentration of
positions held by the entity’s participants increases significantly, the proposed rule would require
a covered clearing agency to have policies and procedures for conducting comprehensive
analyses of stress testing scenarios, models, and underlying parameters and assumptions more
frequently than monthly. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi) also requires a covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to provide for the reporting of the results of this analysis to the appropriate decision makers at
the covered clearing agency, including its risk management committee or board of directors, and
to require the use of the results to evaluate the adequacy of and to adjust its margin methodology,
model parameters, and any other relevant aspects of its credit risk management policies and
procedures, in supporting compliance with the minimum financial resources requirements in
Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iii), as applicable.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vii) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require a model
validation for its credit risk models not less than annually or more frequently as may be
contemplated by the covered clearing agency’s risk management policies and procedures.

106

Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(viii) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to address allocation
of credit losses the covered clearing agency may face if its collateral and other resources are
insufficient to fully cover its credit exposures, including the repayment of any funds the covered
clearing agency may borrow from liquidity providers.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ix) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to describe the
covered clearing agency’s process to replenish any financial resources it may use following a
default or other event in which use of such resources is contemplated. 225
The purpose of this information collection is to identify and limit credit exposures to
participants and to satisfy all of its settlement obligations in the event of a participant default, to
address the allocation of credit losses if collateral and other resources are insufficient to fully
cover its credit exposures following a participant default, and to describe the covered clearing
agency’s process to replenish financial resources following such a default.
5. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit the assets it accepts as
collateral to those with low credit, liquidity, and market risks, and also require policies that set
and enforce appropriately conservative haircuts and concentration limits if the covered clearing
agency requires collateral to manage its own or its participants’ credit exposures. In addition,
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and
225

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(4); CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 464–

466.

107

enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to include a not-less-than-annual
review of the sufficiency of a covered clearing agency’s collateral haircuts and concentration
limits. 226
The purpose of the information collection is to enable a covered clearing agency to be
able to maintain sufficient collateral by using appropriately conservative haircuts and
concentration limits.
6. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) requires a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to cover its credit exposures to its participants by establishing a risk-based margin system that is
monitored by management on an ongoing basis and regularly reviewed, tested, and verified.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(i) requires a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to result in a margin system that, at a minimum, considers and produces margin levels
commensurate with the risks and particular attributes of each relevant product, portfolio, and
market. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(ii) requires a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to ensure that the margin system would mark participant positions to market and collect margin,
including variation margin or equivalent charges if relevant, at least daily, and include the
authority and operational capacity to make intraday margin calls in defined circumstances. Rule
17Ad-22(e)(6)(iii) requires a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to establish,
226

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(5); CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 466–

467.

108

implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
calculate margin sufficient to cover its potential future exposure to participants in the interval
between the last margin collection and the close out of positions following a participant default.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(iv) requires a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to ensure that it uses reliable sources of timely price data and uses procedures and sound
valuation models for addressing circumstances in which pricing data are not readily available or
reliable. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(v) requires a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services
to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to ensure the use of an appropriate method for measuring credit exposure that accounts
for relevant product risk factors and portfolio effects across products.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi) requires a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to establish a risk-based margin system that is monitored by management on an ongoing basis.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi) also requires a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to regularly review, test, and verify its risk-based margin system by conducting backtests of its
margin model at least once each day using standard predetermined parameters and assumptions.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi) also requires a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to regularly review, test, and verify its risk-based margin system by conducting a sensitivity
analysis of its margin model and a review of its parameters and assumptions for backtesting on at
least a monthly basis, and considering modifications to ensure the backtesting practices are

109

appropriate for determining the adequacy of the covered clearing agency’s margin resources.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi) also requires a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to regularly review, test, and verify its risk-based margin system by conducting a sensitivity
analysis of its margin model and a review of its parameters and assumptions for backtesting
more frequently than monthly during periods of time when the products cleared or markets
served display high volatility or become less liquid, and when the size or concentration of
positions held by the covered clearing agency’s participants increases or decreases significantly.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi) also requires a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to regularly review, test, and verify its risk-based margin system by reporting the results of its
analyses above to appropriate decision makers at the covered clearing agency, including but not
limited to, its risk management committee or board of directors, and using these results to
evaluate the adequacy of and adjust its margin methodology, model parameters, and any other
relevant aspects of its credit risk management framework.
Finally, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vii) requires a covered clearing agency that provides CCP
services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to requires a model validation for the covered clearing agency’s margin
system and related models to be performed not less than annually, or more frequently as may be
contemplated by the covered clearing agency’s risk management framework established pursuant
to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3). 227
227

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(6); CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 467–

468.

110

The purpose of the information collection is to enable a covered clearing agency to be
able to collect sufficient margin subject to regular sensitivity analysis, monthly backtesting, and
an annual model validation.
7. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to effectively measure, monitor,
and manage the liquidity risk that arises in or is borne by it, by meeting, at a minimum, the ten
requirements specified in the rule.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) requires that a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures
be reasonably designed to ensure that it maintains sufficient liquid resources in all relevant
currencies to effect same-day and, where appropriate, intraday and multiday settlement of
payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of potential stress
scenarios that includes the default of the participant family that would generate the largest
aggregate payment obligation for it in extreme but plausible market conditions.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that it holds
qualifying liquid resources sufficient to meet the minimum liquidity resource requirement in
each relevant currency for which the covered clearing agency has payment obligations owed to
clearing members.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iii) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure it uses
accounts and services at a Federal Reserve Bank, pursuant to Section 806(a) of the Clearing
Supervision Act, or other relevant central bank, when available and where determined to be

111

practical by the board of directors of the covered clearing agency, to enhance its management of
liquidity risk.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iv) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure it undertakes
due diligence to confirm that it has a reasonable basis to believe each of its liquidity providers,
whether or not such liquidity provider is a clearing member, has sufficient information to
understand and manage the liquidity provider’s liquidity risks, and the capacity to perform as
required under its commitments to provide liquidity.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(v) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the
covered clearing agency maintains and, on at least an annual basis, tests with each liquidity
provider, to the extent practicable, its procedures and operational capacity for accessing each
type of relevant liquidity resource.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(A) through (C) requires a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
determine the amount and regularly test the sufficiency of the liquid resources held for purposes
of meeting the minimum liquid resource requirement of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) by (A)
conducting stress testing of its liquidity resources at least once each day using standard and
predetermined parameters and assumptions; (B) conducting a comprehensive analysis of the
existing stress testing scenarios, models, and underlying parameters and assumptions used in
evaluating liquidity needs and resources, and considering modifications to ensure they are
appropriate for determining the covered clearing agency’s identified liquidity needs and
resources in light of current and evolving market conditions at least once each month; and (C)

112

conducting a comprehensive analysis of the existing stress testing scenarios, models, and
underlying parameters and assumptions used in evaluating liquidity needs and resources more
frequently when products cleared or markets served display high volatility or become less liquid,
when the size or concentration of positions held by participants increases significantly, or in
other circumstances described in the covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures. Rule
17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(D) also requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to result in reporting the results
of the analyses performed under Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(B) and (C) to appropriate decision
makers, including the risk management committee or board of directors, at the covered clearing
agency for use in evaluating the adequacy of and adjusting its liquidity risk management
framework.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vii) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to result in performing
an annual or more frequent model validation of its liquidity risk models.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(viii) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to address foreseeable
liquidity shortfalls that would not be covered by its liquid resources and seek to avoid
unwinding, revoking, or delaying the same-day settlement of payment obligations.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ix) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to describe its process
for replenishing any liquid resources that it may employ during a stress event.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(x) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that it, at

113

least once a year, evaluates the feasibility of maintaining sufficient liquid resources at a
minimum in all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where appropriate, intraday and
multiday settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under a wide range
of foreseeable stress scenarios that includes, but is not limited to, the default of the two
participant families that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for the
covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible market conditions if the covered clearing
agency provides CCP services and is either systemically important in multiple jurisdictions or a
clearing agency involved in activities with a more complex risk profile. 228
The purpose of this information collection is to identify and limit liquidity risk so that a
covered clearing agency can satisfy its settlement obligations on an ongoing and timely basis by
holding a sufficient amount of qualifying liquid resources and performing regular stress testing
of its liquid resources. It is also to help ensure that a covered clearing agency addresses
foreseeable liquidity shortfalls and can replenish any liquid resources that it may employ in a
stress event. It is also to help ensure that a covered clearing agency manages the risks posed by
its liquidity providers.
8. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to define the point at which
settlement is final to be no later than the end of the day on which the payment or obligation is
due and, where necessary or appropriate, either intraday or in real time. 229

and reliability in the settlement process.
9. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to conduct its money
settlements in central bank money, where available and determined to be practical by the board
of directors of the covered clearing agency, and minimizes and manages credit and liquidity risk
arising from conducting its money settlements in commercial bank money if central bank money
is not used by the covered clearing agency. 230
The purpose of this information collection is to promote reliability in a covered clearing
agency’s settlement operations.
10. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to establish and
maintain transparent written standards that state its obligations with respect to the delivery of
physical instruments and operational practices that identify, monitor, and manage the risk
associated with such physical deliveries. 231
The purpose of this information collection is to provide a covered clearing agency’s
participants with the information necessary to evaluate the risks and costs associated with
participation in the covered clearing agency.

11. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(i) requires a covered clearing agency that provides CSD services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to maintain securities in an immobilized or dematerialized form for their transfer by book entry,
ensure the integrity of securities issues, and minimize and manage the risks associated with the
safekeeping and transfer of securities. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(ii) requires a covered clearing
agency that provides CSD services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to implement internal auditing and other controls to
safeguard the rights of securities issuers and holders and prevent the unauthorized creation or
deletion of securities, and conduct periodic and at least daily reconciliation of securities issues it
maintains. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(iii) requires a covered clearing agency that provides CSD
services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to protect assets against custody risk through appropriate rules and
procedures consistent with relevant laws, rules, and regulations in jurisdictions where it
operates. 232
The purpose of this information collection is to reduce securities transfer processing costs
and the risks associated with securities settlement and custody, as well as increase the speed and
efficiency of the settlement process.
12. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) requires a covered clearing agency, for transactions that involve the
settlement of two linked obligations, to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to eliminate principal risk by conditioning the final

116

settlement of one obligation upon the final settlement of the other, regardless of whether the
covered clearing agency settles on a gross or net basis and when finality occurs. 233
The purpose of this information collection is to promote the elimination of principal risk
in transactions with linked obligations.
13. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) requires a covered clearing agencies providing CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to ensure that the covered clearing agency has the authority and operational capacity to take
timely action to contain losses and liquidity demands and continue to meet its obligations by, at a
minimum, requiring the covered clearing agency’s participants and, when practicable, other
stakeholders to participate in the testing and review of its default procedures, including any
close-out procedures, at least annually and following material changes thereto. 234
The purpose of this information collection is to facilitate the functioning of a covered
clearing agency in the event that a participant fails to meet its obligations, as well as limit the
extent to which a participant’s failure can spread to other participants or the covered clearing
agency itself.
14. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) requires a covered clearing agency that is a security-based swap
clearing agency or a complex risk profile clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to enable the segregation and

clearing agency with respect to those positions, and effectively protect such positions and related
collateral from the default or insolvency of that member. 235
The purpose of this information collection is to facilitate the safe and effective holding
and transfer of customers’ positions and collateral in the event of a participant’s default or
insolvency.
15. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify, monitor,
and manage its general business risk and hold sufficient liquid net assets funded by equity to
cover potential general business losses so that the covered clearing agency can continue
operations and services as a going concern if those losses materialize. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(i)
requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to determine the amount of liquid net assets funded by
equity based upon its general business risk profile and the length of time required to achieve a
recovery or orderly wind-down, as appropriate, of its critical operations and services if such
action is taken. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(ii) requires a clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for holding
liquid net assets funded by equity equal to the greater of either six months of its current operating
expenses or the amount determined by the board of directors to be sufficient to ensure a recovery
or orderly wind-down of critical operations and services of the covered clearing agency, as

also requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for monitoring its business operations
and reducing the likelihood of losses. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(iii) requires a covered clearing
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to provide for maintaining a viable plan, approved by the board of directors and
updated at least annually, for raising additional equity should its equity fall close to or below the
amount required by the rule, as discussed above. 236
The purpose of this information collection is to mitigate the potential impairment of a
covered clearing agency as a result of a decline in revenues or increase in expenses.
16. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to safeguard its own
and its participants’ assets and minimize the risk of loss and delay in access to these assets. Rule
17Ad-22(e)(16) also requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to invest such assets in instruments
with minimal credit, market, and liquidity risks. 237
17. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage the covered
clearing agency’s operational risk. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(i) requires a covered clearing agency to

establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to identify the plausible sources of operational risk, both internal and external, and mitigate their
impact through the use of appropriate systems, policies, procedures, and controls. Rule 17Ad22(e)(17)(ii) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain, and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that systems have a high degree of
security, resiliency, operational reliability, and adequate, scalable capacity. Finally, Rule 17Ad22(e)(17)(iii) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for a business continuity plan
that addresses events posing a significant risk of disrupting operations. 238
The purpose of this information collection is to limit operational disruptions that may
impede the proper functioning of a covered clearing agency.
18. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to establish objective,
risk-based, and publicly disclosed criteria for participation, which permit fair and open access by
direct and, where relevant, indirect participants and other FMUs. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) also
requires that a covered clearing agency establish, implement, maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to require participants to have sufficient financial
resources and robust operational capacity to meet obligations arising from participation in the
clearing agency and to monitor compliance with participation requirements on an ongoing
basis. 239

The purpose of this information collection is to enable a covered clearing agency to
ensure that only entities with sufficient financial and operational capacity are direct participants
in the covered clearing agency, while still ensuring that all qualified persons can access a
covered clearing agency’s services. The purpose of this information collection is also to enable a
covered clearing agency to monitor that participation requirements are met on an ongoing basis
and to identify a participant experiencing financial difficulties before the participant fails to meet
its settlement obligations.
19. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify, monitor,
and manage the material risks to the covered clearing agency arising from arrangements in
which firms that are indirect participants in the covered clearing agency rely on the services
provided by direct participants in the covered clearing agency to access the covered clearing
agency’s payment, clearing, or settlement facilities. In addition, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) also
requires that a covered clearing agency establish, implement, maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to regularly review the material risks to the covered
clearing agency arising from such tiered participation arrangements. 240
The purpose of this information collection is to enable a covered clearing agency to
identify and manage risks posed by non-member entities, such as the customers of clearing
members.

20. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify, monitor,
and manage risks related to any link with one or more other clearing agencies, FMUs, or trading
markets. 241
The purpose of this information collection is to enable a covered clearing agency to
identify and manage risks posed by linkages to other entities, such as other clearing agencies,
FMUs, or trading markets.
21. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require the covered
clearing agency to be efficient and effective in meeting the requirements of its participants and
the markets it serves. Additionally, the rule requires a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to have
the management of a covered clearing agency regularly review the efficiency and effectiveness
of the covered clearing agency’s (i) clearing and settlement arrangement; (ii) operating structure,
including risk management policies, procedures, and systems; (iii) scope of products cleared or
settled; and (iv) use of technology and communications procedures. 242
The purpose of this information collection is to ensure that the services provided by a
covered clearing agency do not become inefficient and to promote the sound operation of a
covered clearing agency.

22. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to use, or at a
minimum, accommodate, relevant internationally accepted communication procedures and
standards in order to facilitate efficient payment, clearing, and settlement. 243
The purpose of this information collection is to ensure the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transactions by enabling participants to communicate with a clearing
agency in a timely, reliable, and accurate manner.
23. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to (i) publicly disclose
all relevant rules and material procedures, including key aspects of its default rules and
procedures; (ii) provide sufficient information to enable participants to identify and evaluate the
risks, fees, and other material costs they incur by participating in the covered clearing agency;
and (iii) publicly disclose relevant basic data on transaction volume and values.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain clear and
comprehensive rules and procedures that provide for a comprehensive public disclosure that
describes the covered clearing agency’s material rules, policies, and procedures regarding its
legal, governance, risk management, and operating framework, accurate in all material respects
at the time of publication, including (i) a general background of the covered clearing agency,
including its function and the market it serves, basic data and performance statistics on its

services and operations, such as basic volume and value statistics by product type, average
aggregate intraday exposures to its participants, and statistics on the covered clearing agency’s
operational reliability, and a description of its general organization, legal and regulatory
framework, and system design and operations; (ii) a standard-by-standard summary narrative for
each applicable standard set forth in Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1) through (23) with sufficient detail and
context to enable the reader to understand its approach to controlling the risks and addressing the
requirements in each standard; (iii) a summary of material changes since the last update of the
disclosure; and (iv) an executive summary of the key points regarding each. Rule 17Ad22(e)(23)(v) also requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure the comprehensive public
disclosure required under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv) is updated not less than every two years, or
more frequently following changes to its system or the environment in which it operates to the
extent necessary, to ensure statements previously provided remain accurate in all material
respects.
The purpose of this information collection is to ensure that participants and prospective
participants in a covered clearing agency are provided with a complete picture of the covered
clearing agency’s operations and risk management so that they can understand the risks and
responsibilities of participation in the covered clearing agency.
24. Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1)
Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1) requires that, each fiscal quarter (based on calculations made as of
the last business day of the clearing agency's fiscal quarter) or at any time upon Commission
request, a registered clearing agency that performs CCP services shall calculate and maintain a
record, in accordance with Rule 17a-1 under the Exchange Act, of the financial and qualifying

124

liquid resources necessary to meet the requirements, as applicable, of Rules 17Ad-22(b)(3),
(e)(4), and (e)(7), and sufficient documentation to explain the methodology it uses to compute
such financial resources or qualifying liquid resources requirement.
The purpose of the collection of information is to enable the Commission to monitor the
financial resources of registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services.
B. Respondents
The requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e) impose a PRA burden on covered clearing
agencies. Under the adopted definition of “covered clearing agency,” Rule 17Ad-22(e) applies
to five registered clearing agencies, including four registered clearing agencies that provide CCP
services and one registered clearing agency that provides CSD and SSS services. In the CCA
Standards adopting release, the Commission estimated that two additional entities might seek to
register with the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission estimated that the majority of the
requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e) would have seven respondents, of which (i) six would be
CCPs and one would be a CSD and (ii) two would be security-based swap clearing agencies. The
Commission further clarified that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) would only have six respondents because
it only applies to CCPs, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) would only have one respondent because it only
applies to CSDs, and Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) would only have two respondents because it only
applies to security-based swap clearing agencies.
Under the proposed amendment to the definition of “covered clearing agency” described
above, Rule 17Ad-22(e) would instead apply to six registered clearing agencies, including five
registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services and one registered clearing agency that

125

provides CSD and SSS services. 244 The Commission continues to believe that two additional
entities might seek to register with the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily
estimates that, under the proposed amendment to the definition of “covered clearing agency”
described above, a majority of the requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e) would have eight
respondents, of which (i) seven would be CCPs and one would be a CSD and (ii) two would be
security-based swap clearing agencies. The Commission also notes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)
would now have seven respondents because it only applies to CCPs, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) would
continue to only have one respondent because it only applies to CSDs, and Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14)
would continue to only have two respondents because it only applies to security-based swap
clearing agencies.
The PRA analysis for seven of the eight respondents appears in the CCA Standards
adopting release. Below, the Commission provides a PRA analysis for the one remaining
respondent that would be subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e) under the proposed amendment to the
definition of “covered clearing agency,” therefore reflecting the incremental annual reporting and
recordkeeping burdens resulting from the proposed amendment to the definition of “covered
clearing agency.” In addition, because the one remaining respondent provides CCP services and
does not provide CSD services, the analysis does not include Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11).

244

See supra Part III.B and accompanying text. The additional registered clearing agency
that provides CCP services and that would be subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e) under the proposed
amendment to the definition of “covered clearing agency” is currently a registered clearing
agency subject to Rule 17Ad-22(d).

126

C. Total Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens
As described in the CCA Standards adopting release, 245 the Commission continues to
believe that the information collected pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e) reflects, to a degree, existing
policies and procedures at covered clearing agencies, but in some instances a covered clearing
agency will be required to develop new policies and procedures. Thus, when a covered clearing
agency reviews and updates its policies and procedures pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e), the
Commission believes that the PRA burden may vary across the requirements under Rule 17Ad22(e), depending on the complexity of the requirement in question and the extent to which a
covered clearing agency already has policies and procedures consistent with the requirement. As
a general matter, the portions of Rule 17Ad-22(e) for which the Commission expects a higher
PRA burden are those provisions including requirements not comparable to any existing
requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(d). Where the requirements do not reflect existing practices
or the normal course of a covered clearing agency’s activity, the PRA burden may entail, in
addition to ongoing burdens, initial one-time burdens to develop new policies and procedures.
Consistent with the CCA Standards adopting release, the Commission continues to
believe that Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1), (8) through (10), (12), (14), (16), and (22) contain
requirements either substantially similar to those in Rule 17Ad-22(d) or reflect current practices
at covered clearing agencies. The Commission believes that a covered clearing agency may need
to make only limited changes to its policies and procedures pursuant to the requirements in these
rules. For example, a covered clearing agency may need to conduct a comparison of its existing
policies and procedures against each rule to confirm that its policies and procedures are
consistent with the requirements therein.
245

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 416–418.

127

The Commission also continues to believe that Rules 17Ad-22(e)(2), (3), (5), (11), (13),
(17), (18), (20), and (21) contain provisions that are similar to those in Rule 17Ad-22(d) but
would also impose additional requirements not found in Rule 17Ad-22(d). The Commission
believes that a covered clearing agency may need to make changes to update its policies and
procedures pursuant to the requirements in these rules. For example, a covered clearing agency
may need to review and amend its existing rules, policies, and procedures but may not need to
develop, design, or implement new operations or practices pursuant to these rules.
For Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4), (6), (7), (15), (19), and (23), for which no comparable preexisting requirements under Rule 17Ad-22 have been identified, the Commission continues to
believe that a covered clearing agency may need to make more extensive changes to its policies
and procedures, may need to implement new policies and procedures, and may need to take other
steps pursuant to the requirements in these rules. For example, a covered clearing agency may
need to develop, design, and implement new operations and practices. In these cases, the PRA
burden is greater since these requirements may not reflect established practices or the normal
course of a covered clearing agency’s activities. Further, the PRA burden for these rules may
entail both initial one-time burdens, such as create new policies and procedures, as well as
ongoing burdens, such as requirements to make certain disclosures or perform certain types of
review, on a periodic basis.
1. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) contains substantially similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(1). 246
The Commission therefore expects that a respondent clearing agency has written rules, policies,
and procedures substantially similar to the requirements in the rule and that the PRA burden
246

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(1), (e)(1).

128

would include the incremental burdens of reviewing current policies and procedures and revising
them, where appropriate, pursuant to the rule. Accordingly, based on the similar provisions and
the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for Rule 17Ad22(d)(1), 247 the Commission preliminarily estimates that a respondent clearing agency would
incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 8 hours to review and revise existing
policies and procedures. 248
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. The
rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 249 the Commission
preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) would impose
an aggregate annual burden on a respondent clearing agency of 3 hours. 250
2. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) contains similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(8) but also adds
additional requirements that do not appear in Rule 17Ad-22(d). 251 The Commission therefore
expects that a respondent clearing agency may have written rules, policies, and procedures
247

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 418–419; Clearing Agency
Standards adopting release, supra note 31, at 66260.

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 2 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 6 hours)) = 8 hours x 1 respondent clearing agency = 8 hours.

249

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 419; Clearing Agency Standards
adopting release, supra note 31, at 66260–63.

clearing agency = 3 hours.

129

similar to the requirements in the rule and that the PRA burden includes the incremental burdens
of reviewing and revising current policies and procedures and creating new policies and
procedures, as necessary, pursuant to the rule. Accordingly, based on the similar provisions and
the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for Rule 17Ad22(d)(8), 252 the Commission preliminarily estimates that a respondent clearing agency would
incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 22 hours to review and revise existing
policies and procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as necessary. 253
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. The
rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 254 the Commission
preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) would impose
an aggregate annual burden on a respondent clearing agency of 4 hours. 255
3. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)
While Rule 17Ad-22(d) requires registered clearing agencies to have policies and
procedures to manage certain risks, 256 Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) requires a comprehensive framework
252

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 420; Clearing Agency Standards
adopting release, supra note 31, at 66260.
253

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 24 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 10 hours)) = 22 hours x 1 respondent clearing agency = 22 hours.

254

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 421; Clearing Agency Standards
adopting release, supra note 31, at 66260–63.
255

This figure was calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney for 4 hours) x 1 respondent
clearing agency = 4 hours.

256

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d), (e)(3).

130

for risk management, under which policies and procedures for risk management are designed
holistically, are consistent with each other, and work effectively together. Accordingly, the PRA
burden requires a respondent clearing agency to revise its written rules, policies, and procedures
to include, among other things, periodic review and plans for the recovery and orderly winddown of the covered clearing agency. As a result, the Commission preliminarily estimates that a
respondent clearing agency would incur an aggregate one-time burden of 57 hours to review and
revise existing policies and procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as
necessary. 257
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. The
rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures created in response to the rule and activities related to facilitating a periodic review
of the risk management framework. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 258 the Commission
preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) would impose
an aggregate annual burden on a respondent clearing agency of 49 hours. 259 The Commission
notes that the estimated ongoing burden for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) is similar to the initial one-time
burden because the rule includes a specific requirement that policies and procedures for
257

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 25 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 18 hours) + (Senior Risk Management Specialist for 7 hours) +
(Computer Operations Manager for 7 hours)) = 57 hours x 1 respondent clearing agency = 57
hours.

258

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 422–423; Clearing Agency
Standards adopting release, supra note 31, at 66260–63.
259

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Compliance Attorney for 8 hours) +
(Administrative Assistant for 3 hours) + (Senior Business Analyst for 5 hours) + (Risk
Management Specialist for 33 hours)) = 49 hours x 1 respondent clearing agency = 49 hours.
131

comprehensive risk management include review on a specified periodic basis and approval by
the board of directors annually.
4. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)
The Commission has previously estimated that the PRA burdens for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)
are more significant than in other cases under Rule 17Ad-22(e) and may require a respondent
clearing agency to make substantial changes to its written rules, policies, and procedures
pursuant to the rule. 260 In addition, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) will require a respondent clearing
agency to make one-time systems adjustments so that it has the capability to test the sufficiency
of its financial resources and to perform an annual model validation. As a result, the
Commission preliminarily estimates that a respondent clearing agency would incur an aggregate
one-time burden of 200 hours to review and revise existing policies and procedures and to create
new policies and procedures, as necessary. 261
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. The
rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures developed in response to the rule and ongoing activities with respect to testing the
sufficiency of its financial resources and performing the annual model validation. Based on the
Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance burdens with respect
to Rule 17Ad-22, 262 the Commission preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities required

by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) would impose an aggregate annual burden on a respondent clearing
agency of 60 hours. 263
5. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) contains similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(3). 264 The
Commission therefore expects that a respondent clearing agency has written rules, policies, and
procedures substantially similar to the requirements in the rule and that the PRA burden includes
the incremental burdens of reviewing current policies and procedures and revising them, where
appropriate, pursuant to the rule. For example, a respondent clearing agency may need to
develop new policies and procedures for an annual review of the sufficiency of its collateral
haircuts and concentration limits. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and procedures
requirements in and the Commission’s previous corresponding burden estimates for Rule 17Ad22(d)(3), 265 the Commission preliminarily estimates that a respondent clearing agency would
incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 42 hours to review and review existing
policies and procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as necessary. 266
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. The
rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to the written policies
263

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Compliance Attorney for 24 hours) +
(Administrative Assistant for 3 hours) + (Senior Business Analyst for 3 hours) + (Risk
Management Specialist for 30 hours)) = 60 hours x 1 respondent clearing agency = 60 hours.

hours.

and procedures created in response to the rule and also requires an annual review of collateral
haircuts and concentration limits. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 267 the Commission
preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) would impose
an aggregate annual burden on a respondent clearing agency of 36 hours. 268 The Commission
notes that the estimated ongoing burden for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) is similar to the initial one-time
burden because the rule requires policies and procedures for a not-less-than-annual review of the
sufficiency of a covered clearing agency’s collateral haircuts and concentration limits.
6. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)
The Commission has previously estimated that the PRA burdens for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)
are more significant than in other cases under Rule 17Ad-22(e) and may require a respondent
clearing agency to make substantial changes to its written rules, policies, and procedures
pursuant to the rule. 269 For example, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) requires one-time systems adjustments
to perform daily backtesting and monthly (or more frequent) sensitivity analyses. As a result, the
Commission preliminarily estimates that a respondent clearing agency would incur an aggregate
one-time burden of 180 hours to review and revise existing policies and procedures and to create
new policies and procedures, as necessary. 270

Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. The
rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to the written policies
and procedures created in response to the rule and activities associated with daily backtesting,
monthly (or more frequent) sensitivity analyses, and annual model validation. Based on the
Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance burdens with respect
to Rule 17Ad-22, 271 the Commission preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities required
by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) would impose an aggregate annual burden on a respondent clearing
agency of 60 hours. 272
7. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)
The Commission estimates that the PRA burdens for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) are more
significant than in other cases under Rule 17Ad-22(e) and may require a respondent clearing
agency to make substantial changes to its written rules, policies, and procedures pursuant to the
rule. 273 For example, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) requires one-time systems adjustments to test the
sufficiency of its liquid resources, test its access to liquidity providers, and perform an annual
model validation. As a result, the Commission preliminarily estimates that a respondent clearing

(Computer Operations Manager for 40 hours) + (Chief Compliance Officer for 15 hours) +
(Senior Programmer for 10 hours)) = 180 hours x 1 respondent clearing agency = 180 hours.

agency would incur an aggregate one-time burden of 330 hours to review and revise existing
policies and procedures. 274
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. The
rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to policies and
procedures created in response to the rule as well as activities related to testing the sufficiency of
its liquidity resources, testing access to its liquidity providers, and performing an annual model
validation. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and
compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 275 the Commission preliminarily estimates
that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) would impose an aggregate annual
burden on a respondent clearing agency of 128 hours. 276
8. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) contains substantially similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(12). 277
The Commission therefore expects that a respondent clearing agency has written rules, policies,
and procedures substantially similar to the requirements in the rule and that the PRA burden
includes the incremental burdens of reviewing current policies and procedures and revising them,

corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for Rule 17Ad22(d)(12), 278 the Commission preliminarily estimates that a respondent clearing agency would
incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 12 hours to review and revise existing
policies and procedures. 279
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. The
rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 280 the Commission
preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) would impose
an aggregate annual burden on a respondent clearing agency of approximately 5 hours. 281

incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 12 hours to review and revise existing
policies and procedures. 289
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and

can contain losses and liquidity demands and continue to meet its obligations. Rule 17Ad22(e)(13) contains similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11) but also imposes additional
requirements that do not appear in Rule 17Ad-22. 297 The Commission therefore expects that a
respondent clearing agency may have written rules, policies, and procedures similar to some
requirements in the rule and that the PRA burden includes the incremental burdens of reviewing
and revising existing policies and procedures pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) and creating new
policies and procedures, as necessary. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and procedures
requirements and the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11), 298 the Commission preliminarily believes that a respondent clearing
agency would incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 60 hours to review and
revise existing policies and procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as
necessary. 299
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires policies and procedures for the annual review and testing of a clearing agency’s
default policies and procedures. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing

impose an aggregate annual burden on a respondent clearing agency of approximately 9 hours. 301
13. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14)
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14), a respondent clearing agency is a registered
clearing agency that provides CCP services for security-based swaps. Such clearing agencies
generally have written policies and procedures regarding the segregation and portability of
customer positions and collateral as a result of applicable rules and regulations notwithstanding
Rule 17Ad-22. 302 The Commission therefore expects that a respondent clearing agency has
written rules, policies, and procedures substantially similar to the requirements in the rule and
that the PRA burden includes the incremental burdens of reviewing current policies and
procedures and revising them, where appropriate, pursuant to the rule. Accordingly, the
Commission estimates that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) imposes on respondent clearing agencies an
aggregate one-time burden of 36 hours to review and revise existing policies and procedures. 303
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing

This figure was calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney for 9 hours) x 1 respondent
clearing agency = 9 hours.
302

See, e.g., 77 FR 6336 (Feb. 7, 2012) (CFTC adopting rules imposing LSOC on DCOs for
cleared swaps). Because the respondent clearing agency is subject to the CFTC’s segregation
and portability requirements for cleared swaps, the Commission has previously expected that the
burden imposed by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) will be limited. See CCA Standards adopting release,
supra note 7, at 438.
303

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 12 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 10 hours) + (Computer Operations Manager for 7 hours) + (Senior
Business Analyst for 7 hours)) = 36 hours x 1 respondent clearing agency that provides CCP
services = 36 hours.

preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) would
impose an aggregate annual burden on a respondent clearing agency of approximately 6 hours. 305
14. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)
Because Rule 17Ad-22(d) does not include requirements related to general business risk,
the Commission estimates that the PRA burdens for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) are more significant
than in other cases under Rule 17Ad-22(e) and may require a respondent clearing agency to
make substantial changes to its written rules, policies, and procedures pursuant to the rule. 306
The Commission preliminarily estimates that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) would impose an aggregate
one-time burden on a respondent clearing agency of 210 hours to review and revise existing
policies and procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as necessary. 307
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) requires a respondent clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain a viable plan,
approved by its board of directors and updated at least annually, for raising additional equity in
the event that the covered clearing agency’s liquid net assets fall below the level required by the

includes the incremental burdens of reviewing current policies and procedures and revising them,
where appropriate, pursuant to the rule. Accordingly, based on the similar provisions and the
corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for Rule 17Ad-22(d)(3), 311

Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 313 the Commission
preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) would
impose an aggregate annual burden on a respondent clearing agency of 6 hours. 314
16. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) contains similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(4) but also imposes

expects that a respondent clearing agency may have written rules, policies, and procedures
similar to the requirements in the rule and that the PRA burden includes the incremental burdens
of reviewing and revising current policies and procedures and creating new policies and
procedures, as necessary, pursuant to the rule. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and

necessary. 317
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 318 the Commission

Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) contains similar provisions to Rules 17Ad-22(b)(5) through (7) and
(d)(2). 320 The Commission therefore expects that a respondent clearing agency may have written
rules, policies, and procedures similar to the requirements in the rule and that the PRA burden
includes the incremental burdens of reviewing and revising current policies and procedures and
creating new policies and procedures, as necessary, pursuant to the rule. Accordingly, based on
the similar policies and procedures requirements and the corresponding burden estimates

previously made by the Commission for Rules 17Ad-22(b)(5) through (7) and (d)(2), 321 the
Commission preliminarily estimates that a respondent clearing agency would incur an aggregate
one-time burden of 44 hours to review and revise existing policies and procedures and to create
new policies and procedures, as necessary. 322
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 323 the Commission
preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities required by the rule would impose an
aggregate annual burden on a respondent clearing agency of 7 hours. 324
18. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19)
Tiered participation arrangements are not addressed by Rule 17Ad-22(d). The
Commission therefore expects that a respondent clearing agency may need to create policies and
procedures pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19). 325 The Commission estimates that Rule 17Ad22(e)(19) imposes an aggregate one-time burden on respondent clearing agencies of 44 hours to
321

adopting release, supra note 31, at 66260–63.

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 10 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 7 hours) + Computer Operations Manager for 15 hours) + (Senior
Business Analyst for 5 hours) + (Chief Compliance Officer for 5 hours) + (Senior Programmer
for 2 hours)) = 44 hours x 1 respondent clearing agency = 44 hours.

clearing agency = 7 hours.

review and revise existing policies and procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as
necessary. 326
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 327 the Commission
preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities required by the rule would impose an annual
aggregate burden on a respondent clearing agency of 7 hours. 328
19. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) contains similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(7) but also adds
additional requirements that do not appear in Rule 17Ad-22(d). 329 The Commission therefore
expects that a respondent clearing agency may have written rules, policies, and procedures
similar to the requirements in the rule and that the PRA burden includes the incremental burdens
of reviewing and revising current policies and procedures and creating new policies and
procedures, as necessary, pursuant to the rule. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and

326

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 10 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 7 hours) + (Computer Operations Manager for 15 hours) + (Senior
Business Analyst for 5 hours) + (Chief Compliance Officer for 5 hours) + (Senior Programmer
for 2 hours)) = 44 hours x 1 respondent clearing agency = 44 hours.

clearing agency = 7 hours.

procedures requirements and compliance burdens associated with Rule 17Ad-22(d)(7), 330 the
Commission preliminarily believes that a respondent clearing agency would incur an aggregate
one-time burden of approximately 44 hours to review and revise existing policies and
procedures. 331
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 332 the Commission
preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities required by the rule would impose an
aggregate annual burden on a respondent clearing agency of 7 hours. 333
20. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) contains similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(6) but also adds
additional requirements that do not appear in Rule 17Ad-22(d). 334 The Commission therefore
expects that a respondent clearing agency may have written rules, policies, and procedures
similar to the requirements in the rule and that the PRA burden includes the incremental burdens

(Compliance Attorney for 7 hours) + (Senior Business Analyst for 5 hours) + (Computer
Operations Manager for 15 hours) + (Chief Compliance Officer for 5 hours) + (Senior
Programmer for 2 hours) = 44 hours x 1 respondent clearing agency = 44 hours.

of reviewing and revising current policies and procedures and creating new policies and
procedures, as necessary, pursuant to the rule. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and
procedures requirements and the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the
Commission for Rule 17Ad-22(d)(6), 335 the Commission preliminarily estimates that a
respondent clearing agency would incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 32 hours
to review and revise existing policies and procedures. 336
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 337 the Commission
preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) would
impose an aggregate annual burden on a respondent clearing agency of 11 hours. 338
21. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22)
Although Rule 17Ad-22(d) does not include any requirements with provisions similar to
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22), the Commission understands that covered clearing agencies currently use
the relevant internationally accepted communication procedures and standards and therefore
335

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 447; Clearing Agency Standards
adopting release, supra note 31, at 66260–63.
336

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 10 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 7 hours) + (Senior Business Analyst for 5 hours) + (Computer
Operations Manager for 10 hours)) = 32 hours x 1 respondent clearing agency = 32 hours.

337

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 447; Clearing Agency Standards

expects that a respondent clearing agency may need to make only limited changes to its policies
and procedures under the rule. 339 Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily estimates that
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) would impose an aggregate one-time burden on a respondent clearing
agency of 24 hours to review and revise existing policies and procedures. 340
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. It
requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and procedures
under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and
compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 341 the Commission preliminarily estimates
that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) would impose an aggregate annual
burden on a respondent clearing agency of 5 hours. 342
22. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) contains similar requirements to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(9) but also
imposes substantial new requirements. 343 The Commission therefore expects that, although a
respondent clearing agency may have written rules, policies and procedures similar to those
required by some provisions under the rule, a respondent clearing agency will need to create new

339

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d), (e)(22).

340

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 2 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 6 hours) + (Computer Operations Manager for 7 hours) + (Senior
Business Analyst for 2 hours) + (Chief Compliance Officer for 5 hours) + (Senior Programmer
for 2 hours)) = 24 hours x 1 respondent clearing agency = 24 hours.

clearing agency = 5 hours.

policies and procedures to address the other provisions. Accordingly, based on the similar
policies and procedures requirements and the corresponding burden estimates previously made
by the Commission for Rule 17Ad-22(d)(9), 344 the Commission preliminarily estimates that a
respondent clearing agency would incur an aggregate one-time burden of 138 hours to review
and revise existing policies and procedures and to create policies and procedures, as
necessary. 345
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 346 the Commission
preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) would
impose an aggregate annual burden on a respondent clearing agency of 34 hours. 347
23. Total Burden for Rule 17Ad-22(e)
The Commission preliminarily estimates that the aggregate initial burden for a new
respondent clearing agency under Rule 17Ad-22(e) would be 1,567 hours. The aggregate
ongoing burden for a new respondent clearing agency under Rule 17Ad-22(e) would be 502
344

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 449; Clearing Agency Standards
adopting release, supra note 31, at 66260–63.

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 38 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 24 hours) + (Computer Operations Manager for 32 hours) + (Senior
Business Analyst for 18 hours) + (Chief Compliance Officer for 18 hours) + (Senior Programmer
for 8 hours)) = 138 hours x 1 respondent clearing agency = 138 hours.

hours. Further, the Commission preliminarily estimates that, under Rule 17Ad-22(e) and the
proposed amendment to the definition of “covered clearing agency,” all respondent clearing
agencies would incur an aggregate initial burden of 12,343 hours under Rule 17Ad-22(e) and an
aggregate ongoing burden of 4,039 hours.
24. Total Burden for Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1)
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1), a respondent clearing agency is a registered clearing
agency that provides CCP services. In the CCA Standards adopting release the Commission
estimated that respondent clearing agencies would incur both initial and ongoing burdens under
Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1). Specifically, the Commission estimated that Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1) would
impose on a respondent clearing agency a one-time burden of 110 hours. 348 The Commission
preliminarily believes that this estimate remains correct and that a respondent clearing agency
would incur an aggregate one-time burden of 110 hours to perform adjustments needed to
synthesize and format existing information in a manner sufficient to explain the methodology
used to meet the requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1). 349
In addition, the Commission estimated that Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1) would impose ongoing
burdens on a respondent clearing agency of three hours per respondent clearing agency. 350 The
Commission preliminarily believes that this estimate remains correct and that the ongoing
348

See CCA Standards adopting release, supra note 7, at 452–453. This figure was
calculated as follows: ((Chief Compliance Officer at 44 hours) + (Computer Operations
Department Manager at 44 hours) + (Senior Programmer at 22 hours)) = 110 hours.
349

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Chief Compliance Officer at 44 hours) +
(Computer Operations Department Manager at 44 hours) + (Senior Programmer at 22 hours)) =
110 hours x 1 respondent clearing agency = 110 hours.

350

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Compliance Attorney at 1 hour) + (Computer
Operations Department Manager at 2 hours)) = 3 hours per quarter × 4 quarters per year = 12
hours.

153

activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1) would impose an aggregate annual burden on
respondent clearing agencies of 120 hours to perform adjustments needed to synthesize and
format existing information in a manner sufficient to explain the methodology used to meet the
requirements of the rule. 351
D. Collection of Information is Mandatory
The collection of information requirements for Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1) and (e) are
mandatory.
E. Confidentiality
The Commission preliminarily expects that the policies and procedures developed
pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e) would be communicated to the participants, as applicable, of each
respondent clearing agency and, as applicable, the public. A respondent clearing agency would
be required to preserve such policies and procedures in accordance with, and for the periods
specified in, Rules 17a-1 and 17a-4(e)(7) under the Exchange Act. 352 To the extent that the
Commission receives confidential information pursuant to this collection of information, such
information would be kept confidential subject to the provisions of applicable law. 353

351

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Compliance Attorney at 2 hours) + (Computer
Operations Department Manager at 3 hours)) = 5 hours per quarter × 4 quarters per year = 20
hours x 1 respondent clearing agency = 20 hours.
352

See 17 CFR 240.17a-1 and 17a-4(e)(7).

353

See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act provides an
exemption for trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and
privileged or confidential. See 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). Exemption 8 of the Freedom of Information
Act provides an exemption for matters that are contained in or related to examination, operating,
or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the
regulation or supervision of financial institutions. See 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8).

154

F. Request for Comments
The Commission invites comments on all of the above estimates. Pursuant to 44 U.S.C.
3506(c)(2)(B), the Commission requests comment in order to (a) evaluate whether the collection
of information is necessary for the proper performance of our functions, including whether the
information will have practical utility; (b) evaluate the accuracy of our estimates of the burden of
the collection of information; (c) determine whether there are ways to enhance the quality,
utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; (d) evaluate whether there are ways to
minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who respond, including through
the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology; and (e)
determine whether there are cost savings associated with the collection of information that have
not been identified in this proposal.
Persons submitting comments on the collection of information requirements should direct
them to the Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503,
and should also send a copy of their comments to Brent J. Fields, Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549-1090, with reference to File
Number S7-23-16. Requests for materials submitted to OMB by the Commission with regard to
this collection of information should be in writing, with reference to File Number S7-23-16, and
be submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F
Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549-2736. As OMB is required to make a decision concerning
the collections of information between 30 and 60 days after publication, a comment to OMB is
best assured of having its full effect if OMB receives it by [INSERT DATE THAT IS 30 DAYS
FROM THE DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER].

V. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act
Under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, a rule is
considered “major” where, if adopted, it results or is likely to result in (i) an annual effect on the
economy of $100 million or more (either in the form of an increase or a decrease); (ii) a major
increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or (iii) significant adverse
effect on competition, investment, or innovation. 354 The Commission requests comment on the
potential impact of the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 on the economy on an annual
basis, any potential increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries, and any
potential effect on competition, investment, or innovation. Commenters are requested to provide
empirical data and other factual support for their views to the extent possible.
VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) requires the Commission, in promulgating rules,
to consider the impact of those rules on small entities. 355 Section 603(a) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 356 as amended by the RFA, generally requires the Commission to undertake a
regulatory flexibility analysis of all proposed rules to determine the impact of such rulemaking
on “small entities.” 357 Section 605(b) of the RFA states that this requirement shall not apply to

354

Pub. L. 104-121, 110 Stat. 857 (1996) (codified in various sections of 5 U.S.C., 15 U.S.C.
and as a note to 5 U.S.C. 601).
355

See 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

356

5 U.S.C. 603(a).

357

Section 601(b) of the RFA permits agencies to formulate their own definitions of “small
entities.” See 5 U.S.C. 601(b). The Commission has adopted definitions for the term “small
entity” for the purposes of rulemaking in accordance with the RFA. These definitions, as
relevant to this proposed rulemaking, are set forth in Rule 0-10, 17 CFR 240.0-10.

156

any proposed rule which, if adopted, would not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities. 358
A. Registered Clearing Agencies
The proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 would apply to registered clearing agencies
that are CCPs, CSDs, or SSSs. For the purposes of Commission rulemaking and as applicable to
the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22, a small entity includes, when used with reference to a clearing
agency, a clearing agency that (i) compared, cleared, and settled less than $500 million in
securities transactions during the preceding fiscal year, (ii) had less than $200 million of funds
and securities in its custody or control at all times during the preceding fiscal year (or at any time
that it has been in business, if shorter), and (iii) is not affiliated with any person (other than a
natural person) that is not a small business or small organization. 359
Based on the Commission’s existing information about the clearing agencies currently
registered with the Commission, 360 the Commission preliminarily believes that all such
registered clearing agencies exceed the thresholds defining “small entities” set out above. While
other clearing agencies may emerge and seek to register as clearing agencies with the
358

See 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

359

See 17 CFR 240.0-10(d).

360

In 2015, DTCC processed $1.508 quadrillion in financial transactions. Within DTCC,
DTC settled $112.3 trillion of securities and held securities valued at $45.4 trillion, NSCC
processed an average daily value of $976.6 billion in equity securities, and FICC cleared $917.1
trillion of transactions in government securities and $48.2 trillion of transactions in agency
mortgage-backed securities. See DTCC, 2015 Annual Report, available at
http://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2015/index.php. OCC cleared more than 4.1 billion contracts and
held margin of $98.3 billion at the end of 2015. See OCC, 2015 Annual Report, available at
http://www.theocc.com/components/docs/about/annual-reports/occ-2015-annual-report.pdf. In
addition, Intercontinental Exchange (“ICE”) averaged daily trade volume of 9.3 million and
revenues of $3.3 billion in 2015. See ICE at a glance, available at
https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/ICE_at_a_glance.pdf.

157

Commission, the Commission preliminarily does not believe that any such entities would be
“small entities” as defined in Exchange Act Rule 0-10. 361 Accordingly, the Commission
preliminarily believes that any such registered clearing agencies will exceed the thresholds for
“small entities” set forth in Exchange Act Rule 0-10.
B. Certification
For the reasons described above, the Commission certifies that the proposed amendments
to Rule 17Ad-22 would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities for purposes of the RFA. The Commission requests comment regarding this
certification. The Commission requests that commenters describe the nature of any impact on
small entities, including clearing agencies and counterparties to security and security-based swap
transactions, and provide empirical data to support the extent of the impact.
VII. Statutory Authority and Text of Proposed Amendments to Rule 17Ad-22
Pursuant to the Exchange Act, particularly Section 17A thereof, 15 U.S.C. 78q-1, and
Section 805 of the Clearing Supervision Act, 12 U.S.C. 5464, the Commission proposes to
amend Rule 17Ad-22.
List of Subjects in 17 CFR Part 240
Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Securities.
Text of Proposed Amendment
In accordance with the foregoing, title 17, chapter II of the Code of Federal Regulations
is proposed to be amended as follows:
PART 240—GENERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS, SECURITIES EXCHANGE
361

See 17 CFR 240.0-10(d). The Commission based this determination on its review of
public sources of financial information about registered clearing agencies.
