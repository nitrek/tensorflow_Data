Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or the “Commission”)
alleges as follows:

3
4

Jurisdiction And Venue
1.

The Commission brings this action against defendant, Jason A. Wallace

5

(“Wallace” or “Defendant”), for violating the federal securities laws, including

6

engaging in fraudulent acts involving retail investors, acting as an unregistered

7

broker, and selling unregistered securities. The Court has jurisdiction over this action

8

pursuant to §§ 20(b), 20(d), and 22(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”)

9

and §§ 21(d), 21(e), and 27(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange

10

Act”). [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d), 77v(a), 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa(a)]. The

11

Commission alleges that Defendant, directly and indirectly, made use of the mails,

12

the means and instruments of transportation and communication in interstate

13

commerce, and the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection

14

with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this

15

Complaint.

16

2.

Venue is proper in this district pursuant to § 22(a) of the Securities Act

17

and § 27 of the Exchange Act. [15 U.S.C. §§ 77v(a), 78aa]. Defendant is found,

18

inhabits, or transacts business in this District, and certain of the acts, practices,

19

courses of conduct, and transactions constituting violations of the federal securities

20

laws occurred in this District.

21
22

Summary
3.

Defendant engaged in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for

23

the securities of Healthient, Inc. (“Healthient”), PEI Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (“PEI

24

Worldwide”), Sycamore Ventures, Inc. (“Sycamore”), and Systems America, Inc.

25

(“Systems America”).

26

4.

These companies were microcap issuers, and there was no ready market

27

for their shares. To overcome this, two large shareholders, James Price and William

28

Alverson, engaged Wallace to create a false market for these securities and sell them
1

Case 8:16-cv-01788 Document 1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 3 of 25 Page ID #:3

1
2

to unsuspecting investors.
5.

Wallace identified and targeted potential investors and then persuaded

3

them to buy the securities at inflated prices.

4

his company — made fraudulent misrepresentations to potential investors to falsely

5

promote the securities. He also placed manipulative trades in his own brokerage

6

account to create the deceptive appearance of market interest in the stocks.

7

6.

He — directly and indirectly through

In carrying out this fraudulent sales campaign, Wallace and his company

8

acted as unregistered brokers. They also failed to comply with the federal registration

9

requirements for the Sycamore securities.

10

7.

In total, Wallace’s illegal conduct resulted in more than $2 million in

11

stock sales. Price and Alverson paid 40-50% commissions on the gross sales, with

12

Wallace and his company earning nearly half-a-million dollars from the fraudulent

13

scheme. Wallace’s victims, who number more than 200 and include retired people,

14

lost virtually all of the money that Wallace persuaded them to invest.

15

8.

By engaging in the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business

16

alleged in this Complaint, Wallace directly violated: Section 15(a) of the Exchange

17

Act; Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act;

18

Act; Section 17(a) of the Securities Act; and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and

19

Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.

20

9.

Section 9(a)(2) of the Exchange

In addition, Wallace aided and abetted violations of the federal securities

21

laws by his company and his business associate, Brian Kingsfield (“Kingsfield”). He

22

also is liable for his company’s violations as its sole control person.

23

10.

Unless this Court enjoins Wallace, he will continue to engage in

24

fraudulent conduct similar to that alleged in this Complaint. The Commission thus

25

seeks the following relief against Wallace: an injunction permanently restraining

26

Defendant from committing future violations of the federal securities laws; an order

27

requiring Defendant to disgorge all ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest; an

28

order imposing civil money penalties on Defendant; an order permanently barring
2

consistent with the evidence adduced at the trial of this case and applicable law.

Glossary Of Terms Used In This Complaint
21.

A penny stock is a security issued by a small company that generally

3

trades at less than $5 per share. Penny stocks generally are quoted over-the-counter,

4

such as on OTCBB or OTC Link. Penny stocks may trade infrequently, which means

5

their owners may have difficulty selling them.

6

22.

A boiler room is an operation that uses high-pressure sales techniques to

7

sell securities. The securities sold by boiler rooms are generally thinly traded penny

8

stocks, and the boiler room’s task is to create a market for them. The boiler room

9

generally sells the securities on behalf of either the issuer or a large shareholder. The

10
11

boiler room typically is paid a commission tied to the amount of securities sold.
23.

Cold calling is one sales technique used by boiler rooms. Telemarketers

12

or “cold callers” sell securities by making telephone sales pitches to potential

13

investors. These sales pitches often are unsolicited because the potential investors

14

have not expressed interest in buying the particular security being offered. The cold

15

caller’s job is to introduce the security to the potential investor and persuade him or

16

her to purchase it. The cold caller receives as compensation a percentage of the sales

17

that he or she is able to close.

18

24.

A buy limit order is an order to purchase a security at or below a certain

19

price. Instead of paying market price for the security, the buyer sets the price that he

20

or she is willing to pay for a certain number of shares. The buyer is guaranteed to

21

pay that price or less because the order is executed only when a seller’s price matches

22

the amount set by the buyer. If the specified price is never met, the order is not filled.

23

25.

A sell limit order is an order to sell a security at or above a certain price.

24

Instead of taking market price for a security, the seller sets the price at which he or

25

she is willing to sell a certain number of shares. The seller is guaranteed to sell at or

26

above the specified price because the order is executed only when a buyer matches

27

the seller’s price. If the specified price is never matched, the order is not filled.

Facts

2

Wallace Controlled JAW And Operated It As A Boiler Room

3
4
5

26.

Wallace incorporated JAW in California in 2007 and dissolved JAW in

27.

Wallace was JAW’s sole shareholder and president. At all relevant

2012.

6

times, Wallace was in charge of JAW’s finances, including maintaining JAW’s bank

7

account and filing JAW’s tax returns.

8
9
10

28.

From its founding until its dissolution in 2012, Wallace operated JAW as

a boiler room. He employed a team of cold callers to sell private placements.
29.

At all relevant times, Wallace was responsible for hiring, training, and

11

supervising the cold callers. He also paid their compensation, which was a portion of

12

the sales commissions that JAW received when its sales pitches resulted in sales.

13

30.

Wallace also developed and maintained “customer lists” — the names

14

and telephone numbers of potential investors whom his cold callers targeted for sales

15

pitches.

16

Wallace And His Boiler Room Created A False Market For

17

Price’s And Alverson’s Penny Stocks

18

31.

In 2010, Kingsfield approached Wallace about expanding JAW into a

19

new line of business: promoting and selling penny stocks on the open market. At that

20

time, Kingsfield was promoting and selling penny stocks for Price.

21

32.

Price owned a large number of penny stocks and wanted to expand his

22

sales operation beyond Kingsfield. Price wanted to partner with an established boiler

23

room operator with tested customer lists, but he did not want to work with any

24

registered brokers or associated individuals.

25

experienced in generating demand and closing sales but was not subject to regulatory

26

scrutiny.

27
28

33.

Price sought someone who was

Wallace satisfied Price’s criteria. Kingsfield recruited Wallace to create

a false market for Price’s penny stocks. Beginning in September 2010, Wallace and
6

Case 8:16-cv-01788 Document 1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 8 of 25 Page ID #:8

1

his boiler room solicited buyers for Price’s shares of PEI Worldwide, Sycamore, and

2

Systems America.

3
4
5

34.

Kingsfield later recruited Wallace and his boiler room to solicit buyers

for Alverson’s Healthient shares.
35.

Wallace’s job was to use his boiler room to coordinate trades between

6

investors, Price, and Alverson. Wallace’s cold callers directed investors to place buy

7

limit orders with the investors’ broker-dealers. The size and the amount of the buy

8

limit orders that Wallace and the cold callers told investors to place were dictated by

9

Price and Alverson based on how many of their shares they wanted to sell and at what

10

price. Wallace arranged for the investors to place buy limit orders, and Price and

11

Alverson placed matching sell limit orders. The corresponding limit orders were

12

executed, and Price and Alverson sold their shares to the buyers solicited by

13

Wallace’s boiler room.

14

36.

Between September 2010 and January 2012, Wallace and his boiler

15

room induced unsuspecting investors to purchase at least 1.56 million shares of

16

Healthient, at least 6.33 million shares of Sycamore, and at least 494,267 shares of

17

Systems America, as well as a number of PEI Worldwide shares, in coordinated

18

trades with Price and Alverson. Price and Alverson earned at least $2.2 million on

19

these sales and paid Wallace and his boiler room at least $440,435 in commissions.

20

Wallace Operated The Fraudulent Scheme To Sell Price’s And Alverson’s

21

Penny Stocks

22

37.

Because Wallace was new to selling penny stocks on the open market in

23

2010, he learned from Kingsfield how to operate the fraudulent sales scheme.

24

Kingsfield taught Wallace how to place buy limit orders, so that Wallace and the cold

25

callers could teach potential investors how to place orders that Price and Alverson

26

could “catch” in coordinated trades.

27
28

38.

Kingsfield also directed Wallace to open his own personal brokerage

account, so that Wallace could trade in Healthient, PEI Worldwide, Sycamore, and
7

Case 8:16-cv-01788 Document 1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 9 of 25 Page ID #:9

1
2

Systems America to create volume in the penny stocks and prop up their share prices.
39.

When Wallace’s boiler room first transitioned to selling penny stocks on

3

the open market, Kingsfield demonstrated sales pitches to the cold callers. Price also

4

met with the cold callers to generate their enthusiasm for promoting his penny stocks.

5
6
7

40.

Thereafter, Wallace assumed responsibility for operating the fraudulent

sales scheme.
41.

Wallace orally received a sales pitch from Kingsfield, Price, or Alverson

8

that detailed how many shares Price or Alverson wanted to sell and at what share

9

price. Wallace wrote down the sales pitch and gave it to his cold callers, but he did

10

not expect the cold callers to follow the scripts verbatim. Wallace closely monitored

11

the cold callers when they delivered sales pitches. In real time, Wallace directed the

12

cold callers to adjust the sales pitches to fit the needs and interests of the potential

13

investors who were on the calls. Wallace even stepped in and delivered adapted sales

14

pitches when he thought different sales tactics were needed to persuade potential

15

investors to buy. As a result, Wallace had ultimate authority over the contents of the

16

sales pitches that his cold callers delivered to potential investors.

17

42.

Wallace also set up the coordinated trades.

When an investor was

18

persuaded to buy, Wallace texted or called Kingsfield, Price, or Alverson to confirm

19

how many shares Price or Alverson wanted to sell and for how much. Wallace or a

20

cold caller then went back to the potential investor and instructed him or her to place

21

a buy limit order for the exact number of shares that Price or Alverson wanted to sell

22

at precisely the price they wanted to receive. To make the investor more comfortable

23

with the transactions, he or she was directed to use his or her own broker-dealer to

24

place the buy limit order. Wallace or a cold caller also urged the investor not to listen

25

if the broker-dealer tried to dissuade him or her from placing the buy limit order.

26

Wallace then alerted Kingsfield, Price, or Alverson that an investor was placing the

27

requested buy limit order. Price or Alverson placed a corresponding sell limit order

28

and “caught” the investor’s buy limit order. A trade was then executed between Price
8

Case 8:16-cv-01788 Document 1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 10 of 25 Page ID #:10

1

or Alverson and the investor solicited by Wallace’s boiler room. Wallace was paid a

2

commission of up to a 40-50% on each of these executed trades, which he split with

3

the cold callers and, at times, Kingsfield.

4

43.

Wallace also placed buy limit orders in his own brokerage account for

5

the purpose of creating volume and increasing the share prices of Healthient, PEI

6

Worldwide, Sycamore, and Systems America securities. At times, Wallace engaged

7

in this trading at the request of Kingsfield or Price. More often, however, Wallace

8

undertook the trading at his own initiative when he thought the stocks needed the

9

appearance of market demand and some price support.

10

44.

To maintain the appearance of a real market, Wallace took steps to

11

prevent investors from independently selling their Healthient, PEI Worldwide,

12

Sycamore, and Systems America securities into the market. Wallace and his cold

13

callers directed investors not to sell unless they went through Wallace and the boiler

14

room to find the best buyer at the best price. This was to ensure that Wallace and the

15

boiler room had an opportunity to talk the investors out of selling or at least find

16

someone else to buy the shares. Wallace, along with Kingsfield and Price, monitored

17

the over-the-counter markets in real time and looked for bids and asks in the penny

18

stocks they were promoting. When there was an order out to sell one of the penny

19

stocks they were promoting, Wallace worked to find the seller. When he did not

20

recognize the seller based on the number of shares being sold and the market maker,

21

Wallace and the cold callers called the investors they had solicited until they found

22

the investor who was selling. Then, they would try to talk the investor out of selling

23

or find a replacement investor.

24
25

Wallace And His Boiler Room Acted As Unregistered Brokers
45.

As detailed above, for more than a year, Wallace and JAW solicited

26

potential buyers for Price’s and Alverson’s securities. In the course of doing so,

27

Wallace and the cold callers introduced the potential investors to Healthient, PEI

28

Worldwide, Sycamore, and Systems America. In promoting the securities of these
9

Case 8:16-cv-01788 Document 1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 11 of 25 Page ID #:11

1

four issuers, Wallace and the cold callers advised potential investors about the returns

2

they could expect from investing in the stocks and promised guidance on when to sell

3

the securities for maximum profit. When investors were ready to purchase, Wallace

4

and the cold callers told the investors how many shares to buy at what price and

5

instructed the investors how to place buy limit orders. In total, Wallace and the cold

6

callers facilitated more than $2 million in sales for Price and Alverson. In exchange,

7

Wallace and JAW received a commission of up to 40-50% on each sale that Price and

8

Alverson made to a buyer solicited by Wallace and JAW.

9
10
11

46.

Yet, JAW never registered with the Commission as a broker, and

Wallace never associated himself with any registered broker.
47.

Therefore, Wallace and JAW acted as unregistered brokers every time

12

they called a potential investor to attempt to induce him or her to purchase Healthient,

13

PEI Worldwide, Sycamore, or Systems America securities.

14
15

Wallace And His Boiler Room Offered And Sold Unregistered Securities
48.

In addition to acting as unregistered brokers, Wallace and his boiler

16

room offered and sold unregistered Sycamore securities, or in the alternative, were

17

necessary participants and played a substantial factor in the offer and sale of

18

unregistered Sycamore securities.

19

49.

In February 2011, Price and Aero purchased 663,702 Sycamore shares in

20

private transactions. Price engaged Wallace and his boiler room to resell the shares

21

through telephone sales pitches to potential investors.

22

50.

From February 2011 through April 18, 2011, Wallace and his boiler

23

room offered and sold at least 83,550 Sycamore shares to investors, with gross sales

24

totaling at least $68,586.

25

51.

All of those offers and sales were unregistered because no Sycamore

26

registration statement was ever filed or in effect with the Commission and thus

27

purchasers in those unregistered transactions were deprived of the information that

28

should have been set forth in a registration statement.
10

Wallace And His Boiler Room Made Materially False Statements And

2

Omissions To Investors

3

52.

Wallace and his boiler room cold callers made numerous material

4

misstatements and omissions to prospective investors about the Healthient, PEI

5

Worldwide, Sycamore, and Systems America securities.

6

53.

Wallace and the cold callers misrepresented who hired them to promote

7

the penny stocks. With respect to each security, Wallace and the cold callers falsely

8

told prospective investors that “the company” — meaning the issuer — was paying

9

for the stock promotion. In truth, Price and Alverson hired Wallace and his boiler

10

room, and the securities promoted were Price’s and Alverson’s own shares. Wallace

11

and the cold callers never disclosed to potential investors Price’s and Alverson’s

12

identities, their roles in the sales campaigns, or that they were the sources of the

13

shares that were available to purchase.

14

54.

Wallace and the cold callers directed investors to place buy limit orders

15

for certain quantities of the penny stocks at certain prices. In doing so, Wallace and

16

the cold callers omitted material facts about the purpose and operation of the buy

17

limit orders. For example, Wallace and the cold callers never disclosed that they

18

were setting the size of the buy limit orders based on how many shares Price and

19

Alverson wanted to sell at what price. Wallace and the cold callers also did not

20

disclose that Wallace was coordinating with Price and Alverson to place

21

corresponding sell limit orders to ensure that the trades were executed. In addition to

22

not disclosing that Wallace was working both sides of the trades, Wallace and the

23

cold callers did not tell investors when they were directing them to place buy limit

24

orders that those buy limit orders would result in executed trades that would pay a 40-

25

50% commission to Wallace and the boiler room.

26

unaware that the sales commissions were a direct and substantial percentage of the

27

buy limit orders that Wallace and the cold callers were instructing investors to place.

28

55.

As a result, investors were

Wallace and the cold callers also made false statements about the nature
11

Case 8:16-cv-01788 Document 1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 13 of 25 Page ID #:13

1

of the sales campaign. Wallace and the cold callers affirmatively told potential

2

investors that the telephone sales pitches were only the initial phase and that a “viral”

3

email marketing campaign would follow once the securities reached certain selling

4

prices. Potential investors were led to believe that the penny stocks would be worth

5

more after the “viral” email marketing campaign started. In fact, no “viral” email

6

marketing campaign was undertaken or even contemplated.

7
8

56.

Additionally, Wallace and the cold callers made false price predictions

to induce potential investors to purchase the penny stocks. For example,

9

 On or about January 11, 2011, a cold caller induced an investor to buy

10

Systems America stock at $2.45 per share by promising that price would

rise to $9 per share.

12

 A cold caller induced an investor to purchase Sycamore securities on or

13

about January 25, 2011 at $0.30 per share by promising that the stock’s

14

price would reach $2-3 per share.
 On or about July 27, 2011 Wallace promised one potential investor that

15

“the [Sycamore] stock will go up in value with every single trade.”

16
17

 Also, on or about July 27, 2011, Wallace promised a prospective

18

investor that Sycamore’s share price would increase from $0.06 per

19

share to $5.00 per share in one year.

20

 On or about August 15, 2011, a cold caller induced an investor to

21

purchase Healthient shares for $0.17 per share by promising that the

22

price would reach $5.00 per share.

23

57.

These price predictions were false when Wallace and the cold callers

24

made them. The forecasted share prices did not reflect how much the penny stocks

25

were worth or how they reasonably could be expected to perform in the future.

26

Indeed, neither Wallace nor anyone else undertook an analysis of the issuers’

27

financial performance or operations. Instead, Wallace directed the cold callers to

28

project price increases that would induce buyers to purchase Price’s and Alverson’s
12

Case 8:16-cv-01788 Document 1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 14 of 25 Page ID #:14

1

shares at the sought-after prices. Whether an increase in share price was significant

2

enough to induce a purchase was the only metric used in making the price

3

predictions.

4

Worldwide, Sycamore, and Systems America would collapse when his boiler room

5

stopped promoting the securities and he stopped propping up their prices with

6

manipulative trades.

7

58.

In fact, Wallace knew that the share prices of Healthient, PEI

In addition to making false price predictions, Wallace and the cold

8

callers at times falsely promised risk-free investments: one investor was assured on or

9

about January 20, 2011 that he would be reimbursed fully if he sustained any

10

investing losses on Systems America stock. This was false. Systems America never

11

intended to reimburse any losses on its shares because the issuer had no role in the

12

sales campaign. Price, Kingsfield, Wallace, and the cold callers never intended to

13

reimburse any investment losses either. Price, Kingsfield, Wallace, and the cold

14

callers knew that investment losses were inevitable once the fraudulent sales

15

campaign ended, and the fraudulent sales campaign lasted only as long as it took to

16

sell Price’s Systems America shares for maximum profit.

17

59.

In addition to making misstatements to induce potential investors to

18

purchase the penny stocks, Wallace and the cold callers made false statements to stop

19

the investors from selling the Healthient, PEI Worldwide, Sycamore, and Systems

20

America securities that they already owned. The price predictions and occasional no-

21

risk guarantees were repeated to convince investors to hold or re-purchase their

22

shares. The investors were assured that Wallace and the cold callers would tell the

23

investors the right time to sell. Wallace and the cold callers only made this promise

24

to ensure that the investors would hold onto their shares; Wallace and the cold callers

25

never intended to tell the investors the right time to sell so that they would avoid

26

losses.

27
28

60.

Wallace knew, or was reckless or negligent in not knowing, that the

statements detailed in paragraphs 53-59 were materially false and misleading.

Wallace Artificially Inflated Trading Volume And Share Prices
61.

Wallace engaged in his own manipulative trading to further induce

3

investors to purchase the Healthient, PEI Worldwide, Sycamore, and Systems

4

America securities.

5

62.

Wallace bought and sold small amounts of the stocks with his own

6

money. There was no legitimate purpose for his trading. He engaged in it to increase

7

the securities’ trading volume and prop up their share prices — a practice that he and

8

Kingsfield referred to as “painting” and “lifting” the stocks. Wallace considered the

9

stock purchases and any investment losses he inevitably sustained on them “a cost of

10
11

doing business” because the trading supported his boiler room operations.
63.

On numerous occasions, Wallace placed buy limit orders for 100-200

12

shares of the penny stocks. Wallace’s buy limit orders resulted in 208 executed

13

trades in these securities.

14
15

64.

The vast majority of Wallace’s executed trades were at prices higher

than the securities’ last reported trades. For example,

16

 Wallace had nine executed trades in PEI Worldwide securities, and

17

seven of those were executed at a higher price than the last reported

18

trade.
 Wallace had 61 executed trades in Healthient securities, and 56 of those

19

were executed at a higher price than the last reported trade.

20

 Wallace had 56 executed trades in Systems America securities, and 51 of

21

those were executed at a higher price than the last reported trade.

22

 Wallace had 81 executed trades in Sycamore securities, and 80 of those

23

were executed at a higher price than the last reported trade.

24
25
26
27
28

65.

Indeed, Wallace’s executed trades set the highest price for the trading

day 99 different times.
66.

Wallace’s executed trades created the appearance of an active market for

the securities of Healthient, PEI Worldwide, Sycamore, and Systems America and
14

Case 8:16-cv-01788 Document 1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 16 of 25 Page ID #:16

artificially inflated their share prices for the purpose of inducing investors to buy.
