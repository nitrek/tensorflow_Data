INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940
Release No. 4339 / February 23, 2016
Admin. Proc. File No. 3-15323
In the Matter of
SANDEEP GOYAL

ORDER VACATING BAR ORDER
Sandeep Goyal seeks to vacate a Commission order barring him from association with
any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer
agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.1 The order was issued pursuant to
Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 19402 based on a judgment permanently
enjoining Goyal from violating certain provisions of the securities laws,3 and Goyal’s prior guilty
plea to securities law violations.4 On October 27, 2015, following the decision in United States
v. Newman,5 an order of nolle prosequi was entered in the criminal proceeding against Goyal,6
and on January 14, 2016, the civil judgment against him was vacated.7
Goyal argues that the basis for the bar order against him no longer exists, and he requests
that it be vacated.8 The Division of Enforcement does not oppose Goyal’s request.

Goyal frames his motion as a request that we “[r]everse the Initial Decision against [him]
that has since become the Final Decision” and dismiss this proceeding. We construe his motion
as a request to vacate the bar. First, because the bar order was entered in a settled proceeding,

2
We have held that administrative bar orders will remain in place in the usual case and are
vacated only in “compelling circumstances.”9 We have found such compelling circumstances
where, as here, the basis for the bar imposed has been vacated.10
In light of the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED that the bar order entered on May 9, 2013,
against Sandeep Goyal is hereby vacated.
By the Commission

Brent J. Fields
Secretary

see supra note 1, there is no initial decision or finality order making one effective that could be
reversed. Second, because the bar order already became effective, we consider whether it should
be vacated, not whether this proceeding should be dismissed. Compare Todd Newman, Advisers
Act Release No. 4084, 2015 WL 2328705, at *1 (May 15, 2015) (vacating bar order based on
judicial developments occurring after its effectiveness) with Anthony Chiasson, Advisers Act
Release No. 4085, 2015 WL 2328706, at *1 (May 15, 2015) (dismissing proceeding based on
same developments where Commission had not entered a final bar order).
