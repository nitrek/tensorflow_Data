GlaxoSmithKline Pays $20 Million Penalty to Settle FCPA Violations
September 30, 2016 – The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that
GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GSK”) has agreed to pay $20 million to settle charges that it violated the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its China-based subsidiaries engaged in pay-toprescribe schemes to increase sales.
An SEC investigation found that the schemes spanned a period of years and involved the transfer
of money, gifts, and other things of value to health care professionals, which led to millions of
dollars in increased sales of GSK pharmaceutical products to China’s state health institutions.
The participants included certain complicit sales and marketing managers within GSK’s Chinabased subsidiaries. GSK failed to devise and maintain a sufficient system of internal accounting
controls and lacked an effective anti-corruption compliance program to detect and prevent these
schemes. As a result, the improper payments were not accurately reflected in GSK’s books and
records.
The SEC’s order finds that GSK violated the FCPA’s internal controls and books-and-records
provisions. GSK consented to the order without admitting or denying the findings, and agreed to
pay a $20 million civil penalty. GSK also agreed to provide status reports to the SEC for the
next two years on its remediation and implementation of anti-corruption compliance measures.
