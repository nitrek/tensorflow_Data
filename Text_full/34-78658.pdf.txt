Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), against Martin J. Lawler (“Respondent”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings

On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds1 that:
1

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

Summary
1.
Respondent violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act by acting as an
unregistered broker-dealer in connection with his representation of clients who were seeking U.S.
residency through the Immigrant Investor Program. Respondent, an immigration attorney,
recommended that his clients participate in the Immigrant Investor Program by investing in
securities offered through an EB-5 Regional Center and helped effect the purchases. In addition to
receiving legal fees from his clients, Respondent received a commission from the Regional Center
for each investment he facilitated.
Respondent
2.
Martin J. Lawler, age 64, is a resident of San Francisco, California. He is a licensed
attorney specializing in immigration. During the relevant time period, he was a partner of a law
firm located in San Francisco, California.
Background
3.
The United States Congress created the Immigrant Investor Program, also known as
“EB-5,” in 1990 to stimulate the U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by
foreign investors. The Program offers EB-5 visas to individuals who invest $1 million in a new
commercial enterprise that creates or preserves at least 10 full-time jobs for qualifying U.S.
workers (or $500,000 in an enterprise located in a rural area or an area of high unemployment). A
certain number of EB-5 visas are set aside for investors in approved Regional Centers. A Regional
Center is defined as “any economic unit, public or private, which is involved with the promotion of
economic growth, including increased export sales, improved regional productivity, job creation,
and increased domestic capital investment.” 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e) (2015).
4.
Typical Regional Center investment vehicles are offered as limited partnership
interests. The partnership interests are securities, usually offered pursuant to one or more
exemptions from the registration requirements of the U.S. securities laws. The Regional Centers
are often managed by a person or entity which acts as a general partner of the limited partnership.
The Regional Centers, the investment vehicles, and the managers are collectively referred to herein
as “EB-5 Investment Offerers.”
5.
Various EB-5 Investment Offerers paid commissions to anyone who successfully
facilitated the sale of limited partnership interests to new investors.
Respondent Received Commissions for His Clients’ EB-5 Investments
6.
From at least June 2009 through September 2011, Respondent received
commissions from one EB-5 Investment Offerer totaling $115,000.
7.
Respondent performed activities necessary to effectuate the transactions in EB-5
securities, including recommending one or more EB-5 Investment Offerers to his clients; acting as
2

a liaison between the EB-5 Investment Offerers and the investors; and assisting in the
documentation of investment funds to the EB-5 Investment Offerers. Respondent received
transaction-based commissions for his services from the EB-5 Investment Offerer. While some of
Respondent’s activities overlapped with legal services, for which he received fees, Respondent was
paid transaction-based compensation for the activities which effectuated the investor’s transactions
in EB-5 securities.
8.
As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent violated Section 15(a)(1) of
the Exchange Act which makes it unlawful for any broker or dealer which is either a person other
than a natural person or a natural person not associated with a broker or dealer to make use of the
mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce “to effect any transactions in, or to
induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security” unless such broker or dealer is
registered in accordance with Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent Martin J. Lawler’s Offer.
Accordingly, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, it is hereby ORDERED that:
A.
Respondent shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and
any future violations of Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.
B.
Respondent shall pay disgorgement of $115,000 and prejudgment interest of
$25,997, to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the general fund of the United

following installments: (1) 50% of the total amount within ten (10) days of the entry of this Order,
(2) 25% of the total amount within ninety (90) days of the entry of this Order, and (3) 25% of the
total amount within one-hundred-eighty (180) days of the entry of this Order. If any payment is
not made by the date the payment is required by this Order, the entire outstanding balance of
disgorgement and prejudgment interest, plus any additional interest accrued pursuant to SEC Rule
of Practice 600, shall be due and payable immediately, without further application.
Payment must be made in one of the following ways:

Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which will

Respondent, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other
amounts due by Respondent under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree
or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by
Respondent of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set
forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(19).

By the Commission.
