POSTPONEMENT ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings on January 27, 2016, pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, and the hearing was scheduled to commence on February 22, 2016. The
proceeding is a follow-on proceeding based on Respondent Moazzam “Mark” Malik’s 2015
conviction of several felonies under New York state law, including grand larceny, forgery, and
securities fraud. Malik is currently incarcerated.
The Division of Enforcement has requested that the hearing be postponed in order for it to:
(1) ascertain whether Malik has been properly served with the OIP; (2) to contact Malik to find out
whether he plans to submit an answer to the OIP; and (3) try to schedule a time for a telephonic
prehearing conference. Consistent with 17 C.F.R. § 201.161, the hearing will be postponed sine
die. The Division will report on its efforts by March 11, 2016.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
