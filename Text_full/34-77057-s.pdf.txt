Airline Executive Settles FCPA Charges
Feb. 4, 2016 – The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that the CEO of
South American-based LAN Airlines has agreed to settle charges that he violated the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when he authorized improper payments to a third-party consultant
who may have passed some money to union officials in the midst of a dispute between the airline
and its unionized employees in Argentina.
An SEC investigation found that Ignacio Cueto Plaza, who was serving as president and chief
operating officer at the time, authorized a sham consulting agreement and the company wired
$1.15 million in payments to the consultant’s Virginia-based brokerage account. The unsigned
agreement falsely stated that the consultant would undertake a study of existing air routes in
Argentina. Cueto knew no such study would be performed and the consultant instead agreed to
help settle the labor dispute, and Cueto also understood it was possible that the consultant would
pass a portion of the payments along to union officials in Argentina. Cueto approved the
payments to get the unions to abandon their threats to enforce the single-function rule and to get
them to accept a wage increase lower than the amount asked for in negotiations.
The SEC’s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding finds that Cueto violated the
internal accounting controls, books and records, and false records provisions of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the findings, Cueto agreed to pay a
$75,000 penalty and must certify his compliance with the airline’s policies and procedures by
attending anti-corruption training among other undertakings.
The SEC’s continuing investigation is being conducted by Denise Hansberry and Tracy L. Price
of the FCPA Unit and supervised by Kara N. Brockmeyer. The SEC appreciates the assistance
of the Justice Department’s Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the
agency also thanks foreign authorities including the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority for
their assistance.
