Introduction
The Commission is adopting Rules 15Fh-1 through 15Fh-6 and Rule 15Fk-1 to

implement the business conduct standards and chief compliance officer (“CCO”)
requirements for security-based swap dealers (“SBS Dealers”) and major security-based
swap participants (“Major SBS Participants” and, together with SBS Dealers, “SBS
Entities”) as set forth in Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. 1 The Commission is also
amending Rules 3a67-10 and 3a71-3 and adopting Rule 3a71-6 with respect to the crossborder application of the rules and the availability of substituted compliance.

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010).

The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, among other reasons, to promote the financial
stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the
financial system. 2 The 2008 financial crisis highlighted significant issues in the over-thecounter derivatives markets, which experienced dramatic growth in the years leading up
to the financial crisis and are capable of affecting significant sectors of the U.S. economy.
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act provides for a comprehensive new regulatory framework
for swaps and security-based swaps by, among other things: (1) providing for the
registration and comprehensive regulation of SBS Entities, swap dealers (“Swap
Dealers”), and major swap participants (“Major Swap Participants” and, together with
Swap Dealers, “Swap Entities”); (2) imposing clearing and trade execution requirements
for swaps and security-based swaps, subject to certain exceptions; (3) creating
recordkeeping, regulatory reporting, and public dissemination requirements for swaps
and security-based swaps; and (4) enhancing the rulemaking and enforcement authorities
of the Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”).
The Commission initially proposed Rules 15Fh-1 through 15Fh-6 and Rule 15Fk1 in June 2011. 3 In May 2013, the Commission re-opened the comment period for all of
its outstanding Title VII rulemakings, including the external business conduct
rulemaking. 4

briefly described immediately below. A detailed discussion of each rule follows in
Sections II.A. – II.J, below. 11
A.

Summary of Final Rules

Rule 15Fh-1, as adopted, defines the scope of Rules 15Fh-1 through 15Fh-6 and
Rule 15Fk-1, and provides that an SBS Entity can rely on the written representations of a
counterparty or its representative to satisfy its due diligence requirements under the rules,
unless it has information that would cause a reasonable person to question the accuracy of
the representation.
Rule 15Fh-2, as adopted, sets forth the definitions used throughout Rules 15Fh-1
through 15Fh-6. The defined terms are discussed in connection with the rules in which
they appear.
Rule 15Fh-3, as adopted, defines the business conduct requirements generally
applicable to SBS Entities with respect to: (1) verification of counterparty status as an
eligible contract participant (“ECP”) or special entity; (2) disclosure to the counterparty
of material information about the security-based swap, including material risks,
characteristics, incentives, and conflicts of interest; (3) disclosure of information
concerning the daily mark of the security-based swap; (4) disclosure regarding the ability
of the counterparty to require clearing of the security-based swap; (5) communication
with counterparties in a fair and balanced manner based on principles of fair dealing and

11

If any of the provisions of these rules, or the application thereof to any person or
circumstance, is held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions
or application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances that can be
given effect without the invalid provision or application.

11

good faith; and (6) the establishment of a supervisory and compliance infrastructure.
Rule 15Fh-3, as adopted, additionally requires an SBS Dealer to: (1) establish, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to obtain and retain a
record of the essential facts concerning each known counterparty that are necessary to
conduct business with that counterparty; and (2) comply with certain suitability
obligations when recommending a security-based swap, or trading strategy involving a
security-based swap, to a counterparty.
Rule 15Fh-4(a), as adopted, provides that it shall be unlawful for an SBS Entity
to: (i) employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any special entity or prospective
customer who is a special entity; (ii) engage in any transaction, practice, or course of
business that operates as a fraud or deceit on any special entity or prospective customer
who is a special entity; or (iii) to engage in any act, practice, or course of business that is
fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative.
Rule 15Fh-4(b), as adopted, sets forth particular requirements for SBS Dealers
acting as advisors to special entities. 12 Specifically, an SBS Dealer that acts as an advisor
to a special entity must act in the “best interests” of the special entity, and make

12

The statutory definition of “special entity” includes federal agencies, states and
political subdivisions, employee benefit plans as defined under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), governmental plans as
defined under ERISA, and endowments. See Rule 15Fh-2(d) (defining “special
entity” to include employee benefit plans that are defined in Title I of ERISA but
permitting employee benefit plans that are not subject to regulation under Title I
of ERISA to elect not to be special entities).

12

reasonable efforts to obtain information that it needs to determine that the
recommendation is in the “best interests” of the special entity. 13
Rule 15Fh-5, as adopted, sets forth particular requirements for SBS Entities acting
as counterparties to special entities. Under the rule, those SBS Entities must have a
reasonable basis to believe that the counterparty has a qualified representative who: (1)
has sufficient knowledge to evaluate the transaction and risks; (2) is not subject to a
statutory disqualification; (3) is independent of the SBS Entity; (4) undertakes a duty to
act in the best interests of the special entity; (5) makes appropriate and timely disclosures
to the special entity of material information concerning the security-based swap; and (6)
provides written representations regarding fair pricing and the appropriateness of the
security-based swap. If the special entity is an employee benefit plan that is subject to
regulation under Title I of ERISA (“ERISA plan”), these requirements are satisfied if the
independent representative is a “fiduciary” under ERISA. In addition, the independent
representative must be subject to pay-to-play regulation if the special entity is a
“municipal entity” or a “governmental plan” as defined in Section 3 of ERISA.
Rule 15Fh-6, as adopted, imposes certain pay-to-play restrictions on SBS Dealers.
The rule generally prohibits an SBS Dealer from engaging in security-based swap
transactions with a “municipal entity” within two years after certain political
contributions have been made to officials of the municipal entity. As with other pay-toplay rules, Rule 15Fh-6 does not prohibit political contributions.

Rule 15Fh-2(a), as adopted, defines what it means to “act as an advisor” to a
special entity, and provides a safe harbor under which the parties can establish
that the SBS Dealer is not acting as an advisor to the special entity.

13

Rule 15k-1, as adopted, requires an SBS Entity to designate a CCO and imposes
certain duties and responsibilities on that CCO.
B.

Cross-Border Application of the Final Rules

Rule 3a71-3(c) and related amendments to Rule 3a71-3(a), as adopted, define the
scope of application of the business conduct standards described in Section 15F(h) of the
Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder (other than the rules and
regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to Section 15F(h)(1)(B)) to SBS
Dealers. As adopted, these rules require a registered U.S. SBS Dealer to comply with
transaction-level business conduct requirements with respect to all of its transactions,
except for certain transactions conducted through such dealer’s foreign branch. The rules
further require a registered foreign SBS Dealer to comply with transaction-level business
conduct requirements with respect to any transaction with a U.S. person (except for a
transaction conducted through a foreign branch of the U.S. person) and any transaction
that the SBS Dealer arranges, negotiates, or executes using personnel located in the
United States.
Rule 3a67-10(d) and related amendments to Rule 3a67-10(a), as adopted, define
the scope of application of the business conduct standards described in Section 15F(h) of
the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder (other than the rules and
regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to Section 15F(h)(1)(B)) to registered
Major SBS Participants. As adopted, these rules, like those applicable to registered SBS
Dealers, require a registered U.S. Major SBS Participant to comply with transaction-level
business conduct requirements with respect to all of its transactions, except for certain
transactions conducted through such participant’s foreign branch. The rules further

14

require a registered foreign Major SBS Participant to comply with transaction-level
business conduct requirements with respect to any transaction with a U.S. person (except
for a transaction conducted through a foreign branch of the U.S. person) but not any
transaction with a non-U.S. person.
Finally, Rule 3a71-6, as adopted, provides a framework under which foreign SBS
Dealers and foreign Major SBS Participants may seek to satisfy certain business conduct
requirements under Title VII by means of substituted compliance.
In developing these final rules, including their cross-border application, we have
consulted and coordinated with the CFTC and the prudential regulators 14 in accordance
with the consultation mandate of the Dodd-Frank Act. 15 The Commission also has
consulted and coordinated with foreign regulatory authorities through Commission staff
participation in numerous bilateral and multilateral discussions with foreign regulatory
authorities addressing the regulation of OTC (over-the-counter) derivatives. 16 Through
14

The term “prudential regulator” is defined in section 1a(39) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 1a(39), and that definition is incorporated by reference in
section 3(a)(74) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(74). Pursuant to the
definition, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the
Farm Credit Administration, or the Federal Housing Finance Agency
(collectively, the “prudential regulators”) is the “prudential regulator” of a
security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant if the entity
is directly supervised by that regulator.

15

Section 712(a)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act provides in part that the Commission
shall “consult and coordinate to the extent possible with the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and the prudential regulators for the purposes of assuring
regulatory consistency and comparability, to the extent possible.”

16

For example, senior representatives of authorities with responsibility for
regulation of OTC derivatives have met on a number of occasions to discuss
international coordination of OTC derivatives regulations. See, e.g., Report of the
OTC Derivatives Regulators Group to G20 Leaders on Cross-Border
Implementation Issues November 2015 (Nov. 2015), available at:

15

these discussions and the Commission staff’s participation in various international task
forces and working groups, 17 we have gathered information about foreign regulatory
reform efforts and their impact on and relationship with the U.S. regulatory regime. The
Commission has taken and will continue to take these discussions into consideration in
developing rules, forms, and interpretations for implementing Title VII of the DoddFrank Act. 18

Consistency with CFTC Rules

The Commission and CFTC staffs, prior to the proposal of rules by their
respective agency, held approximately 30 joint meetings with interested parties regarding
the agencies’ respective business conduct rules to solicit a variety of views. 19 As
discussed in Section I.D. below, the agencies’ staffs also consulted with Department of
http://www.cftc.gov/idc/groups/public/@internationalaffairs/documents/file/odrgr

Commission representatives participate in the Financial Stability Board’s
Working Group on OTC Derivatives Regulation (“ODWG”), both on the
Commission’s behalf and as the representative of the International Organization
of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”), which is co-chair of the ODWG. See

Labor (“DOL”) representatives on this rulemaking. In the Proposing Release, the
Commission solicited comment on the impact of any differences between the
Commission’s and CFTC’s approaches to business conduct regulations, and whether the
Commission’s proposed business conduct regulations should be modified to conform to
the proposals made by the CFTC. 20 Subsequently, in February 2012, the CFTC adopted
final rules with respect to the external business conduct standards of Swap Entities that
are generally consistent with the Commission’s proposed rules. 21 In addition, in April
2013, the CFTC adopted final rules with respect to internal business conduct standards
regarding, among other things, the obligation of a Swap Entity to diligently supervise its
business. 22 These rules also require each Swap Entity to designate a CCO, prescribe
qualifications and duties of the CCO, and require that the CCO prepare, sign, and furnish
the annual report containing an assessment of the registrant’s compliance activities to
either the board of directors or the senior officer. 23 The rules further require the annual
report to be furnished to the CFTC. 24
In May 2013, in the Reopening Release, the Commission sought comment on
certain specific issues, including: (1) the relationship of the proposed rules to any parallel

authorities; and (2) with respect to the CFTC rules, whether and to what extent the
Commission, in adopting its own rules, should emphasize consistency with the CFTC
rules versus adopting rules that are more tailored to the security-based swap market,
including any specific examples where consistency or tailoring of a particular rule or rule
set is more critically important. 25
The Commission received numerous comments regarding consistency with the
CFTC’s external business conduct rules both before and after the CFTC adopted its final
rules. 26 Comments specific to individual rules are addressed in the discussions of the
respective rules below. As a general matter, these comments had, as an overarching
theme, that the Commission should coordinate with the CFTC to achieve consistent
regulations. 27 Commenters stressed that differences between the regulatory regimes
would, among other things, increase regulatory burdens and costs for market participants,
delay execution of transactions, and lead to confusion. 28

Before the CFTC adopted its final external business conduct rules, commenters
were divided as to whether they preferred the Commission’s 29 or the CFTC’s 30 proposed
approach to specific issues, in instances in which the CFTC’s proposed approach differed
from the Commission’s proposed rules. However, the comments received by the
Commission in response to the Reopening Release, which was issued after the CFTC
adopted its final rules, overwhelmingly urged the Commission to harmonize its external
business conduct rules with those of the CFTC because the CFTC’s rules have already
been implemented by the industry. 31 A number of these comments have suggested
specific and detailed modifications. Where we believe the external business conduct
rules, if modified in accordance with these suggestions, will continue to provide the
protections (as explained in the context of the particular rule) that the rules are intended
to accomplish, we have modified the proposed rules to harmonize with CFTC

Commenters also urged, with respect to supervision and CCO obligations

internal business conduct standards. See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5,

Department of Labor ERISA Fiduciary Regulations

Section 15F(h)(2)(C) of the Exchange Act defines the term “special entity” to
include “an employee benefit plan, as defined in section 3 of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974.” 33
Prior to proposing the business conduct standards rules, the Commission received
submissions from commenters concerning the interaction with ERISA, DOL’s proposed
fiduciary rule, and current regulation regarding the definition of ERISA fiduciaries. 34 As
noted above, the Commission, CFTC and DOL staffs consulted on issues regarding the
intersection of ERISA fiduciary status with the Dodd-Frank Act business conduct
provisions, prior to the Commission’s proposing rules in this area. 35
The Commission received numerous comments concerning the interaction of
ERISA and existing fiduciary regulation with the business conduct standards under the

Exchange Act and the Commission’s proposed rules. 36 Commenters, including ERISA
plan sponsors, dealers and institutional asset managers, stated that although ERISA plans
currently use security-based swaps as part of their overall hedging or investment strategy,
the statutory and regulatory intersections of ERISA and the external business conduct
standards under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act could prevent ERISA plans from
participating in security-based swap markets in the future, and the proposed business
conduct standards rules, if adopted without clarification, could have unintended
consequences for SBS Entities dealing with ERISA plans. 37
Commenters were primarily concerned that compliance with the business conduct
standards under the Exchange Act or the Commission’s proposed rules would cause an
SBS Entity to be an ERISA fiduciary to an ERISA plan and thus, subject to ERISA’s
prohibited transaction provisions. 38 If an SBS Entity were to become an ERISA fiduciary
to an ERISA plan, it would be prohibited from entering into a security-based swap with

Section 406(b) of ERISA (29 U.S.C. 1106(b)) states that an ERISA fiduciary with
respect to an ERISA plan shall not (1) deal with the assets of the plan in his own
interest or for his own account, (2) in his individual or in any other capacity act in
any transaction involving the plan on behalf of a party (or represent a party)
whose interests are adverse to the interests of the plan or the interests of its
participants or beneficiaries, or (3) receive any consideration for his own personal
account from any party dealing with such plan in connection with a transaction
involving the assets of the plan.

that ERISA plan absent an exemption. 39 One commenter asserted that the penalties for
violating ERISA’s prohibited transaction provisions would discourage SBS Entities from
dealing with ERISA plans. 40 Other commenters asserted that compliance by SBS
Entities with the following obligations could cause an SBS Entity to be an ERISA
fiduciary: (1) providing information regarding the risks of the security-based swap; (2)
providing the daily mark; (3) reviewing the ability of the special entity’s advisor to advise
the special entity with respect to the security-based swap; and (4) acting in the best
interests of the special entity. 41 Accordingly, commenters requested that the Commission
and DOL coordinate the respective rules to clarify that compliance with the business
conduct standards rules will not make an SBS Entity an ERISA fiduciary. 42
DOL staff reviewed the CFTC’s final business conduct standards rules for Swap
Entities and provided the CFTC with the following statement:
The Department of Labor has reviewed these final business conduct
standards and concluded that they do not require swap dealers or major
swap participants to engage in activities that would make them fiduciaries
under the Department of Labor’s current five-part test defining fiduciary
advice 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-21(c). In the Department’s view, the CFTC’s
final business conduct standards neither conflict with the Department’s
existing regulations, nor compel swap dealers or major swap participants
to engage in fiduciary conduct. Moreover, the Department states that it is
fully committed to ensuring that any changes to the current ERISA
fiduciary advice regulation are carefully harmonized with the final
business conduct standards, as adopted by the CFTC and the SEC, so that
39

In addition to other statutory exemptions, Section 408(a) of ERISA (29 U.S.C.
1108(a)) gives DOL authority to grant administrative exemptions from prohibited
transactions prescribed in Section 406 of ERISA.

there are no unintended consequences for swap dealers and major swap
participants who comply with these business conduct standards. 43
Thereafter, in April 2015, the DOL reproposed a change to the definition of
fiduciary under ERISA. 44 The DOL noted that its staff had “consulted with staff of the
SEC.” 45
On April 6, 2016, DOL issued its final rule. 46 We understand that DOL’s revised
definition of “fiduciary” in its final rule is intended to allow SBS Entities to avoid
becoming ERISA fiduciaries when acting as counterparties to a swap or security-based
swap transaction. For example, DOL makes the following statement in the preamble to
its final rule:
The Department has provided assurances to the CFTC and the SEC that
the Department is fully committed to ensuring that any changes to the
current ERISA fiduciary advice regulation are carefully harmonized with
the final business conduct standards, as adopted by the CFTC and the
SEC, so that there are no unintended consequences for swap and securitybased swap dealers and major swap and security-based swap participants
who comply with the business conduct standards. See, e.g., Letter from
Phyllis C. Borzi, Assistant Secretary, Employee Benefits Security
Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, to The Hon. Gary Gensler et
al., CFTC (Jan. 17, 2012). In this regard, we note that the disclosures
required under the business conduct standards, including those regarding
material information about a swap or security-based swap concerning
material risks, characteristics, incentives and conflicts of interest;
disclosures regarding the daily mark of a swap or security-based swap and
a counterparty’s clearing rights; disclosures necessary to ensure fair and

balanced communications; and disclosures regarding the capacity in which
a swap or security-based swap dealer or major swap participant is acting
when a counterparty to a special entity, do not in the Department’s view
compel counterparties to ERISA-covered employee benefit plans, other
plans or IRAs to make a recommendation for purposes of paragraph (a) of
the final rule or otherwise compel them to act as fiduciaries in swap and
security-based swap transactions conducted pursuant to section 4s of the
Commodity Exchange Act and section 15F of the Securities Exchange
Act. This section of this Notice discusses these issues in the context of the
express provisions in the final rule on swap and security-based swap
transactions and on transactions with independent fiduciaries with
financial expertise. 47
Furthermore, DOL’s final rule establishes a “swap and security-based swap
transactions” exclusion 48 which, in DOL’s view, is intended to establish conditions under
which persons acting as SBS Entities, among others, “do not become investment advice
fiduciaries as a result of communications and activities conducted during the course of
swap or security-based swap transactions regulated under the Dodd-Frank Act provisions
in the Commodity Exchange Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and applicable
CFTC and SEC implementing rules and regulations.” 49 In addition, DOL has stated that
its exclusion for “transactions with independent plan fiduciaries with financial expertise”
has been significantly adjusted and expanded in the final rule and gives an alternative
avenue for parties involved in swap, security-based swap, or other investment

transaction with an employee benefit plan would give rise to additional fiduciary
obligations or restrictions under Title I of ERISA”).

24

transactions to conduct the transaction in a way that would ensure they do not become
investment advice fiduciaries under the final rule. 50
The Commission staff has continued to coordinate with DOL staff to ensure that
the final business conduct standards rules are appropriately harmonized with ERISA and
DOL regulations. DOL staff has provided the Commission with a statement that:
It is the Department’s view that the draft final business conduct standards
do not require security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap
participants to engage in activities that would make them fiduciaries under
the Department’s current five-part test defining fiduciary investment
advice. 29 CFR § 2510.3-21(c). The standards neither conflict with the
Department’s existing regulations, nor compel security-based swap dealers
or major security-based swap participants to engage in fiduciary
conduct. Moreover, the Department’s recently published final rule
amending ERISA’s fiduciary investment advice regulation was carefully
harmonized with the SEC’s business conduct standards so that there are no
unintended consequences for security-based swap dealers and major
security-based swap participants who comply with the business conduct
standards. As explained in the preamble to the Department’s final rule,
the disclosures required under the SEC’s business conduct rules do not, in
the Department’s view, compel counterparties to ERISA-covered
employee benefit plans to make investment advice recommendations
within the meaning of the Department’s final rule or otherwise compel
them to act as ERISA fiduciaries in swap and security-based swap
transactions conducted pursuant to section 4s(h) of the Commodity
Exchange Act and section 15F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 51
Finally, the Commission has modified its proposed treatment of special entities to
take into account the comprehensive regulatory scheme established under ERISA. In
particular, as discussed more fully in Section II.H below, if the special entity is an ERISA
50

See id. at 20986 (noting that DOL “does not believe extending the swap and
security-based swap provisions to IRA investors is appropriate” and, rather,
concluding “that it was more appropriate to address this issue in the context of the
‘independent plan fiduciary with financial expertise’ provision described
elsewhere in this Notice”).

plan, our rules deem certain requirements satisfied if the plan has an independent
representative that is a fiduciary under ERISA.
E.

Investment Adviser and Municipal Advisor Status

In addition to questions about ERISA fiduciary status, commenters also
questioned whether compliance with the business conduct standards might cause an SBS
Entity to be deemed an investment adviser or, when transacting with a special entity that
meets the definition of municipal entity, a municipal advisor. 52 Two commenters
expressed concern more generally that compliance with the daily mark requirement (in
Rule 15Fh-3(c)) might raise questions as to whether an SBS Entity has advisory or
fiduciary responsibilities under applicable common law, state law or federal law (e.g.,
DOL regulations, provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”), or
the Dodd-Frank Act’s municipal advisor provisions). 53
As we noted in the Proposing Release, the duties imposed on an SBS Dealer (or
Major SBS Participant) under the business conduct rules are specific to this context, and
are in addition to any duties that may be imposed under other applicable law. 54 Thus, an
SBS Entity must separately determine whether it is subject to regulation as a brokerdealer, an investment adviser, a municipal advisor or other regulated entity. 55 For

See Proposing Release, supra note 3, 76 FR at 42424.

55

The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Exchange Act definition of “dealer” so that a
person would not be deemed to be a dealer as a result of engaging in securitybased swaps with eligible contract participants. See Section 3(a)(5) of the
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(5), as amended by section 761(a)(1) of the DoddFrank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act does not include comparable amendments for
persons who act as brokers in swaps and security-based swaps. Because security-

26

example, an SBS Dealer that acts as an advisor to a special entity may fall within the
definition of “investment adviser” under Section 202(a) (11) of the Advisers Act. 56
We further stated in the Proposing Release that an SBS Dealer that acts as an
advisor to a municipal entity also may be a “municipal advisor” under Section 15B(e) of
the Exchange Act. 57 We note, however, that we subsequently adopted rules in 2013 that
interpret the statutorily defined term “municipal advisor” and provide a regulatory
exemption for persons engaging in municipal advisory activities in circumstances in
which a municipal entity or obligated person is otherwise represented by an independent
registered municipal advisor with respect to the same aspects of a municipal financial
product or an issuance of municipal securities so long as the following requirements are
satisfied: (1) the independent registered municipal advisor is registered pursuant to
Section 15B of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and is not, and
within at least the past two years was not, associated with the person seeking to rely on
the exemption; (2) the person seeking to use the exemption receives from the municipal
entity or obligated person a representation in writing that it is represented by, and will
rely on the advice of, the independent registered municipal advisor, and such person has a
based swaps, as defined in Section 3(a)(68) of the Exchange Act, are included in
the Exchange Act Section 3(a)(10) definition of “security,” persons who act as
brokers in connection with security-based swaps must, absent an exception or
exemption, register with the SEC as a broker pursuant to Exchange Act Section
15(a), and comply with the Exchange Act's requirements applicable to brokers.
As discussed in Section I.F, infra¸ the Commission has issued temporary
exemptions under the Exchange Act in connection with the revision of the
“security” definition to encompass security-based swaps. Among other aspects,
these temporary exemptions extended to certain broker activities involving
security-based swaps.

reasonable basis for relying on the representation; and (3) the person seeking to use the
exemption provides written disclosure to the municipal entity or obligated person, with a
copy to the independent registered municipal advisor, stating that such person is not a
municipal advisor and is not subject to the fiduciary duty to municipal entities that the
Exchange Act imposes on municipal advisors, and such disclosure is made at a time and
in a manner reasonably designed to allow the municipal entity or obligated person to
assess the material incentives and conflicts of interest that such person may have in
connection with the municipal advisory activities. 58 We explained that if a municipal
entity or obligated person is represented by a registered municipal advisor, parties to the
municipal securities transaction and others who are not registered municipal advisors
should be able to provide advice to the municipal entity or obligated person without being
deemed themselves to be municipal advisors, so long as the responsibilities of each
person are clear. 59

Intersection with SRO Rules

Under the framework established in the Dodd-Frank Act, SBS Entities are not
required to be members of self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”). Some commenters
have, however, urged us to harmonize Title VII business conduct requirements applicable
to SBS Entities with relevant SRO requirements applicable to the SRO’s members to
avoid unnecessary differences, which they argue could create duplication and conflicts

when an SBS Entity is also registered as a broker-dealer, or when an SBS Entity uses a
registered broker-dealer to intermediate its transactions. 60
The rules we proposed were designed to implement the business conduct
requirements enacted by Congress regarding security-based swap activity of SBS
Entities. At the same time, in proposing these rules, we were mindful that an SBS Entity
also may engage in activity that will require it to register as a broker-dealer, and thus
become subject to SRO rules applicable to registered broker-dealers that may impose
similar business conduct requirements. 61 As we noted in the Proposing Release, the
existing rules of various SROs served as an important point of reference for our proposed
business conduct rules. 62 For example, a number of the proposed rules, including those
regarding “know your counterparty,” 63 suitability, 64 fair and balanced communications, 65

See IIB (July 2015), supra note 10, at 13; SIFMA/FSR (July 2015), supra note 10,
at 9-10 (due to the possibility of dually registered firms, the Commission and
FINRA, “must work to harmonize existing sales practice requirements” because,
to the extent requirements differ, “there may be unnecessary duplication and
conflicts that cause a disparate impact on security-based swap dealers acting
through broker-dealers as compared to other security-based swap dealers.”);
SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5, at 2 (urging the Commission to
harmonize its rules with, among other things, “the FINRA Supervision Rules,
[and] the FINRA CCO Rule”).

See Exchange Act Section 15(b)(8) (generally making it illegal for a registered
broker-dealer to effect a transaction in, or induce or attempt to induce the
purchase or sale of, any security unless it is a member of a registered securities
association or effects transactions in securities solely on a national securities
exchange of which it is a member). 15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(8).

62

We looked, in particular, to the requirements imposed by FINRA, the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”), and the National Futures Association
(“NFA”), in addition to the business conduct standards, both internal and external,
adopted by the CFTC.

supervision, 66 and designation of a CCO, 67 were patterned on standards that have been
established by SROs for their members. However, we tailored the proposed rules to the
specifics of the regulatory scheme for security-based swaps under Title VII. 68
We recognize, as the commenters noted, that the security-based swap and other
securities activities of certain entities may require them to register both as broker-dealers
and as SBS Dealers or Major SBS Participants. 69 To the extent an entity will be subject
to regulation both as a broker-dealer and as an SBS Entity, there may be overlapping
regulatory requirements applicable to the same activity. The Commission is mindful of
potential regulatory conflicts or redundancies and has sought in adopting these final rules
to avoid such conflicts and minimize redundancies, consistent with the statutory business
conduct requirements for SBS Entities. As discussed throughout this release, the rules

68

For example, we provided in the proposed rules for an institutional suitability
alternative, which was modeled on FINRA’s institutional suitability rule (Rule
2111(b)) but tailored to take into account the definition of eligible contract
participant included in Title VII, which includes, among other persons,
individuals with aggregate amounts of more than $10 million invested on a
discretionary basis (or $5 million if hedging), and entities with a net worth of at
least $1 million that are hedging commercial risk. See discussion in Section
II.G.4, infra. In addition, proposed Rule 15Fh-3(g) would impose obligations
regarding fair and balanced communications that are consistent with, but less
detailed than, the obligations imposed on registered broker-dealers under FINRA
Rule 2210. See Section II.G.5, infra.

69

See, e.g., IIB (July 2015), supra note 10. In addition, as noted above, there may
instances in which a registered broker-dealer acts on behalf of an SBS Entity, and
so both our rules and the SRO business conduct rules may apply to the activity of
the broker-dealer in its capacity as agent of the SBS Entity.

30

we are adopting today take into account the comments received, both comments specific
to the application of the proposed rules to the security-based swap market and the role
that the SBS Entities play in that market, and comments asking us to modify the proposed
rules to more closely align with the similar SRO rules applicable to broker-dealers. 70
Overall, we believe that the business conduct rules we are adopting today are generally
designed to be consistent with the relevant SRO requirements, taking into account the
nature of the security-based swap market and the statutory requirements for SBS
Entities. 71
On July 1, 2011, the Commission issued a separate order granting temporary
exemptive relief (the “Temporary Exemptions”) from compliance with certain provisions
of the Exchange Act in connection with the revision, pursuant to Title VII of the DoddFrank Act, of the Exchange Act definition of “security” to encompass security-based
swaps. 72 Consistent with the Commission’s action, on July 8, 2011, FINRA filed for
70

One commenter urged harmonization with SRO (as well as CFTC) rules to allow
SBS Entities “to leverage existing processes and speed implementation.” SIFMA
(September 2015), supra note 5, at 2.

71

Generally, when a business conduct standard in these proposed rules is based on a
similar SRO standard, we would expect – at least as an initial matter – to take into
account the SRO’s interpretation and enforcement of its standard when we
interpret and enforce our rule. At the same time, we are not bound by an SRO’s
interpretation and enforcement of an SRO rule, and our policy objectives and
judgments may diverge from those of a particular SRO. Accordingly, we would
also expect to take into account such differences in interpreting and enforcing our
rules. Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42399, supra note 3.

The Commission, noting the need to avoid a potential unnecessary disruption to
the security-based swap market in the absence of an extension of the Temporary
Exemptions, and the need for additional time to consider the potential impact of the
revision of the Exchange Act definition of “security” in light of recent Commission

In its Exemptive Release, the Commission noted that the relief is targeted and
does not include, for instance, relief from the Exchange Act’s antifraud and antimanipulation provisions. FINRA has noted that FINRA Rule 0180 is similarly
targeted. For instance, paragraph (a) of FINRA Rule 0180 provides that FINRA
rules shall not apply to members’ activities and positions with respect to securitybased swaps, except for FINRA Rules 2010 (Standards of Commercial Honor and
Principles of Trade), 2020 (Use of Manipulative, Deceptive or Other Fraudulent
Devices), 3310 (Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Program) and 4240

and refined the applicable expiration dates of the previously granted Temporary
Exemptions. 74 In the Temporary Exemptions Extension Release, the Commission
extended the expiration date of the expiring Temporary Exemptions that are not directly
linked to pending security-based swap rulemakings until the earlier of such time as the
Commission issues an order or rule determining whether any continuing exemptive relief
is appropriate for security-based swap activities with respect to any of these Exchange
Act provisions or until three years following the effective date of the Temporary
Exemptions Extension Release. 75 The Commission further extended the expiration date
for many expiring Temporary Exemptions directly related to pending security-based
swap rulemakings until the compliance date for the related security-based swap-specific
rulemaking. 76

In establishing Rule 0180, and in extending the rule’s expiration date, 77 FINRA
noted its intent, pending the implementation of any Commission rules and guidance that
would provide greater regulatory clarity in relation to security-based swap activities, to
align the expiration date of FINRA Rule 0180 with the termination of relevant provisions
of the Temporary Exemptions provided by the Commission, so as to avoid undue market
disruptions resulting from the change to the definition of “security” under the Exchange
Act.

Discussion of Rules Governing Business Conduct
A.

Scope, Generally
1.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 15Fh-1 would provide that Rules 15Fh-1 through 15Fh-6
(governing business conduct) and Rule 15Fk-1 (requiring designation of a CCO) are not
intended to limit, or restrict, the applicability of other provisions of the federal securities
laws, including but not limited to Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 9 and
10(b) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. Additionally, it
would provide that Rules 15Fh-1 through 15Fh-6 and Rule 15Fk-1 would not only apply
in connection with entering into security-based swaps but also would continue to apply,
as appropriate, over the term of executed security-based swaps.
In the Proposing Release, the Commission solicited comment on the scope of the
business conduct rules, including whether the rules should apply to transactions between

77

As noted in the FINRA Rule 0180 Extension Notice, FINRA has indicated that it
intends to amend the expiration date of Rule 0180 in subsequent filings as
necessary such that the expiration date will be coterminous with the termination
of relevant provisions of the Temporary Exemptions.

an SBS Entity and its affiliates, whether any of the rules should apply to security-based
swaps that were entered into prior to the effective date of the rules, and to the extent that
any of the rules were intended to provide additional protections for a particular
counterparty, whether the counterparty should be able to opt out of those protections. 78

Comments on the Proposed Rule
a.

General

Eleven commenters addressed the general scope of the proposed business conduct
standards. 79 One commenter recommended that the Commission apply the proposed
rules to security-based swaps that are offered as well as those that are executed. 80 The
other commenters addressed: the application of the rules to inter-affiliate transactions, the
application of the rules to security-based swaps entered into prior to the effective date,
and whether counterparties should be able to opt out of the protections provided by the
rules.

Application to Security-Based Swaps Entered Into Prior

that were entered into prior to the compliance date of the rules, and all seven

recommended that the rules not apply to such transactions. 81 Three further indicated that
the rules should not generally apply to amendments to, or other lifecycle events arising
under, a security-based swap that was executed before the compliance date of the rules. 82
Another commenter also specifically argued that the rules should not apply to either
partial or full terminations of security-based swaps executed prior to the compliance date,
or the exercise of an option on a security-based swap where the option was executed prior
to the compliance date. 83
One commenter argued that amendments to existing transactions typically do not
alter the risk and other characteristics of a transaction sufficiently to merit application of
the rules and that application of the rules in these cases may frustrate their purpose. 84
Others believed that any potential retroactive application would be burdensome, noting
that it would undermine the expectations that the parties had when entering into the
security-based swap. 85

Three commenters discussed the application of the rules to inter-affiliate
transactions. 86 All three recommended that the rules generally not apply to securitybased swap transactions between affiliates, 87 but one recognized that entity-level
requirements (such as CCO and supervision responsibilities) will necessarily apply. 88
One commenter asserted that the rules are intended to protect investors in arm’s length
transactions and therefore, would be irrelevant in inter-affiliate transactions. 89 The
second commenter similarly argued that because affiliates are not “external clients” of the
SBS Entity, the protections afforded by the rules are inapposite. 90 The second
commenter also suggested that the Commission define “affiliate” to mean an entity that is
“under common control and that reports information or prepares its financial statements
on a consolidated basis” with another entity, and opined that the definition should be
consistently applied across Title VII rulemakings. 91 The third commenter also advocated
for a common control standard, arguing that the rules should not apply to transactions
between an SBS Entity and “a person controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the [SBS Entity].” 92

Nine commenters addressed whether to permit counterparties to opt out of certain
protections provided by the rules. 93 Six commenters were in favor of allowing an opt out
in at least some circumstances, 94 and three were against it. 95
Three commenters suggested that the Commission permit institutional or
“sophisticated investors” to opt out of provisions intended to protect counterparties. 96
Specifically, one endorsed allowing “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule
144A under the Securities Act and institutions with total assets of $100 million or more
to opt out, asserting that the costs, delays in execution, and requirements to make detailed
representations and disclosure to the SBS Entity may outweigh the benefits that such
counterparties would receive. 97 Another asserted that “sophisticated” counterparties
should be able to opt out of receiving “material information” disclosures and the written
disclosures related to clearing rights to lower their hedging costs and avoid potential
trading delays and inefficiencies. 98

38

Three other commenters suggested an opt out for specific types of
counterparties. 99 One suggested that an ERISA plan should be permitted to opt out
because SBS Entities might use the information they receive as a result of compliance
with the business conduct standards to disadvantage the ERISA plan. 100 A second
asserted that pension funds acting as end users should be allowed to opt out of any rules
that impose “heightened fiduciary duties” on SBS Dealers because pension funds do not
need extra protection, and compliance with the fiduciary duties would only increase costs
for SBS Dealers, leading them to either pass the costs along or refrain from entering into
transactions with pension funds. 101 A third suggested that any entity advised by a
qualified independent representative should be able to waive the protections of the rules
to avoid execution delays and administrative costs. 102
Three commenters opposed allowing counterparties to opt out of the special
protections in the rules. 103 One commenter noted that a “theoretically optional opt out
would likely become mandatory” because SBS Dealers would make it a condition of
doing business, and that an opt-out approach could be used to perpetuate abuses the rules
are intended to prevent. 104 Another commented that an opt-out would “only add
confusion to an already complex regulatory framework and create opportunities for

standards.” 105 A third specifically opposed allowing counterparties to opt out of the
disclosure requirements, noting that even sophisticated investors may be misled. 106

Response to Comments and Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh-1,
predesignated as Rule 15Fh-1(a), with certain modifications.
a.

General

The Commission is adopting, as proposed, the provision in final Rule 15Fh-1(a)
specifying that Rules 15Fh-1 through 15Fh-6 and Rule 15Fk-1 apply “in connection with
entering into security-based swaps” and also will continue to apply, as appropriate, over
the term of executed security-based swaps. Many of the rules impose obligations on an
SBS Entity with respect to its “counterparty” that must be satisfied before the SBS Entity
has actually entered into a security-based swap with that counterparty (e.g., Rule 15Fh3(a) (verification of counterparty status) and Rule 15Fh-3(b) (disclosure of material risks
and characteristics, and material incentives or conflicts of interest)). This is consistent
with the language specifying that the rules apply “in connection with entering into
security-based swaps” in Rule 15Fh-1(a). Accordingly, when the rules refer to a
“counterparty” of the SBS Entity, the term “counterparty” includes a potential
counterparty where compliance with the obligation is required before the SBS Entity and
the “counterparty” has actually entered into the security-based swap. 107
105

See Better Markets (August 2011), supra note 5.

We believe that our reading of the term “counterparty” to include a potential
counterparty addresses the concerns raised by the commenter that requested that

Application to Security-Based Swaps Entered Into Prior
to the Effective Date

To address concerns raised by commenters, 108 the Commission is clarifying that
the business conduct rules generally will not apply to any security-based swap entered
into prior to the compliance date of the rules, and generally will apply to any securitybased swap entered into after the compliance date of these rules, including a new
security-based swap that results from an amendment or modification to a pre-existing
security-based swap. 109
In response to commenters’ concerns about applying the business conduct rules to
amendments to and other lifecycle events of a security-based swap entered into before the
compliance date of these rules, 110 the Commission is clarifying that the business conduct
rules generally will not apply to amendments or modifications to a pre-existing securitybased swap unless the amendment or modification results in a new security-based swap
(and occurs after the compliance date of these rules). The Commission has previously
determined that if the material terms of a security-based swap are amended or modified
during its life based on an exercise of discretion and not through predetermined criteria or
a predetermined self-executing formula, the amended or modified security-based swap is

those that are executed. See CFA, supra note 5.

viewed as a new security-based swap. 111 Thus, if there is such a material amendment or
modification, which could include a change in the economic terms of the transaction that
the parties would not have provided for when entering into the security-based swap
contract, the Commission will consider the amended or modified security-based swap to
be a new security-based swap for purposes of the business conduct rules. If that material
amendment or modification occurs after the compliance date of these rules, these rules
will apply to the resulting new security-based swap.
In response to concerns raised by a commenter, the Commission also is clarifying
that the rules generally will not apply to either a partial or full termination of a preexisting security-based swap. 112 In these instances we anticipate that the expectations of
the parties will be governed by the pre-existing terms of the original security-based swap,
and so the business conduct requirements generally will not apply. If, however, the
partial termination involves a change in the material terms of the original security-based
swap “based on an exercise of discretion and not through predetermined criteria or a
predetermined self-executing formula” the business conduct rules will apply.
As requested by a commenter, 113 we are clarifying that the business conduct rules
generally will not apply to a new security-based swap that results from the exercise of an
option on a security-based swap (whether or not the exercise occurs before or after the

option and the terms of the underlying security-based swap that will result upon the
exercise of the option are governed by the terms of the pre-existing option. If, however,
the material terms of either the option or the resulting security-based swap are amended
or modified based on an exercise of discretion and not through predetermined criteria or a
predetermined self-executing formula, our business conduct rules will apply to the
amended or modified option or security-based swap resulting from the exercise of the
option (assuming that such amendment or modification occurs after the compliance date
of these rules).
We believe it appropriate to apply the rules in this manner to help to ensure that
counterparties receive the benefits of the rules in circumstances where they are
warranted, while providing firms adequate time to review the business conduct rules
being adopted today and make appropriate changes to their operations before they have to
begin complying with those rules.
The Commission emphasizes that the above clarifications relate to the business
conduct rules that by their terms apply when an SBS Entity offers to enter into or enters
into a security-based swap, such as verification of status (Rule 15Fh-3(a)), certain
disclosures (Rule 15Fh-3(b) and (d)), requirements for special entities as counterparties
(Rule 15Fh-5), and pay-to-play (Rule 15Fh-6)). Other rules being adopted today are
broader in their application, such as those relating to know your counterparty (Rule 15Fh3(e)), recommendations of security-based swaps or trading strategies (Rule 15Fh-3(f)),
fair and balanced communications (Rule 15Fh-3(g)), supervision (Rule 15Fh-3(h)),
antifraud (Rule 15Fh-4(a)), requirements when an SBS Dealer is acting as an advisor to a

43

special entity (Rule 15Fh-4(b)), and the CCO (Rule 15Fk-1). Thus, if an SBS Entity
takes an action after the compliance date that independently implicates one of the
business conduct rules, it will need to comply with the applicable requirements. For
example, if an SBS Dealer makes a recommendation of a trading strategy that involves
termination of a pre-existing security-based swap, the SBS Dealer would need to comply
with the suitability requirements of Rule 15Fh-3(f) regarding such recommendation. In
addition, an SBS Entity will need to comply with “entity level” rules relating to
supervision and CCO after the compliance date of those rules for all of its security-based
swap business.
c.

Application to Inter-Affiliate Transactions

The Commission agrees with the concerns raised by commenters regarding the
treatment of inter-affiliate transactions. 114 As the Commission noted in the Definitions
Adopting Release (defined below), market participants may enter into inter-affiliate
security-based swaps for a variety of purposes, such as to allocate risk within a corporate
group or to transfer risks within a corporate group to a central hedging or treasury
entity. 115 As discussed below, we believe that transactions by SBS Entities with certain
of their affiliated persons do not implicate the concerns that the business conduct
requirements regarding verification of counterparty status (Rule 15Fh-3(a)), disclosures
regarding the product and potential conflicts of interest, daily mark and clearing rights

(Rule 15Fh-3(b), (c) and (d)), “know your counterparty” and suitability obligations
(Rules 15Fh-3(e) and (f)), and obligations when advising or acting as counterparty to a
special entity (Rules 15Fh-4(b) and 15Fh-5) are intended to address (referred to as
“transaction specific obligations”). 116 We therefore are providing in Rule 15Fh-1(a) as
adopted that Rules 15Fh-3(a) through (f), 15Fh-4(b) and 15Fh-5 are not applicable to
security-based swaps that SBS Entities enter into with certain affiliates.
We are not, however, extending the exception to transactions with all affiliates, as
requested by some commenters. 117 Rather, the Commission is limiting the exception
from the business conduct requirements to security-based swap transactions between
majority-owned affiliates. The rule defines “majority-owned affiliates” consistent with
the Definitions Adopting Release such that, for these purposes, the counterparties to a
security-based swap are majority-owned affiliates if one counterparty directly or
indirectly owns a majority interest in the other, or if a third party directly or indirectly
owns a majority interest in both counterparties to the security-based swap, where
“majority interest” is the right to vote or direct the vote of a majority of a class of voting
securities of an entity, the power to sell or direct the sale of a majority of a class of voting

116

As one commenter suggested, because affiliates are not “external clients” of the
SBS Entity, the protections afforded by these rules may be inapposite. See ABA
Securities Association, supra note 5.

117

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5; FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5. See
also ABA Securities Association, supra note 5 (suggesting an “affiliated group”
definition that was considered but not adopted in the Definitions Adopting
Release). As noted above, the Commissions instead adopted the exception for
“majority-owned affiliates” that we are providing here. See Definitions Adopting
Release, supra note 115.

45

securities of an entity, or the right to receive upon dissolution or the contribution of a
majority of the capital of a partnership. 118
The transaction-specific obligations outlined above and included in Rule 15Fh1(a) generally are designed to provide an SBS Entity counterparty with certain
information in connection with the security-based swap transaction that would help
reduce potential information asymmetries, and to help ensure that the SBS Entity knows
its counterparty and acts in a fair manner towards that counterparty, even in the face of
potential conflicts of interest. The Commission does not believe that these objectives and
concerns are implicated in the same manner or to the same extent when there is an
alignment of economic interests between the SBS Entity and a counterparty, such as is
the case when the counterparty is a majority-owned affiliate. However, absent majority
ownership, we cannot be confident that there would be an alignment of economic
interests that is sufficient to eliminate the concerns that underpin the need for regulation
in this area. 119 Accordingly, the Commission is modifying Rule 15Fh-1(a) to provide
that Rules 15Fh-3(a)-(f), 15Fh-4(b) and 15Fh-5 are not applicable to security-based
swaps that SBS Entities enter into with their majority-owned affiliates. These generally
are the transaction specific exceptions requested by a commenter. 120

118

See Exchange Act Rules 3a71–1(d)(1) and 15Fh-1(a).

119

See Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30625, supra note 115 (declining to
adopt a “common control” standard, noting that, “[a]bsent majority ownership, we
cannot be confident that there would be an alignment of economic interests that is
sufficient to eliminate the concerns that underpin dealer regulation.”).

120

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5 (requesting exceptions with respect to
Rules 15Fh-3(a) through (f), 15Fh-4(b) and 15Fh-5).

46

Further, consistent with the commenter’s request, we are not granting an
exception for transactions with affiliates with respect to the antifraud requirements of
Rule 15Fh-4(a) or the requirements of Rule 15Fh-3(g) (fair and balanced
communications). 121 The exception for inter-affiliate transactions from the transaction
specific obligations discussed above is generally predicated on the assumption that
entities with aligned economic interests have an incentive to act fairly when dealing with
each other. However, we believe it important to continue to provide the protections of
the antifraud and fair and balanced communication rules in situations where an SBS
Entity acts in a manner contrary to this assumption. We also are not granting exceptions
to the entity-level requirements regarding supervision (Rule 15Fh-3(h)) and CCO
obligations (Rule 15Fk-1), which are intended to help to ensure the compliance of SBS
Entities in their security-based swap transactions.
d.

Counterparty Opt-Out

The Commission has considered the concerns raised by commenters 122 and
determined, on balance, not to permit counterparties generally to opt out of the
protections provided by the business conduct rules. As discussed throughout the release
in the context of specific rules, the rules being adopted today are intended to provide
certain protections for counterparties, including certain heightened protections for special
entities. We think it is appropriate to apply the rules so that counterparties receive the

benefits of those protections and so do not think it appropriate to permit parties generally
to elect to “opt out” of the benefits of those provisions. 123
While we are not adopting a general opt-out provision, as discussed below in
connection with the relevant rules, the Commission has determined to permit means of
compliance with the final rules that should promote efficiency and reduce costs (e.g.,
Rule 15Fh-1(b) (reliance on representations)) and, where appropriate, allow SBS Entities
to take into account the sophistication of the counterparty (e.g., Rule 15Fh-3(f) (regarding
recommendations of security-based swaps or trading strategies)).
B.

Exceptions for Anonymous SEF or Exchange-Traded Transactions

Section 15F(h)(7) of the Exchange Act provides a statutory exception “from the
requirements of this subsection” for security-based swap transactions that are: “(A)
initiated by a special entity on an exchange or security-based swaps execution facility;
and (B) the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant does not
know the identity of the counterparty to the transaction.” 124 More generally, commenters
have asked the Commission to provide exceptions to the application of our rules in
situations in which an SBS Entity does not know the identity of its counterparty, or where
a security-based swap transaction is executed on a registered national securities exchange
or security-based swap execution facility (“SEF”), without regard to whether the

Proposal

Noting that there may be circumstances in which it may be unclear which party
“initiated” the communications that resulted in the parties entering into a security-based
swap transaction on a registered SEF or registered national securities exchange, the
Commission proposed to interpret Section 15F(h)(7) to apply to any transaction with a
special entity on a registered SEF or registered national securities exchange, where the
SBS Entity does not know the identity of its counterparty at any time up to and including
execution of a transaction.
The Commission further proposed to interpret Section 15F(h)(7) to apply with
respect to requirements specific to dealings with special entities. Proposed Rule 15Fh4(b)(3) would provide an exception from the special requirements for SBS Dealers acting
as advisors to special entities, including the requirement that an SBS Dealer act in the
best interests of a special entity for whom it acts as an advisor, if the transaction is
executed on a registered exchange or SEF and the SBS Dealer does not know the identity
of the counterparty at any time up to and including execution of the transaction. Under
the same circumstances, proposed Rule 15Fh-5(c) would similarly provide an exception
from the special requirements for SBS Entities acting as counterparties to special entities,
including the qualified independent representative and disclosure requirements of
proposed Rule 15Fh-5. 126 Proposed Rule 15Fh-6(b)(2)(iii) would provide an exception

from the pay to play rules with respect to transactions on a registered exchange or SEF
where the SBS Dealer does not know the identity of the counterparty at any time up to
and including execution of the transaction. 127
Consistent with Section 15F(h)(7), we also proposed to limit the application of
certain other requirements to situations in which the identity of a counterparty (whether a
special entity or not) is known to the SBS Entity. The rules as proposed would limit the
verification of counterparty status obligations (proposed Rule 15Fh-3(a)), 128 and know
your counterparty obligations (proposed Rule 15Fh-3(e)) to transactions with
counterparties whose identity is known to the SBS Entity. 129

Comments on the Proposal

The Commission received five comment letters that addressed the exception for
anonymous, exchange or SEF-traded security-based swaps in the context of special
entity-specific requirements, 130 and four comment letters that addressed more broadly the
issue of an exception for anonymous or SEF and exchange-traded security-based

127

Rule 15Fh-6, as proposed, would apply only with respect to transactions
“initiated” by a municipal entity. The Commission is modifying the exception
under Rule 15Fh-6(b)(2)(iii) to apply to all security-based swap transactions that
are executed on a registered national securities exchange or registered or exempt
SEF, rather than just with respect to transactions “initiated by a municipal entity”
on such exchange or registered SEF (as long as the other conditions of Rule 15Fh6(b)(2)(iii) are met). These revisions are consistent with the exceptions to Rules
15Fh-4 and 15Fh-5 for anonymous, exchange-traded or SEF transactions. See

swaps. 131 The comment letters that address the exception in the context of the special
entity requirements are discussed infra in Sections II.H.8 and II.H.9. The comment
letters that address the broader issue of an exception from business conduct requirements
for anonymous or SEF and exchange-traded security-based swaps are discussed below.
Two commenters asserted that, where a security-based swap is cleared (through
registered clearing organizations) and SEF or exchange-traded, the transaction should not
be subject to the requirements of the proposed rules – regardless of whether the identity
of the counterparty is known at the time of execution. 132 The commenters argued that
knowledge or identification of a counterparty’s identity should not compel compliance
with the business conduct standards. 133 The commenters further argued that the concerns
addressed by business conduct standards were largely inapplicable to security-based
swaps entered into through registered SEFs, swap execution facilities or registered
national securities exchanges. 134 The commenters asserted that compliance with the
proposed rules would result in delay, additional complexity, individual negotiation and

note 5; SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5

See SIFMA (August 2011), supra note 5 (arguing that parties to exchange-traded
security-based swaps likely know the identity of their counterparty before the
transaction, either because the exchange uses a request for quote system (where
the participants can seek quotes from specific counterparties) or a single-dealer
platform, or because information about the counterparties to the trade is necessary
to complete the execution process); BlackRock, supra note 5.

potentially less transparency, which the trading and clearing requirements of the DoddFrank Act sought to avoid. 135
However, one of the commenters acknowledged that some security-based swaps
executed on a SEF or exchange might be bilaterally negotiated, and the SEF or exchange
subsequently used to process the trade, in which case it might be appropriate to apply the
business conduct standards. 136
After adoption of the CFTC’s business conduct standards, one commenter urged
the Commission to adopt an exception for exchange-traded security-based swaps that are
intended to be cleared if: (1)(a) the transaction is executed on a registered or exempt SEF
or registered national securities exchange; and (b) is of a type that is, as of the date of
execution, required to be cleared pursuant to Section 3C of the Exchange Act; or (2) the
SBS Entity does not know the identity of the counterparty, at any time up to and
including execution of the transaction. 137 The commenter argued that these changes
would harmonize the scope of the Commission’s requirements with the scope of the
parallel requirements under the relief provided by CFTC No-Action Letter 13-70. 138 The
commenter argued that the considerations on which the CFTC staff based its no-action
relief would also apply to the security-based swap market, namely: “(i) the impossibility

See BlackRock, supra note 5 (also noting that, conversely, generally “when a

requirements of [the proposed rules] unnecessary”).

or impracticability of compliance with certain rules by a Swap Entity when the identity of
the counterparty is not known prior to execution; (ii) the likelihood that swaps initiated
anonymously on a designated contract market or swap execution facility will be
standardized and, thus, information about the material risks and characteristics of such
swaps is likely to be available from the designated contract market or swap execution
facility or other widely available source (including the product specifications of a
derivatives clearing organization where the swaps are accepted for clearing); and (iii) the
likelihood that such relief would provide an incentive to transact on designated contract
markets and swap execution facilities, thus enhancing transparency in the swaps
market.” 139

Response to Comments and Final Rules

After considering the comments, the Commission has determined to adopt two
sets of exceptions from the business conduct requirements. As discussed in Sections
II.H.8 and II.H.9, infra, we are adopting exceptions from the requirements of Rules 15Fh4(b), 15Fh-5 and 15Fh-6 (collectively, “special entity exceptions”) for anonymous
transactions executed on a registered national securities exchange or a registered or
exempt SEF, where the identity of the special entity is not known to the SBS Entity at a
reasonably sufficient time prior to execution of the transaction to permit the SBS Entity
to comply with the obligations of the rule. 140

139

Id.

140

See Rules 15Fh-4(b)(3)(ii), 15Fh-5(d)(2) and 15Fh-6(b)(3)(iii). We have
similarly modified the verification of special entity counterparty status
requirements in Rule 15Fh-3(a)(2), as discussed infra in Section II.G.1.

53

In addition to the special entity exceptions, the Commission is adopting a second
set of exceptions that are not limited to transactions with special entities, under which
certain of the business conduct standards rules will apply only where the SBS Entity
knows the identity of the counterparty at a reasonably sufficient time prior to execution of
the transaction to permit the SBS Entity to comply with the obligations of the rule. 141
These exceptions are intended to address the impracticalities and potential business
disruption that could result if an SBS Entity were required to comply with the disclosure
requirements in Rule 15Fh-3(b) (requiring an SBS Entity to disclose material risks and
characteristics of a security-based swap and material incentives or conflicts in connection
with a security-based swap, prior to entering into that security-based swap with a
counterparty) and Rule 15Fh-3(d) (requiring certain pre-transaction disclosures to
counterparties regarding clearing rights), before learning the identity of its
counterparty. 142 By only applying these rules’ requirements to situations where the
counterparty’s identity is known “at a reasonably sufficient time prior to” the execution
of a transaction, the rules’ requirements are limited to situations where an SBS Entity has
sufficient time before the execution of the transaction to comply with its obligations
under the rules. For this reason, we decline to adopt language, suggested by a
commenter, which would apply the exception to circumstances where the identity of the

As discussed in Section II.G.3, infra, we are adopting as proposed the exception

rule to transactions with “known” counterparties.

54

counterparty “is not known at any time up to and including execution of the
transaction.” 143
We are not, however, accepting the commenter’s suggestion that we revise our
exceptions to provide an exception for transactions intended to be cleared so long as the
transaction is either executed on a registered national securities exchange or registered or
exempt SEF and required to be cleared pursuant to Section 3C of the Exchange Act,
regardless of whether or not the transaction is anonymous. 144 Similarly, we reject
commenters’ more general assertions that the exceptions should apply to all SEF or
exchange-traded transactions, even where the identity of the counterparty is known, 145
and that the protections provided by the business conduct standards are unnecessary for
security-based swaps that are entered into through registered SEFs, swap execution
facilities or registered national securities exchanges. 146 The rules being adopted today
are intended to provide certain protections for counterparties, and we think it is
appropriate to apply the rules, to the extent practicable, so that counterparties receive the
benefits of those protections. We have determined not to apply those rules where it may
not be possible or practical to do so, specifically where a transaction is executed on a
registered exchange or SEF and the identity of the counterparty is not known to the SBS
Entity at a reasonably sufficient time prior to execution of the transaction to permit the
SBS Entity to comply with the obligations of the rule. However, where the identity of the
counterparty is known in a timely manner, we believe that it is appropriate to apply the

rules, including the assistance of an advisor or qualified independent representative acting
in the best interests of a counterparty that is special entity.

Application of the Rules to SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants
1.

Proposal

As noted in the Proposing Release, in general, where the Dodd-Frank Act imposes
a business conduct requirement on both SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants, we
proposed rules that would apply to SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants. 147 Where,
however, a business conduct requirement is not expressly addressed by the Dodd-Frank
Act, the proposed rules generally applied only to SBS Dealers. 148 We solicited comment
on whether this approach was appropriate. Specifically, where the Dodd-Frank Act
requires that a business conduct rule apply to all SBS Entities, we asked if the rule should
impose the same requirements on Major SBS Participants as on SBS Dealers, and where
we proposed rules for SBS Dealers that are not expressly addressed by the Dodd-Frank
Act, we asked if any of those rules should also apply to Major SBS Participants.
2.

Comments on the Proposal

Three commenters addressed the general application of the rules to SBS Dealers

147

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42400-42401, supra note 3.

148

As noted in the Proposing Release, there are exceptions to this principle. We
proposed that all SBS Entities be required to determine if a counterparty is a
special entity. In addition, Section 3C(g)(5) of the Exchange Act creates certain
rights with respect to clearing for counterparties entering into security-based
swaps with SBS Entities but does not require disclosure. We proposed a rule that
would require an SBS Entity to disclose to a counterparty certain information
relating to these rights. See 15 U.S.C. 78c–3(g)(5); Proposing Release, 76 FR at
42401 n.39, supra note 3.

56

and Major SBS Participants. 149 One commenter agreed it may be appropriate, “in light of
their somewhat different roles,” to adopt different approaches to rules governing SBS
Dealers and Major SBS Participants in certain areas. 150 The commenter asserted that
absent an affirmative reason to adopt a different approach for SBS Dealers and Major
SBS Participants, the Commission should seek to promote consistency and adopt
uniformly strong rules. 151 The commenter argued that the determining factor should be
whether Major SBS Participants are likely to be engaged in conduct that would
appropriately be regulated under the relevant standard. 152
In contrast, another commenter urged the Commission to consider separate
regulatory regimes for SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants, arguing that they are
different, and there are “different reasons why the Dodd-Frank Act requires additional
oversight of each.” 153 The commenter recommended that the Commission focus
regulation of Major SBS Participants on reducing default risk, and focus regulation of
SBS Dealers on market making and pricing and sales practices in addition to reducing
default risk. 154 The commenter argued that to the extent Major SBS Participants transact
at arm’s-length, they will not be advising counterparties and therefore, neither fiduciary
duties nor “dealer-like obligations” (regarding “know your counterparty,” suitability and

“pay-to-play” restrictions, for example) should be imposed on them. 155
A third commenter generally supported our proposed approach in not applying
certain business conduct requirements to Major SBS Participants where the Dodd-Frank
Act does not expressly impose such standards. 156 In the alternative, if the Commission
determines to require Major SBS Participants to disclose “material information” and to
provide daily marks to their counterparties, the commenter asked that we make these
requirements inapplicable to transactions between a Major SBS Participant and an SBS
Dealer, and to allow all other parties to opt out of receiving such disclosures in their
dealings with a Major SBS Participant. 157
3.

Response to Comments and Final Rules

After considering the comments, the Commission has determined to apply the
rules to SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants as proposed. To that end, as discussed
below, where a statutory provision encompasses both SBS Dealers and Major SBS
Participants, 158 we are adopting rules that would apply equally to SBS Dealers and Major

155

Id.

156

See BlackRock, supra note 5.

157

Id.

158

See Section 15F(h)(1) (requiring SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants to
conform to business conduct standards as prescribed by Section 15F(h)(3)
(regarding duty to verify counterparty status as ECP, required pre-trade
disclosures and ongoing daily mark disclosures)); Section 15F(h)(1)(A) (requiring
SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants to comply with standards as may be
prescribed by the Commission regarding fraud); Section 15F(h)(1)(B) (requiring
SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants to comply with standards as may be
prescribed by the Commission regarding diligent supervision of the business of
the SBS Dealer or Major SBS Participant); Section 15F(h)(4)(A) (antifraud
provisions applicable to both SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants); Section
15F(h)(5) (regarding special requirements for SBS Dealers and Major SBS

58

SBS Participants. 159 We think this is important to ensure that counterparties of Major
SBS Participants, as well as counterparties of SBS Dealers, receive the protections the
rules are intended to provide. For example, to the extent that Major SBS Participants
may be better informed about the risks and valuations of security-based swaps due to
information asymmetries, disclosures may help inform counterparties concerning the
material risks and characteristics of security-based swaps, and material conflicts of
interest of Major SBS Participants entering into security-based swaps. 160
Where, however, a business conduct requirement is not expressly addressed by
the Dodd-Frank Act or we read the statute to apply a requirement only to SBS Dealers, 161
the adopted rules generally would not apply to Major SBS Participants. 162 Thus, the
obligations under Rules 15Fh-3(e) (know your counterparty), 15Fh-3(f)
(recommendations of security-based swaps or trading strategies), 15Fh-4(b) (special

Participants that enter into a security-based swap with a special entity); and
Section 15F(k) (imposing CCO obligations).
159

See Rules 15Fh-3(a) (verification of counterparty status), 15Fh-3(b) (pre-trade
disclosures), 15Fh-3(c) (daily mark), 15Fh-3(h) (supervision), 15Fh-5 (special
requirements for SBS Entities acting as counterparties to special entities) and
15Fk-1 (CCO requirements).

160

See discussion infra in Section VI.B.

161

See Section II.H.2 (regarding application of “act as an advisor” obligations under
Rule 15Fh-4(b) to SBS Dealers but not Major SBS Participants).

162

As noted in the Proposing Release, there are exceptions to this principle. Because
an SBS Entity must comply with the requirements of Rule 15Fh-5 if it is acting as
a counterparty to a special entity, the obligation to verify special entity status
under Rule 15Fh-3(a)(2) applies to all SBS Entities. See Section II.G.1. In
addition, Section 3C(g)(5) of the Exchange Act creates certain rights with respect
to clearing for counterparties entering into security-based swaps with SBS Entities
but does not require disclosure. As discussed in Section II.G.2.f, infra, Rule
15Fh-3(d) would require all SBS Entities to disclose to a counterparty certain
information relating to these clearing rights.

obligations when acting as an advisor to a special entity) and 15Fh-6 (pay to play rules)
do not apply to a Major SBS Participant. In addition, our rules provide exceptions to
Major SBS Participants, as discussed in Section II.G.2.a, from certain disclosure
requirements when entering into security-based swaps with an SBS Dealer, another
Major SBS Participant, a swap dealer or a swap participant.
In determining whether or not to apply certain requirements to Major SBS
Participants, as explained in the Proposing Release, we have considered how the
differences between the definitions of SBS Dealer and Major SBS Participant may be
relevant in formulating the business conduct standards applicable to these entities. The
Dodd-Frank Act and our rules define “security-based swap dealer” in a functional
manner, by reference to the way a person holds itself out in the market and the nature of
the conduct engaged in by that person, and how the market perceives the person’s
activities. 163 Unlike the definition of “security-based swap dealer,” which focuses on
those persons whose function is to serve as the points of connection in those markets, the
definition of “major security-based swap participant” focuses on the market impacts and
risks associated with an entity’s security-based swap positions. 164 Despite the differences
in focus, however, the Dodd-Frank Act applies substantially the same statutory standards
to SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants. 165 We explained in the Proposing Release
163

See Exchange Act Section 3(a)(71), 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(71), and Rule 3a-71, 17
CFR 240.3a71.

164

See Exchange Act Section 3(a)(67), 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(67), and Rule 3a-67, 17
CFR 240.3a67.

165

In particular, under Section 15F of the Exchange Act, SBS Dealers and Major
SBS Participants generally are subject to the same types of margin, capital,
business conduct and certain other requirements, unless an exclusion applies. See
15 U.S.C. 78o-10.

60

that, in this way, the statute applies comprehensive regulation to entities (i.e., Major SBS
Participants) whose security-based swap activities do not cause them to be dealers, but
nonetheless could pose a high degree of risk to the U.S. financial system generally.
We are mindful, as noted by a commenter, that there are “different reasons why
the Dodd-Frank Act requires additional oversight of each.” 166 We have attempted to take
into account these differing definitions and regulatory concerns in considering whether
the business conduct requirements that we proposed, and that we are adopting, for SBS
Dealers should or should not apply to Major SBS Participants as well. Accordingly, as
noted, in general, where the Dodd-Frank Act imposes a business conduct requirement on
both SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants, the rules will apply equally to SBS
Dealers and Major SBS Participants, and where a business conduct requirement is not
expressly addressed by the Dodd-Frank Act, the rules generally will not apply to Major
SBS Participants. We believe this approach addresses the concern of the commenter who
argued that the determining factor should be the conduct in which a Major SBS
Participant is likely to be engaged. 167
The external business conduct requirements promulgated under Section 15F(h)
are intended to provide certain protections for counterparties, and we believe the rules we
are adopting today appropriately apply those requirements to SBS Dealers and Major
SBS Participants so that counterparties receive the benefit of those protections. At the
same time, mindful of the different role to be played by Major SBS Participants (which,
by definition, are not SBS Dealers), we have not sought to impose the full range of
166

See MFA, supra note 5.

167

See CFA, supra note 5.

61

business conduct requirements on Major SBS Participants. We note that our approach in
this regard largely mirrors that of the CFTC, under whose rules Swap Dealers and Major
Swap Participants have operated for some time. We believe that this consistency will
result in efficiencies for entities that have already established infrastructure to comply
with the CFTC standard.
We proposed and are adopting limited exceptions (as discussed in connection
with the applicable rules) from the disclosure requirements in Rules 15Fh-3(b), 15Fh-3(c)
and 15Fh-3(d) for transactions with an SBS Entity or a Swap Entity. 168 We are not,
however, adopting the suggestion that we broaden the exceptions to permit other types of
counterparties to opt out of the disclosures and other protections provided under the rules
when entering into a transaction with a Major SBS Participant. As noted above, the
external business conduct requirements promulgated under Section 15F(h) are intended to
provide certain protections for counterparties, and we believe the rules we are adopting
today appropriately tailor those requirements so that counterparties receive the benefit of
those protections.
D.

Reliance on Representations
1.

Proposal

The Proposing Release solicited input on whether the rules adopted by the
Commission should include a standard addressing the circumstances in which an SBS
Entity may rely on representations to establish compliance with the business conduct
rules. 169 We sought comment on two alternative approaches. 170 One approach would
168

See BlackRock, supra note 5.

169

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42404, supra note 3.

62

permit an SBS Entity to rely on a representation from a counterparty unless it knows that
the representation is not accurate (“actual knowledge standard”). 171 The other would
permit an SBS Entity to rely on a representation unless the SBS Entity has information
that would cause a reasonable person to question the accuracy of the representation
(“reasonable person standard”). 172 After the Commission issued its proposed rules, the
CFTC in its final rules adopted a “reasonable person standard” that generally permits a
Swap Entity to rely on written representations to satisfy its due diligence obligations
unless it has information that would cause a reasonable person to question the accuracy of
the representation. 173
2.

Comments on the Proposal

Twelve commenters generally addressed the proposed standards for reliance on
counterparty representations. 174 With one exception, 175 these comments predate the 2012
adoption of the CFTC rules.
In 2011, seven commenters supported the actual knowledge standard. 176 One
asserted its view that the actual knowledge standard would offer greater legal certainty to

SBS Entities when making required subjective judgments under the rules (for example,
judgments regarding the qualifications of a special entity’s independent
representative). 177 Another commenter argued that the actual knowledge standard is
preferable because the reasonable person standard would require an assessment of what a
reasonable person would conclude if such person had the same information as the SBS
Entity, which could cause uncertainty and additional cost for market participants. 178
One commenter, writing after the CFTC rules were adopted, asked the
Commission to adopt a “reasonable person standard” that is “consistent with the parallel
CFTC EBC Rules,” which generally permit a Swap Entity to rely on written
representations to satisfy its due diligence obligations unless it has information that
would cause a reasonable person to question the accuracy of the representations. 179
Additionally, two other commenters supported the reasonable person standard in 2011. 180
One commenter asserted that the reasonable person standard would help to ensure that
SBS Entities are acting on reliable information because of the duty it would impose to
verify the accuracy of a representation if the SBS Entity had some reason to question

it. 181 The commenter also argued that the reasonable person standard would be easier to
monitor and enforce because it would be objective rather than subjective. 182
Some commenters suggested that the Commission require detailed
representations. 183 One commenter asked the Commission to clarify that, for purposes of
“red flags,” the knowledge test should apply only to individuals with knowledge of the
security-based swap transaction; information that may be available to other parts of the
SBS Entity organization should not be imputed to those individuals. 184 Another
commenter requested that the Commission clarify that any representations made by a
special entity or its representative to satisfy the rules do not give any party any additional
rights, such as rescission or monetary compensation (e.g., if the representations turn out
to be incorrect). 185 Additionally, the commenter asserted that an SBS Dealer should be
permitted to rely on a single set of representations made by a special entity at the
beginning of a trading relationship, rather than requiring the SBS Dealer to obtain a new
representation with each transaction, if the special entity represents that it will notify the
SBS Dealer when the representations become inaccurate. 186
More generally, another commenter recommended allowing representations to be

contained in counterparty relationship documentation if agreed to by the counterparties,
and requiring counterparties to undertake to update such representations with any
material changes. 187 The commenter also suggested that an SBS Entity that is also
registered with the CFTC as a Swap Entity should be permitted to rely on a
counterparty’s written representations with respect to the CFTC’s business conduct rules
to satisfy its due diligence requirements under the Commission’s business conduct rules
provided that the SBS Entity provides notice of such reliance to the counterparty and the
counterparty does not object. 188 The commenter argued that this would speed
implementation and lower costs without reducing counterparty protections. 189 Finally,
the commenter recommended including both a general reliance on representations
provision and also specific reliance on representations safe harbors in the individual rules
that specify what representations the SBS Entity should obtain to satisfy the safe
harbor. 190

protocol that has been adopted by most market participants as a means of
complying with the CFTC rules. See SIFMA (November 2015), supra note 5.
The commenter noted that the representations contained in this protocol only
expressly address market participants’ trading in swaps, but asserted that “ the
factual matters addressed by those representations typically do not vary as
between trading in swaps and trading in [security-based swaps]. As a result,
requiring SBS Entities to obtain separate representations specifically addressing
[security-based swaps] would impose additional costs with few, if any, additional
benefits.” Id.

Entity may rely on written representations to satisfy its due diligence requirements under
the business conduct rules unless it has information that would cause a reasonable person
to question the accuracy of the representation. Under this standard, if an SBS Entity has
in its possession information that would cause a reasonable person to question the
accuracy of the representation, it will need to make further reasonable inquiry to verify
the accuracy of the representation. 191
We understand that this is a market in which parties rely heavily on
representations both with respect to relationship documentation and the transactions
themselves. While both standards we proposed for comment could be workable in this
context, we recognize that neither provides the absolute certainty sought by some
commenters. As we explained in the Proposing Release, under either approach an SBS
Entity could not ignore information in its possession as a result of which the SBS Entity
would know that a representation is inaccurate. 192 Under an “actual knowledge”
standard, however, an SBS Entity can rely on a representation unless it knows that the
representation is inaccurate. This alternative could allow SBS Entities to rely on
questionable representations insofar as they do not have actual knowledge that the
representation is inaccurate, even if they have information that would cause reasonable
191

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42404, supra note 3. As described infra in
Section II.G.0, Rule 15Fh-3(e) will require an SBS Dealer to have policies and
procedures reasonably designed to obtain and retain certain essential facts
regarding a known counterparty. As a result, information in the SBS Entity’s
possession will include information gathered by an SBS Dealer through
compliance with the “know your counterparty” provisions of Rule 15Fh-3(e), as
well as any other information the SBS Entity has acquired through its interactions
with the counterparty, including other representations obtained from the
counterparty by the SBS Entity.

67

persons to question their accuracy. As a result, this alternative could potentially reduce
the benefits of the verification of status, know your counterparty, suitability and special
entity requirements and result in weaker protections for counterparties to SBS Entities.
In contrast, the “reasonable person” standard under the rule as adopted should help ensure
that SBS Entities do not disregard facts that call into question the validity of the
representation. 193
Further, this standard also is consistent with the standard adopted by the CFTC
under which a Swap Entity cannot rely on a representation if the Swap Entity has
information that would cause a reasonable person to question the accuracy of the
representation. 194 This consistency will result in efficiencies for entities that have already
established infrastructure to comply with the CFTC standard.
The rule as adopted would permit an SBS Entity to reasonably rely on the
representations of a counterparty or its representative to satisfy its due diligence
obligations under the business conduct rules, including Rules 15Fh-2(a) and (d), 15Fh3(a), (e) and (f), 15Fh-4 and 15Fh-5. We are not requiring a specified level of detail for
these representations but note that they should be detailed enough to permit the SBS

Cf. Exchange Act Rule 3a71-3(4) (permitting reliance on a counterparty
representation unless the party seeking to rely on the representation “knows or has
reason to know that the representation is not accurate; . . . a person would have
reason to know that the representation is not accurate if a reasonable person
should know, under all of the facts of which the person is aware, that it is not
accurate”). See also Application of “Security-Based Swap Dealer” and “Major

Entity to form a reasonable basis for believing that the applicable requirement is
satisfied. 195
Nothing in our rules would prohibit an arrangement under which the parties agree
that representations will be provided in counterparty relationship documentation, and that
they will update such representations with any material changes, as suggested by
commenters. 196
We are not accepting the commenter’s suggestion that we provide that in every
instance an SBS Entity that is also registered with the CFTC as a Swap Entity will be
permitted to rely on a counterparty’s pre-existing written representations with respect to
the CFTC’s business conduct rules to satisfy its due diligence requirements under the
Commission’s business conduct rules, provided that the SBS Entity provides notice of
such reliance to the counterparty and the counterparty does not object. 197 Rule 15Fh-1(b)
as adopted sets out the standard pursuant to which an SBS Entity can rely on
representations to satisfy its due diligence obligations, and does not speak to the process

The commenter noted that the representations contained in this protocol only
expressly address market participants’ trading in swaps, but asserted that “ the
factual matters addressed by those representations typically do not vary as

requiring SBS Entities to obtain separate representations specifically addressing

the SBS Entity will need to undertake to meet the standard. The question of whether
reliance on the representations that had been obtained with respect to the CFTC business
conduct rules, including the process by which the SBS Entity makes that determination,
would satisfy an SBS Entity’s obligations under our business conduct rules will depend
on the facts and circumstances of the particular matter. 198
We are not adopting the suggestion of one commenter that “the knowledge test
should be applied only to individuals with knowledge of the SBS transaction.” 199 In
some instances it may be appropriate to look only to the knowledge of persons involved
in a security-based swap transaction for purposes of determining whether an SBS Entity
reasonably relied on representations. However, the determination whether to impute to
the individuals that are involved in a securities-based swap transaction knowledge that
may be available in other parts of the SBS Entity will depend on the facts and
circumstances of the particular matter. At a minimum, an SBS Entity seeking to rely on
representations cannot ignore information that would cause a reasonable person to
question the accuracy of those representations.
E.

Policies and Procedures Alternative

Proposal

The Commission solicited comment on whether an SBS Entity should be deemed
to have complied with a requirement under the proposed rules if it has: (1) established
and maintained written policies and procedures, and a documented system for applying

those policies and procedures, that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with
the requirement; and (2) reasonably discharged the duties and obligations required by the
written policies and procedures and documented system, and did not have a reasonable
basis to believe that the written policies and procedures and documented system were not
being followed. 200
2.

Comments on the Proposal

One commenter addressed the policies and procedures alternative. 201 The
commenter opposed the alternative, arguing that it would reward the process of achieving
compliance more than actually achieving compliance. 202 However, the commenter
asserted that SBS Entities should be required to establish, maintain, document and
enforce appropriate policies and procedures, and that the Commission should take them
into account when determining the sanctions for violations. 203 The commenter argued
that the requirement regarding policies and procedures should supplement the
requirements or prohibitions in the rules, not supplant them. 204
3.

Response to Comments and Final Rule

After taking into consideration the comment, the Commission is not adopting a
general policies and procedures safe harbor. The Commission acknowledges the
importance of policies and procedures as a tool to achieving compliance with applicable
regulatory and other requirements but agrees with the commenter that a general policies

and procedures safe harbor could have the unintended effect of rewarding the process
towards achieving compliance more than the result of actually achieving compliance. 205
As discussed more fully herein, Rule 15Fh-3(h) requires that an SBS Entity
establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably
designed to prevent violations of applicable securities laws, and rules and regulations
thereunder. Rule 15Fh-3(h) also provides an affirmative defense to a charge of failure to
supervise diligently based, in part, on the establishment and maintenance of these policies
and procedures, where the entity has reasonably discharged the duties and obligations
required by the written policies and procedures and documented system, and did not have
a reasonable basis to believe that the written policies and procedures and documented
system were not being followed. In addition, consistent with the approach of the CFTC,
we are providing targeted representations-based safe harbors, 206 which should result in
efficiencies for entities that have already established infrastructure to comply with the
CFTC rules.

Major SBS Participant. 209 Two commenters suggested that the Commission adopt a
broader definition that would apply the business conduct rules to any person acting on
behalf of the SBS Entity, including an associated person, consistent with the CFTC
business conduct rules. 210 One commenter asserted that this would prevent SBS Entities
from “evad[ing] the business conduct rules by doing through third parties what they
would not be permitted to do directly.” 211 The commenter also discouraged the
Commission from seeking to identify all of the requirements that would apply to an
associated person of an SBS Entity, suggesting that the rules should apply in any
circumstance where an SBS Entity acts through or by means of an associated person or
other party. 212
A third commenter recommended that the Commission clarify that associated
persons of an SBS Entity should only be directly responsible for complying with the
disclosure rules and rules involving interactions with counterparties, and should not be
responsible for complying with internal business conduct standards, such as the rules
relating to supervision and requiring designation of a CCO. 213 The commenter also
suggested that the Commission define “associated person” as “an associated person of an
[SBS Dealer] or [Major SBS Participant] through whom the [SBS Dealer] or [Major SBS

Response to Comments and Final Rule

The Commission is moving the definition of “independent representative of a
special entity” from Rule 15Fh-2 to Rule 15Fh-5 and accordingly, re-designating
paragraphs (d) through (f) of Rule 15Fh-2 as paragraphs (c) through (e). The definition
of “independent representative of a special entity” and paragraphs (a), (d) and (e) of Rule
15Fh-2 (defining “act as an advisor,” “special entity” and “subject to a statutory
disqualification,” respectively) are addressed below in Section II.H.
The Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh-2(b) with two modifications. In response
to a suggestion from a commenter, 215 the Commission is correcting a typographical error
in the cross-reference to the Exchange Act definition of “eligible contract participant” in
the proposed rule. The proposed rule referenced “Section 3(a)(66)” of the Exchange Act,
but should have referenced Section 3(a)(65) of the Exchange Act, which defines an
eligible contract participant. Section 3(a)(65) of the Exchange Act, in turn, provides that
the term eligible contract participant “has the same meaning as in section 1a of the
Commodity Exchange Act.” We have also revised the definition in response to the same
commenter’s request that we add a reference to applicable rules and interpretations of the
Commission and the CFTC to incorporate the joint SEC-CFTC rulemaking adopted in May
2012. 216 In this regard, we note that the Commission and the CFTC jointly further

214

Id.

215

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5.

216

Section 712(d)(1)(A) of the Dodd-Frank Act provides, among other things, that
the CFTC and the Commission, in consultation with the Board of Governors, shall
further define the term “eligible contract participant.” Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat.
1376 (2010). Moreover, Section 712(d)(4) provides that any interpretation of, or

75

defined the term eligible contract participant by adopting rules and regulations under the
Commodity Exchange Act. 217 Thus, as adopted, the definition of “eligible contract
participant” in Rule 15Fh-2(b) refers to: “any person as defined in Section 3(a)(65) of the
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and in Section 1a of the Commodity
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.”
After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh-2(d) as
proposed, re-designated as Rule 15Fh-2(c). The statute defines the term “associated
person of a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant” to
include “any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with” an SBS Dealer or Major SBS Participant. 218 While the SBS Entity remains
ultimately responsible for compliance with the business conduct standards, to the extent
that an SBS Entity acts through, or by means of, an associated person of that SBS Entity,
the associated person must comply as well with the applicable business conduct
standards.
The Commission declines to modify the definition, as requested by some
commenters, to apply to persons acting on behalf of the SBS Entity. 219 We believe it
unnecessary to expand the definition because, as noted above, the SBS Entity remains

guidance by either Commission regarding, a provision of Title VII of the Dodd
Frank Act shall be effective only if issued jointly by the CFTC and the
Commission, after consultation with the Board of Governors, if this title requires
the Commissions to issue joint regulations to implement the provision. Id.

ultimately responsible for compliance with the business conduct standards, whether the
SBS Entity is acting through, or by means of, an associated person or other person.
In response to the commenter that raised concerns that associated persons should
not be responsible for complying with “internal” business conduct standards, 220 the
Commission notes that Rule 15Fh-2(c) provides that the definition of an SBS Entity
includes associated persons of the SBS Entity “where relevant.” Certain rules, including
the so-called “internal” business conduct rules (e.g., Rule 15Fh-3(h) (supervision) and
Rule 15Fk-1 (designation of CCO)) may apply to some but not all associated persons of
an SBS Entity, and the registrant remains ultimately responsible for compliance with all
of the business conduct rules that are the subject of this rulemaking.

Business Conduct Requirements

Counterparty Status
a.

Proposed Rule

Section 15F(h)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act directs that business conduct
requirements adopted by the Commission shall establish a duty for an SBS Entity to
verify that any counterparty meets the eligibility standards for an ECP. 221
Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(a)(1) would require an SBS Entity to verify that a
counterparty whose identity is known to an SBS Entity prior to the execution of the
transaction meets the eligibility standards for an ECP, before entering into a securitybased swap with that counterparty other than on a registered national securities exchange

or SEF. 222 Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(a)(2) would require an SBS Entity to verify whether a
counterparty whose identity is known to the SBS Entity prior to the execution of the
transaction is a special entity before entering into a security-based swap with that
counterparty, no matter where the transaction is executed. 223
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Three commenters addressed proposed Rule 15Fh-3(a). 224 One opposed limiting
the application of the rule to known counterparties, noting that this would invite SBS
Entities to promote anonymous off-exchange transactions that would allow them to avoid
obligations otherwise owed to special entities. 225 The commenter asserted that the only
exemption from the verification requirement should be for transactions on a registered
exchange or SEF, and that for such transactions, if the SBS Entity knows the identity of
the counterparty prior to the transaction and has reason to believe it may not be an ECP,

222

Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(a)(1). See Section 6(l) of the Exchange Act (making it
unlawful to effect a security-based swap transaction with or for a person that is
not an ECP unless such transaction is effected on a registered national securities
exchange). See also Section 5(e) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77e(e))
(“unless a registration statement meeting the requirements of section 10(a) [of the
Securities Act] is in effect as to a security-based swap, it shall be unlawful for any
person . . . to offer to sell, offer to buy or purchase or sell a security-based swap to
any person who is not an eligible contract participant”). See also Registration and
Regulation of Security-Based Swap Execution Facilities, Exchange Act Release
No. 63825 (Feb. 2, 2011), 76 FR 10948 (Feb. 28, 2011) (“SEF Registration

registered SBS Dealers, Major SBS Participants, brokers and ECPs).

Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(a)(2). See generally Section 15F(h)(1)(D) of the Exchange
Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(1)(D) (authorizing the Commission to prescribe

the SBS Entity should be required to undertake an additional inquiry to verify the
counterparty’s status. 226 The commenter also recommended that verification take place
before the SBS Entity offers to enter into a transaction, rather than before execution. 227
Two commenters recommended that the exception for transactions on a registered
exchange or SEF be broadened to apply to the verification of special entity status in
addition to the verification of ECP status. 228 One commenter also recommended
expanding the exception to include exempt SEFs, such as a foreign SEF that the
Commission determines to be subject to a comparable home country regime. 229
Additionally, as part of a series of recommendations to harmonize with the CFTC’s
treatment of employee benefit plans defined in Section 3 of ERISA, the commenter
suggested requiring an SBS Entity to verify whether a counterparty is eligible to elect to
be a special entity, and if so, to notify such counterparty. 230
The other commenter also recommended further narrowing the application of the
rule by excluding transactions in which the identity of the counterparty is known just
prior to execution, arguing that an SBS Entity would have insufficient time to exchange
representations with the counterparty or otherwise verify the counterparty’s status in
226

Id. The commenter also recommended that the Commission conform to the
CFTC’s then-pending proposal, which would have required counterparty status
verification in any transaction other than anonymous transactions on a swap
execution facility. We note, however, that the CFTC subsequently adopted a rule
that clarified that the exemption from verification applies to all transactions on a
designated contract market (“DCM”) and to anonymous transactions on a swap
execution facility. See CFTC Adopting Release, 77 FR at 9757, supra note 21.

those situations. 231 Alternatively, the commenter requested that the Commission require
SEFs to adopt rules that would permit verification of the counterparty’s status. 232 The
commenter also opposed establishing specific documentation requirements regarding
counterparty status, asserting that it would not allow for flexible risk management and
investment decisions through private contractual negotiation. 233
c.

Response to Comments and Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh-3(a) with
certain modifications.
Rule 15Fh-3(a)(1), as adopted, requires an SBS Entity to verify the ECP status of
a counterparty before entering into a security-based swap with that counterparty other
than a transaction executed on a registered national securities exchange. We are not
adopting the further provision of the proposed rule that would have limited the
application of the verification requirement to a counterparty “whose identity is known to
the SBS Entity prior to the execution of the transaction.” We also are not adopting the
provision of the proposed rule that would have provided that the verification requirement
does not apply to transactions executed on a SEF. These changes reflect the
Commission’s further consideration of the regulatory framework provided by the DoddFrank Act.
In particular, Section 6(l) of the Exchange Act makes it unlawful to effect a
transaction in a security-based swap with or for a person that is not an ECP, unless the

231

232

233

80

transaction is effected on a registered national securities exchange. 234 Section 6(l) of the
Exchange Act does not provide an exception for transactions effected on SEFs, or for
transactions where the identity of a counterparty is not known to the SBS Entity prior to
the execution of the transaction. Thus, upon further consideration of the proposed rule in
the context of the statute, we are not providing an exception for transactions executed
other than on a registered national securities exchange, and we are not limiting the
requirement to known counterparties because Section 6(l) of the Exchange Act does not
contain a similar exception or limitation, and we do not wish to suggest to SBS Entities
that Section 6(l) is similarly limited. In this regard, we note that, even with these
modifications, the scope of Section 6(l) of the Exchange Act (“unlawful to effect a
transaction in a security-based swap”) is broader than the activity covered by Rule 15Fh3(a)(1) (“before entering into a security-based swap”), and that SBS Entities, and other
market participants, have an independent obligation under Section 6(l) for any action
covered by that section. 235
As noted in the Proposing Release, an SBS Entity that has complied with the
requirements of Rule 15Fh-3(a)(1) concerning a counterparty’s eligibility to enter into a
particular security-based swap fulfills its obligations under the rule for that security-based
234

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42403, supra note 5. 15 U.S.C. 78f(l) (“[i]t shall
be unlawful for any person to effect a transaction in a security-based swap with or
for a person that is not an eligible contract participant, unless such transaction is
effected on a [registered] national securities exchange”).

235

See also Section 5(e) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77e(e) (“unless a
registration statement meeting the requirements of [section 10(a) of the Securities
Act] is in effect as to a security-based swap, it shall be unlawful for any person . .
. to offer to sell, offer to buy or purchase or sell a security-based swap to any
person who is not an eligible contract participant”). This rulemaking does not
address and has no applicability with respect to the requirements under the
Securities Act applicable to security-based swap transactions.

81

swap, even if the counterparty subsequently ceases to meet the eligibility standards for an
ECP during the term of that security-based swap. 236 However, an SBS Entity will need
to verify the counterparty’s status for any subsequent action covered by Rule 15Fh3(a)(1), (which it could do by relying on written representations from the counterparty, as
described above). An SBS Entity could satisfy this obligation by relying on a
representation in a master or other agreement that is renewed or “brought down” as of the
date of the subsequent action covered by 15Fh-3(a)(1). In this manner, counterparties
will be able to make representations about their status at the outset of a relationship, and
can undertake to “bring down” that representation for each relevant action involving a
security-based swap. In addition, as noted above, market participants have an
independent obligation under Section 6(l) of the Exchange Act for any action covered by
that section.
Rule 15Fh-3(a)(2), as adopted, requires an SBS Entity to verify whether a
counterparty is a special entity before entering into a security-based swap transaction
with that counterparty, unless the transaction is executed on a registered or exempt SEF
or registered national securities exchange and the SBS Entity does not know the identity
of the counterparty at a reasonably sufficient time prior to execution of the transaction to
permit the SBS Entity to comply with the obligations of the rule. The rule as proposed
would have limited the verification of special entity status to counterparties whose
identity is known to the SBS Entity prior to the execution of the security-based swap
transaction. Because the question of special entity status figures most significantly in
connection with the application of the special entity rules (Rules 15Fh-4, 15Fh-5 and
236

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42404, supra note 5.

82

15Fh-6), we have modified the special entity verification rule to track the exceptions to
those rules. 237 Accordingly, the verification of special entity status requirements will not
apply where the transaction is executed on a registered or exempt SEF or registered
national securities exchange, and the SBS Entity does not know the identity of the
counterparty at a reasonably sufficient time prior to execution of the transaction to permit
the SBS Entity to comply with the obligations of the rule.
An SBS Entity that has complied with the requirements of Rule 15Fh-3(a)(2)
concerning verification whether a counterparty is a special entity before entering into a
particular security-based swap with that counterparty fulfills its obligations under the rule
for that security-based swap. 238 However, an SBS Entity will need to verify the
counterparty’s status for any subsequent action covered by Rule 15Fh-3(a)(2) (which it
could do by relying on written representations from the counterparty, as described
above). An SBS Entity could satisfy this obligation by relying on a representation in a
master or other agreement that is renewed or “brought down” as of the date of the
subsequent action covered by 15Fh-3(a)(2). In this manner, counterparties will be able to
make representations about their status at the outset of a relationship, and can undertake
to “bring down” that representation for each relevant action involving a security-based
swap.
Additionally, the Commission is adding a new paragraph (a)(3), special entity
election, which requires an SBS Entity, in verifying the special entity status of a
counterparty pursuant to Rule 15Fh-3(a)(2), to verify whether a counterparty is eligible to
237

See Section II.B.

238

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42404, supra note 5.

83

elect not to be a special entity as provided for in the adopted special entity definition in
Rule 15Fh-2(d)(4), and if so, notify such counterparty. This change is intended to
provide the greatest protections to the broadest categories of special entities, while still
allowing them the flexibility to elect not to avail themselves of special entity
protections. 239
Although the Dodd-Frank Act does not specifically require an SBS Entity to
verify whether a counterparty is a special entity or is eligible to elect not to be a special
entity, the Commission believes that such verification will help to ensure the proper
application of the business conduct rules that apply to SBS Entities dealing with special
entities. 240
The Commission is not revising the rule, as suggested by a commenter, 241 to
require that verification of special entity counterparty status take place before an SBS
Entity “offers” to enter into a transaction. We agree with the commenter that it is
important for an SBS Entity to verify special entity status “as soon as possible . . . to
ensure timely compliance with the other obligations that accompany transactions with
these entities.” As explained in Section II.A, when the rules refer to a “counterparty” of
the SBS Entity, the term “counterparty” includes a potential counterparty where

239

As explained in Section II.H.1, we are interpreting the definition of “special
entity” to distinguish entities that are “defined in” section 3 of ERISA but not
“subject to” regulation under Title I of ERISA. Our rules as adopted would
include within the “special entity” definition entities such as church plans and
plans maintained solely for the purpose of complying with applicable workmen’s
compensation laws, unemployment compensation, or disability insurance laws but
allow them to elect not to be treated as “special entities.”

240

See Section II.H, infra.

241

See CFA, supra note 5.

84

compliance with the obligation is required before the SBS Entity and the “counterparty”
have actually entered into the security-based swap.
The Commission is not specifying the manner of documentation or procedures
required for compliance with Rule 15Fh-3(a). 242 Among other things, an SBS Entity
could rely on representations in accordance with Rule 15Fh-1(b). For example, an SBS
Entity could verify that a counterparty is an ECP by obtaining a written representation
from the counterparty as to specific facts about the counterparty (e.g., that it has $100
million in assets) to conclude that the counterparty is an ECP, unless the SBS Entity has
information that would cause a reasonable person to question the accuracy of the
representation. Similarly, an SBS Entity could seek to verify that a counterparty is not a
special entity by obtaining a written representation from the counterparty that it does not
fall within any of the enumerated categories of persons that are “special entities” for
purposes of Section 15F of the Exchange Act. The SBS Entity also could seek to obtain a
representation in writing from the counterparty if it elects not to be a special entity, as
provided for in the special entity definition in Rule 15Fh-2(d)(4). Consistent with Rule
15Fh-1(b), however, an SBS Entity cannot disregard information that would cause a
reasonable person to question the accuracy of the representation.

242

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42403, supra note 3. The Commission
separately has proposed rules regarding recordkeeping and reporting requirements
for SBS Entities that would require an SBS Entity to keep records of its
verification. See Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements for Security-Based
Swap Dealers, Major Security-Based Swap Participants, and Broker-Dealers;
Capital Rule for Certain Security-Based Swap Dealers, Exchange Act Release No.

2.

Disclosure

Section 15F(h)(3)(B) of the Exchange Act broadly requires that business conduct
requirements adopted by the Commission require disclosures by SBS Entities to
counterparties of information related to “material risks and characteristics” of the
security-based swap, “material incentives or conflicts of interest” that an SBS Entity may
have in connection with the security-based swap, and the “daily mark” of a securitybased swap. 243
a.

Disclosure not Required When the Counterparty is an
SBS Entity or a Swap Entity
i.

Proposed Rules

Section 15F(h)(3)(B) provides that disclosures under that section are not required
when the counterparty is “a security-based swap dealer, major security-based swap
participant, security-based swap dealer, or major security-based swap participant.” 244 As
explained in the Proposing Release, the Commission believes that the repetition of the
terms “security-based swap dealer and major security-based swap participant” in this
Exchange Act provision is a drafting error, and that Congress instead intended an
exclusion identical to that found in the Commodity Exchange Act, which provides that
these general disclosures are not required when the counterparty is “a swap dealer, major
swap participant, security-based swap dealer, or major security-based swap
participant.” 245 Accordingly, proposed Rule 15Fh-3(b) (information about material risks
and characteristics, and material incentives or conflicts of interests), proposed Rule 15Fh243

whenever the counterparty is an SBS Entity or Swap Entity.
ii.

Comments on the Proposal

Two commenters submitted comments on the application of the disclosure
requirements when the counterparty is an SBS Entity or Swap Entity. 246 One commenter
asserted that the disclosure requirements should apply even when the counterparty is also
an SBS Entity. 247 Another commenter agreed with the Commission’s interpretation that
Congress intended the exclusion to apply to transactions with other SBS Entities and
Swap Entities. 248 However, in response to a specific request for comment, the
commenter asserted that the Commission should not exempt transactions with other
entities (such as banks or broker-dealers) from the disclosure requirements, or otherwise
subject them to different disclosure standards, because while more sophisticated banks or
brokers may benefit, less sophisticated parties would be left without adequate
protections. 249
Additionally, as discussed in Section II.B, a commenter advocated for adding
exceptions to the disclosure requirements in Rules 15Fh-3(b) and (d) to cover securitybased swaps that are intended to be cleared and that are either (1) executed on a
registered national securities exchange or registered or exempt SEF and required to be
cleared pursuant to Section 3C of the Exchange Act, or (2) anonymous. 250 The

commenter argued that this would harmonize the scope of the Commission’s disclosure
requirements with no-action relief provided by the CFTC with respect to its parallel
requirements. 251
iii.

Response to Comments and Final Rules

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting, as proposed, the
exceptions from the disclosure requirements under Rule 15Fh-3(b) (information about
material risks and characteristics, and material incentives or conflicts of interests), Rule
15Fh-3(c) (the daily mark), and Rule 15Fh-3(d) (clearing rights) for transactions in which
the counterparty is an SBS Entity or Swap Entity. We are not adopting the suggestion
that disclosure requirements apply even when the counterparty is an SBS Entity or Swap
Entity. We believe that an SBS Entity would be well-positioned to negotiate with
another SBS Entity, and nothing in our rules precludes an SBS Entity from requesting
such disclosures.
In addition, the exceptions under the rules as adopted parallel the exceptions in
the analogous CFTC rules. This consistency will result in efficiencies for entities that
have already established infrastructure to comply with the CFTC standard.
For the reasons discussed in Section II.B, we are not providing additional
exceptions for transactions that are intended to be cleared. 252

Timing and Manner of Certain Disclosures and Scope
of Disclosure Rules
i.

Proposed Rules

Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(b) would require that disclosures regarding material risks
and characteristics and material incentives or conflicts of interest be made to potential
counterparties before entering into a security-based swap, but would not mandate the
specific manner in which those disclosures are made as long as they are made “in a
manner reasonably designed to allow the counterparty to assess” the information being
provided. 253 Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(d) similarly would require that disclosures regarding
certain clearing rights be made before entering into a security-based swap, but would not
mandate the manner of disclosure. To the extent such disclosures were not otherwise
provided to the counterparty in writing prior to entering into a security-based swap,
proposed Rules 15Fh-3(b)(3)and 15Fh-3(d)(3) would require an SBS Entity to make a
written record of the non-written disclosures made pursuant to proposed Rules 15Fh-3(b)
and 15Fh-3(d), respectively, and provide a written version of these disclosures to the
counterparty in a timely manner, but in any case no later than the delivery of the trade
acknowledgement of the particular transaction.
ii.

Comments on Proposed Rules
Timing and Manner of Certain Disclosures

Five commenters addressed the timing and manner of required disclosures. 254
One commenter recommended allowing disclosure requirements to be satisfied by the
253

Section 15F(h)(3)(B) of the Exchange Act is silent regarding both form and
timing of disclosure. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(3)(B).

89

execution of a master agreement and provision of a trade acknowledgment. 255 Similarly,
another commenter urged the Commission to permit all required disclosures to be made
upfront at the beginning of a trading relationship, rather than on a transaction-bytransaction basis. 256
Alternatively, if the Commission requires disclosure beyond the master agreement
and trade acknowledgment, the first commenter encouraged the Commission to permit
the use of standardized disclosures. 257 The commenter also recommended that the
Commission not dictate the timing of required disclosures and permit SBS Entities to
make required disclosures in advance, as opposed to immediately prior to the execution
of a trade, so as not to interfere with the parties’ desired timing. 258 However, the
commenter noted that advance disclosure requirements would be infeasible for
transactions executed on a SEF or exchange, or where the counterparty is known only
immediately prior to or after execution. 259
In contrast, two commenters advocated for more specific requirements with
respect to the timing and manner of disclosure. 260 Both recommended that disclosure be
required in writing and at a “reasonably sufficient time” prior to the execution of the
transaction to allow counterparties to evaluate the information before deciding whether to

enter the transaction. 261 One commenter also asserted that disclosure should be in a clear
and intelligible format that permits comparison between derivatives offered by different
market participants. 262 The other commenter opposed allowing SBS Entities to satisfy
disclosure requirements through entry into a master agreement and provision of a trade
acknowledgement, arguing that key information could be lost in the fine print of legal
documents. 263 At a minimum, if a master agreement is used, the commenter
recommended that the required disclosures regarding material risks and characteristics
and material incentives or conflicts of interest be provided in a clearly labeled, separate
narrative incorporated into the overall document, and that all key issues be disclosed
before the trade is executed and not in a post-trade acknowledgement. 264
Another commenter also recommended that disclosure regarding material risks
and characteristics and material incentives or conflicts of interest be required at a
“reasonably sufficient time” prior to the execution of the transaction to harmonize with
the CFTC’s disclosure requirements. 265 Additionally, as discussed in Section II.B, the
commenter advocated for adding exceptions to the disclosure requirements in Rules
15Fh-3(b) and (d) to cover security-based swaps that are intended to be cleared and that
are either: (1) executed on a registered national securities exchange or registered or
exempt SEF and required to be cleared pursuant to Section 3C of the Exchange Act, or

Written Records of Non-Written Disclosure
One commenter addressed the written record requirements in proposed Rules
15Fh-3(b)(3) and 15Fh-3(d)(3). 267 The commenter opposed permitting SBS Entities to
make required disclosures orally, asserting that oral disclosure fails to promote pre-trade
transparency and makes enforcement more difficult, and that SBS Entities may minimize
disclosure of conflicts of interest when making them orally. 268 The commenter also
argued that the Commission’s approach to permitting oral disclosure “doesn’t even have
the benefit of saving labor, since the Commission proposes to require after-the-fact
written disclosures of any information not made in writing prior to the transaction.” 269
Scope of Disclosure Rules
If the Commission requires disclosure beyond the master agreement and trade
acknowledgment, one commenter encouraged the Commission to exclude from such
requirements counterparties that are regulated entities such as banks, broker-dealers, and
investment advisers. 270 Two other commenters argued that Major SBS Participants
should not be subject to the disclosure requirements because they will be transacting with
counterparties at arm’s length. 271 Alternatively, one commenter suggested exempting
transactions between Major SBS Participants and SBS Dealers from the disclosure

requirements, in particular receiving written records of non-written disclosure. 272
Similarly, another commenter suggested that ECPs should have the option of opting-out
of disclosures. 273
iii.

Response to Comments and Final Rules

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting the rules
substantially as proposed, with certain modifications. In response to commenters’
concerns, the Commission is requiring that an SBS Entity make the disclosures required
by Rule 15Fh-3(b) regarding material risks and characteristics and material incentives or
conflicts of interest at a reasonably sufficient time prior to entering into a security-based
swap to allow the counterparty to assess the disclosures. This will also be consistent with
the CFTC’s timing requirement for its parallel disclosures rules, resulting in efficiencies
for entities that have already established infrastructure to comply with the CFTC
standard.
With respect to the manner of disclosure, we are not adopting the commenters’
suggestion that we impose more specific requirements with respect to the timing and
manner of disclosure. 274 Instead, the Commission continues to believe it is appropriate to
require only that disclosures regarding material risks and characteristics and material
incentives or conflicts of interest be made “in a manner reasonably designed to allow the
counterparty to assess” the information being provided pursuant to Rule 15Fh-3(b). As

See MFA, supra note 5.

274

See Better Markets (August 2011), supra note 5; CFA, supra note 5.

93

noted in the Proposing Release, this provision is intended to require that disclosures be
reasonably clear and informative as to the relevant material risks or conflicts that are the
subject of the disclosure, and is not intended to impose a requirement that disclosures be
tailored to a particular counterparty or to the financial, commercial or other status of that
counterparty. 275
After considering the comments, the Commission is also adopting as proposed the
requirements in Rules 15Fh-3(b)(3) and 15Fh-3(d)(3) that an SBS Entity make a written
record of any non-written disclosures made pursuant to Rules15Fh-3(b) and 15Fh-3(d),
respectively, and provide a written version of these disclosures to the counterparty in a
timely manner, but in any case no later than the delivery of the trade acknowledgement 276
of the particular transaction. As noted in the Proposing Release and suggested by
commenters, the Commission understands that security-based swaps generally are
executed under master agreements, with much of the transaction-specific disclosure
provided over the telephone, in instant messages or in confirmations. 277 The Commission
believes that parties should have the flexibility to make disclosures by various means,
including master agreements and related documentation, telephone calls, emails, instant

messages, and electronic platforms. 278 Similarly, while we acknowledge the
commenter’s concern that SBS Entities may minimize disclosure of conflicts of interest
when making them orally, we are not persuaded that requiring all disclosures be provided
in writing prior to the parties’ entering into a security-based swap would be necessary to
provide protections under the rule as adopted. We further note that Rule 15Fh-3(b)(3),
discussed in Section II.G.2.c, separately requires that an SBS Entity provide a written
record of non-written disclosures no later than the delivery of the trade acknowledgement
of the particular transaction. Accordingly, the Commission anticipates that SBS Entities
may elect to make certain required disclosures of material information to their
counterparties in a master agreement or other written document accompanying such
agreement. While certain forms of disclosure may be highly standardized, certain
provisions may need to be tailored to the particular transaction, most notably pricing and
other transaction-specific commercial terms. As noted in the Proposing Release, the
Commission believes this approach is generally consistent with the use of standardized
disclosures suggested by industry groups and commenters. 279
We do believe, however, that is it is important that the required disclosures be
made at a reasonably sufficient time before the execution of the transaction to allow the
counterparty to assess the disclosures. While this time may vary depending on the
278

When SBS Entities rely on electronic media, their counterparties generally should
have the capability to effectively access all of the information required by Rule
15Fh-3(b)(3) in a format that is understandable but not unduly burdensome for the
counterparty. See generally Use of Electronic Media by Broker-Dealers, Transfer
Agents and Investment Advisers for Delivery of Electronic Information,

product and the counterparty, we do not believe, as suggested by some commenters, that
SBS Entities should be able to rely on trade acknowledgements alone to satisfy certain
disclosure requirements. 280 As noted in the Proposing Release, however, SBS Entities
could rely on trade acknowledgements to memorialize non-written disclosures they made
prior to entering into the proposed transaction. 281
As discussed in Section II.B above, the Commission is limiting the disclosure
requirements in Rules 15Fh-3(b) and (d) to circumstances where the identity of the
counterparty is known to the SBS Entity at a reasonably sufficient time prior to execution
of the transaction to permit the SBS Entity to comply with the obligations of the rule.
The disclosure requirements in Rules 15Fh-3(b) and (d) will not apply where the identity
of the counterparty is not discovered until after the execution of the transaction, or where
the SBS Entity learns the identity of the counterparty with insufficient time to be able to
provide the necessary disclosures to satisfy its obligations under the rule without
disrupting or delaying the execution of the transaction. Similarly, for the reasons
discussed in Section II.A.3.d, we are not providing additional exceptions or “opt-out”
rights.
Finally, we are not adopting the suggestion of one commenter that the
Commission exclude from the disclosure requirements transactions with counterparties
that are regulated entities such as banks, broker-dealers, and investment advisers. 282
Because information asymmetries exist in a market for opaque and complex products,

even for regulated entities, such disclosures may help inform counterparties concerning
the valuations and material risks and characteristics of security-based swaps in the
sometimes rapidly changing market environment. 283 In this regard, the external business
conduct requirements promulgated under Section 15F(h) are intended to provide certain
protections for counterparties, including information regarding the material risks and
characteristics of the security-based swap, any material incentives or conflicts of interest
that the SBS Entity may have, and the daily mark of the security-based swap. We
believe the rules we are adopting today appropriately apply those requirements so that
counterparties receive the benefit of those protections, and so are not providing
counterparty exclusions beyond the exception for transactions with SBS Entities and
Swap Entities discussed in Section II.G.2.a, infra.
c.

Material Risks and Characteristics of the SecurityBased Swap
i.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(b)(1) would require an SBS Entity to disclose the material
risks and characteristics of the particular security-based swap, including, but not limited
to, the material factors that influence the day-to-day changes in valuation, the factors or
events that might lead to significant losses, the sensitivities of the security-based swap to
those factors and conditions, and the approximate magnitude of the gains or losses the
security-based swap would experience under specified circumstances. In the Proposing

283

See Section VI.C, infra.

97

Release, the Commission also solicited comment regarding whether SBS Entities should
be specifically required to provide scenario analysis disclosure. 284
ii.

Comments on the Proposed Rule
General

Seven commenters addressed the disclosure of material risks and characteristics
of security-based swaps. 285 One commenter expressed support for the proposed
disclosure requirements, agreeing that the disclosure should include any information for
which there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the
information to be important in making an investment decision. 286
Two commenters argued that the Commission should adopt different or modified
disclosure requirements. 287 One commenter requested that the Commission clarify in the
rule that: (1) the rule only requires disclosure about the material risks and characteristics
of the security-based swap itself and not with respect to the underlying reference security
or index, and (2) the rule does not require disclosure in relation to any particular
counterparty. 288 The commenter also asked the Commission to eliminate the proposed
requirement that risk disclosures set forth the approximate magnitude of the gains or
losses the security-based swap will experience under specified circumstances because this
is the functional equivalent of a requirement to provide a scenario analysis, which the

commenter does not support (discussed below). 289 Additionally, the commenter noted its
view that the Commission should not require an SBS Entity to disclose the absence of
certain material provisions typically contained in master agreements for security-based
swap transactions because master agreements differ and what is “typical” is not clear. 290
A second commenter requested a clarification that only material information is required
to be disclosed. 291
Three commenters argued for additional or modified requirements. 292 One
asserted that the proposed disclosure obligations are too limited in terms of scope, form,
and content. 293 The commenter suggested that the disclosure provisions should require
“more complete, timely, and intelligible disclosure of all the risks, costs, and other
material information relating to [security-based swap] transactions,” including
disaggregated prices and risks, listed hedge equivalents, scenario analysis (discussed
below), and embedded financing costs. 294 Similarly, another commenter requested
clarification regarding what material risks and characteristics must be disclosed, arguing
that the disclosure should include liquidity risks, the details of (and separate prices for)
the standardized component parts of any customized security-based swap, any features of
the security-based swap that could disadvantage the counterparty (such as differences in
interest rates paid versus those received), and where credit arrangements are built into

security-based swaps through forbearance of collateral posting, the embedded credit and
its price. 295 A third commenter also suggested that the Commission clarify what material
risks and characteristics must be disclosed, proposing that SBS Entities be required to
disclose any material risk related to the source of a security-based swap’s assets and any
negative view by the SBS Entity itself of the assets’ riskiness. 296 The commenter also
recommended that SBS Entities be required to disclose the material risks and
characteristics not just of the security-based swap itself, but also of any reference
securities, indices, or other assets, noting that this disclosure would be particularly
important when the security-based swap references unique pools of assets arranged by the
SBS Entity. 297
Another commenter, writing after the CFTC adopted its final rules, recommended
that the Commission harmonize with the CFTC’s requirement to disclose material risks
and characteristics. 298 Specifically, the commenter requested that, like the CFTC, the
Commission describe the material risks and characteristics to be disclosed as including
“market, credit, liquidity, foreign currency, legal, operational, and any other applicable
risks,” and “the material economic terms of the security-based swap, the terms relating to
the operation of the security-based swap, and the rights and obligations of the parties
during the term of the security-based swap.” 299 The commenter argued that
harmonization with the CFTC would help support the continued development of standard

disclosures, reducing compliance costs and preventing undue delays in execution, and
would reduce the likelihood of inconsistent disclosures for similar products and resulting
counterparty confusion. 300
Scenario Analysis
We sought comment on whether we should require scenario analysis and, if so,
what standards should apply. Eight commenters addressed the disclosure of scenario
analysis. 301 Four commenters supported requiring scenario analysis disclosure to some
degree. 302 Of these commenters, one suggested that the analysis include specific
information about the security-based swap’s liquidity and volatility. 303 Another
recommended only requiring scenario analysis disclosure for “high-risk complex
security-based swaps,” and suggested that the Commission provide additional
clarification or a definition for determining what security-based swaps are high-risk and
complex. 304 A third commenter advocated requiring SBS Entities to notify counterparties
of their right to receive a scenario analysis and to provide a scenario analysis at the
request of a non-SBS Entity counterparty. 305 To reduce the costs associated with
providing scenario analyses and to mitigate the disclosure of SBS Entities’ proprietary

information, the commenter suggested that the Commission permit SBS Entities to
delegate the provision of scenario analyses to qualified third-parties. 306 The commenter
explained that requiring scenario analysis disclosure on a transaction-by-transaction basis
would not be necessary because SBS Entity counterparties are generally sophisticated
enough to create their own, more meaningful, portfolio-based analyses, but that scenario
analyses could help a less sophisticated counterparty understand the dynamics and
potential exposure of security-based swaps on a portfolio-level. 307 The commenter also
noted that the Commission should encourage all market participants to create or obtain a
portfolio-level scenario analysis, in keeping with industry best practices. 308
Four commenters opposed requiring disclosure of scenario analysis. 309 One noted
that requiring scenario analysis disclosure would have potentially significant adverse
consequences for special entities and other counterparties, and urged the Commission to
refrain from requiring it. 310 Specifically, the commenter explained that requiring
scenario analysis would likely delay execution of transactions and expose counterparties
to market risk for potentially extended periods of time (including at critical times when
the counterparty is seeking to hedge its positions in volatile markets) because the
development of scenario analyses depends upon the specific terms agreed by the parties
and therefore, cannot be performed until full agreement on the material terms is

reached. 311 Additionally, the commenter noted that the development of such analyses
would cause SBS Entities to incur substantial costs, which ultimately would be passed on
to counterparties. 312 Another commenter opposed a requirement to provide scenario
analysis and asserted that, if a scenario analysis is required, it should only be at the
request of the counterparty and only with respect to scenarios based on parameters
selected by the counterparty. 313 The commenter also expressed concern that providing a
scenario analysis could be viewed as a “recommendation” that triggers other
requirements under the proposed rules (e.g., suitability requirements). 314
A third commenter, writing after the CFTC adopted final rules, 315 stated that, in
its experience, the CFTC’s scenario analysis requirement has complicated the ability of
SBS Dealers to provide different pricing scenarios, either voluntarily or at the request of
a counterparty, because it creates “uncertainty as to when those scenarios must satisfy the
requirements for scenario analysis set forth in the CFTC EBC rules.” 316
A fourth commenter recommended that, to the extent a Major SBS Participant is
transacting with an ECP at arm’s-length, the Commission should explicitly exclude

The CFTC had proposed to require scenario analysis for “high-risk complex
bilateral swaps” but in its final rules determined instead to require scenario
analysis only when requested by the counterparty for any swap not “made
available for trading” on a designated contract market or swap execution facility.
To comply with the CFTC rule, swap dealers must disclose to counterparties their
right to receive scenario analysis and consult with counterparties regarding
design. See CFTC Adopting Release, 77 FR at 9762-9763, supra note 21. See
also 17 CFR 23.431(b).

scenario analysis from the information that the Major SBS Participant is required to
disclose pursuant to Rule 15Fh-3(b). 317 The commenter asserted that scenario analysis
disclosure would be costly and redundant since the rule would already require Major SBS
Participants to undertake a transaction-specific analysis, and prepare tailored disclosures
of a transaction’s loss sensitivities to market factors and conditions, and the magnitude of
gains and losses the transaction may experience under specified circumstances. 318
iii.

Response to Comments and Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh-3(b)(1)
with some modifications requested by commenters to more closely align the requirements
of our rules with those of the CFTC.
We have revised the descriptions in Rule 15Fh-3(b)(1) of the required disclosures
of material risks and characteristics of a security-based swap to harmonize with the
descriptions in the parallel CFTC disclosure requirement. As adopted, Rule 15Fh-3(b)(1)
requires an SBS Entity to disclose material information in a manner reasonably designed
to allow the counterparty to assess the material risks and characteristics of the particular
security-based swap, which may include (1) market risk, 319 credit risk, 320 liquidity risk, 321

317

See MFA, supra note 5.

318

Id.

319

By “market risk,” we mean the risk to the value of a security-based swap
“resulting from adverse movements in the level or volatility of market prices.”
See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42408 n.82, supra note 3.

320

By “credit risk,” we mean the risk that a counterparty to a security-based swap
“will fail to perform on an obligation” under the security-based swap. See
Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42408 n.80, supra note 3.

321

By “liquidity risk,” we mean the risk that a counterparty to a security-based swap
“may not be able to, or cannot easily, unwind or offset a particular position at or
near the previous market price because of inadequate market depth or because of

104

foreign currency risk, legal risk, 322 operational risk 323 and any other applicable risks, and
(2) the material economic terms of the security-based swap, and the rights and obligations
of the parties during the term of the security-based swap. These changes are intended to
provide an illustrative list of material risks and characteristics. In addition, these changes
will harmonize our rule with the requirements of the CFTC rule, which should result in
efficiencies for SBS Entities that have already established infrastructure to comply with
the CFTC rules, while still achieving the objectives of the rule to provide information to a
counterparty to help them assess whether, and under what terms, they want to enter into
the transaction.
The rule as adopted requires disclosure of “material” information regarding
material risks and characteristics and material incentives or conflicts of interests. We
believe that this modification will provide for an appropriate level of disclosure by
requiring disclosure of “material” information, that is, the information most relevant to a
counterparty’s assessment of whether and under what terms to enter into a security-based
swap. In addition, it will harmonize with the CFTC approach, promoting regulatory
consistency across the swap and security-based swap markets, particularly among entities
that transact in both markets and have already established infrastructure to comply with
existing CFTC regulations. In response to comment, the Commission believes that for
disruptions in the marketplace.” See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42408 n.83,
supra note 3.
322

By “legal risk,” we mean the risk that agreements are unenforceable or incorrectly
or inadequately documented. See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42408 n.85, supra
note 3.

323

By “operational risk,” we mean the risk that “deficiencies in information systems
or internal controls, [including human error,] will result in unexpected loss.” See
Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42408 n.84, supra note 3.

105

purposes of evaluating the material risks and characteristics of the particular securitybased swap, including its economic terms, material information about the referenced
security, index, asset or issuer should be disclosed. 324 As one commenter suggested, this
disclosure would be particularly important when, for example, the security-based swap
references unique pools of assets arranged by the SBS Entity. 325
The Commission anticipates that SBS Entities may provide these disclosures
through various means, including by providing a scenario analysis, as noted in the
Proposing Release. 326 We are not, however, adopting any requirements that would
require an SBS Entity to provide scenario analysis. Although scenario analysis may
prove a valuable analytic tool, it is one means by which information may be conveyed,
and we acknowledge the concerns of commenters that a scenario analysis may not be
necessary or appropriate in every situation to ensure that appropriate disclosures are
made. We note, however, that nothing in our rules would preclude parties from
requesting such analysis, even if a security-based swap is “made available for trading.”
In this regard, our approach differs from that of the CFTC which requires a Swap Dealer
to provide scenario analysis when requested by a counterparty for any swap that is not
“made available for trading” on a designated contract market or swap execution facility.
We believe, however, that the approaches are consistent because, as noted above, the

324

The manner in which and extent of information about the referenced security,
index, asset or issuer is disclosed would depend on the particular facts and
circumstances, including the public availability of the information.

326

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42408 n.88, supra note 3.

106

Commission is not prohibiting counterparties from requesting scenario analysis
disclosure.
As noted in the Proposing Release, these disclosures are intended to pertain to the
material risks and characteristics of the security-based swap, and not the material risks
and characteristics of the security-based swap with respect to a particular counterparty. 327
d.

Material Incentives or Conflicts of Interest
i.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(b)(2) would require the SBS Entity to disclose any
material incentives or conflicts of interest that it may have in connection with the
security-based swap, including any compensation or other incentives from any source
other than the counterparty in connection with the security-based swap to be entered into
with the counterparty. 328 We explained in the Proposing Release that we preliminarily
believed that the term “incentives” – which is used in Section 15F(h)(3)(b)(ii) of the
Dodd-Frank Act – refers not to any profit or return that the SBS Entity would expect to
earn from the security-based swap itself, or from any related hedging or trading activities
of the SBS Entity, but rather to any other financial arrangements pursuant to which an
SBS Entity may have an incentive to encourage the counterparty to enter into the
327

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42408 n.87, supra note 3. However, if an SBS
Dealer recommends a security-based swap or trading strategy involving a
security-based swap, or acts as an advisor to a special entity, for example, Rules
15Fh-3(f) and 15Fh-4, respectively, impose certain counterparty-specific
requirements. See Rules 15Fh-3(f) and 15Fh-4, discussed infra in Sections II.G.0
and II.H.3.

328

See Section 15F(h)(3)(B)(ii) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(3)(B)(ii)

interest” that the SBS Entity may have in connection with the security-based
swap).

transaction. This disclosure would include, among other things, information concerning
any compensation (e.g., under revenue-sharing arrangements) or other incentives the SBS
Entity receives from any source other than the counterparty in connection with the
security-based swap to be entered into with the counterparty, but would not include, for
example, expected cash flows received from a transaction to hedge the security-based
swap or that the security-based swap is intended to hedge. 329

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Seven commenters addressed the disclosure of material incentives or conflicts of
interest. 330 One commenter expressed strong support for the proposed rule. 331 A second
commenter also supported the proposed rule, noting that it is consistent with the CFTC’s
parallel requirement, except for the CFTC’s requirement to disclose a pre-trade midmarket mark, which the commenter argued is of limited benefit and delays execution of
transactions. 332 Three other commenters expressed support for the proposed rule but also
suggested certain revisions to the rule. 333 One recommended modifying the rule to
include specific disclosures by SBS Entities of any affiliations or material business
relationships they may have with any provider of security-based swap valuation
services. 334 Another noted that an SBS Entity’s biggest conflict of interest would likely
be the difference in compensation between selling a security-based swap (and in

particular, a customized security-based swap) versus another product with similar
economic terms. 335 Accordingly, the commenter recommended that SBS Entities be
required to include any differential compensation in their disclosure. 336 Additionally, the
commenter asserted that if an SBS Entity is entering a trade as part of a trading strategy
to move a position off its books, the SBS Entity should be required to disclose that
particular conflict of interest and that the security-based swap is recommended to effect
that strategy. 337 A third commenter suggested coordinating the proposed rule with the
conflict of interest prohibitions in Sections 619 and 621 of the Dodd-Frank Act to clarify
that those prohibitions cannot be circumvented through application of the business
conduct disclosure requirements. 338 The commenter also recommended including in
these required disclosures any otherwise hidden profits or returns that the SBS Entity
expects to make from a security-based swap, related agreement or arrangement, or related
hedging or trading activity. 339
One commenter objected to any requirement that an SBS Entity disclose its
anticipated profit for the security-based swap. 340 The commenter asserted that the best
protection for a counterparty is reviewing and selecting the best available pricing. 341

Response to Comments and Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh-3(b)(2)
as proposed.
As noted in the Proposing Release, the Commission believes that the term
“incentives” – which is used in Section 15F(h)(3)(b)(ii) of the Dodd-Frank Act – refers
not to any profit or return that the SBS Entity would expect to earn from the securitybased swap itself, or from any related hedging or trading activities of the SBS Entity, but
rather to any other financial arrangements pursuant to which an SBS Entity may have an
incentive to encourage the counterparty to enter into the transaction. 342 Accordingly, the
disclosure required pursuant to Rule 15Fh-3(b)(2) generally should include information
concerning any compensation (for example, under revenue-sharing arrangements) or
other incentives the SBS Entity receives from any source other than the counterparty in
connection with the security-based swap to be entered into with the counterparty but will
not include, for example, expected cash flows received from a transaction to hedge the
security-based swap or that the security-based swap is intended to hedge.
As discussed above, whether a conflict or incentive is material depends on the
facts and circumstances of the particular matter. Although we are not expressly requiring
disclosure of differential compensation as requested by the commenter, the difference in
compensation an SBS Entity may receive for selling a security-based swap versus another
product with similar economic terms may create a material incentive or conflict of
interest that would need to be disclosed under the framework discussed above. Similarly,
an SBS Entity would need to disclose material information concerning affiliations or
342

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42409, supra note 3.

110

material business relationships it may have with any provider of security-based swap
valuation providers if those relationships create a material incentive or conflict of
interest. Regarding the commenter’s concern that the conflict of interest prohibitions in
Sections 619 and 621 of the Dodd-Frank Act might be circumvented through application
of the business conduct disclosure requirements, 343 nothing in our rules limits or restricts
the applicability of other relevant laws. 344
e.

Daily Mark

Exchange Act Section 15F(h)(3)(B)(iii) directs that business conduct
requirements adopted by the Commission require an SBS Entity to disclose to a
counterparty (other than to another SBS Entity or Swap Entity): (i) for cleared securitybased swaps, upon request of the counterparty, the daily mark from the appropriate
derivatives clearing organization; 345 and (ii) for uncleared security-based swaps, the daily
343

See Levin, supra note 5.

344

For instance, depending on the facts and circumstances, failure to disclose
material conflicts of interest when there is a recommendation by a broker-dealer
can be a violation of the antifraud rules. See, e.g., Chasins v. Smith, Barney &
Co., 438 F.2d 1167, 1172 (2d Cir. 1970) (explaining that failure to inform a
customer fully of a possible conflict of interest in the securities which the broker
recommended for purchase was an omission of material fact in violation of Rule
10b-5). See also In the Matter of Richmark Capital Corp., Exchange Act Release
No. 48758 (Nov. 7, 2003) (Commission opinion) (“When a securities dealer
recommends stock to a customer, it is not only obligated to avoid affirmative
misstatements, but also must disclose material adverse facts of which it is aware.
That includes disclosure of ‘adverse interests’ such as ‘economic self-interest’
that could have influenced its recommendation.”) (citations omitted).

345

As noted in the Proposing Release, although Section 15F(h)(3)(B)(iii) of the
Exchange Act refers to a “derivatives clearing organization,” the Commission
believes that this was a drafting error and that Congress intended to refer to a
“clearing agency” because the Dodd-Frank Act elsewhere requires security-based
swaps to be cleared at registered clearing agencies, not derivatives clearing
organizations. See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42410 n.98, supra note 3; Section
17A(g) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(g).

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(c) would require an SBS Entity to disclose to its
counterparty (other than to another SBS Entity or Swap Entity): (1) for a cleared securitybased swap, upon the request of the counterparty, the daily end-of-day settlement price
that the SBS Entity receives from the appropriate clearing agency, and (2) for an
uncleared security-based swap, the midpoint between the bid and offer, or the calculated
equivalent thereof, as of the close of business, unless the parties agree in writing to a
different time, on each business day during the term of the security-based swap.
Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(c)(2) would specify that the daily mark for an uncleared securitybased swap may be based on market quotations for comparable security-based swaps,
mathematical models or a combination thereof. Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(c)(2) also would
require disclosure of the data sources and a description of the methodology and
assumptions used to prepare the daily mark for an uncleared security-based swap, as well
as any material changes to such data sources, methodology or assumptions during the
term of the security-based swap.

Comments on Proposed Rule

Ten comment letters addressed the requirement for SBS Entities to provide a daily
mark. 346
One commenter suggested modifications to the daily mark requirement to

harmonize with the CFTC’s parallel requirement. 347 Specifically, for cleared securitybased swaps, the commenter recommended that an SBS Entity simply be required to
notify a counterparty of its right to receive the daily mark from the appropriate clearing
agency upon request. 348 The commenter also argued that the CFTC’s description of the
clearinghouse’s mark is less prescriptive. 349 Additionally, the commenter recommended
that the Commission provide guidance clarifying that an SBS Entity will be deemed to
satisfy the daily mark requirement for cleared security-based swaps if the counterparty
has agreed to receive its daily mark from its clearing member. 350
One commenter asserted that requiring SBS Entities to provide daily marks would
not further the goal of providing helpful transparency because in most transactions marks
are typically either based on internal models or derived from indices with which the
transactions are not perfectly matched. 351 Another commenter asked the Commission to
carefully review and consider the costs of such a requirement before imposing any
obligation to provide daily marks, other than those agreed upon for collateral purposes or
for which midmarket quotations are observable. 352 The commenter also requested that
“sophisticated counterparties” be permitted to opt out of this requirement, and
recommended that the Commission clarify that where parties have agreed upon a basis
for margining uncleared security-based swaps, providing the daily mark used to make the

related margin calculation should satisfy the SBS Entity’s daily mark disclosure
obligations. 353
One commenter suggested that the data sources, methodology and assumptions
used to prepare the daily mark should be required to constitute a complete and
independently verifiable methodology for valuing each security-based swap entered into
between the parties, noting that this would promote objectivity and transparency, and aid
in the resolution of disputes. 354 In this regard, a second commenter also expressed
support for requiring the provision of a daily mark and specifically for requiring
disclosure of any material changes to the data sources, methodology and assumptions
used to prepare the daily mark, noting that this should include disclosing if the data
sources become unreliable or unavailable and any resulting changes to the valuations. 355
A third commenter recommended requiring disclosure as to how the daily mark is
calculated, including such information as whether the daily mark was calculated based on
inputs related to actual trade activity, using mathematical models, quotes and prices of
other comparable securities, and whether those inputs came from third-party valuation
service providers. 356 The commenter added, however, that the proposed disclosure of the
data sources and the description of the methodology and assumptions used were not
likely to require the disclosure of proprietary information and that a general description
of key valuation inputs should be sufficient. 357 Likewise, another commenter also

recommended that the Commission clarify in rule text that an SBS Entity is not required
to disclose confidential, proprietary information about any model it may use to prepare
the daily mark. 358
This commenter also recommended that an SBS Entity should disclose additional
information concerning its daily mark to ensure a fair and balanced communication,
including that: (1) the daily mark may not necessarily be a price at which the SBS Entity
or counterparty would agree to replace or terminate the security-based swap; (2) calls for
margin may be based on considerations other than the daily mark; and (3) the daily mark
may not necessarily be the value of the security-based swap that is marked on the books
of the SBS Entity. 359 Additionally, this commenter advocated for eliminating the
proposed requirement for the SBS Entity to disclose its data sources used to prepare the
daily mark to harmonize more closely with the CFTC rule, which requires disclosure of
assumptions and methodologies but not data sources. 360
One commenter noted that Major SBS Participants, unlike SBS Dealers, will not
always have access to sufficient market information to provide a daily mark, particularly
if the security-based swap is not actively traded or if there are no current bid and offer
quotes. 361 The commenter expressed concern that this could cause Major SBS
Participants to have to reveal proprietary information about their trading book positions,
particularly when providing the methodology and inputs that they used to prepare the

daily mark. 362 The commenter suggested permitting sophisticated counterparties to opt
out of receiving daily marks. 363 Another commenter suggested either not requiring Major
SBS Participants to provide the daily mark to its counterparties or in the alternative, to
exempt transactions between Major SBS Participants and SBS Dealers and allow all other
counterparties to opt out of receiving such disclosures. 364
Several commenters raised potential conflicts of interest concerns in connection
with providing the daily mark for uncleared security-based swaps. Two commenters
recommended requiring SBS Entities to use third-party quotations whenever possible to
calculate the daily mark for uncleared security-based swaps. 365 One commenter
suggested allowing use of the midpoint between an SBS Entity’s bid and offer prices only
when the SBS Entity’s internal book value falls within the same price range. 366
Additionally, this commenter suggested that the Commission consider requiring the SBS
Entity to provide clients with actionable quotes or prices at which the SBS Entity would
terminate the swap or allow the client to buy more, and with actionable quotes at a
significant size as a means to ensure accuracy. 367 Another commenter noted its view that
defining the daily mark for uncleared security-based swaps as the midpoint between the
bid and offer prices, or the calculated equivalent thereof, could be problematic because it
may present a conflict of interest for SBS Entities, particularly when the security-based

swaps are not actively traded or do not have consistent or up-to-date bid and offer
quotes. 368 This commenter also suggested requiring SBS Entities and their counterparties
to have a clearly defined process for resolving any potential valuation disputes. 369
Two commenters addressed the communication of daily marks, supporting the use
of web-based methods of communication. 370 One commenter advocated for web-based
systems to be the preferred method of communication, but noted that since some market
participants prefer more traditional methods of communication, web-based systems
should not be required. 371 The commenter recommended requiring SBS Entities to have
policies and procedures in place that reasonably ensure that any non-electronic means of
communication is safe and secure and is otherwise comparable to web-based systems. 372
Additionally, the commenter generally requested that the Commission provide greater
clarity on permissible methods for delivering daily mark disclosures, establish minimum
requirements for the communication of daily marks (for instance, that the interfaces used
provide counterparties with appropriate tools to initiate, track and close valuation
disputes), and require SBS Entities to ensure that the method of communication is
designed to protect the confidentiality of the data and prevent any unintentional or
fraudulent addition, modification or deletion of a valuation record. 373 The second
commenter suggested that the use of a secure website or electronic platform should be

required to enhance data security. 374 The commenter noted that such a platform could
also be used to provide transparency into the inputs used to determine the daily mark and
to initiate inquiries or challenges to the daily mark. 375 The commenter also
recommended that the Commission require daily mark information to be provided
without charge. 376
iii.

Response to Comments and Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh-3(c) as
proposed, with modifications.
Cleared Security-Based Swaps
In response to concerns raised by a commenter, 377 the Commission is modifying
the requirement in Rule 15Fh-3(c)(1) concerning delivery of the daily mark for cleared
security-based swaps. For cleared security-based swaps, the proposed rule would have
required the SBS Entity upon the request of the counterparty to provide the counterparty
with the end-of-day settlement price the SBS Entity received from the clearing agency.
As adopted, for cleared security-based swaps, Rule 15Fh-3(c)(1) requires an SBS Entity
upon the request of the counterparty to provide to the counterparty the daily mark that the
SBS Entity receives from the appropriate clearing agency.
In response to comments, the Commission is clarifying that to fulfill its obligation
to provide the daily mark upon request, the SBS Entity may agree with the clearing
agency, a clearing member or another agent, for such clearing agency, clearing member

118

or other agent to provide the daily mark directly to the counterparty. 378 The SBS Entity,
however, would retain the regulatory responsibility to provide the daily mark upon
request. We understand that current market practice is for a clearing agency to provide
access to end-of-day settlement prices to the counterparty. We believe that this flexibility
is appropriate, as we believe errors in transmission are less likely to occur if the
counterparty receives the information directly from the appropriate clearing agency,
which is the source of the daily mark for cleared security-based swaps. In addition, these
changes will align our rule more closely with the comparable CFTC rule, which allows
for the counterparty to receive the daily mark for a cleared swap from access to the
derivatives clearing organization or futures commodities merchant or from the Swap
Entity, which should result in efficiencies for SBS Entities that have already established
infrastructure to comply with the CFTC rule. 379 We note that an SBS Entity’s obligation
to provide the daily mark, if requested by the counterparty, exists for the life of the
security-based swap between the SBS Entity and the counterparty. Depending on the
form of clearing that is used to clear the security-based swap, the security-based swap
between the SBS Entity and the counterparty may be terminated upon clearing by the
clearing agency. 380
Rule 15Fh-3(c)(1), as adopted, also requires that the SBS Entity provide the daily
mark (as opposed to the end-of-day settlement price) upon request to the counterparty to
378

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5.

379

See 17 CFR 23.431(d); and CFTC Adopting Release, supra note 21.

380

If, for example, the security-based swap between the SBS Entity and counterparty
is terminated upon novation by the clearing agency, the SBS Entity would no
longer have any obligation to provide a daily mark to the original counterparty
because a security-based swap no longer exists between them.

119

allow clearing agencies the flexibility to provide a different calculation of the mark in the
future. As noted above, we understand that current market practice is for the clearing
agency to provide an end-of-day settlement price as its mark. In addition, this change
will conform our rule more closely to the parallel CFTC rule described above.
Uncleared Security-Based Swaps
The Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh-3(c)(2) as proposed. The Commission
agrees with commenters 381 that the daily mark for uncleared security-based swaps will
provide helpful transparency to counterparties during the lifecycle of a security-based
swap by providing a useful and meaningful reference point against which to assess,
among other things, the calculation of variation margin for a security-based swap or
portfolio of security-based swaps, and otherwise inform the counterparty’s understanding
of its financial relationship with the SBS Entity. 382 We continue to believe that even if
the mark is calculated based on internal models or such indices, its provision by the SBS
Entity will further the goal of providing helpful transparency into the SBS Entity’s
pricing and valuation of the security-based swap by providing a helpful reference point
that the SBS Entity’s counterparty can take into account when evaluating the pricing and
valuation of the SBS. Thus, we disagree with the commenter 383 who believes that
providing the daily mark will not enhance transparency.
As noted in the Proposing Release, though the daily mark may be used as an input
to compute the variation margin between an SBS Entity and its counterparty, it is not
381

(August 2015), supra note 5.

382

120

necessarily the sole determinant of how such margin is computed. Differences between
the daily mark and computations for variation margin may result from adjustments for
position size, position direction, credit reserve, hedging, funding, liquidity, counterparty
credit quality, portfolio concentration, bid-ask spreads, or other costs. Moreover, we
understand that the actual computations may be highly negotiated between the parties.
Therefore, we decline to implement the commenter’s suggestion that the basis for
margining uncleared security-based swaps would satisfy the daily mark disclosure
obligations.
For uncleared security-based swaps, Rule 15Fh-3(c)(2) as adopted defines the
daily mark as the midpoint between the bid and offer prices for a particular uncleared
security-based swap, or the calculated equivalent thereof, as of the close of business
unless the parties otherwise agree in writing to a different time. 384 The Commission
continues to believe that, absent specific agreement by the parties otherwise, the rule will
result in a daily mark that reflects daily changes in valuation and that is: (a) the same for
all counterparties of the SBS Entity that have a position in the uncleared security-based
swap, (b) not adjusted to account for holding-specific attributes such as position
direction, size, or liquidity, and (c) not adjusted to account for counterparty-specific
attributes such as credit quality, other counterparty portfolio holdings, or concentration of
positions. 385
384

As noted in the Proposing Release, parties could agree that the daily mark would
be computed as of a time other than the close of business but could not agree to
waive the requirement that the daily mark be provided on a daily basis, as
required by the statute. See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42411 n.103, supra note
3.

385

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42411, supra note 3.

121

As noted in the Proposing Release, for actively traded security-based swaps that
have sufficient liquidity, computing a daily mark as the midpoint between the bid and
offer prices for a particular security-based swap, known as a “midmarket value,” would
be consistent with Rule 15Fh-3(c)(2). 386 For security-based swaps that are not actively
traded, or do not have up-to-date bid and offer quotes, the SBS Entity may calculate an
equivalent to a midmarket value using mathematical models, quotes and prices of other
comparable securities, security-based swaps, or derivatives, or any combination thereof.
In this regard, the rule as adopted requires that the SBS Entity disclose its data sources
and a description of the methodology and assumptions used to prepare the daily mark,
and promptly disclose any material changes to such data sources, methodology and
assumptions during the term of the security-based swap. One commenter suggested that
the disclosures should include how the daily mark is calculated, including whether the
daily mark is calculated based on inputs related to actual trade activity or using
mathematical models, quotes and prices of other comparable securities, and whether
those inputs came from third-party valuation service providers. 387 We believe that the
requirement in the rule to disclose data sources, methodologies and assumptions
encompasses this commenter’s suggestion. On the other hand, another commenter has
expressed concern that disclosure of data sources, methodology and assumptions would
require the SBS Entity to disclose confidential, proprietary information about its

Counterparty Risk Management Practices, Counterparty Risk Management Policy

models. 388 We believe achieving the benefits underlying the statutory daily mark
requirement require that each counterparty knows the data sources, methodology and
assumptions used to calculate the mark. This information is critical for a counterparty to
properly understand how the daily mark was calculated. The Commission believes that
such disclosures will provide the counterparty useful context with which it can assess the
quality of the mark received. 389 The Commission further agrees with the commenter
that these disclosures would promote objectivity and transparency. 390 This commenter
also suggested that this description of data sources, methodologies and assumptions
should be required to constitute a complete and independently verifiable methodology for
valuing each security. 391 To satisfy the duty to disclose the data sources, methodology
and assumptions used to prepare the daily mark, SBS Entities may choose to provide to
counterparties methodologies and assumptions sufficient to independently validate the
output from a model generating the daily mark. The Commission does not foresee that
these disclosures would require SBS Entities to disclose confidential, proprietary
388

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5.

389

The Commission recognizes that different SBS Entities may produce somewhat
different marks for similar security-based swaps, depending on the respective data
sources, methodologies and assumptions used to calculate the marks. Thus, the
data sources, methodologies and assumptions would provide a context in which
the quality of the mark could be evaluated. See Disclosure of Accounting Policies
for Derivative Financial Instruments and Derivative Commodity Instruments and
Disclosure of Quantitative and Qualitative Information about Market Risk
Inherent in Derivative Financial Instruments, Other Financial Instruments and
Derivative Commodity Instruments, Securities Act Release No. 7386 (Jan. 31,
1997), 62 FR 6044 (Feb. 10, 1997). The Commission understands that industry
practice is often to include similar disclosures for margin calls in swap
documentation, such as a credit support annex. See Proposing Release, 76 FR at
42411 n.109, supra note 3.

390

See Barnard, supra note 5.

123

information about any model it may use to prepare the daily mark. 392 With these
disclosures, counterparties should not be misled or unduly rely on the daily mark
provided by the SBS Entities. Therefore, the Commission’s final rule requires disclosure
of the data sources, methodology and assumptions underlying the daily mark for
uncleared security-based swaps.
A commenter suggested that the daily mark disclosures would assist in resolving
valuation disputes during the term of the security-based swap. 393 Another commenter
suggested requiring SBS Entities and their counterparties to have a clearly defined
process for resolving any potential valuation disputes about daily marks for both cleared
and uncleared security-based swaps. 394 The Commission notes that many market
participants separately negotiate a dispute resolution mechanism for disagreements
regarding valuations or include standardized language regarding dispute resolution in
their agreements. At this time, the Commission declines to require parties to have a
process for resolving valuation disputes and leaves the parties the flexibility to include
such dispute resolution mechanisms in their negotiations if desired.

392

We also note that methodologies and assumptions with respect to various models
are disclosed in the context of financial statement reporting in footnotes to
publicly available financial statements and Management’s Discussion and
Analysis in periodic reports under the Exchange Act without disclosing
confidential proprietary information about models. See FASB Accounting
Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures; 17
CFR 229.303; and 17 CFR 229.305.

124

Two commenters suggested that Major SBS Participants should not be required to
provide the daily mark for uncleared security-based swaps. 395 We believe that the
benefits of Rule 15Fh-3(c), as discussed above, would inure equally to counterparties that
transact with SBS Dealers as well as those that transact with Major SBS Participants. As
we have noted above, even with the use of proprietary models to calculate the daily mark,
we do not believe that the level of detail required to be disclosed would require an SBS
Entity to disclose confidential proprietary information, whether the SBS Entity is an SBS
Dealer or a Major SBS Participant. The commenter that expressed concerns regarding
the reliability of the daily mark illustrates the necessity of the disclosure of the data
sources, methodologies and assumptions underlying the calculation. Counterparties may
evaluate the calculation and reliability of the daily mark calculation and determine for
themselves whether or not to rely on the calculation. Furthermore, we do not find the
arms-length nature of relationships with counterparties to be a persuasive argument to
eliminate the daily mark requirement. To the extent that Major SBS Participants may be
better informed about the valuations of security-based swaps due to significant
information asymmetries in a market for opaque and complex products, disclosures may
395

See MFA, supra note 5 (suggesting that Major SBS Participants will have to use
proprietary models, which will force the Major SBS Participants to reveal
proprietary information about their trading book positions and that such
calculations would be sufficient to calculate a fund’s total asset value but should
not be relied upon by other market participants) and BlackRock, supra note 5
(arguing that the security-based swaps are arms-length transactions so the Major
SBS Participant should not be required to develop systems to deliver the daily
mark information, particularly since most transactions will be with an SBS
Dealer). As an alternative to eliminating the daily mark requirement for Major
SBS Participants, these commenters suggest that sophisticated counterparties
should be permitted to opt out of receiving the daily mark. See discussion above
regarding the Commission’s reasons for not permitting counterparties to opt out
of receiving the daily mark disclosure.

125

help inform counterparties concerning the valuations and material risks and
characteristics of security-based swaps in the sometimes rapidly changing market
environment. 396 The commenter also states that the vast majority of transactions by a
Major SBS Participant would be with an SBS Dealer, in which circumstance, the
disclosure is not required. As a result, we are not adopting the commenters’ suggestions
to exclude Major SBS Participants from the requirement of providing the daily mark
disclosure at this time.
The Commission has considered the rationale raised by commenters and decided
not to allow counterparties, even “sophisticated counterparties,” to opt-out of the
protections afforded by the daily mark disclosures. It is our understanding that
counterparties have a range of sophistication and some are unlikely to have their own
modeling capabilities or access to relevant data to calculate a daily mark themselves. We
think it is appropriate to apply the rule so that counterparties receive the benefits of the
daily mark and related disclosures, and do not think it appropriate to permit parties to
“opt out” of the benefits of those provisions.
A commenter suggested modifying the rule text for uncleared security-based
swaps to require that the SBS Entity disclose additional information concerning the daily
mark to ensure a fair and balanced communication, including, as appropriate, that: (A)
the daily mark may not necessarily be a price at which either the counterparty or the SBS
Entity would agree to replace or terminate the security-based swap; (B) depending upon
the agreement of the parties, calls for margin may be based on considerations other than
the daily mark provided to the counterparty; and (C) the daily mark may not necessarily
396

See Section II.C., supra.

126

be the value of the security-based swap that is marked on the books of the SBS Entity. 397
While the Commission declines to modify the rule text in this way, it does note that Rule
15Fh-3(g) as adopted requires an SBS Entity to communicate with its counterparty in a
fair and balanced manner. 398 As a result, an SBS Entity may generally wish to consider
disclosing this information.
Against this background, the Commission is not prescribing the means by which
an SBS Entity determines the daily mark for an uncleared security-based swap.
Commenters have made various suggestions as to additional requirements as to the inputs
used for the daily mark calculation, such as requiring independent third-party quotes or
limiting the context in which an SBS Entity can use its own bid and offer prices or
requiring the daily mark to be an actionable quote. 399 At this time, the Commission
declines to adopt these additional requirements. We believe that the rule as adopted will
provide appropriate flexibility for SBS Entities to determine how to calculate the daily
mark while providing disclosure of sufficient information – data sources, methodologies
and assumptions, which are designed to allow the counterparty to assess the quality of the
marks it receives from the SBS Entity. One of these commenters also suggested that
using its own bid and offer prices for the calculation of the daily mark may present a
conflict of interest for the SBS Entity. 400 If the SBS Entity is presented with a conflict of
interest, we believe that the SBS Entity likely would disclose the conflict to the
397

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5 (requesting that the Commission insert
additional required disclosures into Rule 15h-3(c) to ensure a fair and balanced
communication).

counterparty pursuant to Rule 15Fh-3(b)(2) if the conflict is material. After receiving
such disclosures, the counterparty will be able to factor that information into its
assessment of the quality of the marks it receives. Consistent with the considerations
outlined above, an SBS Entity may choose to do these calculations in-house or to use
independent third-party valuation services, as suggested by a commenter. 401
As noted above, Rule 15Fh-3(c)(2) requires an SBS Entity to disclose to the
counterparty its data sources and a description of the methodology and assumptions used
to prepare the daily mark for an uncleared security-based swap. Additionally, Rule
15Fh-3(c)(2) requires an SBS Entity to promptly disclose any material changes to the
data sources, methodology, or assumptions during the term of the security-based swap.
As noted in the Proposing Release, an SBS Entity is not required to disclose the data
sources or a description of the methodology and assumptions more than once unless it
materially changes the data sources, methodology or assumptions used to calculate the
daily mark. 402 For the purposes of this rule, a material change would generally include
any change that has a material impact on the daily mark provided, such as if the data
sources become unreliable or unavailable, as requested by one commenter. 403
A commenter has requested that we eliminate the requirement to disclose data
sources to harmonize more closely with the CFTC. 404 We believe that the requirement to
disclose data sources is important for the counterparty to understand and assess the mark
being provided. Therefore, we decline to eliminate this requirement.

Applicable to Both Cleared and Uncleared
Security-Based Swaps
Rule 15Fh-3(c) as adopted, does not mandate the means by which an SBS Entity
must make the required disclosures and the Commission declines to mandate any
particular means at this time. The Commission believes that SBS Entities are best
positioned to determine the most appropriate means of communication of the disclosures.
Commenters have made several specific suggestions for additional requirements
regarding the means of communication of the daily mark. 405 One commenter suggested
that we require the use of a secure website or electronic platform. 406 Another commenter
requested web-based systems to be the preferred method of communication, but noted
that since some market participants prefer more traditional methods of communication,
web-based systems should not be required. 407 The commenter recommended requiring
SBS Entities to have policies and procedures in place that reasonably ensure that any
non-electronic means of communication is safe and secure and is otherwise comparable

Suggestions include: requiring interfaces that allow the counterparty to initiate,

unintentional or fraudulent addition, modification or deletion of a valuation record. 409
The Commission continues to believe that such a method of communication would be an
appropriate way for SBS Entities to discharge their obligations with respect to daily
marks. 410
One commenter suggested that we require an SBS Entity to have policies and
procedures to reasonably ensure the safety and security of non-electronic means of
communication. 411 To provide SBS Entities with flexibility in the manner of disclosure,
we have not specified requirements with respect to the safety and security of either
electronic or non-electronic communication of the daily mark. 412
In the Proposing Release, the Commission stated that the daily mark for both
cleared and uncleared security-based swaps should be provided without charge and with
no restrictions on internal use by the counterparty, although restrictions on dissemination
to third parties are permissible. 413 One commenter supported the requirement that the

See the discussion of Timing and Manner of Certain Disclosures above in Section

and Rule 15Fh-3(h). In addition, as a practical matter, we believe SBS Entities
are likely to have such policies and procedures with respect to both electronic and
non-electronic means of communication in the course of prudent business
practices.

daily mark disclosure be provided free of charge. 414 The daily mark disclosures are
relevant to a counterparty’s ongoing understanding and management of its security-based
swap positions. We believe that counterparties to whom the SBS Entity provides the
daily mark should have the opportunity to effectively use, retain, and analyze the
information with respect to such management. Therefore, the Commission continues to
believe that effective access to the daily mark information is necessary to ensure a
counterparty’s ability to manage its security-based swap positions over the life of the
security-based swaps. Charging for provision of the daily mark, or allowing restrictions
on the internal use of the daily mark by the counterparty with respect to managing their
security-based swap positions, could undermine this objective. Thus, the Commission
continues to believe that the daily mark for both cleared and uncleared security-based
swaps should be provided without charge and with no restrictions on internal use by the
counterparty, although restrictions on dissemination to third parties are permissible. 415
Accordingly, the Commission has included these requirements in a new paragraph (3) to
Rule 15Fh-3(c), as adopted.

Clearing Rights

Section 15F(h)(1)(D) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to
prescribe business conduct standards that relate to “such other matters as the Commission
determines to be appropriate.” 416 When an SBS Entity enters into a security-based swap

414

See IDC, supra note 5.

415

For these purposes, providing the daily mark to a third party that is the agent of
the counterparty, such as the independent representative of a special entity, for use
consistent with its duties to the client, generally should be considered internal use.

with a counterparty that is not an SBS Entity or a Swap Entity, Section 3C(g) of the
Exchange Act establishes a right for the counterparty: (i) to select the clearing agency at
which the security-based swap will be cleared, if the security-based swap is subject to the
mandatory clearing requirement under Section 3C(a); 417 and (ii) to elect to require the
clearing of the security-based swap, and to select the clearing agency at which the
security-based swap will be cleared, if the security-based swap is not subject to the
mandatory clearing requirement. 418
i.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(d) would require an SBS Entity, before entering into a
security-based swap with a counterparty, other than an SBS Entity or Swap Entity, to
disclose to the counterparty its rights under Section 3C(g) of the Exchange Act
concerning submission of a security-based swap to a clearing agency for clearing. The
counterparty’s rights, and thus the proposed disclosure obligations, would differ
depending on whether the clearing requirement of Section 3C(a) applies to the relevant
417

See Exchange Act 3C(g)(5)(A), 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(g)(5)(A):
With respect to any security-based swap that is subject to the mandatory clearing
requirement under subsection (a) and entered into by a security-based swap dealer
or a major security-based swap participant with a counterparty that is not a swap
dealer, major swap participant, security-based swap dealer, or major securitybased swap participant, the counterparty shall have the sole right to select the
clearing agency at which the security-based swap will be cleared.

418

See Exchange Act Section 3C(g)(5)(B), 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(g)(5)(B):
With respect to any security-based swap that is not subject to the
mandatory clearing requirement under subsection (a) and entered into by a
security-based swap dealer or a major security-based swap participant
with a counterparty that is not a swap dealer, major swap participant,
security-based swap dealer, or major security-based swap participant, the
counterparty -- (i) may elect to require clearing of the security-based
swap; and (ii) shall have the sole right to select the clearing agency at
which the security-based swap will be cleared.

132

transaction. 419
When the clearing requirements of Section 3C(a) apply to a security-based swap,
proposed Rule 15Fh-3(d)(1)(i) would require the SBS Entity to disclose to the
counterparty the clearing agencies that accept the security-based swap for clearing and
through which of those clearing agencies the SBS Entity is authorized or permitted,
directly or through a designated clearing member, to clear the security-based swap.
Under proposed Rule 15Fh-3(d)(1)(ii), the SBS Entity would also be required to notify
the counterparty of the counterparty’s sole right to select which clearing agency is to be
used to clear the security-based swap, provided it is a clearing agency at which the SBS
Entity is authorized or permitted, directly or through a designated clearing member, to
clear the security-based swap.
For security-based swaps that are not subject to the clearing requirement under
Exchange Act Section 3C(a), proposed Rule 15Fh-3(d)(2) would require the SBS Entity
to determine whether the security-based swap is accepted for clearing by one or more
clearing agencies and, if so, to disclose to the counterparty the counterparty’s right to
elect clearing of the security-based swap. Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(d)(2)(ii) would require
the SBS Entity to disclose to the counterparty the clearing agencies that accept the
security-based swap for clearing and whether the SBS Entity is authorized or permitted,
directly or through a designated clearing member, to clear the security-based swap
through such clearing agencies. Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(d)(2)(iii) would require the SBS
419

Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act provides that: “[i]t shall be unlawful for
any person to engage in a security-based swap unless that person submits such
security-based swap for clearing to a clearing agency that is registered under this
Act or a clearing agency that is exempt from registration under this Act if the
security-based swap is required to be cleared.” 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(a)(1).

133

Entity to notify the counterparty of the counterparty’s sole right to select the clearing
agency at which the security-based swap would be cleared, provided it is a clearing
agency at which the SBS Entity is authorized or permitted, directly or through a
designated clearing member, to clear the security-based swap.
ii.

Comments on Proposed Rule

Four commenters addressed the required disclosure regarding clearing rights. 420
One commenter requested confirmation that a counterparty’s clearing elections could
affect the price of the security-based swap so long as this is disclosed to the counterparty
at the time of the other disclosures regarding clearing. 421 Additionally, the commenter
asked for clarification that standardized disclosure could be used to satisfy this
requirement. 422 Another commenter recommended that the Commission not impose the
clearing rights disclosure requirement on Major SBS Participants transacting with
counterparties at arm’s length, or alternatively, that the Commission allow ECP
counterparties to opt out of receiving such disclosures. 423
An additional commenter advocated for harmonizing the clearing rights
disclosure requirement with the CFTC’s parallel requirement. 424 Specifically, the
commenter recommended eliminating the proposed requirements to disclose the names of
the clearing agencies that accept the security-based swap for clearing, and through which

the SBS Entity is authorized to clear the security-based swap. 425 The commenter argued
that given the limited number of security-based swap clearing agencies, such additional
disclosure is unlikely to be necessary, and that the Commission could always require it at
a future date if the number increases. 426 Additionally, as discussed in Section II.B, the
commenter advocated for adding an exception to the requirements regarding the
disclosure of clearing rights to include security-based swaps that are intended to be
cleared and that are either (1) executed on a registered national securities exchange or
registered or exempt SEF and required to be cleared pursuant to Section 3C of the
Exchange Act, or (2) anonymous. 427
iii.

Response to Comments and Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh-3(d)
largely as proposed, but with modifications. First, as discussed above in Section II.B, we
are limiting an SBS Entity’s disclosure obligations regarding clearing rights pursuant to
Rule 15Fh-3(d) to counterparties whose identity is known to the SBS Entity at a
reasonably sufficient time prior to the execution of the transaction.
The Commission is also making a second modification to the proposed rule. We
also added the phrase “subject to Section 3C(g)(5) of the Act,” to Rule 15Fh-3(d)(1)(ii) to
clarify the source of the counterparty’s right to select which of the clearing agencies
described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) shall be used to clear the security-based swap.

A commenter suggested that, due to the limited number of security-based swap
clearing agencies, disclosure of clearing agencies by name was unnecessary. 428
Regardless of the current limited number of clearing agencies for security-based swaps,
not every security-based swap will be accepted for clearing at every clearing agency, so
the Commission believes that it is still useful for the counterparty to know whether the
particular security-based swap is able to be cleared at a particular clearing agency.
Rule 15Fh-3(d) requires that disclosure be made before a transaction occurs. As
noted in the Proposing Release, the Commission believes that it would be appropriate for
a counterparty to exercise its statutory right to select the clearing agency at which its
security-based swaps will be cleared on a transaction-by-transaction basis, on an assetclass-by-asset-class basis, or in terms of all potential transactions the counterparty may
execute with the SBS Entity. 429 While Rule 15Fh-3(d) does not require an SBS Entity to
become a member or participant of a specific clearing agency, an SBS Entity could not
enter into security-based swaps that are subject to a mandatory clearing requirement
without having some arrangement in place to clear the transaction. 430
Consistent with the discussion regarding manner of disclosures above in Section
II.G.2.b, the Commission agrees with the commenter that SBS Entities could use
standardized disclosure to satisfy Rule 15Fh-3(d).
The Commission also recognizes that a counterparty’s clearing elections could
affect the price of the security-based swap and recognizes that counterparties may wish to

430

136

receive disclosures about the effect of clearing on the price. Although the rule does not
explicitly require that the SBS Entity provide specific disclosures regarding the effect of
clearing on the price of the security-based swap, the SBS Entity may wish to consider
whether their obligations under Rule 15Fh-3(b)(1) to disclose the material risks and
characteristics of the particular security-based swap, as well as their obligation pursuant
to Rule 15Fh-3(g) to communicate with counterparties in a fair and balanced manner
based on principles of fair dealing and good faith (including providing a sound basis for
evaluating the facts with regard to any particular security-based swap or trading strategy
involving a security-based swap) may require such disclosure given their particular facts
and circumstances.
One commenter recommended that the Commission not impose the clearing rights
disclosure requirement on Major SBS Participants transacting with counterparties at
arm’s length or as an alternative allow ECP counterparties to opt out of receiving the
clearing rights disclosure. 431 As explained in the Proposing Release, the required
disclosure is intended to promote that, wherever possible and appropriate, derivatives
contracts formerly traded exclusively in the OTC market are cleared through a regulated
clearing agency. 432 The Commission has considered the concerns raised by commenters
and determined that it is appropriate to require Major SBS Participants to provide such
disclosures, and to not to permit counterparties to opt out of the protections provided by
the business conduct rules. We believe that the benefits of Rule 15Fh-3(d), as discussed
above, would inure equally to counterparties that transact with SBS Dealers as well as
431

See MFA, supra note 5.

432

See MFA, supra note 5; Proposing Release 76 FR at 42413, supra note 3.

137

those that transact with Major SBS Participants. 433 We further believe that allowing
counterparties to effectively opt out of the rule would deprive them of the express
protections that the rules were intended to provide. As a result, we are not adopting the
commenters’ suggestions to allow counterparties to opt out of the clearing rights
disclosure requirement when transacting with a Major SBS Participant nor to exclude
Major SBS Participants from the requirement of providing the clearing rights disclosure
at this time.

Know Your Counterparty

prescribe business conduct standards that relate to “such other matters as the Commission
determines to be appropriate.” 434
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(e) would establish a “know your counterparty”
requirement under which an SBS Dealer would be required to establish, maintain and
enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to obtain and retain a record of the
essential facts that are necessary for conducting business with each counterparty that is
known to the SBS Dealer. For purposes of the proposed rule, “essential facts” would be
defined as: (i) facts required to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules; (ii)
facts required to implement the SBS Dealer’s credit and operational risk management
policies in connection with transactions entered into with such counterparty; (iii)
information regarding the authority of any person acting for such counterparty; and (iv) if

independent representative as the SBS Dealer reasonably deems appropriate. 435
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Four commenters addressed the proposed know your counterparty requirement. 436
Two commenters generally supported the proposed rule. 437 However, one requested
clarification that since the requirement only applies to “known” counterparties, it would
not apply to an SBS Dealer transacting on a SEF or other electronic execution platform
where such SBS Dealer only learns the identity of the counterparty immediately before
the execution and must execute the transaction within a limited time frame after learning
the counterparty’s identity. 438 The other commenter asserted that the requirement should
apply to Major SBS Participants in addition to SBS Dealers. 439
A third commenter expressed concern that the proposed rule would
inappropriately empower SBS Dealers to adopt and enforce rules and to collect
information about independent representatives. 440 The commenter asserted that the use
of the word “enforce” in the proposed rule suggests that the rule would improperly
empower SBS Dealers to adopt policies and procedures that have the force of law with
respect to their counterparties. 441 Specifically, the commenter asserted that the proposed

special entities, as well as proprietary information, which would give dealers an unfair
competitive advantage. 442 The commenter argued that SBS Dealers should be required to
adopt policies that comply with the law, and that these policies should not be binding to
the extent they require more than the law requires. 443
A fourth commenter recommended eliminating the proposed requirement to
collect background information regarding the independent representative of a special
entity. 444 First, the commenter asserted that this change would harmonize the
Commission’s rule with the parallel CFTC requirement. 445 Second, the commenter stated
that the proposed requirement would be duplicative of the requirements imposed on SBS
Entities acting as counterparties to special entities pursuant to Rule 15Fh-5. 446
Additionally, as discussed in Section II.B, the commenter advocated for adding an
exception to the know your counterparty requirement to cover security-based swaps that
are intended to be cleared, executed on a registered national securities exchange or
registered or exempt SEF, and of a type that is, as of the date of execution, required to be
cleared pursuant to Section 3C of the Exchange Act. 447

Response to Comments and Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh-3(e) with
two modifications. First, in response to a specific suggestion from a commenter, 448 the
Commission is eliminating the proposed requirement that an SBS Dealer obtain
background information regarding the independent representative of a special entity
counterparty, as the SBS Dealer reasonably deems appropriate. The Commission agrees
with the commenter that the proposed requirement would have been duplicative of the
requirements imposed on SBS Entities acting as counterparties to special entities
pursuant to Rule 15Fh-5 (discussed below in Section II.H).
Second, the Commission is adding the word “written” before policies and
procedures in the rule text to clarify that the policies and procedures required by the rule
must be written. The Commission believes that this change clarifies the proposal and
reflects the requirement in Rule 15Fh-3(h), discussed in Section II.G.6 below, that an
SBS Dealer establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures that are
reasonably designed to prevent violations of the applicable federal securities laws and
rules and regulations thereunder. Thus, as adopted, Rule 15Fh-3(e) requires SBS Dealers
to “establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to obtain and retain a record of the essential facts concerning each counterparty.”
In response to concerns raised by a commenter, 449 the Commission is clarifying
that the provision stating that an SBS Dealer shall “establish, maintain and enforce”
policies and procedures does not vest such policies and procedures with force of law with
448

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5.

449

See ABC, supra note 5.

141

respect to their counterparties. An SBS Dealer would, however, have an obligation to
enforce (i.e., follow) its internal policies and procedures.
We have determined, as proposed, not to apply the rule where an SBS Dealer does
not know the identity of its counterparty. We are not adopting the suggestion of one
commenter that we provide an additional exception to cover security-based swaps that are
intended to be cleared, executed on a registered national securities exchange or registered
or exempt SEF, and of a type that is, as of the date of execution, required to be cleared
pursuant to Section 3C of the Exchange Act, even if not anonymous. 450 However, we
note that Rule 15Fh-3(e) requires SBS Dealers to establish policies and procedures that
are “reasonably designed to obtain and retain a record of the essential facts concerning
each [known counterparty] that are necessary for conducting business with such
counterparty.” Reasonably designed policies and procedures established pursuant to Rule
15Fh-3(e) may address situations in which there are few, if any, essential facts that are
necessary for conducting business with a counterparty. For example, if the only securitybased swaps that an SBS Dealer enters into with a counterparty are intended to be cleared
security-based swaps that are executed on a registered exchange or SEF and of a type that
is, as of the date of execution, required to be cleared pursuant to Section 3C of the
Exchange Act, then there may be few, if any, essential facts that the SBS Dealer needs to
know about such counterparty in that circumstance.
In response to a commenter’s request for clarification that since the requirement
only applies to “known” counterparties, it would not apply to an SBS Dealer transacting
on a SEF or other electronic execution platform where such SBS Dealer only learns the
450

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5.

142

identity of the counterparty immediately before the execution and must execute the
transaction within a limited time frame after learning the counterparty’s identity, 451 the
Commission notes that Rule 15Fh-3(e) does not contain a specific timing requirement.
Rule 15Fh-3(e) requires SBS Dealers to establish policies and procedures that are
“reasonably designed to obtain and retain a record of the essential facts concerning each
[known counterparty] that are necessary for conducting business with such counterparty.”
To be “reasonably designed” such policies and procedures generally should provide for
the collection of counterparty information prior to execution of a transaction with that
counterparty. However, if the SBS Dealer does not learn a counterparty’s identity until
immediately prior to or subsequent to execution, then it would be reasonable for
collection to occur within a reasonable time after the SBS Dealer learns the identity of the
counterparty. 452
As noted in the Proposing Release, the “know your counterparty” obligations
under Rule 15Fh-3(e) are a modified version of the “know your customer” obligations
imposed on other market professionals, such as broker-dealers, when dealing with
customers. 453 Although the statute does not require the Commission to adopt a “know
451

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

452

The application of the know your counterparty requirement in these circumstances
does not affect the application of the other business conduct obligations in Rules
15Fh-3(b) and (d), 15Fh-4(b), 15Fh-5, and 15Fh-6, including the exceptions to the
application of those rules where the identity of the counterparty is not known to
the SBS Entity at a reasonably sufficient time prior to execution of the
transaction, and, in the case of Rules 15Fh-4(b), 15Fh-5 and 15Fh-6, executed on
a registered national securities exchange or registered or exempt SEF.

453

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42414, supra note 3. Cf. FINRA Rule 2090
(“[e]very member shall use reasonable diligence, in regard to the opening and
maintenance of every account, to know (and retain) the essential facts concerning
every customer and concerning the authority of each person acting on behalf of

143

your counterparty” standard, the Commission continues to believe that such a standard is
consistent with basic principles of legal and regulatory compliance, and operational and
credit risk management. 454 Further, the Commission continues to believe that entities
that currently operate as SBS Dealers typically would already have in place, as a matter
of their normal business practices, policies and procedures that could potentially satisfy
the requirements of the rule. 455
The Commission is applying the requirements in Rule 15Fh-3(e) to SBS Dealers
but declines to apply them to Major SBS Participants, as suggested by a commenter. 456
As discussed above in Section II.C, the Commission has determined that where a
business conduct requirement is not expressly addressed by the Dodd-Frank Act, the
rules generally will not apply to Major SBS Participants.

Recommendations by SBS Dealers

Section 15F(h)(1)(D) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to
prescribe business conduct standards that relate to “such other matters as the Commission
determines to be appropriate.” 457 Additionally, Section 15F(h)(3)(D) of the Exchange
authorizes the Commission to establish “such other standards and requirements as the
such customer”). Supplementary Material .01 to FINRA Rule 2090 defines the
“essential facts” for purposes of the FINRA rule to include certain information not
required by Rule 15Fh-3(e). For purposes of FINRA Rule 2090, facts “essential”
to “knowing the customer” are those required to (a) effectively service the
customer’s account, (b) act in accordance with any special handling instructions
for the account, (c) understand the authority of each person acting on behalf of the
customer, and (d) comply with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.

investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this Act.” 458
a.

Proposed Rule
i.

General

Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f) generally would require an SBS Dealer that
recommends a security-based swap or trading strategy involving a security-based swap to
a counterparty, other than an SBS Entity or Swap Entity, to have a reasonable basis for
believing that the recommended security-based swap or trading strategy is suitable.
Specifically, proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(i) would require an SBS Dealer to have a
reasonable basis to believe, based on reasonable diligence, that the recommended
security-based swap or trading strategy is suitable for at least some counterparties.
Additionally, proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(ii) would require an SBS Dealer to have a
reasonable basis to believe that the recommended security-based swap or trading strategy
is suitable for the particular counterparty that is the recipient of the SBS Dealer’s
recommendation (“customer-specific suitability”). Under proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(ii),
to establish a reasonable basis to believe that a recommendation is suitable for a
particular counterparty, an SBS Dealer would need to have or obtain relevant information
regarding the counterparty, including the counterparty’s investment profile, trading
objectives, and its ability to absorb potential losses associated with the recommended
security-based swap or trading strategy.
ii.

Institutional Suitability Alternative

Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2) would provide an alternative to the general suitability
458

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(3)(D).

145

requirements, under which an SBS Dealer could fulfill its suitability obligations with
respect to a particular counterparty if: (1) the SBS Dealer reasonably determines that the
counterparty (or its agent) is capable of independently evaluating investment risks with
regard to the relevant security-based swap or trading strategy involving a security-based
swap; (2) the counterparty (or its agent) affirmatively represents in writing that it is
exercising independent judgment in evaluating the recommendations by the SBS Dealer;
and (3) the SBS Dealer discloses that it is acting in the capacity of a counterparty, and is
not undertaking to assess the suitability of the security-based swap or trading strategy for
the counterparty.
The Commission sought comment on whether different categories of ECPs should
be treated differently for purposes of suitability determinations. 459 The Proposing
Release noted that, under our proposed rules, an SBS Dealer could rely on the
institutional suitability alternative when entering into security-based swaps with any
person that qualified as an ECP, a category that includes persons with $5 million or more
invested on a discretionary basis that enter into the security-based swap “to manage
risks.” 460 In contrast, under FINRA rules, in order to apply an analogous institutional
suitability alternative, a broker-dealer must be dealing with a person (whether a natural
person, corporation, partnership, trust, or otherwise) with total assets of at least $50
million. 461 The Proposing Release asked whether the Commission should apply a
different standard of suitability depending on whether the counterparty would be

protected as a retail investor under FINRA rules when the SBS Dealer is also a registered
broker-dealer. 462 More generally, the Commission sought comment on whether the
institutional suitability alternative available under proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2) should be
limited to counterparties that would not be protected as retail investors under FINRA
rules or another category of counterparties.
iii.

Special Entity Suitability Alternative

Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(3) would provide another alternative to the general
suitability requirements for SBS Dealers transacting with special entity counterparties.
Under proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(3), an SBS Dealer would be deemed to satisfy its
suitability obligations with respect to a special entity counterparty if the SBS Dealer
either is acting as an advisor to the special entity and complies with proposed Rule 15Fh4(b), 463 or is deemed not to be acting as an advisor to the special entity pursuant to
proposed Rule 15Fh-2(a).
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule
i.

462

General

Under FINRA rules, institutional suitability is limited to transactions with socalled “institutional” investors:
(1) a bank, savings and loan association, insurance company or registered
investment company;
(2) an investment adviser registered either with the SEC under Section 203 of the
Investment Advisers Act or with a state securities commission (or any agency or
office performing like functions); or
(3) any other person (whether a natural person, corporation, partnership, trust or
otherwise) with total assets of at least $50 million.
See FINRA Rule 4512(c) (regarding definition of “institutional account”).

463

As discussed below in Section II.H.2, proposed Rule 15Fh-4(b) would impose
certain requirements on SBS Dealers acting as advisors to special entities.

147

Six commenters addressed the suitability requirements. 464 Three commenters
recommended expanding the suitability requirements. 465 One commenter suggested two
changes to the rule: (1) clarifying that SBS Dealers would be prohibited from
recommending to investors financial products that the dealers believe will fail; and (2)
requiring that an SBS Dealer making recommendations regarding a certain product or
type of product have the background necessary to understand the product. 466 Another
commenter urged the Commission to consider developing suitability standards for the
types of financial products that can be sold to state and local governments, including
those products in the swaps arena. 467 A third commenter suggested that the Commission
conform its requirements to the CFTC’s proposal, noting that the CFTC proposal would
have required the dealer to obtain information through reasonable due diligence
concerning the counterparty’s financial situation and needs, objectives, tax status, ability
to evaluate the recommendation, liquidity needs, risk tolerance or other relevant
information. 468 The commenter also recommended explicitly requiring SBS Dealers to:
(1) gather information sufficient to make the suitability assessment; and (2) maintain
sufficient documents to allow the Commission to effectively enforce compliance. 469
Additionally, the commenter asserted that the suitability requirement should apply to all

SBS Entities, not just SBS Dealers, noting that the suitability obligation would only be
imposed on a Major SBS Participant if the Major SBS Participant makes a
recommendation to a non-SBS Entity. 470 While the commenter supported the exclusion
from the suitability requirement for recommendations to other SBS Entities, it strongly
opposed any additional exclusions (e.g., for recommendations to broker-dealers or other
market intermediaries who are not SBS Entities). Finally, the commenter also strongly
opposed limiting the requirement to recommendations to retail investors. 471
Two other commenters recommended narrowing the suitability requirements. 472
One commenter suggested that any suitability standard for SBS Dealers be applied at the
least granular level (e.g., on a transaction-by-transaction basis, on an asset-class-by-assetclass basis, or in terms of all potential transactions between the parties, as appropriate). 473
The second commenter opposed the suitability requirement more broadly, stating that
Congress did not impose such a requirement. 474 The commenter suggested, as an
alternative to the proposed rule, that any suitability requirement for recommendations to

Id. The commenter explained that, under the institutional suitability alternative,
“the SBS Dealer wouldn’t even have to have a reasonable basis to believe that the
swap was suitable . . . for the particular counterparty to the transaction.” The
commenter expressed its concern that:
Given the profits at stake, SBS Dealer will have strong incentives to
conclude that the counterparty is capable of evaluating the transaction.
Counterparties who turn to the derivatives markets out of questionable
motives will have equally strong incentives to assert their capacity to
independently evaluate investment risk. And even those with purer
motives may be reluctant to confess to a lack of expertise.

counterparties other than special entities be imposed through a requirement to adopt and
enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to assess the suitability of
recommendations, and that the proposed rule be incorporated as guidance establishing a
safe harbor for whether an SBS Dealer’s policies are reasonable. 475 The commenter also
asserted that the proposed rule could conflict with the specific suitability rules of other
(unidentified) regulators, and accordingly, urged the Commission to clarify that an SBS
Dealer that complies with suitability requirements of another qualifying regulator will
also be deemed to have adopted and enforced reasonable suitability policies under the
Commission’s rule. 476 Finally, the commenter recommended allowing sophisticated
counterparties to opt out of suitability protection, noting that some counterparties will
find the suitability analysis burdensome and intrusive, and that the costs of the proposed
suitability rule for those counterparties will likely outweigh any benefits. 477
Finally, a sixth commenter advocated for harmonizing the suitability requirement
in proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(i) with the CFTC’s parallel requirement. 478 Specifically,
the commenter recommended changing the wording of the suitability requirement in
proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(i) to “undertake reasonable diligence to understand the
potential risks and rewards associated with the recommended security-based swap or
trading strategy involving a security-based swap.” 479

Three commenters submitted comments regarding the institutional suitability
alternative in proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2). 480 Two commenters expressed concerns
regarding the proposed alternative. 481 One commenter expressed concern that the
counterparty representations upon which the SBS Dealer would rely may become
outdated or boilerplate language that is inappropriate for the counterparty to which it is
directed. 482 Accordingly, the commenter suggested requiring SBS Dealers to conduct
routine audits to ensure that these institutional level suitability determinations are not
over-utilized, that they are appropriate for the particular counterparties involved, and that
the appropriate written documentation was provided and signed in applicable
transactions. 483 Additionally, the commenter recommended that as part of that audit
process, and to prevent inaccurate determinations, SBS Dealers should be required to test,
perhaps on an annual basis, whether counterparties continue to have the personnel and
expertise needed to conduct independent evaluations of the security-based swap products
being marketed. 484
The second commenter strongly opposed the institutional suitability alternative,
asserting that the complexity and opacity of structured finance products has made them
impenetrable to all but the most sophisticated industry experts. 485 At a minimum, the
commenter recommended that if the Commission adopts the institutional suitability

alternative, it should require an SBS Dealer to have a reasonable basis to believe its
counterparty has the capacity to absorb potential losses related to the security-based swap
or trading strategy being recommended. 486
A third commenter advocated for harmonizing the institutional suitability
alternative with the CFTC’s parallel provision, citing potential counterparty confusion. 487
Specifically, the commenter recommended that the Commission: (1) clarify that the
institutional suitability alternative only satisfies an SBS Dealer’s customer-specific
suitability obligation in proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(ii), not its suitability obligation in
proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(i); and (2) add a safe harbor providing that an SBS Dealer
can satisfy its requirement to make a reasonable determination that the counterparty is
capable of independently evaluating investment risks with regard to the security-based
swap if the SBS Dealer receives written representations from the counterparty regarding
the counterparty’s compliance with appropriate policies and procedures. 488

a special entity would cause it to be acting as an advisor to the special entity. 491

Response to Comments and Final Rule
i.

General

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)
with two modifications. The first modification is to rephrase the suitability obligation in
proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(i), in response to a specific suggestion from a commenter, 492
to make it consistent with the CFTC’s parallel suitability requirement in Commodity
Exchange Act Rule 23.434(a)(1), which explicitly requires SBS Dealers to understand the
risk-reward tradeoff of their recommendations. We believe that our proposed
formulation and the CFTC’s formulation would have achieved the same purpose.
However, to alleviate concerns among commenters that compliance with the two rules
would require anything different, we are harmonizing the wording of our rule with the
CFTC’s parallel suitability obligation. 493 As adopted, Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(i) requires an
SBS Dealer that recommends a security-based swap or trading strategy involving a
security-based swap to a counterparty, other than an SBS Entity or Swap Entity, to
491

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5.

492

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5. The Commission believes this change
also responds to another commenter’s concern that the proposed rules could
conflict with the CFTC’s suitability rule. See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

493

See CFTC Adopting Release, 77 FR at 9771-9774, supra note 21. The new
formulation is also consistent with FINRA’s approach to this aspect of suitability.
See Supplementary Material .05(a) to FINRA Rule 2111 (effective July 9,
2012)(“[a] member’s or associated person’s reasonable diligence must provide the
member or associated person with an understanding of the potential risks and
rewards associated with the recommended security or strategy”).

153

“undertake reasonable diligence to understand the potential risks and rewards associated
with the recommended security-based swap or trading strategy involving a security-based
swap.” Consistency with the CFTC standard will result in efficiencies for entities that
have already established infrastructure to comply with the CFTC standard. Consistent
wording will also allow SBS Entities to more easily analyze compliance with the
Commission’s rule against their existing activities to comply with the CFTC’s parallel
suitability rule for Swap Entities.
The second modification the Commission is making is to add the phrase
“involving a security-based swap” to the final line of the customer-specific suitability
obligation in proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(ii) to modify “trading strategy.” Accordingly,
Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(ii), as adopted, requires an SBS Dealer that recommends a securitybased swap or trading strategy involving a security-based swap to a counterparty, other
than an SBS Entity or Swap Entity, to have a reasonable basis to believe that a
recommended security-based swap or trading strategy involving a security-based swap is
suitable for the counterparty, and to establish a reasonable basis for a recommendation, to
have or obtain relevant information regarding the counterparty, including the
counterparty’s investment profile, trading objectives, and its ability to absorb potential
losses associated with the recommended security-based swap or trading strategy
“involving a security-based swap.” The Commission does not believe that this is a
substantive change. It simply clarifies that the term trading strategy as used in the final
line of the rule is the same as recommended trading strategy involving a security-based
swap that is referenced earlier in the rule.

154

As noted in the Proposing Release, although suitability is not expressly addressed
in Section 15F(h) of the Exchange Act, the obligation to make only suitable
recommendations is a core business conduct requirement for broker-dealers and other
financial intermediaries. 494 Municipal securities dealers also have a suitability obligation
when recommending municipal securities transactions to a customer. 495 Depending on
the scope of its activities, an SBS Dealer may be subject to one of these other suitability
obligations, in addition to those under Rule 15Fh-3(f). In particular, an SBS Dealer that
also is a registered broker-dealer and a FINRA member, would be subject to FINRA’s
suitability requirements in connection with the recommendation of a security-based swap
or trading strategy involving a security-based swap. 496 Rule 15Fh-3(f) is intended to

494

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42415, supra note 3. See also, e.g., FINRA
Rules 2090 and 2111 (effective Jul. 9, 2012); Charles Hughes & Co. v. SEC, 139
F.2d 434 (2d Cir. 1943) (enforcing suitability obligations under the antifraud
provisions of the Exchange Act).

495

MSRB Rule G-19(c) provides that:
In recommending to a customer any municipal security transaction,
a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer shall have
reasonable grounds: (i) based upon information available from the
issuer of the security or otherwise, and (ii) based upon the facts
disclosed by such customer or otherwise known about such
customer, for believing that the recommendation is suitable.

496

See FINRA Rule 2111. Under FINRA rules, unless a customer is an “institutional
account” that meets the requirements of the institutional account exemption, he or
she would be entitled to the protections provided by retail suitability obligations
in the broker-dealer context. An “institutional account” means the account of a
bank, savings and loan association, insurance company, registered investment
company, registered investment adviser or any other person (whether a natural
person, corporation, partnership, trust, or otherwise) with total assets of at least
$50 million. See FINRA Rule 2111(b) (referring to FINRA Rule 4512(c)).

155

ensure that all SBS Dealers that make recommendations are subject to this obligation,
tailored as appropriate in light of the nature of the security-based swap markets. 497
The Commission continues to believe that the determination of whether an SBS
Dealer has made a recommendation that triggers suitability obligations should turn on the
facts and circumstances of the particular situation and, therefore, whether a
recommendation has taken place is not susceptible to a bright line definition. 498 This
follows the FINRA approach to what constitutes a recommendation for purposes of
FINRA’s suitability rule. 499 In the context of the FINRA suitability rule, factors
considered in determining whether a recommendation has taken place include whether
the communication “reasonably could be viewed as a ‘call to action’” and “reasonably
would influence an investor to trade a particular security or group of securities.” 500 We
note that this could include a call to action regarding buying, selling, materially amending
or early termination of a security-based swap. The more individually tailored the

497

Some dealers have indicated that they already apply “institutional suitability”
principles to their swap business. See, e.g., Letter from Richard Ostrander,
Managing Director and Counsel, Morgan Stanley, to Elizabeth M. Murphy,
Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, and David A. Stawick,
Secretary, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Dec. 3, 2010) at 5; Report

communication to a specific customer or a targeted group of customers about a security
or group of securities, the greater the likelihood that the communication may be viewed
as a “recommendation.” The Commission continues to believe that this approach to
determining whether a recommendation has taken place should apply in the context of
Rule 15Fh-3(f) as well. 501
As noted in the Proposing Release, an SBS Dealer typically would not be deemed
to be making a recommendation solely by reason of providing general financial or market
information, or transaction terms in response to a request for competitive bids. 502 Again,
this follows the FINRA approach to determining whether a recommendation has
occurred. 503 Furthermore, compliance with the requirements of the other business
conduct rules, in particular, Rules 15Fh-3(a) (verification of counterparty status), 15Fh3(b) (disclosures of material risks and characteristics, and material incentives or conflicts
of interest), 15Fh-3(c) (disclosures of daily mark), and 15Fh-3(d) (disclosures regarding
clearing rights) would not, in and of itself, result in an SBS Dealer being deemed to be
making a “recommendation.” 504
We believe that the suitability obligation in Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(i) should address
one commenter’s concerns about the possibility that an SBS Dealer will recommend a

501

503

See Supplementary Material .03 to FINRA Rule 2090.

504

Additionally, as discussed in Section I.E, supra, the duties imposed on an SBS
Dealer under the business conduct rules are specific to this context, and are in
addition to any duties that may be imposed under other applicable law. Thus, an
SBS Dealer must separately determine whether it is subject to regulation as a
broker-dealer, an investment adviser, a municipal advisor or other regulated
entity.

157

financial product that it believes will fail or that it does not have the necessary
background to understand. 505 When making recommendations, SBS Dealers are always
required to meet their suitability obligation in Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(i), regardless of whether
they avail themselves of the institutional suitability alternative to meet their customerspecific suitability obligations. In that respect, SBS Dealers will always be required to
undertake reasonable diligence to understand the risks and rewards behind any
recommended security-based swap.
With respect to another commenter’s concerns about SBS Dealers’ gathering
sufficient information to make the customer-specific suitability assessment, 506 the
Commission notes that Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(ii) requires an SBS Dealer to “have a
reasonable basis to believe” that a recommended security-based swap or trading strategy
is suitable for the counterparty. To establish that reasonable basis, the rule requires the
SBS Dealer to “have or obtain relevant information regarding the counterparty, including
the counterparty’s investment profile, trading objectives, and its ability to absorb
potential losses associated with the recommended security-based swap or trading
strategy.” The list of “relevant information” in the rule is exemplary, not exhaustive.
Whether an SBS Dealer has a reasonable basis to believe that a recommended securitybased swap or trading strategy is suitable for the counterparty is a determination that
depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular situation.
505

See Levin, supra note 5.

506

See CFA, supra note 5. In response to the commenter’s other concern regarding
the Commission requiring SBS Dealers to maintain sufficient documentation to
effectively enforce compliance with the suitability rule, we note that the
Commission has separately proposed recordkeeping requirements for SBS
Dealers. See Recordkeeping Release, 79 FR at 25135, supra note 242.

158

The Commission declines to apply Rule 15Fh-3(f) to Major SBS Participants, as
suggested by one commenter. 507 As discussed above in Section II.C, where a business
conduct requirement is not expressly addressed by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission
is generally not applying such a rule to Major SBS Participants. The Commission
continues to believe that it is appropriate not to impose suitability obligations on Major
SBS Participants, given that, by definition, Major SBS Participants are not engaged in
security-based swap dealing activity at levels above the de minimis threshold. 508
However, if a Major SBS Participant is, in fact, recommending security-based swaps or
trading strategies involving security-based swaps to a counterparty, this would indicate
that the Major SBS Participant is actually engaged in security-based swap dealing
activity. 509 If a Major SBS Participant engages in such activity above the de minimis
threshold in Exchange Act Rule 3a71-2, it would need to register as an SBS Dealer and,
as such, would need to comply with the suitability obligations imposed by Rule 15Fh3(f).
Further, Rule 15Fh-3(f) will not impose suitability obligations on an SBS Dealer
transacting with an SBS Entity or Swap Entity. The Commission continues to believe
that these types of counterparties, which are professional intermediaries or major
participants in the swaps or security-based swaps markets, would not need the protections
507

509

See CFA, supra note 5.
See Exchange Act Rule 3a61-1(a)(1) (limiting the definition of “major securitybased swap participant” to persons that are not security-based swap dealers).

Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30618, supra note 115 (“Advising a counterparty as
to how to use security-based swaps to meet the counterparty’s hedging goals, or
structuring security-based swaps on behalf of a counterparty, also would indicate
security-based swap dealing activity.”).

159

that would be afforded by this rule. However, taking into account the concerns of one
commenter, 510 the Commission is not adopting any additional exclusions to the rule at
this time, nor is the Commission applying the suitability obligations at the least granular
level (e.g., on a transaction-by-transaction basis, on an asset-class-by-asset-class basis, or
in terms of all potential transactions between the parties), as suggested by another
commenter. 511 The Commission is also not, as suggested by one commenter, 512
providing an opt out from the rule or a policies and procedures alternative. As discussed
above in Sections II.A.3.d and II.E, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to
apply the suitability rule so that counterparties receive the benefits of the protections
provided by the rule; permitting parties to “opt out” of the benefits of the rule or
providing a policies and procedures alternative would undermine its core purpose of
protecting counterparties. However, while we are not adopting an opt out provision or a
policies and procedures alternative, the Commission has determined to permit means of
compliance with Rule 15Fh-3(f) that should promote efficiency and reduce costs (e.g.,
reliance on representations pursuant to Rule 15Fh-1(b)) and allowing SBS Dealers to take
into account the sophistication of the counterparty by way of the institutional suitability
alternative in Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2) (described below).
The Commission is not adopting one commenter’s suggestion to impose
additional standards for the types of financial products that can be sold to state and local

160

governments, including security-based swaps. 513 We have determined that additional
standards are not needed and that the rules we are adopting appropriately regulate the
business conduct of the professional market intermediaries selling these products. We
also note that the MSRB is developing a regulatory framework for municipal advisors,
including detailed standards of conduct that municipal advisors owe to municipal
entities. 514
ii.

Institutional Suitability Alternative and Special
Entity Suitability Alternative

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rules 15Fh-3(f)(2)(4) with a number of modifications. First, in response to a specific suggestion from a
commenter, 515 the Commission is correcting a typographical error in proposed Rule
15Fh-3(f)(2). The institutional suitability alternative in proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2) was
intended to provide SBS Dealers with an alternative method to fulfill their customer-

specific suitability obligations described in proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(ii), not their
suitability obligations described in proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(i). Accordingly, the
cross-reference in the proposed rule should have been to “paragraph (f)(1)(ii),” not to
“paragraph (f)(1).” The Commission is correcting this cross-reference in the final rules.
Second, in response to concerns raised by a commenter, 516 the Commission is also
limiting the availability of the institutional suitability alternative to recommendations
made to “institutional counterparties.” This is a change from the proposed rule under
which the institutional suitability alternative would have been available with respect to
recommendations made to any counterparty. Rule 15Fh-3(f)(4), as adopted, defines the
term “institutional counterparty” for these purposes to mean a counterparty that is an
eligible contract participant as defined in clauses (A)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (viii), (ix) or (x),
or clause (B)(ii) (other than a person described in clause (A)(v)) of Section 1a(18) of the
Commodity Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, or any person
(whether a natural person, corporation, partnership, trust or otherwise) with total assets of
at least $50 million. This more closely aligns the treatment of the persons who may most
need the protections of the suitability requirements with their treatment under FINRA
rules, which limit the application of FINRA’s analogous institutional suitability
alternative to recommendations to persons (whether a natural person, corporation,
partnership, trust or otherwise) with total assets of at least $50 million. 517 Rule 15Fh3(f)(2), as adopted, generally provides that an SBS Dealer may rely on the institutional
suitability alternative when making recommendations to institutional counterparties. For
516

See CFA, supra note 5.

517

See FINRA Rule 2111(b) (referring to FINRA Rule 4512(c)).

162

a counterparty that is not an institutional counterparty, an SBS Dealer will need to have
or obtain relevant information regarding the counterparty to establish a reasonable basis
to believe that a recommended security-based swap or trading strategy involving a
security-based swap is suitable for the counterparty. 518
Third, in response to specific suggestions from a commenter, the Commission is
making changes to harmonize the institutional and special entity suitability alternatives
with the CFTC’s parallel provisions. 519 Specifically, the Commission is eliminating the
separate special entity suitability alternative. Accordingly, an SBS Dealer may satisfy its
customer-specific suitability obligations in Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(ii) with respect to any
institutional counterparty, including a special entity counterparty that meets the $50
million asset threshold described above, by complying with the requirements of the
institutional suitability alternative in Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2). Having a single institutional
suitability alternative will result in greater consistency with the CFTC’s parallel rule,
which will result in efficiencies for entities that have already established infrastructure to
comply with the CFTC standard. 520 However, the Commission is not adopting the
commenter’s suggestion to add a new fourth prong to Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2) that requires an

518

See Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(ii).

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5 (noting that “[a]lthough conforming to
the [parallel CFTC suitability rule] would impose additional diligence and
compliance requirements on the [SBS Dealer], these requirements would not
result in material costs because [SBS Dealers] are already complying with the
same requirements under the [parallel CFTC rule]”). However, we note that the
CFTC does not limit the availability of its institutional suitability alternative to
recommendations to “institutional counterparties.” See Commodity Exchange
Act Rule 23.434(b).

SBS Dealer to comply, in addition to the requirements of the first three prongs (as
outlined below), with the requirements of Rule 15Fh-4(b) if the SBS Dealer’s
recommendation to a special entity would cause it to be acting as an advisor to the special
entity. 521 The Commission is not making this change because the rules impose
independent requirements, and the Commission believes that SBS Dealers should comply
with each rule to the extent applicable.
The proposed special entity suitability alternative would have provided that an
SBS Dealer would be deemed to satisfy its suitability obligations with respect to a special
entity counterparty if the SBS Dealer either (1) is acting as an advisor to the special entity
and complies with proposed Rule 15Fh-4(b), or (2) is deemed not to be acting as an
advisor to the special entity pursuant to proposed Rule 15Fh-2(a). 522 With respect to the
former, the Commission believes that when an SBS Dealer is acting as an advisor to a
special entity, it is appropriate for both the best interests requirements of Rule 15Fh-4(b)
and the suitability requirements of Rule 15Fh-3(f) to apply. As discussed in Section
II.H.3 below, there is some overlap between the requirements, so an SBS Dealer’s efforts
to satisfy one set of requirements may result in satisfaction of the other. With respect to
the latter, the Commission continues to believe, as noted in the Proposing Release, that
the standards for determining that an SBS Dealer is not acting as an advisor under Rule
15Fh-2(a) are substantially the same as the standards that an SBS Dealer must satisfy to
521

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5. As discussed in Section II.H.2 below,
Rule 15Fh-4(b) generally requires an SBS Dealer that acts as an advisor to a
special entity to make a reasonable determination that any recommended securitybased swap or trading strategy involving a security-based swap is in the best
interests of the special entity.

522

See proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f)(3).

164

qualify for the institutional suitability alternative under Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2) (with the
exception of the new institutional counterparty limitation described above). 523 However,
the Commission agrees with the commenter that having a single institutional suitability
alternative more consistent with the CFTC’s rule will result in efficiencies and a lower
likelihood of counterparty confusion. 524 Additionally, as we note above, the rules being
adopted today are intended to provide certain protections for counterparties, including
certain heightened protections for special entities. In this regard, we believe it is
important that the rules impose both sets of requirements on SBS Dealers that make
recommendations to special entities so that special entities receive the full range of
benefits that the rules are intended to provide.
Fourth, the Commission is adding the words “with regard to the relevant securitybased swap or trading strategy involving a security-based swap” to modify
“recommendations of the [SBS Dealer]” in the second prong of the institutional
suitability alternative to match the language used in the first prong and clarify that those
are the only recommendations to which the rule refers. The Commission is adopting the
other two prongs of the institutional suitability alternative as proposed. Accordingly, as
adopted, Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2) provides that when an SBS Dealer makes a recommendation,
it may fulfill its customer-specific suitability obligations under Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(ii) with
respect to an institutional counterparty, if: (1) the SBS Dealer reasonably determines that
the counterparty (or its agent) is capable of independently evaluating investment risks
523

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42416 n.137, supra note 3.

524

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5. However, as noted above, the CFTC
does not limit the availability of its alternative to recommendations to
“institutional counterparties.” See Commodity Exchange Act Rule 23.434(b).
The “institutional counterparty” limitation is discussed above.

165

with regard to the relevant security-based swap or trading strategy involving a securitybased swap; (2) the counterparty (or its agent) affirmatively represents in writing that it is
exercising independent judgment in evaluating the recommendations of the SBS Dealer
with regard to the relevant security-based swap or trading strategy involving a securitybased swap; and (3) the SBS Dealer discloses that it is acting in the capacity of a
counterparty, and is not undertaking to assess the suitability of the security-based swap or
trading strategy for the counterparty. If an SBS Dealer cannot rely on the institutional
suitability alternative provided by Rule15Fh-3(f)(2), it would need to make an
independent determination that the recommended security-based swap or trading strategy
involving security-based swaps is suitable for the counterparty.
The Commission believes that the SBS Dealer reasonably could determine that
the counterparty (or its agent) is capable of independently evaluating investment risks
with regard to the relevant security-based swap or trading strategy for purposes of Rule
15Fh-3(f)(2)(i) through a variety of means. However, in response to specific suggestions
from a commenter 525 and to provide additional clarity, the Commission is adding a safe
harbor in Rule 15Fh-3(f)(3) providing that an SBS Dealer can satisfy its requirement
under the first prong of the institutional suitability alternative in Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2) to
make a reasonable determination that the counterparty (or its agent) is capable of
independently evaluating investment risks with regard to the relevant security-based swap
or trading strategy if the SBS Dealer receives appropriate written representations from its
counterparty. As discussed above in Section II.D, an SBS Dealer can rely on a
counterparty’s written representations unless the SBS Dealer has information that would
525

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5.

166

cause a reasonable person to question the accuracy of the representation. Under Rule
15Fh-3(f)(3)(i),if the counterparty is not a special entity, the representations must provide
that the counterparty has complied in good faith with written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to ensure that the persons evaluating the recommendation and
making trading decisions on behalf of the counterparty are capable of doing so. Under
Rule 15Fh-3(f)(3)(ii), if the counterparty is a special entity, the representations must
satisfy the terms of the safe harbor in Rule 15Fh-5(b). 526 If an SBS Dealer chooses not to
take advantage of the safe harbor provided by Rule 15Fh-3(f)(3), the Commission
believes that the SBS Dealer reasonably could determine that the counterparty (or its
agent) is capable of independently evaluating investment risks with regard to the relevant
security-based swap or trading strategy for purposes of Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2)(i) through a
variety of means. For example, an SBS Dealer could comply with this requirement by
having a counterparty indicate in a signed agreement or other document that the
counterparty is capable of independently evaluating investment risks with respect to
recommendations or an SBS Dealer could call its counterparty, have that discussion, and
(if it chooses or circumstances require) document the conversation to evidence the
counterparty’s affirmative indication.

526

As discussed in Section II.H.6.i below, Rule 15Fh-5(b) provides a safe harbor
under which an SBS Entity can comply with its obligation to have a reasonable
basis to believe that its special entity counterparty has a qualified independent
representative that, among other things, has sufficient knowledge to evaluate the
transaction and risks and undertakes to act in the best interests of the special
entity. Rule 15Fh-5(b) specifies the representations that the SBS Entity must
obtain from its special entity counterparty and, in some cases, from such
counterparty’s representative, to satisfy the safe harbor.

167

The Commission continues to believe that parties should be able to make the
disclosures and representations required by Rules 15Fh-3(f)(2) and (3) on a transactionby-transaction basis, on an asset-class-by-asset-class basis, or broadly in terms of all
potential transactions between the parties. 527 However, where there is an indication that a
counterparty is not capable of independently evaluating investment risks, or does not
intend to exercise independent judgment regarding, all of an SBS Dealer’s
recommendations, the SBS Dealer necessarily will have to be more specific in its
approach to complying with the institutional suitability alternative. For instance, in some
cases an SBS Dealer may be unable to determine that a counterparty is capable of
independently evaluating investment risks with respect to any security-based swap. In
other cases, the SBS Dealer may determine that a counterparty is generally capable of
evaluating investment risks with respect to some categories or types of security-based
swaps, but that the counterparty may not be able to understand a particular type of
security-based swap or its risk. Additionally, the requirements of Rule 15Fh-1(b) will
apply when an SBS Dealer is relying on representations from a counterparty or its
representative. 528
We are not adopting one commenter’s suggestions to require SBS Dealers to
conduct routine audits to ensure that the institutional suitability alternative is used
appropriately. 529 The Commission does not believe that routine audits are the sole means
through which an SBS Dealer could supervise its associated persons’ use of the

527

528

See discussion in Section II.D, supra.

529

See Levin, supra note 5.

168

institutional suitability alternative. The Commission thinks that the totality of the
supervisory requirements in Rule 15Fh-3(h) (discussed below) are appropriate to promote
effective supervisory systems and believes that SBS Dealers should have the flexibility to
determine what means they will use to supervise their associated persons’ use of the
institutional suitability alternative. The Commission notes that in supervising the use of
the institutional suitability alternative, SBS Dealers should generally consider whether
their associated persons’ reliance on representations from counterparties is reasonable.
As discussed above and in Section II.D, an SBS Dealer (or its associated person) can rely
on a counterparty’s written representations unless the SBS Dealer has information that
would cause a reasonable person to question the accuracy of the representation. In this
context, information that might be relevant to this determination includes whether the
counterparty has previously invested in the type of security-based swap or been involved
in the type of trading strategy that the SBS Dealer is now recommending, and whether the
counterparty (or its representative) appreciates what differentiates the recommended
security-based swap from a less complex alternative. If the associated person knows that
the recommended security-based swap or trading strategy represents a significant change
from the counterparty’s prior investment strategy or knows that the counterparty (or its
representative) lacks an appreciation of what differentiates the recommended securitybased swap from a less complex alternative, the associated person should generally
consider whether it can reasonably rely on the counterparty’s representation that it is
capable of independently evaluating the investment risks. 530

530

As discussed in Section II.D, under Rule 15Fh-1(b), an SBS Dealer can
reasonably rely on written representations from a counterparty or its

169

The Commission is also not adopting another commenter’s suggestion to add a
requirement to the institutional suitability alternative that an SBS Dealer have a
reasonable basis to believe its counterparty has the capacity to absorb potential losses
related to the recommended security-based swap or trading strategy. 531 The Commission
believes that the requirement in Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2)(i) that an SBS Dealer “have a
reasonable basis to believe” that the counterparty is capable of evaluating investment
risks independently is appropriate to support the objectives of the institutional suitability
alternative, and does not believe it is necessary to specifically require an SBS Dealer to
have a reasonable basis to believe its counterparty has the capacity to absorb potential
losses related to the recommended security-based swap or trading strategy.
5.

Fair and Balanced Communications

Section 15F(h)(3)(C) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission to adopt rules
establishing a duty for SBS Entities to communicate in a fair and balanced manner based
on principles of fair dealing and good faith. 532
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(g) would require SBS Entities to communicate with
counterparties in a fair and balanced manner based upon principles of fair dealing and
good faith. In particular, the rule would require: (1) communications to provide a sound
representative to satisfy its due diligence obligations. Because reliance must be
reasonable, the question of whether reliance on representations would satisfy an
SBS Dealer’s obligations under our business conduct rules will depend on the
facts and circumstances of the particular matter. At a minimum, an SBS Dealer
seeking to rely on representations cannot ignore information that would cause a
reasonable person to question the accuracy of those representations.

basis for evaluating the facts with regard to any particular security-based swap or trading
strategy involving a security-based swap; (2) communications not to imply that past
performance will recur or make any exaggerated or unwarranted claim, opinion or
forecast; and (3) any statement referring to the potential opportunities or advantages
presented by a security-based swap to be balanced by an equally detailed statement of the
corresponding risks. 533
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Three commenters addressed the fair and balanced communications
requirement. 534 Two commenters expressed support for the proposed rule, 535 and one
was opposed. 536 One of the commenters supporting the proposed rule stated that there
should not be any exceptions to the proposed fair and balanced communications
requirement. 537 The other commenter asserted that to be fair and balanced,
communications must inform investors of both the potential rewards and risks of their
investments, and also the SBS Entity’s involvement and interests in the investments, in
specific terms. 538 Specifically, the commenter noted that all material adverse interests
should be disclosed, and that the rule should clarify that it is not enough to inform a
customer that the SBS Entity “may” have an adverse interest if that adverse interest

The commenter in opposition to the proposed rule asserted that a fair and
balanced communications requirement is unnecessary. 540 The commenter explained that
the proposed rule is not relevant in the context of SBS Entities’ legacy portfolios since
the proposed rule would generally prohibit puffery used to induce a counterparty to enter
into new transactions. 541 Additionally, the commenter noted that due to the sophisticated
nature of counterparties in the security-based swaps market, the fair and balanced
communications requirement is not critical, particularly where all SBS Entities’
communications are already subject to the antifraud provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act
and the Exchange Act. 542
c.

Response to Comments and Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh-3(g) as
proposed. The rule applies in connection with entering into security-based swaps, and
will continue to apply over the term of a security-based swap. 543
The Commission does not believe any changes to the rule are necessary to address
a commenter’s concern that to be fair and balanced, communications must inform
investors of both the potential rewards and risks of their investments because Rule 15Fh3(g)(3) already provides that “[a]ny statement referring to the potential opportunities or

advantages presented by a security-based swap shall be balanced by an equally detailed
statement of the corresponding risks.” 544 With respect to the commenter’s assertion that
fair and balanced communications should also include information regarding the SBS
Entity’s involvement and interests in the investments, 545 the Commission notes that
although specific disclosure regarding conflicts of interest is not required by Rule 15Fh3(g), it is required by Rule 15Fh-3(b)(2) (disclosure of material incentives or conflicts of
interest).
The standard set forth in Rule 15Fh-3(g) is consistent with the similarly worded
requirement in the FINRA rule on communications. 546 Rule 15Fh-3(g) also includes
three specific standards, drawn from the FINRA rule, which should clarify the rule
requirement. The standards are: (1) communications must provide a sound basis for
evaluating the facts with respect to any security-based swap or trading strategy involving
a security-based swap; 547 (2) communications may not imply that past performance will
recur, or make any exaggerated or unwarranted claim, opinion, or forecast; 548 and (3) any

FINRA Rule 2210(d). See NASD IM-2210-1(1), Guidelines to Ensure That

equally detailed statement of the corresponding risks. 549 As noted in the Proposing
Release, these standards do not represent an exclusive list of considerations that an SBS
Entity must take into account in determining whether a communication with a
counterparty is fair and balanced. 550 In addition to complying with Rule 15Fh-3(g), SBS
Entities should also keep in mind that all their communications with counterparties will
be subject to the specific antifraud provisions added to the Exchange Act under Title VII
of the Dodd-Frank Act, 551 as well as general antifraud provisions under the federal
securities laws. 552 The Commission declines to eliminate the fair and balanced
communications requirement, as suggested by a commenter, 553 because we believe the
requirement promotes investor protection by prohibiting SBS Entities from overstating

549

Cf. FINRA Rule 2210(d)(1)(D) (“Members must ensure that statements are clear
and not misleading within the context in which they are made, and that they
provide balanced treatment of risks and potential benefits. Communications must
be consistent with the risks of fluctuating prices and the uncertainty of dividends,
rates of return and yield inherent to investments.”) The Commission believes that
this requirement addresses concerns raised by a commenter that to be fair and
balanced, communications must inform investors of both the potential rewards
and risks of their investments. See Levin, supra note 5.

Obligation Regarding Diligent Supervision

Section 15F(h)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to adopt
rules for the diligent supervision of the business of SBS Entities. 554
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(h)(1) would require an SBS Entity to establish, maintain
and enforce a system to supervise, and to diligently supervise, its business and associated
persons, with a view to preventing violations of applicable federal securities laws, rules
and regulations relating to its business as an SBS Entity. Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)
would require an SBS Entity’s supervisory system to be reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with applicable securities laws, rules and regulations, and would establish
minimum requirements for the supervisory system. Specifically, proposed Rule 15Fh3(h)(2)(i) would require an SBS Entity to designate at least one person with authority to
carry out the supervisory responsibilities of the SBS Entity for each type of business in
which it engages for which registration as an SBS Entity is required. Proposed Rule
15Fh-3(h)(2)(ii) would require an SBS Entity to use reasonable efforts to determine that
all supervisors are qualified and meet standards of training, experience, and competence
necessary to effectively supervise the security-based swap activities of the persons
associated with the SBS Entity.
Proposed Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii) would require an SBS Entity to establish,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures addressing the supervision of the
554

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(1)(B).

175

types of security-based swap business in which the SBS Entity is engaged. The policies
and procedures would need to be reasonably designed to achieve compliance with
applicable securities laws, rules and regulations, 555 and include, at a minimum: (1)
procedures for the review by a supervisor of transactions for which registration as an SBS
Entity is required; 556 (2) procedures for the review by a supervisor of incoming and
outgoing written (including electronic) correspondence with counterparties or potential
counterparties and internal written communications relating to the SBS Entity’s business
involving security-based swaps; 557 (3) procedures for a periodic review, at least annually,
of the security-based swap business in which the SBS Entity engages that is reasonably
designed to assist in detecting and preventing violations of, and achieving compliance
with, applicable federal securities laws and regulations; 558 (4) procedures to conduct a
reasonable investigation regarding the character, business repute, qualifications, and
experience of any person prior to that person’s association with the SBS Entity; 559 (5)
procedures to consider whether to permit an associated person to establish or maintain a
securities or commodities account in the name of, or for the benefit of such associated
person, at another SBS Dealer, broker, dealer, investment adviser, or other financial
institution, and if permitted, procedures to supervise the trading in such account,
including the receipt of duplicate confirmations and statements related to such account; 560

(6) a description of the supervisory system, including the titles, qualifications and
locations of supervisory persons and the specific responsibilities of each person with
respect to the types of business in which the SBS Entity is engaged; 561 (7) procedures
prohibiting supervisors from supervising their own activities or reporting to, or having
their compensation or continued employment determined by, a person or persons they are
supervising; 562 and (8) procedures preventing the standards of supervision from being
reduced due to any conflicts of interest of a supervisor with respect to the associated
person being supervised. 563 Additionally, proposed Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iv) would require
an SBS Entity to include written policies and procedures reasonably designed, taking into
consideration the nature of the SBS Entity’s business, to comply with the duties set forth
in Section 15F(j) of the Exchange Act. 564
Under proposed Rule 15Fh-3(h)(3), the Commission proposed two mechanisms
under which an SBS Entity or associated person would not be deemed to have failed to
diligently supervise any other person. The SBS Entity or associated person could
demonstrate that: (1) such person is not subject to his or her supervision, or (2) it meets
the terms of a safe harbor. The safe harbor would require the SBS Entity or associated
person to satisfy two conditions. The first condition would be that the SBS Entity has
established and maintained written policies and procedures, and a documented system for
applying those policies and procedures, that would reasonably be expected to prevent and
detect, insofar as practicable, any violation of the federal securities laws and the rules and

be that the SBS Entity or associated person has reasonably discharged the duties and
obligations required by such written policies and procedures and documented system and
did not have a reasonable basis to believe that such written policies and procedures and
documented system were not being followed. 566
Finally, proposed Rule 15Fh-3(h)(4) would require an SBS Entity to promptly
amend its written supervisory procedures as appropriate when material changes occur in
either applicable securities laws, rules or regulations, or in the SBS Entity’s business or
supervisory system, and to promptly communicate any material amendments to its
supervisory procedures throughout the relevant parts of its organization.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Five commenters addressed the proposed supervision rule. 567 One commenter
supported the requirement in proposed Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iv) that SBS Entities adopt
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance with the duties
set forth in Section 15F(j) of the Exchange Act. 568 The commenter noted that this
approach, which does not mandate the inclusion of specific elements or prohibitions, will
provide SBS Entities flexibility in establishing compliance policies appropriate for their
management and organizational structure. 569

Another commenter argued for additional diligent supervision requirements. 570
The commenter recommended requiring supervisory personnel to report to upper
management or the board, as appropriate, if they have reason to believe the SBS Entity’s
supervisory procedures are not proving effective in preventing violations. 571 The
commenter also suggested requiring SBS Entities to reevaluate their supervisory
procedures when they fail to detect or deter significant violations, and determine whether
revisions are needed. 572
In contrast, a third commenter requested that the Commission narrow the
proposed supervision requirements. 573 The commenter suggested that the Commission
clarify that when an SBS Entity is already subject to, and complies with, comparable
requirements of another “qualifying regulator” (such as risk management standards
imposed by a prudential regulator), the SBS Entity’s supervisory policies and procedures
will be deemed to be reasonably designed for purposes of the proposed rule. 574 The
commenter also requested that the Commission clarify that a person committing a
violation will not be viewed as being subject to the supervision of another person unless
the putative supervisor knew or should have known that he or she had the authority and
responsibility to exercise control over the other person that could have prevented the
violation. 575

A fourth commenter opposed the application of the proposed rule to Major SBS
Participants. 576 The commenter asserted that the proposed rule imposes burdensome and
costly supervisory procedures on Major SBS Participants that are not appropriate given
their non-dealer role in the marketplace, and that the potential costs of compliance would
be without any meaningful offsetting benefit for other market participants or the financial
markets as a whole. 577
A fifth commenter recommended harmonizing the Commission’s supervision
requirements with FINRA Rule 3110 to enable SBS Entities that are also broker-dealers
to make use of their existing supervisory systems and to minimize confusion. 578
Specifically, the commenter suggested eliminating the proposed requirements in
proposed Rule 15Fh-3(h)(1) to “enforce” a system to supervise and to diligently
supervise “the business” (as opposed to the associated persons) of the SBS Entity, and
changing the description of the supervisory system from “with a view to preventing
violations of” to “reasonably designed to ensure compliance with” the provisions of
applicable federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder relating to its
business as an SBS Entity. 579 The commenter also recommended eliminating the

making a number of changes to the wording of the minimum requirements listed in subsection (h)(2) to align them with FINRA Rule 3110. 580 The commenter also asked that
the Commission modify the rule text to reflect that security-based swaps are not
necessarily traded in an “account” but rather pursuant to a bilateral trading
relationship. 581 Additionally, the commenter recommended adding a provision allowing
an SBS Entity that cannot comply with the requirement in proposed Rule 15Fh3(h)(2)(iii)(G) (preventing a supervisor from supervising his or her own activities or
reporting to a person he or she is supervising) to document its determination that
compliance is not possible because of the firm’s size or a supervisory person’s position
within the firm and document how the supervisory arrangement otherwise complies with
proposed Rule 15Fh-3(h)(1). 582 The commenter also requested that the Commission
provide guidance regarding risk-based reviews that is consistent with FINRA
supplementary material on the topic. 583 Finally, the commenter recommended wording
changes to the maintenance of written supervisory procedures requirement in proposed
Rule 15Fh-3(h)(4) to harmonize with FINRA Rule 3110, including eliminating the
proposed requirement to update the written supervisory procedures when material
changes occur to the “business,” as opposed to the supervisory system. 584

Response to Comments and Final Rule

181

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh-3(h)
with certain modifications. In response to commenters’ concerns regarding SBS Entities
that will also be registered as broker-dealers or Swap Entities being subject to
overlapping requirements with respect to their supervisory systems, 585 the modifications
(discussed below) are primarily intended to make the final rule more consistent with
FINRA Rule 3110 and the CFTC’s supervision rule for Swap Entities while continuing to
provide protections intended to help ensure that SBS Entities have effective supervisory
systems. 586 While, as discussed throughout this release, we are making changes to many
of the business conduct rules that are intended to make the final rules more consistent
with the parallel CFTC requirements, for the supervision and CCO rules, in particular, we
agree with a commenter that consistency with the parallel FINRA rules is also important
because many SBS Entities have already established infrastructure to comply with those
rules in the context of broader supervisory and compliance programs across their

585

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5; FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

586

As noted above, although the Commission modeled proposed Rule 15Fh-3(h) in
part on NASD Rules 3010 (Supervision) and 3012 (Supervisory Control System),
the Commission subsequently approved new consolidated FINRA Rules 3110
(Supervision) and 3120 (Supervisory Control System), which are largely based on
and replace NASD Rules 3010 and 3012, and corresponding provisions of the
NYSE Rules and Interpretations. Among other changes to the rules, the new
FINRA rules contain new or modified requirements with respect to: (i) which
personnel can supervise other personnel; (ii) which personnel are permitted to
perform office inspections; (iii) review of certain internal communications; and
(iv) obligations to monitor for insider trading, conduct internal investigations and
provide reports to FINRA regarding such investigations. The new FINRA rule
also codified guidance regarding the permissible use of risk-based systems for
review of transactions and correspondence. See Order Approving Proposed Rule
Change as Modified by Amendment No. 1, Exchange Act Release No. 71179
(Dec. 23, 2013), 78 FR 79542 (Dec. 30, 2013).

security-based swap and related securities and swaps businesses. 587 This consistency will
result in efficiencies for SBS Entities that have already established supervisory systems to
comply with the FINRA and/or CFTC standards. Consistent wording will also allow
SBS Entities to more easily analyze compliance with the Commission’s rule against their
existing activities to comply with FINRA Rule 3110 and the CFTC’s supervision rule for
Swap Entities.
First, in response to a specific suggestion made by a commenter, 588 the
Commission is making several wording changes to the description of the general
requirement to establish a supervisory system in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(1). The Commission is
deleting the words “and enforce” from the description and adding the modifying language
“the activities of” before associated persons so that it requires an SBS Entity to “establish
and maintain a system to supervise, and [to] diligently supervise, its business and the
activities of its associated persons.” 589 Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii) (discussed below) includes
an express requirement to enforce supervisory policies and procedures, making the
additional language regarding enforcing the system to supervise unnecessary.
Accordingly, the Commission believes that the rule, as adopted with these wording
changes, will continue to establish requirements to help ensure that SBS Entities have
effective supervisory systems, consistent with the proposed rule. At the same time, the
587

Cf. FINRA Rule 3110(a) (“Each member shall establish and maintain a system to
supervise the activities of each associated person...”); Commodity Exchange Act
Rule 23.602(a) (“Each [Swap Entity] shall establish and maintain a system to
supervise, and shall diligently supervise, all activities relating to its business
performed by its partners, members, officers, employees, and agents (or persons
occupying a similar status or performing a similar function)…”).

183

changes will make the wording of the rule more consistent with the corresponding
FINRA and CFTC requirements, as requested by a commenter. This consistency will
result in efficiencies for SBS Entities that have already established supervisory systems to
comply with the FINRA and/or CFTC standards, as discussed above.
Second, the Commission is making further wording changes to the descriptions of
the required supervisory system in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(1) and (2) in response to concerns
raised by a commenter regarding the redundancy of the descriptions. 590 Proposed Rule
15Fh-3(h)(1) would require SBS Entities to “establish…a system to supervise…with a
view to preventing violations of the provisions of applicable federal securities laws and
the rules and regulations thereunder relating to its business [as an SBS Entity],” and
proposed Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2) would specify that the required system be “reasonably
designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder.” The Commission does not believe that the two descriptions
(“prevent violations” and “achieve compliance”) are substantively different, nor did we
intend to give the appearance of creating two different standards for what is essentially
the same requirement. Accordingly, the Commission is changing and consolidating the
description of the supervisory system in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(1) to state that an SBS Entity’s
supervisory system “shall be reasonably designed to prevent violations of applicable
federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder relating to its business [as
an SBS Entity],” and eliminating the redundant description in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2). 591

590

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5.

591

This formulation tracks the requirement in Exchange Act Rule 15Fb2-1(b) that a
senior officer of the SBS Entity certify on Form SBSE–C that “[a]fter due inquiry,
he or she has reasonably determined that the [SBS Entity] has developed and

184

Additionally, the Commission is making parallel changes to Rules 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii) and
15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii)(C). Specifically, the Commission is changing the requirement in Rule
15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii) that the supervisory system provide for the establishment, maintenance
and enforcement of certain written policies and procedures from policies and procedures
that are “reasonably designed to achieve compliance with” to policies and procedures that
are “reasonably designed to prevent violations of applicable federal securities laws and
the rules and regulations thereunder.” The Commission is also changing the requirement
in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii)(C) that an SBS Entity’s supervisory policies and procedures
include procedures for a periodic review of the SBS Entity’s security-based swap
business by eliminating the redundant requirement that the review be reasonably
designed to assist in “achieving compliance with” applicable federal securities laws and
regulations and conforming the remaining language. Accordingly, as adopted, Rule
15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii)(C) requires an SBS Entity’s written supervisory policies and procedures
to include “[p]rocedures for a periodic review, at least annually, of the security-based
swap business in which the [SBS Entity] engages that is reasonably designed to assist in
detecting and preventing violations of applicable federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder.”

implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent
violation of federal securities laws and the rules thereunder.” Cf. FINRA Rule
3110(a) (“Each member shall establish and maintain a system to supervise the
activities of each associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with applicable
FINRA rules.”); Commodity Exchange Act Rule 23.602(a) (“Each [Swap Entity]
shall establish and maintain a system to supervise...Such system shall be
reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the requirements of the
Commodity Exchange Act and [CFTC] regulations.”).

185

Third, in response to concerns raised by a commenter, 592 the Commission is
changing the wording of the minimum requirements for a supervisory system listed in
Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2) to more closely align the requirements of our rule with those of
FINRA Rule 3110, and to reflect the fact that security-based swaps are not necessarily
traded in an “account” but rather pursuant to a bilateral trading relationship. Specifically,
the Commission is: (1) changing the description of the requirement that supervisors be
qualified in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(ii) from “qualified and meet standards of training,
experience, and competence necessary to effectively supervise the security-based swap
activities of the persons associated with the [SBS Entity]” to “qualified, either by virtue
of experience or training, to carry out their assigned responsibilities;” 593 (2) adding “and
the activities of its associated persons” to the policies and procedures requirement in Rule
15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii) so that it requires “written policies and procedures addressing the
supervision of the types of security-based swap business in which the [SBS Entity] is
engaged and the activities of its associated persons;” 594 (3) adding “good” to the
description of the requirement to have procedures for background investigations on
associated persons in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii)(D) so that it requires “procedures to conduct

592

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5.

593

Cf. FINRA Rule 3110(a)(6) (“A member’s supervisory system shall
provide…for…[t]he use of reasonable efforts to determine that all supervisory
personnel are qualified, either by virtue of experience or training, to carry out
their assigned responsibilities.”).

Cf. FINRA Rule 3110(b)(1) (“Each member shall establish, maintain, and enforce
written procedures to supervise the types of business in which it engages and the
activities of its associated persons…”).

186

a reasonable investigation regarding the good character” of an associated person; 595 (4)
adding “or a trading relationship” to the description of the requirement to have
procedures for considering whether to allow an associated person to conduct trading for
his or her own benefit at another financial institution in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii)(E) so that
it requires “procedures to consider whether to permit an associated person to establish or
maintain a securities or commodities account or a trading relationship;” and (5) changing
the description of the requirement to have conflicts of interest procedures in Rule 15Fh3(h)(2)(iii)(H) from “procedures preventing the standards of supervision from being
reduced due to any conflicts of interest of a supervisor with respect to the associated
person being supervised” to “procedures reasonably designed to prevent the supervisory
system required by paragraph (h)(1) from being compromised due to the conflicts of
interest that may be present with respect to the associated person being supervised,
including the position of such person, the revenue such person generates for the [SBS
Entity], or any compensation that the associated person conducting the supervision may
derive from the associated person being supervised.” 596 The Commission believes that
the rule, as adopted with these changes, will continue to provide protections intended to
595

Cf. FINRA Rule 3110(e) (“Each member shall ascertain by investigation the good
character…of an applicant before the member applies to register that applicant
with FINRA...”).

Cf. FINRA Rule 3110(b)(6)(D) (“The supervisory procedures…shall
include…procedures reasonably designed to prevent the supervisory system
required pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Rule from being compromised due to
the conflicts of interest that may be present with respect to the associated person
being supervised, including the position of such person, the revenue such person
generates for the firm, or any compensation that the associated person conducting
the supervision may derive from the associated person being supervised,
including the position of such person, the revenue such person generates for the
firm, or any compensation that the associated person conducting the supervision
may derive from the associated person being supervised.”).

187

help ensure that SBS Entities have effective supervisory systems, consistent with the
proposed rule. At the same time, the changes will make the wording of the rule more
consistent with the parallel FINRA requirement, resulting in efficiencies for SBS Entities
that have already established supervisory systems to comply with the FINRA standard, as
discussed above.
In addition to the wording changes described above, the Commission is making
two other sets of changes to the minimum requirements for a supervisory system listed in
Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2). First, the Commission is eliminating the specific requirement in
proposed Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii)(E) that the supervision of trading in an associated
person’s securities or commodities account at another financial institution “includ[e] the
receipt of duplicate confirmations and statements related to such accounts.” This change
is intended to more closely align our requirement with the analogous FINRA rule, which
was amended after our proposal. 597 The amended FINRA rule replaced the requirement
to receive duplicate confirmation and statements with a more flexible standard by which
firms can determine the data source(s) that are the most effective means to review trading
activity. Likewise, this change is also intended to provide SBS Entities reasonable
flexibility to craft appropriate supervisory policies and procedures relevant to their
business model and to ascertain the means to obtain the necessary data for effective

597

See Order Approving Proposed Rule Change to Adopt FINRA Rule 3210
(Accounts at Other Broker-Dealers and Financial Institutions), as Modified by
Partial Amendment No. 1 and Partial Amendment No. 2, in the Consolidated
FINRA Rulebook, Exchange Act Release No. 77550 (Apr. 7, 2016), 81 FR 21924
(Apr. 13, 2016) (“Proposed FINRA Rule 3210(c) would require an executing
member, upon written request by the employer member, to transmit duplicate
copies of confirmations and statements, or the transactional data contained
therein, with respect to an account subject to the rule.”).

188

supervision. The Commission notes that the rule, in permitting flexibility, does not limit
the SBS Entity’s discretion to request from the associated person such transaction and
account information as the SBS Entity deems necessary to fulfill its supervisory
obligations (including confirmations and statements related to the account or trading
relationship), and SBS Entities may consider the availability of such information and
whether activity in the account can be properly monitored when determining whether to
provide consent to an associated person to open or maintain an account or trading
relationship at another financial institution.
Second, in response to concerns raised by a commenter, 598 the Commission is
modifying Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii)(G) to address circumstances where an SBS Entity is
unable to comply with the supervisory requirements due to the SBS Entity’s size or
supervisor’s position within the SBS Entity. Pursuant to final Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii)(G),
an SBS Entity that cannot comply with the requirement in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii)(G)
(preventing a supervisor from supervising his or her own activities or reporting to a
person he or she is supervising) will be required to document its determination that
compliance is not possible because of the firm’s size or a supervisory person’s position
within the firm, document how the supervisory arrangement otherwise complies with
Rule 15Fh-3(h)(1), and include a summary of such determination in the annual
compliance report prepared by the SBS Entity’s CCO pursuant to Rule 15Fk-1(c). This
change is designed to address concerns raised by a commenter that due to the size or
structure of some SBS Entities, it may not always be possible to prohibit an associated
person who performs a supervisory function at an SBS Entity from supervising his or her
598

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5.

189

own activities or reporting to a person whom he or she is supervising. 599 The Commission
believes adding the provision described above will make the supervisory requirements
more operationally workable by providing flexibility, in particular for supervision of very
senior SBS Entity personnel, while still maintaining appropriate investor protection
through the requirement to document how the supervisory arrangement otherwise
complies with Rule 15Fh-3(h)(1). The Commission notes that SBS Entities relying on
this provision will also be subject to the other requirements of Rule 15Fh-3(h), including
the requirement in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii)(H) to have procedures reasonably designed to
prevent the supervisory system from being compromised due to the conflicts of interest
that may be present with respect to the associated person being supervised, including the
position of such person, the revenue such person generates for the SBS Entity, or any
compensation that the associated person conducting the supervision may derive from the
associated person being supervised.
The Commission notes that the minimum requirements for a supervisory system
listed in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2) are not an exhaustive list. SBS Entities should keep in mind
their overarching obligation in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(1) to establish and maintain a supervisory
system that is reasonably designed to prevent violations of applicable federal securities
laws and the rules and regulations thereunder relating to the SBS Entity’s business as an
SBS Entity. For instance, although Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii)(B) only requires procedures
“for the review by a supervisor of incoming and outgoing written (including electronic)
correspondence with counterparties or potential counterparties and internal written
communications relating to the [SBS Entity’s] business involving security-based swaps,”
599

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5.

190

if an SBS Entity records oral communications with counterparties or potential
counterparties, the SBS Entity generally should consider providing for the supervisory
review of such communications. 600 Similarly, if an SBS Entity chooses to provide
certain disclosures required by Rule 15Fh-3(b) orally, the SBS Entity should consider
how it will supervise these oral communications.
In response to a specific suggestion made by a commenter, 601 the Commission is
modifying the maintenance of written supervisory procedures requirement in Rule 15Fh3(h)(4) to harmonize with FINRA Rule 3110. Specifically, we are changing the
requirement to promptly communicate material amendments to an SBS Entity’s
supervisory procedures from “throughout the relevant parts of its organization” to “to all
associated persons to whom such amendments are relevant based on their activities and
responsibilities.” 602 We believe that the new formulation will be more effective at
600

Section 15F(g)(1) of the Exchange Act provides that each SBS Entity shall
maintain daily trading records of the security-based swaps of the SBS Entity and
all related records (including related cash or forward transactions) and recorded
communications, including electronic mail, instant messages, and recordings of
telephone calls, for such period as may be required by the Commission by rule or
regulation. See 15 U.S.C. 78o–10(g)(1). To implement Section 15F(g)(1) of the
Exchange Act, the Commission has proposed to amend the preservation
requirement in paragraph (b)(4) of Exchange Act Rule 17a–4 to include
‘‘recordings of telephone calls required to be maintained pursuant to [Section
15F(g)(1) of the Exchange Act].’’ Under this proposed requirement, a brokerdealer SBS Entity would be required to preserve for three years telephone calls
that it chooses to record to the extent the calls are required to be maintained
pursuant to Section 15F(g)(1) of the Exchange Act. The Commission has also
proposed a parallel requirement for stand-alone SBS Entities. See Recordkeeping
Release, 79 FR at 25213-25214, supra note 242.

601

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5.

602

Cf. FINRA Rule 3110(b)(7) (“Each member shall promptly amend its written
supervisory procedures to reflect changes in applicable securities laws or
regulations, including FINRA rules, and as changes occur in its supervisory
system. Each member is responsible for promptly communicating its written

191

achieving its intended result by targeting the communications to the associated persons to
whom such amendments are relevant. The Commission believes that under the proposed
formulation, potential interpretations of the phrase “relevant parts of its organization”
may have resulted in communications to a broader than necessary group. The
Commission declines to adopt the commenter’s suggestion to eliminate the proposed
requirement in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(4)(i) for an SBS Entity to update its written supervisory
procedures when material changes occur to its “business,” in addition to its supervisory
system. 603 Rule 15Fh-3(h)(1) requires an SBS Entity to diligently supervise its business.
Implicit in that obligation is a requirement that the SBS Entity update its supervisory
system as necessary to accommodate changes to its business. The Commission does not
want to create confusion regarding this obligation by eliminating the explicit requirement
in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(4)(i) for an SBS Entity to update its supervisory procedures when
material changes occur to its business.
In addition to the modifications discussed above, the Commission is making
several clarifying changes to the rule. First, the Commission is correcting a
typographical error in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2). The cross-reference in the proposed rule
should have been to “paragraph (h)(1),” not to “paragraph (g)(1).” The Commission is
correcting this cross-reference in the final rule.
Second, the Commission also is making two other changes to the rule to clarify
that Rule 15Fh-3(h) does not require multiple sets of written supervisory policies and

supervisory procedures and amendments to all associated persons to whom such
written supervisory procedures and amendments are relevant based on their
activities and responsibilities.”).
603

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5.

192

procedures. Specifically, the Commission is: (1) re-designating proposed Rule 15Fh3(h)(2)(iv) as Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii)(I); and (2) clarifying that the written policies and
procedures referred to in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(3) are those required by Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii)
by adding the modifying language “as required in §240.15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii)” after “written
policies and procedures” in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(3)(i), and by changing the references in Rule
15Fh-3(h)(3)(ii) from “the written policies and procedures” to “such written policies and
procedures.”
Rule 15Fh-3(h) establishes supervisory obligations that incorporate principles
from both Exchange Act Section 15(b) and existing SRO rules. The concept of diligent
supervision in these rules is consistent with business conduct standards for broker-dealers
that have historically been established by SROs for their members, subject to
Commission approval. As with diligent supervision by a broker-dealer, the Commission
believes that it generally would be appropriate for an SBS Entity to use a risk-based
review system to satisfy its supervisory obligations under Rule 15Fh-3(h) instead of
conducting detailed reviews of every transaction or every communication, so long as the
SBS Entity uses a risk-based review system that is reasonably designed to provide the
entity with sufficient information to allow it to focus on the areas that pose the greatest
risks of federal securities law violations. 604 Use of a risk-based system allows SBS
Entities the flexibility to establish their supervisory systems in a manner that reflects their

604

This guidance is intended to respond to a request from a commenter to provide
guidance regarding risk-based reviews that is consistent with Supplementary
Material .05 and .06 to FINRA Rule 3110. See SIFMA (September 2015), supra
note 5.

193

business models, and based on those models, focus on areas where heightened concern
may be warranted.
Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii)(I), as adopted, requires an SBS Entity to adopt written
policies and procedures reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of such
SBS Entity’s business, to comply with the duties set forth in Section 15F(j) of the
Exchange Act. Section 15F(j) of the Exchange Act requires an SBS Entity to comply
with obligations concerning: (1) monitoring of trading to prevent violations of applicable
position limits; (2) establishing sound and professional risk management systems; (3)
disclosing to regulators information concerning its trading in security-based swaps; (4)
establishing and enforcing internal systems and procedures to obtain any necessary
information to perform any of the functions described in Section 15F of the Exchange
Act, and providing the information to regulators, on request; (5) implementing conflictof-interest systems and procedures; and (6) addressing antitrust considerations such that
the SBS Entity does not adopt any process or take any action that results in any
unreasonable restraint of trade or impose any material anticompetitive burden on trading
or clearing. 605 While the requirements of Section 15F(j) are self-executing, we highlight
in particular the duty of an SBS Entity under Section 15F(j)(2) to “establish robust and
professional risk management systems adequate for managing the day-to-day business”
of the SBS Entity. Any risk management system established by an SBS Entity should be
effective to manage the risks of the SBS Entity within the risk tolerance limits to be
determined for each type of risk. We have separately proposed a rule regarding the
requirement for an SBS Entity for which there is not a prudential regulator to establish,

document, and maintain controls to assist it in managing the risks associated with its
business activities, including market, credit, leverage, liquidity, legal, and operational
risks. 606
We are not adopting a commenter’s 607 suggestion that when an SBS Entity is
already subject to, and complies with, comparable requirements of another “qualifying
regulator” (such as risk management standards imposed by a prudential regulator), the
SBS Entity’s supervisory policies and procedures will be deemed to be reasonably
designed for purposes of Rule 15Fh-3(h). Exchange Act Section 15F(h)(1)(B) directs the
Commission to adopt rules relating to the diligent supervision of SBS Entities’ business.
Although we have closely conformed our supervision rule to parallel SRO requirements
and believe it is also consistent with parallel CFTC requirements, we do not believe it is
606

The Commission has separately proposed to require every SBS Entity for which
there is not a prudential regulator (“Non-bank SBS Dealers”) to comply, with
certain exceptions, with the requirements of Rule 15c3-4 under the Exchange Act
“as if it were an OTC derivatives dealer with respect to all of its business
activities.” See Exchange Act Rule 18a-1(g). See also Capital, Margin, and
Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major SecurityBased Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, Capital,
Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and
Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for BrokerDealers, Exchange Act Release No. 68071 (Oct. 18, 2012), 77 FR 70214, 7025070251 (Nov. 23, 2012), explaining that application of Rule 15c3-4 would require
a Non-bank SBS Entity to “establish, document, and maintain a system of internal
risk management controls to assist in managing the risks associated with its
business activities, including market, credit, leverage, liquidity, legal, and
operational risks.” Rule 15c3-4 identifies a number of elements that must be part
of the risk management system including, among other things: a risk control unit
that reports directly to senior management and is independent from business
trading units; separation of duties between persons responsible for entering into a
transaction and those responsible for recording the transaction on the dealer’s
books; and periodic reviews (which may be performed by internal audit staff) and
annual reviews (which must be conducted by independent certified public
accountants) of the dealer’s risk management systems. Id.

195

appropriate to defer to other regulators’ rules, other than as discussed below in Section
III. In addition, we are not excluding Major SBS Participants from the scope of the rule,
as one commenter suggested. 608 We note that Exchange Act Section 15Fh(1)(B)
explicitly contemplates that Major SBS Participants, as well as SBS Dealers, will have
obligations to supervise diligently their security-based swap business. As discussed
above in Section II.C, where the Dodd-Frank Act imposes a business conduct
requirement on both SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants, the rules will apply to
both entities.
Rule 15Fh-3(h)(3), as adopted, provides that SBS Entities and associated persons
will not be liable for failure to supervise another person if either the other person is not
subject to the SBS Entity’s or associated person’s supervision, or if the safe harbor
described in the rule is satisfied. 609 The safe harbor contains two conditions. First, the
SBS Entity must have established policies and procedures, and a system for applying
those policies and procedures, which would reasonably be expected to prevent and detect,
to the extent practicable, any violation of the federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder relating to security-based swaps. Second, the SBS Entity or
associated person must have reasonably discharged the duties and obligations incumbent
on it by reason of such procedures and system without a reasonable basis to believe that
608

See MFA, supra note 5.

609

One commenter requested clarification that a person committing a violation will
not be viewed as subject to the supervision of another person unless such other
person knew or should have known that he or she had authority and responsibility
to exercise control over the violator that could have prevented the violation. See
FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5. The Commission notes that if the conditions of
the safe harbor in Rule 15Fh-3(h)(3) are not met, liability for failure to supervise
would be a facts and circumstances determination, which would take into account
the factors described by the commenter.

196

such procedures were not being followed. 610 Both conditions must be met in order for an
SBS Entity to satisfy the safe harbor. However, as noted in the Proposing Release, the
inability to rely on the safe harbor would not necessarily mean that an SBS Entity or
associated person failed to diligently supervise any other person. 611

610

We are not adopting a commenter’s recommendation that our rules expressly
require supervisory personnel to “report up” to upper management of the board,
and require an SBS Entity to reevaluate its supervisory procedures if they fail to
detect or deter significant violations. See CFA, supra note 5. We note that Rule
15Fh-3(h) provides a baseline for an effective supervisory system, but, as noted in
the Proposing Release, a particular system may need additional elements to be
effective. See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42419, supra note 3. For that reason,
Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2) states that it establishes only minimum requirements. Id.

611

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42420, supra note 3. With respect to brokerdealers, the Commission’s policy regarding failure to supervise is well
established. See 15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(4)(E) and 15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(6)(A). As the
Commission has explained in other contexts:
The Commission has long emphasized that the responsibility of brokerdealers to supervise their employees is a critical component of the federal
regulatory scheme. . . In large organizations it is especially imperative that
those in authority exercise particular vigilance when indications of
irregularity reach their attention. The supervisory obligations imposed by
the federal securities laws require a vigorous response even to indications
of wrongdoing. Many of the Commission’s cases involving a failure to
supervise arise from situations where supervisors were aware only of “red
flags” or “suggestions” of irregularity, rather than situations where, as
here, supervisors were explicitly informed of an illegal act. Even where
the knowledge of supervisors is limited to “red flags” or “suggestions” of
irregularity, they cannot discharge their supervisory obligations simply by
relying on the unverified representations of employees. Instead, as the
Commission has repeatedly emphasized, “[t]here must be adequate
follow-up and review when a firm’s own procedures detect irregularities
or unusual trading activity....” Moreover, if more than one supervisor is
involved in considering the actions to be taken in response to possible
misconduct, there must be a clear definition of the efforts to be taken and a
clear assignment of those responsibilities to specific individuals within the
firm.

Rules Applicable to Dealings with Special Entities

Sections 15F(h)(4) and (5) of the Exchange Act provide certain additional
protections for “special entities” -- such as municipalities, federal and state agencies,
pension plans, and endowments 612 -- in connection with security-based swaps. 613
Special entities, like other market participants, may use swaps and security-based
swaps for a variety of purposes, including risk management and portfolio adjustment. In
adopting the special entity provisions of the Exchange Act, the Commission seeks to
implement the statute, while not impeding special entities’ access to security-based
swaps.
1.

Scope of Definition of “Special Entity”
a.

Proposed Rule

Exchange Act Section 15F(h)(2)(C) defines a “special entity” as: (i) a Federal
agency; (ii) a State, State agency, city, county, municipality, or other political subdivision
of a State; (iii) any employee benefit plan, as defined in Section 3 of ERISA; (iv) any
governmental plan, as defined in Section 3 of ERISA; or (v) any endowment, including
an endowment that is an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986. 614 Proposed Rule 15Fh-2(e) defines a “special entity” as: (i) a

612

See Section II.D.2.a, infra.

613

15U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(4)-(5).

614

Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 includes, in its list of
“exempt organizations”:
Corporations, and any community chest, fund, or foundation, organized
and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for
public safety, literary, or educational purposes, or to foster national or
international amateur sports competition (but only if no part of its
activities involve the provision of athletic facilities or equipment), or for

198

Federal agency; (ii) a State, State agency, city, county, municipality, or other political
subdivision of a State; (iii) any employee benefit plan, as defined in Section 3 of ERISA;
(iv) any governmental plan, as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA; or (v) any endowment,
including an endowment that is an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
The Proposing Release noted that commenters had raised questions about the
scope of the “special entity” definition. The Commission requested comment regarding:
(1) whether to interpret the phrase “employee benefit plan, as defined in Section 3” of
ERISA to mean a plan that is subject to regulation under ERISA; (2) whether the phrase
“governmental plan” should include government investment pools or other plans,
programs or pools of assets; (3) the definition of the term “endowment;” (4) the treatment
of collective investment vehicles in which one or more special entities are invested; (5)
the treatment of foreign entities; and (6) the treatment of master trusts holding the assets
of one or more funded plans of a single employer and its affiliates.
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

One commenter argued that the term “special entity” was adequately defined in
the Exchange Act, and that it “should not require extensive clarification.” 615 However,

the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, no part of the net earnings
of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual, no
substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or
otherwise attempting, to influence legislation (except as otherwise
provided in subsection (h)), and which does not participate in, or intervene
in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political
campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public
office.

199

most commenters requested that the Commission exclude or include specific groups from
the “special entity” designation. These comments are addressed below.
i.

Federal Agency

We received no comments regarding the inclusion of federal agencies within the
special entity definition. In the Proposing Release, we noted that the definition of
“security-based swap” excludes an “agreement, contract or transaction a counterparty of
which is a Federal Reserve bank, the Federal Government, or a Federal agency that is
expressly backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.” 616
ii.

State and Municipal Entities

One commenter suggested that we modify the description of state and municipal
entities to include “any instrumentality, department, or a corporation of or established by
a State or political subdivision of a State.” 617 According to the commenter, this
modification would harmonize the SEC’s definition of “special entity” with that of the
CFTC. 618
iii.

Employee Benefit Plans and Governmental Plans

As stated above, Exchange Act Section 15F(h)(2)(C)(iii) defines “special entity”
to include “any employee benefit plan, as defined in Section 3 of [ERISA].” 619 Section
15F(h)(2)(C)(iv) separately adds “any governmental plan, as defined in Section 3
[ERISA]” to the special entity definition. Section 3 of ERISA defines the term

“employee benefit plan” to include plans, such as most private sector employee benefit
plans, that are subject to regulation under Title I of ERISA. 620 However, Section 3 of
ERISA also defines the following additional categories of employee benefit plans that are
not subject to” ERISA regulation: (1) governmental plans; (2) church plans; (3) plans
maintained solely for the purpose of complying with applicable workmen’s compensation
laws or unemployment compensation or disability insurance laws; (4) plans maintained
outside the U.S. primarily for the benefit of persons substantially all of whom are
nonresident aliens; or (5) unfunded excess benefit plans. 621 These latter categories of
employee benefit plans, including governmental plans, are therefore “defined in” ERISA,
but not “subject to” regulation under ERISA.
Commenters asked the Commission at the proposing stage to limit the scope of
Section 15F(h)(2)(C)(iii) to employee benefit plans that are subject to regulation under
ERISA, and not to extend the definition of “special entity” to plans that are merely
“defined in” ERISA, “unless they are covered by another applicable prong of the “special
entity” definition (e.g., governmental plans).” 622 As the commenters noted, Exchange
Act Section 15F(h)(2)(C)(iv) separately defines “special entity” to include any
governmental plan, as defined in Section 3 of ERISA. Mindful of the redundancy that
would result if the statute were interpreted to include governmental plans twice in the
definition of “special entity,” the Commission therefore requested comment regarding
whether to interpret the phrase “employee benefit plan, as defined in Section 3 of

[ERISA]” in Exchange Act Section 15F(h)(2)(C)(iii), or to mean a plan that is “subject
to” regulation under ERISA. 623
Seven comment letters addressed this issue. One commenter argued that the
expansive language of the statute suggested that any employee benefit plan “defined in”
ERISA, including a church plan, should be treated as a special entity, and that, as a matter
of policy, church plans should not be treated differently than ERISA or governmental
plans when entering into security-based swaps with SBS Entities. 624 This commenter
recommended that the Commission revise the proposed special entity definition to clarify
that church plans are special entities, or that the Commission permit church plans to “opt
in” to special entity status, since opting in would provide potential counterparties greater
certainty regarding whether a church plan was, in fact, a special entity. 625 Another
commenter recommended that the Commission cover plans “defined in” ERISA. 626
A collective group of three commenters argued that the definition of special entity
should include only employee benefit plans that are “subject to” ERISA. 627 This group
asserted that, “[s]ince Congress included a separate ‘governmental plans’ prong in the
definition of special entity, the ‘employee benefit plan’ prong necessarily excludes
governmental plans (both domestic and foreign) and should be read narrowly to include

only employee benefit plans “subject to” ERISA.” 628 However, one of these commenters
later independently submitted a comment after the CFTC adopted business conduct rules,
and expressed its support for an “opt in” approach. 629 This commenter asserted that the
special entity definition should be limited to employee benefit plans that are “subject to”
ERISA, although other employee benefit plans defined in ERISA, such as church plans,
should be allowed to opt in to special entity status. According to this commenter, these
modifications would harmonize the SEC and CFTC special entity definitions.
One commenter suggested treating plans subject to ERISA and government plans
subject to ERISA similarly, so long as both are acting as end-users and are otherwise
complying with their fiduciary obligations. 630 Another commenter suggested including
governmental plans as special entities, arguing that “the taxpayers and government
workers who stand behind government pensions are precisely the sort of constituents
Congress sought to protect through the heightened protections of special entities.” 631
More broadly, one commenter recommended that the business conduct standards
should only apply to certain governmental special entities, and that they should not apply
to ERISA plans – since these plans already have similar or greater protections under
ERISA. 632 The commenter argued that, by applying these standards to all special entities,
the SEC “has extended its regulatory reach significantly beyond the scope of the statute,”

203

resulting in “redundant” or “overlapping” regulations. 633 The commenter recommended
that the proposed rules be modified to exclude ERISA plans with security-based swap
advisors that are “already sufficiently regulated.” 634
iv.

Master Trusts

The Commission additionally requested comment regarding whether to include a
master trust that holds the assets of one or more funded plans of a single employer and its
affiliates within the special entity definition. Three commenters supported the treatment
of master trusts as special entities. 635
One comment letter suggested that the term “special entity” should be modified to
include master trusts holding the assets of one or more funded plans of a single
employer. 636 Another comment letter urged the Commission to clarify that master trusts
would be treated as special entities, noting that, by making this clarification, the SEC
would harmonize the interpretation of its rules with that of the CFTC. 637
One commenter urged the Commission to include church benefit boards that hold
the assets of multiple church plans, church endowments, and other church-related funds
on a commingled basis within the special entity definition, arguing that the functions of
church benefit boards are similar to those of tax-exempt trusts, or master trusts
established by several multiple-employer pension plans, and that such a definition would

reflect the close relationship – recognized in ERISA – between church benefit boards and
their constituent church plans. 638
v.

Collective Investment Vehicles

The Commission requested comment regarding whether to interpret “special
entity” to include a collective investment vehicle in which one or more special entities
had invested. All eight commenters that commented on this question opposed the
designation of collective investment vehicles as special entities, even where such
collective investment vehicles have special entity investors. 639
Commenters generally argued that requiring SBS Entities to investigate or “look
through” their collective investment vehicle counterparties to determine whether they
held special entity investments would create uncertainty in the market, increase
compliance costs, disrupt the gains of special entity investors, and restrict special entities’
access to security-based swaps – since collective investment vehicle managers may either
limit or reject investments by special entities to avoid limitations on their security-based
swap trading activities. 640
One commenter asked the Commission to clarify that it would not “look through”
collective investment vehicles to align its interpretation of the special entity definition
with that of the CFTC. 641

Two commenters argued to exclude collective investment vehicles because these
vehicles are almost always passive investors, and that including them within the adopted
rules would serve no regulatory purpose, since Congress’ intent was to protect special
entities as defined within the statute. 642
Lastly, two commenters urged the Commission to exclude hedge funds, even
where a special entity invests in that hedge fund. 643
vi.

Endowments

The Commission requested comment regarding how to apply the special entity
definition to endowments, and whether certain organizations that qualify as endowments
should be included in that definition. The five commenters addressing this issue
suggested that the Commission limit the definition of endowments in the special entity
context, with various caveats. 644
Three commenters suggested limiting the definition of “endowments” to
endowments that, themselves, enter into swaps. 645 Two of these commenters urged the
Commission to clarify that the term “endowments” would not include non-profit
organizations whose assets might include funds designated as an endowment, 646 while
another asked that the Commission exclude organizations that use endowment assets to

pledge, maintain, enhance or support the organization’s collateral obligations. 647 Another
commenter similarly requested that the Commission interpret the definition of
endowment to exclude charitable organizations that enter into security-based swaps for
which their counterparties have recourse to the organizations’ endowment. 648 The
commenter noted that, by making this clarification, the SEC would bring its interpretation
of the rules into harmony with that of the CFTC. 649
The last commenter requested clarification that private foundations would not be
included within the special entity definition. 650 The commenter argued that these
foundations are, by statute, non-profit organizations that are not publicly supported, and
that “no evidence” exists that Congress intended to treat private foundations as
“endowments” under Dodd-Frank. 651
Similarly, this same commenter suggested that “institutional investor
organizations” (such as large non-profits and “sophisticated” endowments) with over $1
billion of net assets under management should be excluded from the special entity
definition, since large “sophisticated” endowments employ professional money managers
already subject to oversight and review. 652 The commenter argued that a special entity
designation for these organizations could reduce the number of SBS Entities willing to

evaluating the qualifications of an independent representative.
vii.

Foreign Plans, Foreign Entities

The Commission requested comment on whether to exclude from the definition of
“special entity” any foreign entity. Six commenters responded to this issue. 653 All six
commenters asserted that foreign entities should not be deemed special entities, although
one commenter recommended that the U.S. reserve the right to extend application of its
business conduct standards to foreign entities if international regulatory efforts fail. 654
Four other commenters objected to the inclusion of foreign pension and employee
benefit plans within the special entity definition on the grounds that the statutory
language reflected a lack of Congressional intent to provide special protection for such
plans under Dodd-Frank, and that extending the SEC’s authority outside the United
States would create the potential for conflict with other nations’ regulatory regimes. 655

See Johnson, supra note 5. This same commenter argued that Congress limited
the territorial scope of Title VII to activities within the United States, and that
extraterritorial application of these laws should only apply when international
activities of U.S. firms have a “direct and significant connection with or effect on
U.S. commerce,” or are designed to evade U.S. rules. Id. For further discussion,

c.

Response to Comments and Final Rule

After consideration of all comments, the Commission has determined to modify
the scope of the special entity definition as described below.
i.

Federal Agency

As noted above, the Commission did not receive any comments on the inclusion
of federal agencies within the special entity definition. The Commission continues to
believe it is appropriate to include federal agencies within the special entity definition,
and is therefore adopting Rule 15Fh-2(e)(1) as proposed, renumbered as Rule 15Fh2(d)(1).
ii.

State and Municipal Special Entities

After further consideration and in light of the comment received, the Commission
is modifying proposed Rule 15Fh-2(e)(2), adopted as Rule 15Fh-2(d)(2), to further define
state and municipal entities to include “any instrumentality, department, or a corporation
of or established by a State or political subdivision of a State.” 657 As the Commission
explained in another context, states may delegate powers to their political subdivisions,
656

One commenter urged the Commission to only apply the business conduct
standards to security-based swap transactions involving U.S. counterparties. See
PensionsEurope, supra note 7, discussed in Section III below.

657

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5; and SIFMA (November 2015), supra
note 5 (asking the Commission to clarify that an instrumentality, department, or a
corporation of, or established by, a State or political subdivision of a State is a
special entity). This is consistent as well with the ECP definition for
governmental entities, which includes “an instrumentality, agency, or department”
of a State or political subdivision of a State. See Section 3(a)(65) of the Exchange
Act, referring to Section 1a(18)(A)(vii)(III) of the CEA.

209

including the power to create corporate instrumentalities. 658 Similarly, the Commission
believes a department or a corporation organized as a municipal corporate instrumentality
of a state’s political subdivision should be considered a municipal corporate
instrumentality of a state. Corporate instrumentalities, departments, or corporations
created by states or their political subdivisions are therefore taxpayer-backed institutions.
Consequently, the Commission believes it is important to include “any instrumentality,
department, or a corporation of or established by a State or political subdivision of a
State” within the special entity definition to provide heightened protections for taxpayerbacked institutions that transact in security-based swaps.
In addition, the inclusion of this language will conform the special entity
definition to that of a “municipal entity” in the Exchange Act, as well as to the CFTC’s
definition of State and municipal special entities, thereby providing all categories of
municipal entities with heightened protections, 659 as well as addressing the commenter’s
concern regarding the need for a consistent definition across the security-based swaps and
swaps markets. 660 This consistency should result in efficiencies for entities that transact
in security-based swaps, particularly where such entities have already established a
compliance infrastructure that satisfies the requirements of the existing CFTC business
conduct standards.

Employee Benefit Plans and Governmental Plans

658

See Municipal Advisor Registration Release, 78 FR at 67483, supra note 5.

659

See Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(8), 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(8) (defining “municipal
entity” to include “any agency, authority, or instrumentality of the States, political
subdivision, or municipal corporate entity”).

660

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5; and SIFMA (November 2015), supra
note 5.

210

Upon further consideration and in light of the comments received, the
Commission is modifying proposed Rule 15Fh-2(e)(3), which stated “any employee
benefit plan defined in Section 3 of [ERISA]” to state in adopted Rule 15Fh-2(d)(3) “any
employee benefit plan subject to Title I of [ERISA].” Under this modification, Rule
15Fh(2)(d)(3) only includes employee benefit plans that are subject to regulation under
Title I of ERISA. Furthermore, proposed Rule 15Fh-2(e)(4), renumbered as Rule 15Fh2(d)(5), is being adopted as proposed, to include “any governmental plan, as defined in
section 3(32) of [ERISA].”
In reaching this determination, we believe that Exchange Act Sections
15F(h)(2)(C)(iii) (employee benefit plans defined in Section 3 of ERISA) and
15F(h)(2)(C)(iv) (governmental plans defined in Section 3 of ERISA) should be read
together “to avoid rendering superfluous” any statutory language of the Exchange Act. 661
As discussed above in Section II.H.1.b.3, Exchange Act Section 15F(h)(2)(C)(iii), read
literally as any employee benefit plan “defined in” Section 3 of ERISA, would render
Section 15F(h)(2)(C)(iv) superfluous, since governmental plans “defined in” ERISA are
specifically designated as special entities under Section 15F(h)(2)(C)(iv). The
Commission therefore agrees with the commenter that Congress’ separate inclusion of
governmental plans within the special entity definition supports a narrower reading of
Section 15F(h)(2)(C)(iii), such that the definition only includes employee benefit plans
“subject to” regulation under ERISA. 662

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

211

We recognize that this interpretation of “special entity” would exclude other types
of employee benefit plans “defined in” Section 4(b) of ERISA, including church plans
and workmen’s compensation plans. Therefore, upon further consideration, and in
response to commenters who support a broader interpretation of the term “special entity,”
including those commenters who assert that a church plan should be treated as a special
entity, the Commission has determined to include an additional prong to the special entity
definition. 663 Specifically, Rule 15Fh-2(d)(4), as adopted, defines a special entity to
include “[a]ny employee benefit plan defined in Section 3 of [ERISA] and not otherwise
defined as a special entity, unless such employee benefit plan elects not to be a special
entity by notifying a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant
of its election prior to entering into a security-based swap with the particular securitybased swap dealer or major security-based swap participant.” The Commission believes
that the inclusion of this additional provision appropriately resolves any tension between
Exchange Act Sections 15F(h)(2)(C)(iii) and (iv), while granting broad coverage under
the enhanced business conduct protections for special entities provided by the Dodd
Frank Act.
Under Rule 15Fh-2(d)(4), as adopted, an employee benefit plan that is “defined
in” Section 3 of ERISA but not “subject to” regulation under ERISA is included within
the special entity definition, although it may elect to opt out of special entity status by
notifying an SBS Entity counterparty of its election to opt out prior to entering into a
security-based swap. Therefore, for example, under Rule 15Fh-2(d)(4), any church plan,
663

See Church Alliance (August 2011), supra note 5; CalPERS (August 2011), supra
note 5; Church Alliance (October 2011), supra note 5; SIFMA (August 2015),
supra note 5.

212

as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA, would be considered a special entity unless it
elected to opt out of special entity status. 664 It is also consistent with Rule 15Fh-3(a)(3),
which requires an SBS Entity to verify whether a counterparty is eligible to elect not to
be a special entity, and if so, to notify the counterparty of its right to make such an
election. 665 Further, by requiring employee benefit plans to notify SBS Entities of their
decision to opt out, the provision will provide SBS Entities greater clarity regarding their
counterparty’s election to be treated as a special entity, as requested by a commenter. 666
We note that the special entity definition the Commission is adopting today
differs from the CFTC’s special entity definition, which instead includes an opt-in
provision for plans “defined in” ERISA. 667 While we agree with the CFTC’s objective of
“providing protections broadly,” 668 we have determined that inclusion of an opt-out
provision will afford the maximum protections to the broadest categories of special
entities, while still allowing them the flexibility to elect not to be special entities when
they do not wish to avail themselves of those protections. In making this determination,
we acknowledge the commenter’s request that we conform our special entity definition
to that of the CFTC.. 669 However, we believe that the practical effect of an opt-out
versus an opt-in regime should be minimal since, in either case, the SBS Entity will need

to advise the counterparty of its option to be treated as a special entity. The result should
be greater clarity for SBS Entities regarding the regulatory status of their counterparties.
Lastly, we disagree with the commenter’s assertions that the SEC “has extended
its regulatory reach” beyond the statute by applying the business conduct rules to ERISA
plans, and that the resulting regulations would overlap with the preexisting regulations
established under ERISA. 670 As noted above, the plain language of Exchange Act
Section 15F(h)(2)(C)(iii) includes ERISA plans within the special entity definition, and
we continue to believe that such plans are deserving of the heightened protections of the
business conduct rules specific to special entities. Moreover, wherever practical, we have
adopted bifurcated rules that acknowledge the existing federal regulatory framework for
ERISA plans, thereby minimizing the tension that may arise between that framework and
the business conduct standards adopted today. 671
iv.

Master Trusts

The Commission agrees with commenters that master trusts should be treated as
special entities, where a master trust holds the assets of more than one ERISA plan,
sponsored by a single employer or by a group of employers under common control. 672 In
670

See ABC, supra note 5.

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5; Church Alliance (August 2011), supra note
5; SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5. See also Section 403(a) of ERISA (in
general, “assets of an employee benefit plan shall be held in trust by one or more
trustees”) (29 U.S.C. 1103(a)); DOL Regulation 29 CFR 2520.103-1(e) (requiring
the plan administrator of a Plan which participates in a master trust to file an
annual report on IRS Form 5500 in accordance with the instructions for the form
relating to master trusts); see also IRS Form 5500 Instructions, at 9 (“For
reporting purposes, a ‘master trust’ is a trust . . . in which the assets of more than
one plan sponsored by a single employer or by a group of employers under
common control are held.”).

214

this regard, the Commission clarifies that, if a master trust holds the assets of an ERISA
plan, the SBS Entity may satisfy the business conduct requirements being adopted today
by treating the master trust as a special entity, rather than applying the business conduct
rules to each underlying ERISA plan in a master trust. The Commission understands that
a single employer or a group of employers under common control may sponsor multiple
ERISA plans that are combined into a master trust to achieve economies of scale and
other efficiencies. In such cases, the Commission does not believe that any individual
ERISA plan within the master trust would receive any additional protection if the SBS
Dealer or Major SBS Participant had to separately comply with the final rules with
respect to each ERISA plan whose assets are held in the master trust.
The Commission similarly agrees with the commenter that, where a church
benefit board holds the assets of multiple church plans as defined in Section 3(33) of
ERISA, the function of the church benefit board is similar to that of a master trust. 673
Because church plans are recognized in ERISA, and a church benefit board holds only
the assets of constituent church plans, 674 a church benefit board that holds the assets of
church plans will be deemed a special entity under final Rule 15Fh-2(d)(4), although it
will have the ability to opt out of special entity protections.
Lastly, this clarification addresses the commenter’s request that the Commission
interpret the special entity definition in harmony with the CFTC, as the CFTC also
includes master trusts as special entities where a master trust holds the assets of more
than one ERISA plan, sponsored by a single employer or by a group of employers under

215

common control. 675 Such uniformity will help establish regulatory consistency across the
security-based swap and swap markets, thereby creating efficiencies for SBS entities that
transact in security-based swaps and swaps.
v.

Collective Investment Vehicles

The Commission requested comment on whether to interpret “special entity” to
include collective investment vehicles in which one or more special entities had invested.
After consideration of the comments, the Commission has determined not to interpret
“special entity” in that way. The Commission agrees with commenters that uniformly
urged the Commission not to treat a collective investment vehicle as a special entity,
solely because the collective investment vehicle may have one or more special entity
investors. 676
Unlike master trusts, formed for the purpose of holding assets of ERISA plans, a
collective investment vehicle may be formed for a variety of reasons and only
incidentally accept investments from special entities. We share the concerns of
commenters that requiring SBS Entities to investigate or “look through” their collective
investment vehicle counterparties to determine whether they held special entity

clarification, and in response to commenters, the term “collective investment
vehicle” in our discussion includes, but is not limited to, hedge funds that hold the
assets of special entity investors. See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5;
BlackRock, supra note 5.

216

investments could create uncertainty in the market, and could potentially increase
compliance costs, disrupt the gains of special entity investors, and restrict special entities’
access to security-based swaps – since collective investment vehicle managers may either
limit or reject investments by special entities to avoid application of the special entity
requirements. 677
At the same time, we recognize the potential benefits of applying heightened
protections to special entities that have invested in collective investment vehicles, either
by applying those protections to the collective investment vehicle itself or requiring the
SBS Entity to “look through” the collective investment vehicle. After further
consideration, we have determined that it would neither be appropriate to treat the entire
collective investment vehicle as a special entity, nor to require an SBS Dealer to “look
through” the collective investment vehicle to determine whether any of its investors
qualify as special entities. While the special entity has made the decision to invest in the
collective investment vehicle, it is the collective investment vehicle that enters into the
security-based swap – not the special entity. In light of the foregoing, we do not believe
that collective investment vehicles should be included within the special entity definition.
Lastly, our decision not to include collective investment vehicles in the special
entity definition will address the commenter’s suggestion that we harmonize the
Commission’s special entity definition with that of the CFTC to increase regulatory
consistency across the security-based swap and swap markets. 678

Endowments, Non-Profit Organizations, and
Private Foundations

The Commission requested comment regarding application of the special entity
definition to endowments. After taking into consideration the comments, the
Commission has determined to interpret the term “endowment,” as used in Section
15F(h)(2)(C)(v) of the Exchange Act, not to include entities or persons other than the
endowment itself. The Commission therefore agrees with commenters that special entity
status should be limited to endowments that are, themselves, counterparties to securitybased swaps. 679 Accordingly, the Commission does not interpret the term “endowment”
to include organizations that use endowment assets to pledge, maintain, enhance or
support the organization’s collateral obligations, or situations where a counterparty has
recourse to the organization’s endowment. 680
For clarification, and in response to comment, 681 a private foundation will be
subject to special entity protections where the private foundation qualifies as an
endowment under applicable state laws, rules, or regulations, including the
Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act. Although we acknowledge the
commenter’s assertion that private foundations typically derive their financial support
through private donations, 682 we do not agree that public funding is a prerequisite to
special entity status, or that private funding should necessarily exclude a foundation from
qualifying for special entity status.

218

As noted above in Section II.G.1.b, Rule 15Fh-3(a)(2) generally requires an SBS
Entity to verify whether its counterparty is a special entity before entering into the
security-based swap with that counterparty. Such verification should generally include a
determination whether the counterparty may be deemed an endowment under applicable
state law, as described above. However, as discussed in Section II.G.1.b, supra,
counterparties may make representations about their status as special entities at the outset
of a relationship with an SBS Entity, and can “bring down” that representation for each
relevant action involving a security-based swap.
Also, as with collective investment vehicles, we believe that a more expansive
interpretation of the special entity definition would require a burdensome “look through”
process to determine whether endowment funds had, for instance, been invested or used
as collateral in a particular security-based swap, and could ultimately restrict the ability
of entities that are neither themselves endowments nor special entities (such as
organizations described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 whose
assets merely include funds designated as an endowment) to transact in security-based
swaps.
By making the foregoing clarifications, the Commission more closely aligns its
interpretation of the term “endowment” with that of the CFTC. 683 This consistency in the

683

See CFTC Adopting Release, 77 FR at 9776, supra note 21 (“The Commission
agrees with commenters that the Special Entity prong with respect to endowments
is limited to the endowment itself. Therefore, the endowment prong of the
Special Entity definition under Section 4s(h)(2)(C)(v) and § 23.401(c)(5) applies
with respect to an endowment that is the counterparty to a swap with respect to its
investment funds. The definition would not extend to charitable organizations
generally. Additionally, where a charitable organization enters into a swap as a
counterparty, the Special Entity definition would not apply where the

219

definition will address the commenter’s concern regarding the need to promote regulatory
clarity, and result in operational efficiencies for entities that have been operating under
the CFTC’s business conduct regime since 2012. 684
Lastly, as discussed in more detail above in Section II.A.2.d., we decline the
commenter’s suggestion to permit endowments to opt out of special entity status. 685 As
stated in the Proposing Release, Congress created heightened protections to mitigate the
potential for abuse in SBS transactions with special entities, as the financial
sophistication of special entities varies greatly. 686 As discussed above in Section II.A, the
rules being adopted today are intended to provide certain protections for counterparties,
including certain heightened protections for special entities. We think it is appropriate to
apply the rules so that counterparties receive the benefits of those protections and do not
think it is appropriate to permit parties to “opt out” of those provisions. Furthermore, we
note that the CFTC’s adopted rules do not contain such an opt-out provision, and that
Swap Entities and their special entity counterparties have been operating under this
regime since 2012. For all of the foregoing reasons, and to achieve regulatory
consistency across the security-based swap and swap markets, we decline to adopt an optout provision for endowments in the final rules.

The Commission requested comment on whether to exclude from the definition of
“special entity” any foreign entity. After considering the comments, all of which asserted
that foreign entities should not be deemed special entities, the Commission is declining to
include foreign entities within the definition of “special entity.” The Commission
believes that, as stated in the Cross-Border Adopting Release, the term “special entity”
applies to “legal persons organized under the laws of the United States.” 687 This reading
addresses the concerns raised by commenters regarding the need for clarification
concerning the application of the rules as they relate to special entity-specific
provisions. 688

“Acts as an Advisor” to a Special Entity
a.

Proposed Rule

As discussed below in Section II.H.3, Section 15F(h)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act
imposes a duty on an SBS Dealer acting “as an advisor” to a special entity to act in the
best interests of the special entity. 689 The Dodd-Frank Act does not define the term

687

See Application of “Security-Based Swap Dealer” and “Major Security-Based
Swap Participant” Definitions to Cross-Border Security-Based Swap Activities;
Final Rule; Republication, 79 FR 47278, 47306 n.234 (Aug. 12, 2014)
(“Consistent with the proposal, ‘special entities,’ as defined in Section
15F(h)(2)(C) of the Exchange Act, are U.S. persons because they are legal
persons organized under the laws of the United States”).

688

See ABC, supra note 5; SIFMA (August 2011), supra note 5; BlackRock, supra
note 5. For a more detailed discussion on the cross-border application of U.S.
business conduct standards, see Section III, infra.

689

Under proposed Rule 15Fh-4(b), an SBS Dealer that “acts as an advisor” to a
special entity regarding a security-based swap must: (1) act in the best interests of
the special entity; and (2) make reasonable efforts to obtain such information that
the SBS Dealer considers necessary to make a reasonable determination that a
security-based swap or trading strategy involving a security-based swap is in the
best interests of the special entity. See Section II.H.3, infra.

221

“advisor,” nor does it establish specific criteria for determining when an SBS Dealer is
acting as an advisor within the meaning of Section 15F(h)(4).
The Commission proposed Rule 15Fh-2(a), which states that an SBS Dealer “acts
as an advisor to a special entity when it recommends a security-based swap or a trading
strategy that involves the use of a security-based swap to the special entity.” We
explained in the Proposing Release that, for these purposes, to “recommend” has the
same meaning as that discussed in connection with Rule 15Fh-3(f). 690
While the Dodd-Frank Act does not preclude an SBS Dealer from acting as both
advisor and counterparty, the Commission recognized in the Proposing Release that it
could be impracticable for an SBS Dealer acting as a counterparty to a special entity to
meet the “best interests” standard imposed by Section 15F(h)(4) if it were deemed to be
acting as an advisor to the special entity. 691 Proposed Rule 15Fh-2(a) would therefore
provide a three-pronged safe harbor for an SBS Dealer to establish that it is not acting as
an advisor. To qualify for the safe harbor, the SBS Dealer’s special entity counterparty
must first represent in writing that it will not rely on the SBS Dealer’s recommendations,
but that it will instead rely on advice from a “qualified independent representative.” 692
Second, the SBS Dealer must have a “reasonable basis” to conclude that the special entity
is being advised by a qualified independent representative. 693 Toward this end, the SBS
Dealer could rely on the special entity’s written representations unless the SBS Dealer
has information that would cause a reasonable person to question the accuracy of the

15F(h)(4). 695
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission received numerous comments in response to the definition of
“acts as an advisor” to a special entity in proposed Rule 15Fh-2(a). One commenter
asserted that the meaning of the phrase “acts as an advisor to a special entity” was critical
to several regulatory rulemakings, and that this term should be applied as consistently as
possible. 696 That commenter and another recommended that, in developing
recommendations for the final rules, the Commission staff coordinate with the
Commission staff working on rules regarding municipal advisors, as well as the MSRB
and the CFTC. 697 The commenter urged the Commission to work with the CFTC and the
MSRB to make the definition as consistent as possible across regulatory regimes.
However, the majority of comment letters addressing proposed Rule 15Fh-2(a)
related to: (1) the use of the term “recommends” when defining the phrase “acts as an
advisor to a special entity;” and (2) the safe harbor from acting as an advisor to a special
entity set forth in proposed Rule 15Fh-2(a)(1) – (3). These comments are summarized
below.

Eight comment letters addressed whether an SBS Dealer should be deemed to act
as an advisor if it “recommends” a security-based swap or trading strategy to a special
entity. 698
One commenter argued that the definition of “acting as an advisor” was too
narrow, and should be expanded to include not only making recommendations, but also
providing “more general information and opinions.” 699 That commenter and another
recommended that the definition of “act as an advisor” should parallel that of an
“investment adviser,” such that the definition would encompass advising special entities
as to the value of a security-based swap or as to the advisability of a security-based swap
or trading strategies involving security-based swaps. 700 The second commenter asserted
that this definition would more closely conform the definition of “act as an advisor” to
the definition of “investment adviser” under the Advisers Act, as well as to the definition
of “commodity trading advisor” under the CEA, while preserving the benefits of the
Commission’s proposed safe harbor. 701
A third commenter generally supported our proposed approach, noting that
“defining recommendations as advice is consistent . . . with congressional intent.” 702 The

commenter, however, would narrow the definition of advice to “recommendations related
to a security-based swap or a security-based swap trading strategy that are made to meet
the objectives or needs of a specific counterparty after taking into account the
counterparty’s specific circumstances.” 703 Another commenter suggested that the term
“recommendation” exclude communications to groups of customers or to investment
managers with multiple clients, unless the communication was tailored to a member of
the group or to a specific client known to the SBS Dealer. 704 According to the
commenter, the Commission should clarify that a recommendation must be tailored to the
circumstances of a known special-entity counterparty before giving rise to advisor status,
because, without this clarification, general communications to investment advisers (that
potentially have special entity clients) might result in the SBS Dealer unknowingly
“acting as an advisor.” 705 In 2015, after the CFTC adopted its final business conduct
rules, a commenter similarly proposed that the Commission narrow the scope of the
definition of “act as an advisor to a special entity” to include only recommendations that
are “tailored to the particular needs or characteristics of the special entity.” 706
Another commenter argued that a definition premised on an SBS Dealer’s
“recommend[ing]” a security-based swap or related trading strategy was “overly broad
and unwise,” and that acting as an advisor “requires a more formal, acknowledged

addition, the commenter argued that this modification would align the definition
with applicable guidance under the Advisers Act.

225

agency, as part of a relationship of trust and confidence.” 707 This commenter expressed
concern that a definition based on recommendations could chill communications,
including informal “market chatter.” 708 Two other commenters similarly urged the
Commission to adopt a bright line, objective standard, where an explicit agreement by the
parties would determine whether the SBS Dealer acts as advisor to the special entity. 709
Under this approach, unless the special entity and SBS Dealer agree that information
provided by the SBS Dealer would form the primary basis for an investment decision, the
SBS Dealer’s communications would not be considered a “recommendation” under
proposed Rule 15Fh-2(a). 710
Several commenters requested that the Commission clarify whether certain
communications constitute “acting as an advisor.” One commenter was concerned that
an SBS Dealer could provide a counterparty with data, analysis, and opinions that
constituted recommendations in fact, but were not labeled or characterized as such. 711 A
second commenter suggested the Commission clarify that the phrase “acting as an
advisor” does not include providing general transaction, financial or market information
to the special entity. 712 A third commenter recommended the final rule clarify that an
SBS Dealer’s “customary product explanations and marketing activities, provision of

requirements in the business conduct rules would not constitute ‘acting as an advisor’ to a
special entity.” 713
ii.

Safe Harbor

The Commission received a number of comment letters on the proposed rule’s
safe harbor provisions. Ten comment letters generally supported the safe harbor, subject
to various suggestions or objections. 714 Three commenters objected to the safe harbor. 715
Commenters supporting the adoption of safe harbor provisions that would protect
an SBS Dealer from being deemed an advisor to a special entity, argued that market
participants would benefit from greater certainty provided by the safe harbor, which
would enable contracting parties to specify the nature of their relationship. 716
A number of commenters, however, expressed concern about the possible
interaction of the proposed safe harbor with ERISA. One commenter, for example,
generally agreed with the proposed safe harbor but expressed concern that requiring
an SBS Dealer to have a “reasonable basis” to believe a special entity was being
advised by a qualified independent representative could allow the SBS Dealer’s
opinion of an ERISA plan representative to “trump” that of the ERISA plan

fiduciary. 717 For these reasons, the commenter urged the Commission to prohibit an
SBS Dealer that acts as a counterparty to an ERISA plan from vetoing the plan’s
choice of representative. 718
Another commenter suggested the proposed safe harbor be revised to provide that
either: (1) the special entity will rely on advice from a qualified independent
representative, or (2) if the special entity or its representative is relying on the Qualified
Professional Asset Manager (“QPAM”) or In-House Asset Manager (“INHAM”)
Exemption, the decision to enter into the transaction will be made by a QPAM or
INHAM. 719 One commenter expressed concern with the proposed safe harbor’s
requirement that the special entity represent it is not “relying” on recommendations from
the SBS Dealer. 720 As the commenter explained, since reliance is one of the essential

717

See ABC, supra note 5. The commenter expressed concern that such a veto
power could render the Department of Labor’s Prohibited Transaction Class
Exemption 84-14 for Qualified Professional Asset Managers (“QPAMs”)
unavailable, and make ERISA plan representatives hesitant to vigilantly represent
the plan’s interests for fear of a future veto. The commenter also argued that,
through this same provision, an SBS Dealer acting as an ERISA plan counterparty
could learn confidential information regarding the plan or its representative.

Id.

719

See BlackRock, supra note 5. Section 406(a) of ERISA generally prohibits the
fiduciary of a plan from causing the plan to engage in various transactions with a
“party in interest” (as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA), unless a statutory or
administrative exemption applies to the transaction. Prohibited Transaction
Exemption 84-14 (the “QPAM Exemption”), an administrative exemption,
permits certain parties in interest to engage in transactions involving plan assets
if, among other conditions, the assets are managed by a “qualified professional
asset manager” (QPAM), which is independent of the parties in interest.
Prohibited Transaction Exemption 96-23 (the “INHAM Exemption”)provides
similar conditional prohibited transaction relief for certain transactions involving
plan assets that are managed by an in-house asset management affiliate of a plan
sponsor.

elements of a securities fraud action, an SBS Dealer could seek to rely on the special
entity’s representation that it did not “rely” on the SBS Dealer’s recommendation in
defense of a subsequent securities fraud action against the SBS Dealer. 721 Instead, the
commenter suggested “as a purely technical matter” that the safe harbor instead require a
special entity to acknowledge that the SBS Dealer is not acting as advisor to the special
entity. 722
In August 2015, another commenter suggested modifying the proposed rule to
harmonize with the CFTC’s approach by creating a second separate safe harbor for
employee benefit plans subject to Title I of ERISA that “recognizes the unique fiduciary
regime already applicable to such special entities.” 723 In addition to recommending a
safe harbor for ERISA plans, the commenter requested two changes to the non-ERISA
safe harbor: (1) adding a requirement that an SBS Dealer may not express an opinion as
to whether a special entity should enter into the recommended security-based swap or
related trading strategy; and (2) eliminating the safe harbor condition that an SBS Dealer
have a reasonable basis to believe that the special entity is advised by a qualified
independent representative. 724 The commenter noted that the “reasonable basis”
provision is absent from the parallel CFTC business conduct rule, and argued that the
provision is unnecessary in light of the fact that the SBS Dealer will already receive a
written representation that the special entity will rely on advice from the independent

representative. 725 The commenter explained that its suggested modifications were
generally intended to bring the Commission’s safe harbor provisions into conformity with
those of the CFTC. 726 The same commenter subsequently urged the Commission to
either (i) permit SBS Entities to reasonably rely on written representations that satisfy the
CFTC’s safe harbor, or (ii) adopt a parallel safe harbor. 727
Three commenters opposed the proposed safe harbor, arguing that it would erode
the statutory protections for special entities. For instance, one commenter argued that the
safe harbor would effectively allow SBS Dealers to give advice that might not be in the
best interests of the special entity. 728 A second commenter opposed the safe harbor on
the grounds that it would cause special entities to waive their right to “best interest”
recommendations as a condition of transacting with SBS Dealers, and force them to rely
solely on an independent representative that might be “financially beholden to the
security-based swap industry.” 729 The commenter also expressed concern that “in any
transaction involving a customized swap, the special entity will by definition be relying
on the swap dealer’s assertion that the customization was designed with the particular
needs of the special entity in mind,” and if the SBS Dealer knows or has reason to know
that the swap is not in the best interests of the special entity, the SBS Dealer “should be

precluded from doing the transaction regardless of what representations the special entity
provides about who it may be relying on.” 730
Similarly, a third commenter characterized the safe harbor as permitting “an SBS
Dealer to escape the critical responsibilities associated with ‘acting as an advisor’ by
having Special Entities waive this right,” and expressed concern that special entities
would be forced to sign “boilerplate” waivers to enter into a security-based swap. 731

Response to Comments and Final Rule

As stated above, proposed Rule15Fh-2(a) defined what it means for an SBS
Dealer to act as an advisor to a special entity, and proposed Rule 15Fh-4 imposed certain
requirements on SBS Dealers acting as advisors. Thus, the proposed rules would not
impose these obligations on Major SBS Participants. 732 One commenter stated its view
that it is appropriate to impose Rule 15Fh-4(b)’s heightened standards of conduct on
professional market participants that are likely to be acting as advisors to special
entities, 733 and another commenter stated that the “dealer-like obligations” of Rule 15Fh4(b) should not be imposed on Major SBS Participants, transacting at arm’s-length, as
they will not likely advise special entities with respect to security-based swap

Although Section 15F(h)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act generally requires all SBS
Entities to comply with the requirements of Section 15F(h)(4), the specific
requirements of Sections 15F(h)(4)(B) and (C), by their terms, apply only to SBS
Dealers that act as advisors to special entities.

transactions. 734 The Commission continues to believe that it is appropriate not to impose
the heightened obligations when acting as an advisor to a special entity on Major SBS
Participants, given the nature of their participation in the security-based swap markets. 735
However, if a Major SBS Participant is, in fact, recommending security-based swaps or
trading strategies involving security-based swaps to a special entity, this could indicate
that the Major SBS Participant is actually engaged in security-based swap dealing
activity. 736 A Major SBS Participant that engages in such activity above the de minimis
threshold in Exchange Act Rule 3a71-2 would need to register as an SBS Dealer and
comply with the obligations imposed on SBS Dealers, including the obligations imposed
by Rule 15Fh-4(b) when an SBS Dealer is acting as an advisor to a special entity.
Upon review and consideration of the comments, the Commission is adopting
Rule 15Fh-2(a) as described below.
i.

“Recommends” an SBS or Related Trading
Strategy to a Special Entity

We are adopting, as proposed, Rule 15Fh-2(a), under which an SBS Dealer is
defined to “act as an advisor to a special entity” when it recommends a security-based

734

See MFA, supra note 5.

735

Dealers but not to Major SBS Participants).

structuring security-based swaps on behalf of a counterparty, also would indicate
security-based swap dealing activity.”).

232

swap or a trading strategy that involves a security-based swap to a special entity. 737 For
these purposes, to “recommend” has the same meaning as discussed in connection with
Rule 15Fh-3(f). 738 The determination of whether an SBS Dealer has made a
“recommendation” turns on the facts and circumstances of the particular situation and,
therefore, whether a recommendation has taken place is not susceptible to a bright line
definition. 739
The Commission is not expanding the definition of “recommendation” to
encompass “more general information and opinions,” as suggested by a commenter. 740
Such a broad definition could have the unintended consequence of chilling commercial
communications, restricting customary commercial interactions, and generally reducing
market information shared with special entities regarding security-based swaps. 741 As we
discussed in Section II.G.4, the Commission continues to believe that the meaning of the
term “recommendation” is well-established and familiar to intermediaries in the financial
services industry, including broker-dealers that rely on institutional suitability
determinations, and we believe that the same meaning should be ascribed to the term in
this context.

737

Although we are adopting Rule 15Fh-2(a), as proposed, we are adopting the safe
harbor under proposed rule 15Fh-2(a)(1)-(3) with various modifications, as
discussed in Section II.H.2.c.ii, infra.

738

See Section II.G.4, infra.

739

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42415, supra note 3. As discussed in Section
II.G.4, supra, this is consistent with the FINRA approach as to what constitutes a
recommendation.

740

See Better Markets (August 2011), supra note 5.

741

See, e.g., Ropes & Gray, supra, note 5.

233

As explained in Section II.G.4, the factors considered in determining whether a
recommendation has taken place include whether the communication “reasonably could
be viewed as a ‘call to action’” and “reasonably would influence an investor to trade a
particular security or group of securities.” 742 The more individually tailored the
communication to a specific customer or a targeted group of customers about a security
or group of securities, the greater the likelihood that the communication may be viewed
as a “recommendation.” 743 Thus, in response to commenters’ requests for clarification,
an SBS Dealer typically would not be making a recommendation – and would therefore
not be “acting as an advisor” to a special entity with a duty to act in the “best interests” of
a special entity – solely by reason of providing general financial or market information or
transaction terms in response to a request for competitive bids. 744 Furthermore, provision
of information pursuant to the requirements of the business conduct rules will not, in and
of itself, result in an SBS Dealer being viewed as making a “recommendation,” as
suggested by one commenter. 745 Rather, as stated above, the determination of whether
providing information about the valuation of a security-based swap, or concerning the
advisability of a security-based swap or a trading strategy, involving a security-based
swap constitutes a “recommendation” turns on the particular facts and circumstances.
To avoid unnecessarily narrowing the definition of “recommendation,” we decline
to limit the definition of “act as an advisor” to recommendations that are designed to

meet the needs of a specific counterparty after taking into account the counterparty’s
individual circumstances. 746 We also decline to exclude from the definition of
“recommendation” communications to groups of customers or to investment managers
with multiple clients. 747 We believe that such an exclusion could unnecessarily deprive
groups or special entity investors of the intended protections of the rules when there are
communications regarding a particular security-based swap or trading strategy to a
targeted group of special entities that share common characteristics, e.g., school districts.
As stated above, such communications should be evaluated based on whether, in light of
all the facts and circumstances, the communications could “reasonably could be viewed
as a ‘call to action’” and “reasonably would influence an investor to trade a particular
security or group of securities.” 748 We also note that the number of recipients of a given
communication does not necessarily change the characteristics of the communication.
Furthermore, we are not limiting the definition of “act as an advisor” to a special
entity to situations in which parties affirmatively contract or otherwise establish “more
formal, acknowledged agency relationships that are part of a relationship of trust and
confidence” 749 We believe this could limit the scope of the obligations and
corresponding protections for special entities when an SBS Dealer “acts as an advisor” in
a manner that is not consistent with the intended objectives of the rule. In short, the rule

235

could be stripped of its intended protections if those protections only applied when the
regulated entity agreed to be regulated. 750
For the same reason, SBS Dealers may not avoid making a “recommendation” as
defined in this context through disclaimer, or simply by not characterizing or labeling a
recommendation as such. 751 An interpretation that would permit an SBS Dealer to
disclaim its “best interests” duty, irrespective of the SBS Dealer’s conduct, could
essentially relieve SBS Dealers of their obligations and deprive special entities of the
corresponding protections intended by Rule 15Fh-4. Rather than require the affirmative
agreement of the parties to establish an advisory relationship, we are providing a safe
harbor, as described in Section II.H.2.c.ii, infra, by which the parties can agree that an
SBS Dealer is not “acting as an advisor” to a special entity where certain conditions are
met – specifically, where the special entity agrees to rely on the advice of an ERISA
fiduciary or other qualified, independent representative with respect to a security-based
swap transaction.
We reject the commenters’ suggestion that we conform the definition of an SBS
Dealer that “acts as an advisor” to a special entity to the definition of “investment
adviser” under the Advisers Act, or to the definition of “commodity trading advisor”
under the CEA. 752 We do not agree that either definition is necessarily tailored to the
specific attributes of security-based swap transactions or the unique relationships between
SBS Dealers and their special entity counterparties; therefore we believe that those

The CFTC has taken the same approach in its treatment of swap dealers. See

definitions would not necessarily provide special entities that trade in security-based
swaps with the protections the business conduct rules are intended to provide.
The Commission continues to believe that the duties imposed on an SBS Dealer
that “acts as an advisor” (as well as the definition of “act as an advisor” under Rule 15Fh2(a)) are supplemental to any duties that may be imposed under other applicable law. 753
In particular, we acknowledge the commenter’s suggestion that the Commission
coordinate with the MSRB regarding the definition of “acts as an advisor.” 754 As
explained in Section I.E, supra, we have adopted rules that provide an exemption from
“municipal advisor” status for persons providing advice with respect to municipal
financial products or the issuance of municipal securities where certain conditions are
met, such as where the municipal entity is represented by an independent registered
municipal advisor. 755 More generally, as discussed in Section I.E, supra, the duties
imposed on an SBS Dealer under the business conduct rules are specific to this context,
and are in addition to any duties that may be imposed under other applicable law. Thus,
an SBS Dealer must separately determine whether it is subject to regulation as a brokerdealer, an investment adviser, a municipal advisor or other regulated entity.
Lastly, the Commission considered and agrees with the comment that the
definition of “acting as an advisor” to a special entity should be applied as consistently as
possible across various rulemakings, and that the Commission should coordinate with the

753

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42424, supra note 13.

754

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5

237

CFTC with respect to this definition. 756 As noted in Section I.C, the staffs of the
Commission and the CFTC extensively coordinated and consulted in connection with
their respective rulemakings in an effort to establish a consistent rule regime across the
swap and security-based swap markets. These efforts are reflected in the rules adopted
today.
We note that the Commission’s definition of “acts as an advisor” to a special
entity under Rule 15Fh-2(a) differs slightly from the CFTC’s parallel rule, under which a
swap dealer is deemed to be an advisor when it “recommends a swap or trading strategy
involving a swap that is tailored to the particular needs or characteristics of the Special
Entity.” 757 While we agree that the more individually tailored the communication to a
specific counterparty or a targeted group of counterparties about a swap, group of swaps
or trading strategy involving the use of a swap, the greater the likelihood that the
communication may be viewed as a “recommendation,” we do not agree that a securitybased swap communication must be so tailored to constitute a recommendation for
purposes of Rule 15Fh-2(a). In adopting this more expansive definition of “acts as an
advisor” to a special entity, the Commission believes that it will better provide the
intended protections of the statute to groups of special entity investors that may be treated
similarly by SBS Dealers, such as school districts.
ii.

Safe Harbor

After the Commission issued the Proposing Release, the CFTC adopted final rules
that provide two safe harbors from the definition of “acts as an advisor to a special
756

See NABL, supra note 5; FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5

757

17 CFR 23.440(a).

238

entity.” The first provides a safe harbor for communications between a swap dealer and
an ERISA plan that has an ERISA fiduciary, and the second provides a safe harbor for
communications between a swap dealer and any special entity (including a special entity
that is an ERISA plan). Qualifying for either safe harbor requires specified
representations in writing by the swap dealer and special entity. In response to requests
from commenters, and upon further consideration, we are adopting an approach that
similarly recognizes the use of ERISA fiduciaries by ERISA plans, thereby avoiding the
potential conflict or confusion that may result where the existing ERISA rules intersect
with the business conduct rules adopted today. 758
In adopting a separate safe harbor for ERISA plans, we recognize that Congress
has already established a comprehensive federal regulatory framework for ERISA plans.
Such recognition of the existing federal regulatory framework for ERISA plans maintains
statutory protections for ERISA plans, while addressing the potential conflict, recognized
by commenters, between the ERISA rules and the business conduct standards we are
adopting today. 759 Lastly, in adopting a bifurcated approach that provides a safe harbor
specifically for ERISA plans and another that is available with respect to all special
entities, we are responding to the commenter’s request that we more closely align the
Commission’s rules with those of the CFTC to promote regulatory consistency and

note 5.

operational efficiency for entities that have been operating under the CFTC’s business
conduct regime since 2012. 760
Under Rule 15Fh-2(a)(1), as adopted, an SBS Dealer may establish that it is not
acting as an advisor to a special entity that is an ERISA plan if the special entity is
represented by a qualified independent representative that meets the standard for an
ERISA fiduciary. Specifically, the rule provides that an SBS Dealer will not be acting as
an advisor to an ERISA special entity if: (i) the ERISA plan represents in writing that it
has an ERISA fiduciary; (ii) the ERISA fiduciary represents in writing that it
acknowledges that the SBS Dealer is not acting as an advisor; and (iii) the ERISA plan
represents in writing that: (A) it will comply in good faith with written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to ensure that any recommendation the special entity
receives from the SBS Dealer involving a security-based swap transaction is evaluated by
an ERISA fiduciary before the transaction is entered into; or (B) any recommendation the
special entity receives from the SBS Dealer involving a security-based swap transaction
will be evaluated by an ERISA fiduciary before that transaction is entered into.
Allowing the ERISA plan to either make written representations about its policies
and procedures or represent in writing that the security-based swap transaction will be
evaluated by an ERISA fiduciary provides the ERISA plan greater flexibility in
structuring its relationship with the SBS Dealer. Moreover, these requirements, taken
together, are designed to ensure that the ERISA fiduciary, not the SBS Dealer, is
evaluating the security-based swap transaction on behalf of the ERISA plan. As an

FR at 9784, n. 701, supra note 22.

240

ERISA fiduciary is already required by statute to, among other things, act with prudence
and loyalty when evaluating a transaction for an ERISA plan, 761 the Commission believes
it is appropriate to provide the safe harbor for when an SBS Dealer would not be deemed
to be acting as an advisor to the ERISA plan for purposes of this rule.
Under Rule 15Fh-2(a)(2), as adopted, an SBS Dealer can establish it is not acting
as an advisor to any special entity (including a special entity that is an ERISA plan) when
the special entity is relying on advice from a qualified independent representative that
satisfies specific criteria. An SBS Dealer will not be “acting as an advisor” to any special
entity (including a special entity that is an ERISA plan) if: (i) the special entity represents
in writing that it acknowledges that the SBS Dealer is not acting as an advisor, and that
the special entity will rely on advice from a qualified independent representative; and (ii)
the SBS Dealer discloses that it is not undertaking to act in the best interests of the
special entity. 762
In adopting the safe harbor, the Commission agrees with commenters that the
provisions in Rule 15Fh-2(a)(1)-(2) will reduce uncertainty regarding the role of an SBS
Dealer when transacting with a special entity. 763 Requiring special entities (or their
761

ERISA fiduciaries are required to act with both loyalty (see Section 404(a)(1)(A))
and prudence (see Section 404(a)(1)(B)) when evaluating a transaction for an
ERISA plan. In addition, ERISA fiduciaries are subject to statutory prohibitions
against entering into certain categories of transactions between a plan and a “party
in interest” (see Section 406(a)), and prohibitions against self-dealing and other
conflicts of interest (see Section 406(b)). See supra note 38.

762

However, as noted above in Section II.G.4.c.ii, an SBS Dealer that makes a
recommendation to a special entity will still need to have a reasonable basis to
believe that a recommended security-based swap or trading strategy involving a
security-based swap is suitable for the special entity.

241

fiduciaries) to affirm in writing that they acknowledge the SBS Dealer is not acting as an
advisor, and that they will instead obtain advice from a qualified independent
representative, will help ensure that the parties are aware of their respective rights and
obligations regarding a security-based swap transaction. While our rules would permit an
SBS Dealer to rely on the special entity’s (or its fiduciary’s) written representations, the
SBS Dealer’s reliance must still be reasonable, as required under Rule 15Fh-1(b).
Specifically, the SBS Dealer may not rely on a representation if the SBS Dealer has
information that would cause a reasonable person to question the accuracy of the
representation. 764 The requirement that a special entity or its fiduciary represents in
writing that it acknowledges the SBS Dealer is not acting as an advisor differs from the
proposed safe harbor, which would have required the special entity to represent that it
would not rely on the SBS Dealer’s recommendations. The Commission is making this
change in response to a commenter’s concern. 765 The Commission does not intend to
affect the rights of parties in private actions.
The safe harbor under 15Fh-2(a)(2), as adopted, also differs from the proposed
rule, which would have required that an SBS Dealer must have a reasonable basis to
believe that the special entity is advised by a qualified independent representative.
Rather, under adopted Rule 15Fh-2(a)(2)(i), the safe harbor requires written
representations from the special entity that it will rely on advice from a qualified

764

Rule 15Fh-1(b).

765

242

independent representative. 766 The Commission agrees with the commenter that
requiring special entities to make representations to SBS Dealers in writing that they are
relying on advice from a qualified independent representatives addresses the proposed
rule’s underlying policy concern – i.e., that the special entity is represented by a qualified
independent representative. 767 Moreover, we believe that requiring special entities to
effectively confirm that they have qualified independent representatives addresses the
commenter’s concern that the proposed rule would allow SBS Dealers to evaluate the
qualifications of a special entity’s independent representative and vest SBS Dealers with
the authority to “trump” the special entity’s choice of representative. 768 An SBS Dealer
could rely on the special entity’s written representations unless the SBS Dealer has
information that would cause a reasonable person to question the accuracy of the
representation, including the representation that the special entity is relying on advice
from a qualified independent representative.
While we acknowledge commenters’ concerns that the safe harbor might erode
the statutory protections for special entities, 769 we also have considered the inherent
tensions that arise where SBS Dealers have concurrent, potentially conflicting roles as
advisor and counterparty to special entities. On the one hand, the SBS Dealer as advisor
is subject to a duty to act in the “best interests” of the special entity. On the other hand, a

766

In addition, the safe harbor as adopted continues to require that the SBS Dealer
disclose to the special entity that it is not undertaking to act in the best interest of
the special entity. See Rule 15Fh-2(a)(2)(ii).

243

broad application of the “best interests” standard could have the unintended
consequences of chilling commercial communications, restricting customary commercial
interactions, reducing market information shared with special entities, as well as reducing
the ability of special entities to engage in security-based swaps. In adopting the safe
harbor, we acknowledge the tension between the SBS Dealer’s potentially conflicting
roles as advisor and counterparty by recognizing that the special entity may be separately
advised by a fiduciary or other qualified independent representative, who will act in the
special entity’s best interests.
We disagree with commenters that adoption of the safe harbor could cause special
entities to waive their right to “best interests” standards or sign “boilerplate agreements”
as a condition of transacting with SBS Entities. 770 Rather, the safe harbor reflects an
approach that is conditioned upon the involvement of an ERISA fiduciary or other
qualified independent representative that is otherwise required to act in the best interests
of the special entity.
Although the safe harbor the Commission is adopting today largely aligns with
that of the CFTC, it differs from that of the CFTC in four respects: (1) Rules 15Fh2(a)(1)(ii) and 15Fh-2(a)(2)(i)(A) require the special entity or its fiduciary to represent in
writing that it acknowledges the SBS Dealer is not acting as an advisor, whereas the
CFTC requires the special entity or its fiduciary to represent it will not rely on the SBS
Dealer’s recommendations; 771 (2) Rules 15Fh-2(a)(1)(iii)(A) and (B) apply to any
recommendation the special entity receives from the security-based swap dealer
770

See CFA, supra note 5; AFSCME, supra note 5.

771

See 17 CFR 23.440(b)(1)(ii), (b)(2)(ii)(A).

244

“involving” a security-based swap transaction, while the parallel CFTC rules apply to
recommendations “materially affecting” a security-based swap transaction; 772 (3) Rule
15Fh-2(a)(1)(iii) requires a security-based swap transaction to be evaluated by a fiduciary
before the transaction “is entered into,” whereas the CFTC’s safe harbor requires a swap
transaction to be evaluated by fiduciary before the transaction “occurs”; 773 and (4) the
safe harbor in Rule 15Fh-2(a) does not prohibit an SBS Dealer acting as an advisor from
expressing an opinion as to whether a special entity should enter into a recommended
security-based swap or trading strategy. 774 The Commission believes it is appropriate to
differ from the CFTC in these three discrete areas for the following reasons.
First, as discussed above, the Commission believes that replacing the requirement
that the special entity or its fiduciary represent it will not “rely” on the SBS Dealer’s
recommendations with the requirement that the special entity or its fiduciary represent in
writing that it acknowledges that the SBS Dealer is not “acting as an advisor” will afford
special entities the same statutory protections. As noted above, the Commission is
making this change in response to a commenter’s concern. 775 The Commission does not
intend to affect the rights of parties in private actions.
Second, the Commission has determined to replace the phrase “materially
affecting” with the word “involving” in relation to the recommendations that a special
entity receives from an SBS Dealer. We believe that further clarification is needed in the

772

See 17 CFR 23.440(b)(1)(iii)(A)-(B).

773

See 17 CFR 23.440(b)(1)(iii).

775

See Ropes & Gray, supra note 5.

245

context of Rule 15Fh-2(a)(1) to make clear that all recommendations made by the SBS
Dealer are covered by this provision.
Third, the Commission has determined to use the phrase “is entered into,” as it is
consistently used throughout the business conduct rules being adopted today. 776
However, because we also believe that the CFTC’s usage of the word “occurs” was
intended to have the same meaning as the phrase “is entered into,” we expect the practical
effect of CFTC Regulation 23.440(b)(1)(iii) to be substantially the same as Rule 15Fh2(a)(1)(iii). 777
Fourth, the Commission declines to adopt the provision in CFTC Regulation
23.440(b)(2)(i), under which Swap Dealers seeking to avail themselves of the safe harbor
would be precluded from “expressing an opinion” as to whether the special entity should
enter into a recommended security-based swap or trading strategy. Under the rules
adopted today, the determination of whether an SBS Dealer has provided advice to a
special entity turns on whether a communication is considered a “recommendation,” not
whether the SBS Dealer has “expressed an opinion.” Unlike the word
“recommendation,” the phrase “express an opinion” is not defined or described in the
federal securities laws in this context, and therefore may have other meanings that could
cause confusion. Further, we also believe the concern that underlies the CFTC’s
776

See, e.g., Rule 15Fh-1 (“Sections 240.15h-1 through 240.15Fh-6, and 240.15Fk-1
apply, as relevant in connection with entering into security-based swaps…”); Rule
15Fh-3(a)(1), (2) (“…before entering into a security-based swap…”); Rule 15Fh3(b) (“At a reasonably sufficient time prior to entering into a security-based
swap…”); Rule 15Fh-6(b)(1) (“It shall be unlawful for a security-based swap
dealer to offer to enter into, or enter into, a security-based swap…”) (emphasis
added).

777

See generally CFTC Adopting Release, 77 FR at 9784, supra note 22.

246

provision (i.e., that the special entity obtain advice regarding a security-based swap from
an ERISA fiduciary or other qualified independent representative) is sufficiently
addressed by the requirement in Rules 15Fh-2(a)(1)-(2) that the special entity or its
fiduciary represent that it acknowledges that the SBS Dealer is not acting as an advisor.
It is therefore the Commission’s view that prohibiting SBS Dealers from “expressing an
opinion” would neither increase regulatory clarity regarding whether an SBS Dealer’s
conduct falls within the safe harbor, nor provide a corresponding increase in protection
for special entities.
3.

Definition of “Best Interests”

Exchange Act Section 15F(h)(4)(B) imposes on an SBS Dealer that “acts as an
advisor” to a special entity a duty to act in the “best interests” of the special entity. In
addition, Section 15F(h)(4)(C) requires the SBS Dealer that “acts as an advisor” to a
special entity to make “reasonable efforts to obtain such information as is necessary to
make a reasonable determination” that any swap recommended by the SBS Dealer is in
the “best interests” of the special entity. 778 The term “best interests” is not defined in the
Dodd-Frank Act, and the Commission did not propose to define “best interests.” In the
Proposing Release, we noted that the “best interests” duty for an SBS Dealer acting as an
advisor to a special entity “goes beyond and encompasses the general suitability
requirement of proposed Rule 15Fh-3(f).” We sought comment on whether we should
define the term “best interests,” and if so, whether such definition should use

778

Section 15F(h)(5) of the Exchange Act also requires an SBS Entity that is a
counterparty to a special entity to have a “reasonable basis” to believe the special
entity has an independent representative that undertakes to act in the best interests
of the special entity.

Proposed Rules

Proposed Rule 15Fh-4(b)(1) would generally require an SBS Dealer that acts as
an advisor regarding a security-based swap to a special entity to act in the “best interests”
of the special entity.

We have stated that an adviser must deal fairly with clients and prospective
clients, seek to avoid conflicts with its clients and, at a minimum, make full
disclosure of any material conflict or potential conflict. See Amendments to

enforceable under Section 206 of the Advisers Act, that imposes upon investment

all material facts,’ as well as an affirmative obligation to ‘employ reasonable care

(requiring the MSRB to prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent acts,
practices, and courses of conduct that are not consistent with a municipal
advisor’s fiduciary duty to its municipal entity clients). In April 2015, the MSRB
filed proposed Rule G-42 with the Commission for approval, which rule would
establish core standards of conduct for municipal advisors when engaging in
municipal advisory activities, other than municipal advisory solicitation
activities. The rule was published in the Federal Register on May 8, 2015. See

a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an
enterprise of a like character and with like aims”).

Proposed Rule 15Fh-4(b)(2) would require the SBS Dealer to make “reasonable
efforts” to obtain the information necessary to make a reasonable determination that a
security-based swap or trading strategy involving a security-based swap is in the best
interests of the special entity, and that such information shall include but not be limited
to: (i) the authority of the special entity to enter into a security-based swap; (ii) the
financial status of the special entity, as well as future funding needs; (iii) the tax status of
the special entity; (iv) the investment or financing objectives of the special entity; (v) the
experience of the special entity with respect to entering into security-based swaps,
generally, and security-based swaps of the type and complexity being recommended; (vi)
whether the special entity has the financial capability to withstand changes in market
conditions during the term of the security-based swap; and (vii) such other information as
is relevant to the particular facts and circumstances of the special entity, market
conditions and the type of security-based swap or trading strategy involving a securitybased swap being recommended.

Comments on the Proposed Rules

The Commission received six comment letters on the imposition of a “best
interests” standard. 782 One commenter argued that the Commission should define what it
means to act in the “best interests,” and proposed that the definition must “be at least as
strong as the concept of ‘best interest’ [that] has evolved under the fiduciary principles

782

See Better Markets (August 2011), supra note 5; CFA, supra note 5; Johnson,
supra note 5; ABC, supra note 5; BlackRock, supra note 5; SIFMA (August
2015), supra note 5.

249

applicable to investment [advisers].” 783 The commenter additionally requested that the
Commission acknowledge “that the best interest standard intended by Congress is a
fiduciary concept that goes well beyond suitability.” 784
Similarly, a second commenter supporting a best interests standard stated it did
not believe it was “necessary, or even appropriate,” to strictly define best interests. 785
The commenter asked the Commission to provide guidance on how to apply the standard
in particular circumstances. This commenter asserted that Congress did not intend to
apply the ERISA fiduciary standard, and argued that the intended model for the
“heightened standard” was the Advisers Act fiduciary duty. 786 The commenter stated
that Congress did not seek to eliminate all conflicts of interest but to ensure that such
conflicts of interest would be appropriately managed and fully disclosed. 787 The
commenter urged that in providing guidance in this area, it is important for the
Commission to clarify that not all suitable recommendations would satisfy a best interest
standard and that the best interest standard would impose a “heightened duty beyond
mere suitability” and would require SBS Dealers to “recommend from among the various
suitable options the approach they believe to be best for the special entity.” 788 In
addition, the commenter stated that the guidance should “clarify that the best interest

783

See Better Markets (August 2011), supra note 5 (noting that Congress expressly
described the standard as “best interest” in Exchange Act Sections 15F(h)(2)(A)
and (B), 15F(h)(4) and 15F(h)(5)).

standard is consistent with various different methods of compensation and with
proprietary trades, but that it requires the full disclosure of any conflicts of interest.” In
the context of an SBS Dealer acting as an advisor and serving as a counterparty, the
commenter suggested that the Commission clarify that it would not be inconsistent with
the SBS Dealer’s duty to act in the best interests of the special entity if the SBS Dealer,
as principal, earned a reasonable profit or fee from transacting with the special entity. 789
A third commenter asserted that Congress rejected the imposition of a fiduciary
duty on SBS Dealers as incompatible with their role as market makers and asked the
Commission to “respect Congressional intent” to protect the ability of end users and
pension plans to transact in security-based swaps in a cost-effective manner by rejecting
such a duty. 790
Two additional commenters argued that an SBS Dealer that “acts as an advisor to
a special entity” and complies with the “best interest” requirements might become an
ERISA fiduciary under the DOL’s proposed redefinition of the term “fiduciary.” 791
Accordingly, one of these commenters requested that the Commission clarify that
compliance with the business conduct standards would not transform an SBS Dealer into
a fiduciary under ERISA or under the final DOL regulation. 792
One of these commenters also opposed the best interest requirement, and
recommended that it be omitted from the final rules. 793 The commenter expressed its

concern that “[r]equiring that an SBS Dealer act in the best interests of a counterparty
who is a special entity would confuse the roles of the parties and have an adverse impact
on the flow of information regarding investment and trading strategies.” 794 Additionally,
if the requirement is retained, the commenter recommended that the term “best interests”
be defined as complying with proposed Rule 15Fh-3(g) (fair and balanced
communications), 795 and NASD Rule 2010(d), which would require that communications
be based on principles of fair dealing and good faith, be fair and balanced, and provide a
sound basis for evaluating the transaction. 796
After the CFTC adopted its rules in 2012, one commenter asserted that “to
promote legal certainty and the ability of SBS dealers to continue to trade with special
entities, the SEC should provide guidance clarifying the nature of an SBS Dealer’s ‘best
interests’ duty.” 797 Specifically, the commenter asserted that, to harmonize with CFTC
guidance, the Commission should clarify that the best interest duty is not a fiduciary duty,
but is rather a duty for the SBS Dealer to: (1) comply with the requirement to make a
reasonable effort to obtain necessary information; (2) act in good faith and make full and
fair disclosure of all material facts and conflicts of interest with respect to the
recommended security-based swap or related trading strategy; and (3) employ reasonable
care that any recommendation made to the special entity be designed to further the
special entity’s stated objectives. 798 The commenter also suggested that, consistent with

252

the CFTC’s guidance, a recommendation need not represent the best of all possible
alternatives to meet the best interest standard. Additionally, the commenter stated that
the determination whether a recommendation is in a special entity’s best interest should
be based on the information known to the SBS Dealer at the time a recommendation was
made. 799 Furthermore, according to the commenter, the best interest duty should not
impede an SBS Dealer from negotiating the terms of a transaction in its own interests, or
from making a reasonable profit in a transaction; nor should it impose an ongoing
obligation on the SBS Dealer to act in the best interest of the special entity. 800 This
commenter also suggested deleting the requirement under Rule 15Fh-4(b)(i) that the SBS
Dealer “make reasonable efforts to obtain information regarding ‘the authority of the
special entity to enter into a security based swap.’” 801 Toward this end, the commenter
argued that the CFTC eliminated this requirement as it was “duplicative” of the know
your customer requirement under the CFTC’s business conduct rules. As the commenter
stated: “Since proposed Rule 15Fh3(e)(3) would require an SBS dealer to obtain this
information, we believe the same considerations support eliminating that requirement
here.” 802 Moreover, the commenter proposed a bifurcated treatment of ERISA and nonERISA special entities under Rule 15Fh-5(a) to recognize the “unique fiduciary regime”
already applicable to ERISA special entities, as well as to “reduce costs for special

entities since most of them have already conformed their relationships with their
representatives to satisfy the CFTC’s qualification criteria.” 803

Response to Comments and Final Rules

Upon consideration of commenters’ views, the Commission is adopting Rules
15Fh-4(b)(1) and (2), regarding the “best interests” obligation for an SBS Dealer that acts
as an advisor to a special entity regarding a security-based swap, with certain
modifications.
Under Rule 15Fh-4(b)(1), as adopted, an SBS Dealer that acts as an advisor to a
special entity will have a “duty to make a reasonable determination that any securitybased swap or trading strategy involving a security based swap recommended by the
security based swap dealer is in the best interests of the special entity.” We believe that
this language, suggested by a commenter, 804 appropriately interprets the statutory
requirements imposed on an SBS Dealer that is acting as an advisor to a special entity. 805
While the Commission is not specifically defining the term “best interests,” it is
providing further guidance below regarding how an SBS Dealer that acts as an advisor to
a special entity can comply with the duty to make a reasonable determination that a
security-based swap or security-based swap trading strategy is in the “best interests” of
the special entity.
Under Rule 15Fh-4(b)(2), as adopted, the advisor will be obligated to “make
reasonable efforts to obtain such information that the security-based swap dealer

Proposed Rule 15Fh-4(b)(1) generally required an SBS Dealer to “act in the best
interests of the special entity.”

254

considers necessary to make a reasonable determination that a security-based swap or
trading strategy involving a security-based swap is in the best interests of the special
entity.” Whether a recommended security-based swap or trading strategy is in the best
interests of the special entity is based on information known to the advisor (after it has
employed its reasonable efforts under Rule 15Fh-4(b)(2)) at the time the recommendation
is made.
Various commenters questioned whether the “best interest” duty was tantamount
to, or would give rise to, a “fiduciary duty.” 806 The Commission has considered
commenters’ views and the legislative history in regard to whether Section 15Fh-4
imposes a fiduciary duty. 807 As noted above, Rule 15Fh-4(b)(1), as adopted, requires that
an SBS Dealer “make a reasonable determination that any security-based swap or trading
strategy involving a security based swap recommended by the security based swap dealer
is in the best interests of the special entity.” In response to comments, and for
clarification, the determination whether a recommended security-based swap or trading

In the Senate bill, the business conduct standards provision provided that “a
security-based swap dealer that provides advice regarding, or offers to enter into,
or enters into a security-based swap with [a Special Entity] shall have a fiduciary
duty to the [Special Entity], as appropriate.” Restoring American Financial
Stability Act of 2010, H.R. 4173, Section 764 (May 20, 2010) (Public Print
version as passed in the Senate of the United States May 27 (legislative day, May
26, 2010) (proposed amendments to Section 15F(h)(2)(A) and (B) of the
Exchange Act), available at https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/housebill/4173/text/pp). Instead, Congress adopted the following best interests
standard: “Duty. -- Any security-based swap dealer that acts as an advisor to a
Special Entity shall have a duty to act in the best interests of the Special Entity.”

Act.

strategy is in the “best interests” of the special entity will turn on the facts and
circumstances of the particular recommendation and particular special entity. In response
to a commenter, and as stated in the Proposing Release, we continue to believe that the
“best interests” obligation for an SBS Dealer acting as an advisor to a special entity goes
beyond and encompasses the general suitability requirements of Rule 15Fh-3(f). 808 The
Commission generally believes that it would be difficult for an SBS Dealer acting as an
advisor to a special entity to fulfill its obligations under Rule 15Fh-4(b)(1), as adopted,
unless the SBS Dealer, at a minimum: (1) complies with the requirement of Rule 15Fh4(b)(2) that it make a reasonable effort to obtain necessary information to make a
reasonable determination that a security-based swap or related trading strategy is in the
best interests of the special entity; 809 (2) acts in good faith and makes full and fair
disclosure of all material risks and characteristics of and any material incentives or

808

See Better Markets (August 2011), supra note 5; CFA, supra note 5. See also
Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42417, supra note 3. This is the case even if the SBS
Dealer is not acting as counterparty to the special entity for which it is acting as
an advisor.

809

Also, as stated above, to comply with its customer-specific suitability obligations
under Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(ii), an SBS Dealer must have a reasonable basis to
believe that a recommended security-based swap or trading strategy involving a
security-based swap is suitable for the counterparty. To establish a reasonable
basis for a recommendation, an SBS Dealer must have or obtain relevant
information regarding the special entity, including its investment profile, trading
objectives, and its ability to absorb potential losses associated with the
recommended security-based swap or trading strategy involving a security-based
swap. Furthermore, where an SBS Dealer’s reasonable efforts to obtain necessary
information result in limited or incomplete information, the SBS Dealer must
assess whether it is able to make a reasonable determination that a particular
recommendation is in the best interests of the special entity.

256

conflicts of interest with respect to the recommended security-based swap; 810 and (3)
employs reasonable care that any recommendation made to a special entity is suitable
taking into account the information collected by the SBS Dealer pursuant to Rules 15Fh3(f)(1)(ii) and 15Fh-4(b)(2), including the special entity’s objectives. 811 In taking
reasonable care that any recommendation made to a special entity is suitable, an SBS
Dealer acting as an advisor to a special entity should consider, among other things, the
fair pricing and appropriateness of the security-based swap or trading strategy, and must
act without regard to its own financial or other interests in the security-based swap
transaction or trading strategy. 812 As discussed below, this does not prevent an SBS
Dealer from negotiating commercially reasonable terms or earning a profit.
In response to commenters’ requests for clarification, we do not believe that, to
act in the best interests of a special entity, an SBS Dealer acting as an advisor would be
810

The Commission believes that to “act in good faith” in this context generally
involves taking steps to manage material conflicts of interest in addition to
disclosing them.

811

See note 809, supra and Rule 15Fh-4(b)(2). An SBS Dealer generally should
consider evaluating “best interests” in accordance with policies and procedures
that are reasonably designed to prevent violations of the requirement that a
recommended swap is in the best interests of the special entity. See Rule 15Fh3(h)(2)(iii) (requiring SBS Entities to have supervisory policies and procedures
that are reasonably designed to prevent violations of applicable federal securities
laws and the rules and regulations thereunder). Furthermore, the Commission has
separately proposed that SBS Dealers be required to make and keep current a
record that demonstrates their compliance with Rule 15Fh-4, among others, as
applicable. See Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements for Security-Based
Swap Dealers, Major Security-Based Swap Participants, and Broker-Dealers;
Capital Rule for Certain Security-Based Swap Dealers; Proposed Rules, Exchange
Act Release No. 34-71958, 79 FR 25194 at 25208 (May 2, 2014).

812

Exercising reasonable care would also require, among other things, undertaking
reasonable diligence to understand the potential risks and rewards associated with
the recommended security-based swap or trading strategy. See Rule 15Fh3(f)(1)(i).

257

required to recommend the “best” of all possible alternatives that might exist. 813 The
determination whether a recommended security-based swap is in the “best interests” of
the special entity must be based on information known to the SBS Dealer, acting as an
advisor, (after it has employed its reasonable efforts under Rule 15Fh-4(b)(2)) at the time
the recommendation is made. We believe that a broader requirement could introduce
legal uncertainty into the determination of what an SBS Dealer must do to fulfill its
obligation under the rule, given the broad range of objectives for which a security-based
swap might be used, and how such objectives may vary for different transactions. The
Commission believes, however, that generally an SBS Dealer should consider, based on
the information about existing alternatives known to the SBS Dealer, any reasonably
available alternatives in fulfilling its best interests obligations.
For further clarification in response to comments, we believe that the “best
interests” duty would not necessarily preclude an SBS Dealer from acting as a
counterparty. 814 However, an SBS Dealer acting in both capacities would be required to
comply with the full range of requirements under Rules 15Fh-4 and 15Fh-5, applicable to
SBS Dealers acting as advisors and as counterparties to special entities. In addition to the
substantive requirements, Rule 15Fh-5(c) would require that the SBS Dealer disclose to
the special entity in writing the capacities in which is it acting, and the material
differences between its capacities as advisor and counterparty to the special entity.
We also do not believe that the “best interests” duty would prevent an SBS Dealer
from negotiating commercially reasonable security-based swap terms in its own
813

See CFA, supra note 5; SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5.

814

See CFA, supra note 5.

258

interest, 815 or that it would preclude an SBS Dealer from making a reasonable profit or
fee from a transaction with a special entity. 816 We do not believe that the profit motive
inherent in any security-based swap transaction necessarily precludes an SBS Dealer,
acting as an advisor, from fulfilling its “best interests” duty to a special entity, although it
raises the potential for material conflicts that would need to be disclosed – particularly
when the SBS Dealer is acting as both an advisor and a counterparty to the special entity.
A prohibition on receipt of reasonable profits or fees would likely reduce SBS Dealers’
willingness to act as advisors to and transact with special entities at the same time, and
therefore could limit special entities’ access to security-based swap transactions that
might be necessary to their particular objectives.
As additional guidance in response to comments, 817 the “best interests” duty
would not require the SBS Dealer acting as an advisor to undertake an ongoing obligation
to act in the “best interests” of the special entity, unless such obligation is established
through contract or other arrangement or understanding (e.g., a course of dealing). As
noted above, Rule 15Fh-4(b), as adopted, requires an SBS Dealer to make a reasonable
determination, after making reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary information, that a
recommended security-based swap or related trading strategy is in the best interests of the
815

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5. For example, the SBS Dealer may
negotiate appropriate provisions relating to collateral and termination rights to
manage its risks related to the security-based swap.

816

See CFA, supra note 5. Furthermore, as noted throughout this release, the duties
imposed on an SBS Dealer under these business conduct rules are specific to this
context, and are in addition to any duties that may be imposed under other
applicable law. Thus, an SBS Dealer must separately determine whether it is
subject to regulation as a broker-dealer, an investment adviser, a municipal
advisor or other regulated entity.

817

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5.

259

special entity. Thus, the “best interests” duty applies only to recommendations by the
SBS Dealer. For example, if an SBS Dealer makes a recommendation in connection with
a material amendment to a security-based swap or a recommendation to terminate a
security-based swap early, the “best interests” duty would apply. However, we note that
an SBS Dealer would have an ongoing “best interests” duty if it were to assume the
additional responsibility of monitoring a special entity’s security-based swap transaction
on an ongoing basis.
Commenters have suggested that we apply principles applicable to investment
advisers under the Advisers Act in the “best interests” standard of Rule 15Fh-4(b). 818 As
noted above in Section II.H.2.c.i., we believe that the protections included in the business
conduct rules address the relationships between SBS Dealers and their special entity
counterparties for which they act as advisors, so long as their activities are limited to
those that would not, under the facts and circumstances, implicate other applicable law.
However, as discussed in Section I.E, supra, the duties imposed on an SBS Dealer under
the business conduct rules are specific to this context, and are in addition to any duties
that may be imposed under other applicable law. Thus, an SBS Dealer must separately
determine whether it is subject to regulation as a broker-dealer, an investment adviser, a
municipal advisor or other regulated entity. We also decline to adopt a commenter’s
suggestion that we either omit the term “best interests” from the final rules, or state that
“best interests” means complying with the fair and balanced communications
requirements of Rule 15Fh-3(g) and FINRA Rule 2010 (Standards of Commercial Honor

818

See Better Markets (August 2011), supra note 5; CFA, supra note 5.

260

and Principles of Trade). 819 We do not believe that either approach would be consistent
with the statute, which uses the terms “fair and balanced communications,” “fair
dealing,” and “good faith” in separate provisions, indicating that they impose duties
separate and apart from “best interests.” 820
The Commission also has modified the information that an SBS Dealer must
“make reasonable efforts to obtain” and consider in making its reasonable determination
that a security-based swap or security-based swap strategy is in the “best interests of the
special entity.” Specifically, Rule 15Fh-4(b)(2) now includes the special entity’s
hedging, investment, financing, or other stated objectives as information that shall be
considered by the SBS Dealer in making this determination. The addition of “hedging”
and “other” objectives in Rule 15Fh-4(b)(2)(iii) addresses a commenter’s suggestion that
these terms be included, 821 and recognizes that there may be a broader set of objectives
for a special entity to enter into a security-based swap. The added language expressly
recognizes special entities’ use of security-based swaps to mitigate risk, as well as other
possible uses for security-based swaps that might be necessary for a special entity to
achieve these objectives. We believe that requiring an SBS Dealer to make reasonable

819

See BlackRock, supra note 5. We interpret BlackRock’s comment as referring to
FINRA Rule 2010, (or its predecessors, NYSE Rule 2010 or NASD Rule 2110)
which states: “A member, in the conduct of its business, shall observe high
standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.”

820

Compare Exchange Act Section 15F(h)(3)(C) (requiring business conduct
requirements to “establish a duty for security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant to communicate in a fair and balanced manner
based on principles of fair dealing and good faith”) with Exchange Act Section
15F(h)(4)(B) (“Any security-based swap dealer that acts as an advisor to a special
entity shall have a duty to act in the best interests of the special entity”).

821

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5.

261

efforts to obtain information about a wider array of possible investment objectives of
special entities will allow SBS Dealers to more accurately determine a special entity’s
objectives in entering into a security-based swaps, which is one of the factors it must
consider when making a best interest determination (as discussed above). Furthermore,
as requested by a commenter, this change conforms the obligation under our rules with
that under the rules of the CFTC. 822 Such conformity promotes regulatory consistency
across the swap and security-based swap markets, particularly among entities that
transact in both markets and have already established infrastructure to comply with
existing CFTC regulations.
Furthermore, we reject the commenter’s request to delete the requirement under
proposed Rule 15Fh-4(b)(2)(i) that an SBS Dealer make reasonable efforts to obtain
“information regarding the authority of the special entity to enter into a security-based
swap.” 823 In so doing, we disagree with the commenter’s assertion that the requirement
under Rule 15Fh-4(b)(2)(i) is “duplicative” of the “know your counterparty” requirement
of Rule 15Fh-3(e)(3), which, according to the commenter, already imposes an obligation
on SBS Dealers to obtain information about the authority of the special entity to enter
into a security-based swap. To the contrary, the know your customer requirements of
Rule 15Fh-3(e)(3) require an SBS Dealer to learn “information regarding the authority of

Id. CFTC Regulation §23.440(c)(2)(iii) states that: “Any swap dealer that acts as
an advisor to a Special Entity shall make reasonable efforts to obtain such
information as is necessary to make a reasonable determination that any swap or
trading strategy involving a swap recommended by the swap dealer is in the best
interests of the Special Entity, including… information relating to…the hedging,
investment, financing, or other objectives of the Special Entity.” See CFTC
Adopting Release, 77 FR at 9825, supra note 22.

262

any person acting for such counterparty.” A determination regarding the authority of any
person acting for a counterparty (under Rule 15Fh-3(e)(3)) is different from a
determination regarding the authority of the counterparty itself to enter into a securitybased swap itself (under Rule 15Fh-4(b)(2)(i)). The SBS Dealer’s duty to act in the best
interests of a special entity would encompass the requirement to ensure that a special
entity has the requisite authority to enter into an SBS transaction. Moreover, the “know
your counterparty” requirements of Rule 15Fh-3(e)(3) only apply to known
counterparties. 824 Also, the “know your counterparty” requirements apply only to
counterparties, whereas the requirements imposed on SBS Dealers that “act as an
advisor” to special entities are not limited to special entities that are counterparties.
Accordingly, we continue to believe that requiring SBS Dealers to obtain information
regarding the authority of a special entity to enter into a security-based swap is not
duplicative, but is necessary to achieving the overarching purpose of the rule:
determining whether a recommended security-based swap or related trading strategy is in
the best interests of the special entity.
Lastly, as noted above, commenters requested that we clarify that an SBS Dealer
that “acts as an advisor to a special entity” and complies with the “best interests”
requirements of these business conduct standards will not necessarily become an ERISA
fiduciary under the DOL’s proposed (now final) redefinition of the term “fiduciary.” 825
As discussed in Section I.D, supra, DOL staff has provided the Commission with a
statement that:
824

See Section II.G.3, supra.

825

See ABC, supra note 5; BlackRock, supra note 5; CFA, supra note 5.

263

It is the Department’s view that the draft final business conduct standards
do not require security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap
participants to engage in activities that would make them fiduciaries under
the Department’s current five-part test defining fiduciary investment
advice. 29 CFR § 2510.3-21(c). The standards neither conflict with the
Department’s existing regulations, nor compel security-based swap dealers
or major security-based swap participants to engage in fiduciary
conduct. Moreover, the Department’s recently published final rule
amending ERISA’s fiduciary investment advice regulation was carefully
harmonized with the SEC’s business conduct standards so that there are no
unintended consequences for security-based swap dealers and major
security-based swap participants who comply with the business conduct
standards. As explained in the preamble to the Department’s final rule,
the disclosures required under the SEC’s business conduct rules do not, in
the Department’s view, compel counterparties to ERISA-covered
employee benefit plans to make investment advice recommendations
within the meaning of the Department’s final rule or otherwise compel
them to act as ERISA fiduciaries in swap and security-based swap
transactions conducted pursuant to section 4s(h) of the Commodity
Exchange Act and section 15F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 826

Proposed Rule 15Fh-4(a) would track the language of Section 15F(h)(4)(A) of the
Exchange Act, and prohibit an SBS Entity from: (1) employing any device, scheme, or
artifice to defraud any special entity or prospective customer who is a special entity; (2)
engaging in any transaction, practice, or course of business that operates as a fraud or
deceit on any special entity or prospective customer who is a special entity; or (3)
engaging in any act, practice, or course of business that is fraudulent, deceptive, or
manipulative. The first two provisions are specific to an SBS Entity’s interactions with
special entities, while the third applies more generally.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission received two comment letters on this issue. 827 The first
commenter argued that the antifraud provisions of proposed Rule 15Fh-4(a) would be
duplicative in light of the general antifraud and anti-manipulation provisions of the
existing federal securities laws and proposed Rule 9j-1. 828
The second commenter argued that, because the antifraud prohibitions of
proposed Rule 15Fh-4(a)(3) were modeled on language in the Advisers Act applicable to
conduct by investment advisers, and SBS Entities do not typically act as advisers to their
counterparties, the SEC should include an affirmative defense against alleged violations
of the antifraud prohibitions in its final rules. 829 Specifically, the commenter suggested
that the Commission establish an affirmative defense for an SBS Entity that: (1) did not
act intentionally or recklessly in connection with such alleged violation; and (2) complied
in good faith with written policies and procedures reasonably designed to meet the
particular requirement that is the basis for the alleged violation. 830 The commenter noted
that the CFTC included such a provision in its parallel business conduct rules, and urged
the Commission to rely on the same considerations that led the CFTC to adopt its
affirmative defense. 831

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh-4(a) as
proposed. However, we are re-titling Rule 15Fh-4 “Antifraud provisions and special
requirements for security-based swap dealers acting as advisors to special entities. We
also are re-titling Rule 15Fh-4(a) “Antifraud provisions” and Rule 15Fh-4(b) “Special
requirements for security-based swap dealers acting as advisors to special entities.”
Rule 15Fh-4(a) codifies the statutory requirements of Exchange Act Section
15F(h)(4)(A). 832 Inclusion of the rule in the business conduct standards will provide
SBS Entities and their counterparties with easy reference to the antifraud provisions that
Congress expressly provided under Section 15F(h)(4) of the Exchange Act. These
requirements, which by their terms are applicable to all SBS Entities, apply in addition to
those prohibitions imposed by Section 9(j) of the Exchange Act – along with any rules
the Commission may adopt thereunder, and any other applicable provisions of the federal
securities laws and related rules and regulations. The Commission is not adopting the
commenter’s recommendation that the final rules incorporate an affirmative “policies and
procedures defense.” We recognize that the CFTC adopted an express, affirmative
832

This language mirrors the language in Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers
Act, which does not require scienter to prove liability. See SEC v. Steadman, 967
F.2d 636, 647 (D.C. Cir. 1992). The court in Steadman analogized Section 206(4)
of the Advisers Act to Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, which the Supreme
Court had held did not require a finding of scienter. See id., citing Aaron v. SEC,
446 U.S. 680 (1980). The Steadman court concluded that: “[S]ection 206(4) uses
the more neutral ‘act, practice, or course or business’ language. This is similar to
[Securities Act] section 17(a)(3)’s ‘transaction, practice, or course of business,’
which ‘quite plainly focuses upon the effect of particular conduct . . . rather than
upon the culpability of the person responsible.’ Accordingly, scienter is not
required under section 206(4), and the SEC did not have to prove it in order to
establish the appellants’ liability . . . .” SEC v. Steadman, 967 F.2d at 647

violation of Section 206(2) of the Adviser Act could rest on a finding of simple
negligence. Id. at 642 note 5.

defense in its parallel antifraud rules, in part in response to concerns that the statute may
impose non-scienter liability for fraud in private rights of action. 833 The Exchange Act,
however, does not contain a parallel provision. 834 Moreover, the Commission has
considered the concerns raised by commenters and determined not to provide a similar
safe harbor from liability for fraud on behalf of SBS Entities. As discussed throughout
the release in the context of specific rules, the rules being adopted today are intended to
provide certain protections for counterparties, including certain heightened protections
for special entities. We think it is appropriate to apply the rules so that counterparties
receive the benefits of those protections, and therefore we do not think it would be
appropriate to provide the safe harbor requested by the commenter from liability for
fraud. While we are not adopting a safe harbor from liability for fraud, as discussed
below in connection with the relevant rules, the Commission has adopted rules that
permit reasonable reliance on representations (e.g., Rule 15Fh-1(b)) and, where
appropriate, allow SBS Entities to take into account the sophistication of the counterparty
(e.g., Rule 15Fh-3(f) (regarding recommendations of security-based swaps or trading
strategies)).

Scope of Qualified Independent Representative
Requirement
i.

Proposed Rules

Under Exchange Act Section 15F(h)(5)(A), an SBS Entity that offers to enter into
or enters into a security-based swap with a special entity must comply with any duty
established by the Commission requiring the SBS Entity to have a “reasonable basis” to
believe the special entity has an “independent representative” that meets certain
qualifications. Proposed Rules 15Fh-2(c) and 15Fh-5(a) would implement this provision.
In particular, proposed Rule 15Fh-2(c) would define an “independent representative,” and
proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a) would require an SBS Entity that “offers to enter into” or enters
into a security-based swap with a special entity to have a “reasonable basis” to believe
that the special entity has a “qualified independent representative.”
ii.

Comments on the Proposed Rule
Application to SBS Dealers and Major SBS
Participants

Under proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a), an SBS Dealer or a Major SBS Participant that
offers to enter into or enters into an SBS with a special entity must have a reasonable
basis to believe that the special entity has a qualified independent representative.
Although Exchange Act Section 15F(h)(2)(B) only imposes an express obligation on SBS
Dealers to comply with the requirements of Section 15F(h)(5), we proposed to apply the
qualified independent representative requirement to Major SBS Participants as well as
SBS Dealers because the specific requirements under Section 15F(h)(5)(A) apply by their

268

terms to both a “security-based swap dealer and major security-based swap participant
that offers to or enters into a security-based swap with a special entity.” 835
The sole commenter on this issue supported the proposed Rule, and agreed that it
should apply to both SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants. 836
Application to Any Special Entity
In proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a), we proposed to apply the qualified independent
representative requirements to transactions with all special entities. In the Proposing
Release, we explained that while Exchange Act Section 15F(h)(5)(A) provides broadly
that an SBS Entity that offers to or enters into a security-based swap with a special entity
must comply with the requirements of that section, Section 15F(h)(5)(A)(i) on its face
would apply these requirements only to dealings only with “a counterparty that is an
eligible contract participant within the meaning of subclause (I) or (II) of clause (vii) of
section 1a(18) of the Commodity Exchange Act.” A reliance on Section 15Fh(5)(A)(i)
read in isolation would lead to an anomalous result in which special entity obligations
could apply with respect to entities such as multinational and supranational government
entities, which are ECPs “within the meaning of subclause (I) or (II) of clause (vii) of
section 1a(18) of the Commodity Exchange Act,” but that do not fall within the definition
of special entity in Section 15F(h)(2)(C). Conversely, Section 15Fh(5)(A)(i) read in
isolation could lead to special entity obligations not being applied with respect to

835

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(5)(A).

836

See NAIPFA, supra note 5.

269

dealings with state agencies, which are special entities as defined in Section 15Fh(2)(C)
but are not ECPs as defined in Section 1a(18)(A)(vii)(I) and (II) of the CEA. 837
To resolve the ambiguity in the statutory language, we proposed to apply the
qualified independent requirement under Section 15F(h)(5) to security-based swap
transactions or offers to enter into security-based swap transactions between an SBS
Entity and any counterparty that is a “special entity” as defined in Section 15F(h)(1)(C).
This approach would address the statutory ambiguity by including dealings with a special
entity that is an ECP within the meaning of subclause (I) or (II) of clause (vii) of
Commodity Exchange Act Section 1a(18). 838 The Proposing Release noted that this
reading would be consistent with the categories of special entities mentioned in the
legislative history. 839 It also would give meaning to the requirement of Section
15F(h)(5)(A)(i)(VII) concerning “employee benefit plans subject to ERISA,” that are not
ECPs within the meaning of subclause (I) or (II) of clause (vii) of section 1a(18) of the
Commodity Exchange Act but are included in the category of retirement plans identified
in the definition of special entity. 840
The Commission received one comment letter that addressed the question of
whether proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a) should apply to security-based swap transactions with

any special entity. 841 According to the commenter, proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a) was overly
broad in scope and ignored the limiting language of Section 15F(h)(5)(A). This
commenter suggested interpreting the requirement as applying to only those referenced
governmental entities that are special entities.” 842
Application to “Offers”
As stated above, proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a) would apply to an SBS Dealer or
Major SBS Participant that “offers to enter into” or enters into a security-based swap with
a special entity. The Commission requested comment regarding whether the phrase
“offers to enter into” a security-based swap was sufficiently clear, and if not, how the
requirement should be clarified. 843 Three commenters responded to this request. 844
One commenter suggested that the “offer” stage of a security-based swap
transaction would often be too early for the counterparty to ensure that the independent
representative requirement was satisfied. 845 Instead, the commenter argued that the
independent representative requirement should be satisfied if the counterparty had an

841

842

Id. The commenter suggested two other possible alternatives for resolving the
statutory ambiguity: “(i) interpreting the de facto independent representative
requirements as applying to both those referenced governmental entities that are
special entities and those that are not, (ii) interpreting the independent
representative requirement to be generally inapplicable (as clearly most special
entities were not intended to be covered in the reference)” but expressed a
preference for including governmental entities that are special entities “absent
clarification from Congress.”

independent representative at the time the transaction was executed. 846 A second
commenter recommended that the Commission exclude preliminary negotiations from
the definition of “offer,” and that the communication of an interest in trading a securitybased swap should only be viewed as an “offer” when, based on the relevant facts or
circumstances, the communication was “actionable” or “firm.” 847 A third commenter
asked that the Commission, like the CFTC, clarify the term “offer” to mean an “offer to
enter into an SBS that, if accepted, would result in a binding contract under applicable
law.” 848
“Reasonable Basis”
The Commission additionally sought comment regarding the degree of inquiry
required for an SBS Entity to form a “reasonable basis” to believe the special entity was
represented by a qualified independent representative. Three commenters expressed
concern with the additional duties of inquiry and diligence imposed on SBS Entities
under proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a). 849 One of these commenters argued that the CFTC’s
proposed requirement that a Swap Dealer perform substantial diligence to confirm a swap
advisor’s qualifications could pose a serious conflict of interest, give the Swap Dealer too
much power, and ultimately interfere with, prove more costly for, and be problematic to
state or local governments. 850 Another commenter similarly argued that an inherent
conflict of interest existed in granting one party to a transaction the authority to

effectively determine who has the requisite qualifications to represent the other party. 851
The second commenter would impose additional due diligence obligations on SBS
Entities before they could rely on special entities’ representations regarding the
qualifications of representatives, even where the SBS Entity does not have information
that would cause a reasonable person to question the accuracy of the representations. 852
The commenter conceded that requiring such additional diligence might limit the
willingness or ability of SBS Entities to provide special entities with access to securitybased swaps. However, it argued that, in the absence of such diligence, special entities’
access to security-based swaps should be limited to the extent suitability is in question. 853
Other commenters expressed a range of views in response to our request for
comment on whether an SBS Entity should be able to rely on representations to form the
necessary “reasonable basis” for believing that a special entity counterparty is
represented by a qualified independent representative. One commenter argued that no
particular level of specificity should be required in the representations, and that the SBS
Dealer should not be required to conduct further diligence before relying on the special

851

See CalPERS, supra note 5. This commenter therefore recommended an
approach that would permit a special entity to choose between either relying on
the Commission’s proposed framework, or relying on an alternative approach
under which it would be permitted to enter into off-exchange security-based swap
transactions with an SBS Entity if the special entity had a representative, whether
internal or a third party, that had been certified as able to evaluate security-based
swap transactions. The commenter contemplated that the certification process
would involve passage of a proficiency examination to be developed by the
Commission or FINRA “or another recognized testing organization.” A certified
independent representative would be required to complete periodic continuing
education. Id.

entity’s representations, as “any such diligence would interfere with the relationship
between the special entity and its independent advisor and could result in the SBS Dealer
second-guessing the special entity’s choice of representative.” 854 Another commenter
argued that an SBS Dealer should be required to rely on the representations of a special
entity concerning the qualifications of its independent representative, absent actual
knowledge of facts that clearly contradict material aspects of the representative’s
purported qualifications. 855
One commenter suggested adopting a presumption that the special entity’s
selection of independent representative was acceptable if the special entity represents to
the SBS Entity that the representative satisfies the criteria in Exchange Act Section
15F(h)(5)(A)(i). 856
Two other commenters supported the actual knowledge standard because they
believe the reasonable person standard in practice could require an SBS Entity to perform

854

See BlackRock, supra note 5.

855

See SIFMA (August 2011), supra note 5. The commenter asserted that requiring
an SBS Dealer to undertake an independent due diligence investigation into
representative’s qualifications would impose upon the SBS Dealer a duty to
second-guess the special entity's own assessment of its representative and provide
the SBS Dealer with the ability to trump a special entity’s choice of asset
manager. According to the commenter, this could result in a reduced number of
security-based swap counterparties for special entities, as SBS Dealers would
likely limit transactions with special entities to avoid the potential liability, cost,
delay, and uncertainty arising from this added responsibility.

856

See ABA Committees, supra note 5. That presumption would be voidable only if
one or more senior representatives of the SBS Entity with expertise in securitybased swap transactions possessed actual knowledge that a representation
regarding the independent representative’s qualifications was false. In that
situation, the Special Entity’s senior representative must present his or her
determination promptly in writing to the special entity’s Chief Investment Officer
and Chair of the Board, or equivalent person.

274

substantial due diligence to rely on representations. 857 One commenter noted that this
additional due diligence could reduce the number of SBS Entities willing to contract with
special entities, and could increase the cost of security-based swaps for those persons. 858
The other expressed concern that additional due diligence, in the context of the
qualifications of a special entity’s independent representative, would be intrusive, time
consuming and unnecessary, and would “come very close to having the SBS Dealer
‘approve’ the special entity’s representative.” 859 A third commenter expressed similar
concerns, noting that absent actual knowledge that a representation is incorrect, SBS
Dealers should not be able to second-guess a special entity’s selection of a
representative. 860
Another commenter supported permitting an SBS Dealer to rely on a special
entity’s representation that its independent representative met the statutory and regulatory
requirements, unless the SBS Dealer had reason to believe that the special entity’s
representations with respect to its independent representative were inaccurate. 861
After the adoption of the CFTC’s final rules, one commenter urged the
Commission to adopt the CFTC’s reasonable person approach, under which an SBS

858

See APPA, supra note 5.

859

See BlackRock, supra note 5.

860

See ABC, supra note 5. According to the commenter, without such a bright-line
rule, SBS Dealers might face litigation initiated by ERISA plans for approving a
representative who is subsequently determined to lack needed expertise, or by the
representatives whom they have chosen to disqualify. This potential liability
would ultimately discourage SBS Dealers from transacting with ERISA plans
altogether.

861

275

Entity would be deemed to have a reasonable basis to believe the special entity has a
qualified independent representative when it relies on written representations that the
special entity’s representative meets the criteria for a qualified independent
representative. 862 Alternatively, in the ERISA context, the commenter suggested that an
SBS Entity be deemed to have a reasonable basis to believe a special entity subject to
ERISA has a representative that satisfies the requirements for a qualified independent
representative when it relies on written representations that the representative is a
fiduciary as defined in Section 3 of ERISA. 863 The commenter’s suggested modifications
were intended to harmonize the SEC’s standard with that adopted by the CFTC. 864
Another commenter requested that the Commission clarify that any
representations made by a special entity or its representative to satisfy the rules do not
give any party any additional rights, such as rescission or monetary compensation (e.g., if
the representations turn out to be incorrect). 865

Response to Comments and Final Rule

After consideration of the comments, we are adopting Rule 15Fh-5(a), subject to
the modifications described below.

Participants

865

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

276

As a preliminary matter, we continue to believe and agree with the commenter
that Rule 15Fh-5(a) should apply to both SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants. 866 As
discussed in Section II.C. above, in making this determination, the Commission
recognizes that the statutory language of the business conduct standards generally does
not distinguish between SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants. Where the statute
does make that distinction, the Commission also makes that distinction in the
corresponding rule. 867 Here, we believe Congress intended to impose the independent
representative requirement equally with respect to SBS Dealers and Major SBS
Participants, since the specific requirements under Section 15F(h)(5)(A) of the Exchange
Act apply by their terms to both “security-based swap dealer[s] and major security-based
swap participant[s] that offer[] to or enter[] into a security-based swap with a special
entity.” 868 We also believe that the protections of Rule 15Fh-5 should inure equally to
those special entities that transact with SBS Dealers as well as those that transact with
Major SBS Participants.
Application to Any Special Entity
Moreover, the Commission continues to believe that the qualified independent
representative requirements in Rule 15Fh-5 should apply whenever an SBS Entity acts as
a counterparty to any special entity. We acknowledge the commenter’s suggestion that
the Commission “give appropriate effect to the limiting language in Exchange Act

866

See NAIPFA, supra note 5.

867

For example, the requirements under Exchange Act Section 15F(h)(4)(B) apply
only to an SBS Dealer that acts as an advisor to a special entity, a distinction that
is reflected in Rule 15Fh-4(b).

868

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(5)(A).

277

Section 15F(h)(5)(A)” regarding the types of special entities to which the independent
representative requirement applies. 869 However, given the ambiguity between the
language of Sections 15F(h)(2)(C) and 15F(h)(5)(A)(i), we believe that our interpretation
is appropriate and promotes a more consistent reading of both provisions of the statute,
providing protections to all special entities. 870
This interpretation also gives meaning to the requirement of Section
15F(h)(5)(A)(i)(VII) concerning “employee benefit plans subject to ERISA.” Although
these benefit plans are not ECPs within the meaning of subclause (I) or (II) of clause (vii)
of section 1a(18) of the Commodity Exchange Act, they are included in the category of
plans identified as special entities in Exchange Act section 15F(h)(2)(C). For these
reasons, we believe Rule 15Fh-5(a) should apply to any special entity as counterparty.
Application to Offers
The Commission continues to believe that, consistent with statutory language, the
independent representative requirement of the business conduct rules should be triggered
when an “offer” to enter into a security-based swap is made. We disagree with the
commenter that applying Rule 15Fh-5(a) at the offer stage is premature. 871 The rules are
intended to provide benefits to special entities by, among other things, requiring that a
special entity has a qualified independent representative that undertakes a duty to act in

869

See Ropes & Gray, supra note 5.

870

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42426, supra note 3. See also H.R. Conf. Rep.
111-517 (Jun. 29, 2010) (“When acting as counterparties to a pension fund,
endowment fund, or state or local government, dealers are to have a reasonable
basis to believe that the fund or governmental entity has an independent
representative advising them.”) (emphasis added).

871

278

its best interests in determining whether to enter into a security-based swap. The benefits
of these protections could be lost if the rule were to require only that the special entity
counterparty have an independent representative at the time the transaction is executed. 872
Some commenters argued that the appropriate definition of the term “offer”
should be consistent with contract law, and that a communication should only be
considered an offer when, based on the relevant facts and circumstances, it is
“actionable” or “firm.” 873 The Commission agrees with the commenter that the term
“offer” for purposes of the independent representative requirement of these business
conduct rules means an “offer to enter into a security-based swap that, if accepted, would
result in a binding contract under applicable law.” 874 Given that the relationship between
the SBS Entity and the counterparty is defined and shaped by contract (e.g., generally a
master agreement and credit documents), we believe that the contractual interpretation is
the appropriate interpretation in this context. This interpretation is also the same as the
CFTC’s interpretation of an offer to enter into a swap and would harmonize the scope of
the term offer for purposes of the independent representative requirement of these
business conduct rules. 875 We believe that this harmonization will result in efficiencies
for entities that have already established infrastructure to comply with the CFTC
standard.

279

Whether preliminary negotiations would be deemed an “offer” will depend upon
the facts and circumstances and details of the communication. 876 For example, if the
preliminary communication contains enough details (or if taken in the context of several
communications) that, if accepted, would result in a binding contract, it likely may be an
“offer” under the rule.
Reasonable Basis
The Commission recognizes and believes it appropriate that Rule 15Fh-5(a)
imposes on SBS Entities a duty of inquiry to form a reasonable basis to believe the
special entity has a qualified independent representative. The amount of due diligence
the SBS Entity must perform to form a reasonable basis to believe the independent
representative meets a particular qualification will depend upon the particular facts and
circumstances. For example, if the SBS Entity has no prior dealings or familiarity with
the particular independent representative, it will likely require more diligence on the part
of the SBS Entity than a transaction with an independent representative that the SBS
Entity has had numerous recent dealings in various different contexts. Furthermore, if
the SBS Entity has dealt with the independent representative in other contexts, but not
necessarily in the context of a security-based swap, it may require some limited diligence
to form a reasonable basis regarding the requisite qualifications.
The Commission agrees, however, with the concerns of commenters that
requiring SBS Entities to perform substantial due diligence regarding the qualifications of
independent representatives may provide SBS Entities with the ability to second guess or
negate the special entity’s choice of independent representative, which may generally
876

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra, note 5.

280

increase transaction costs for security-based swaps with special entities, and allow SBS
Entities to exert undue influence over the special entity’s selection of an independent
representative. 877 To address these concerns, final Rule 15Fh-1(b), as discussed in
Section II.D, allows SBS Entities to reasonably rely on written representations regarding
the qualifications and independence of special entities’ representatives. 878 This generally
comports with an SBS Entity’s heightened standard of care when transacting with special
entities, while avoiding the potential conflict of interest and increased transaction costs
that could result if SBS Entities effectively second-guessed special entities’ choice of
independent representatives. In addition, we are adopting safe harbors as discussed
below, pursuant to which an SBS Entity will be deemed to have a reasonable basis to
believe that the special entity has a representative that meets the qualification and
independence requirements of Rule 15Fh-5(a). We believe the availability of the safe
harbor also addresses the concerns of certain commenters that SBS Entities not exert
undue influence on the special entity’s selection of representative. 879
The Commission acknowledges one commenter’s recommended approach that
would permit a special entity to choose between either: (1) relying on the Commission’s
proposed framework regarding a reasonable basis to believe the qualifications of the
independent representative; or (2) relying on an alternative approach under which it
would be permitted to enter into off-exchange security-based swap transactions with an
SBS Entity if the special entity had a representative, whether internal or a third party, that

had been certified as able to evaluate security-based swap transactions. The commenter
contemplated that the certification process would involve the development and
implementation of a proficiency examination by the Commission or FINRA “or another
recognized testing organization,” and that a certified independent representative would be
required to complete periodic continuing education. 880 We do not believe that this
suggested alternative would appropriately provide the protections to special entities that
the statute and our proposed Rule 15Fh-5 were designed to provide. First, we believe
that this alternative would effectively permit special entities to opt out of the express
protections that the rules are intended to provide. In addition, we are not aware of the
existence of a certification process as described by the commenter, and we did not
propose and are not adopting such a process. 881
As with final Rule 15Fh-2(a), we have determined to adopt Rule 15Fh-5(a) in a
bifurcated format to avoid potential conflict with ERISA and DOL regulations, as well as
to more closely harmonize with existing CFTC business conduct rules. Rule 15Fh5(a)(1), as adopted, requires an SBS Entity that offers to enter into or enters into a
security-based swap with a special entity other than an ERISA special entity to form a
reasonable basis to believe that the special entity has a qualified independent
representative. Rule 15Fh-5(a)(2), as adopted, requires an SBS Entity that offers to enter
into or enters into a security-based swap with an ERISA special entity to have a
reasonable basis to believe that the special entity has a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3

of ERISA. By adopting separate criteria for the independent representatives of ERISA
and non-ERISA special entities, the Commission is addressing the concerns of numerous
commenters that the business conduct standards, if adopted without regard for the
potential regulatory intersections of ERISA, could cause confusion and unintended
consequences for SBS Entities dealing with ERISA plans. 882 In addition, this change will
provide greater consistency with the parallel CFTC rule, which will result in efficiencies
for SBS Entities that have already established infrastructure to comply with the CFTC
rule.
The newly bifurcated rule, detailing the requisite criteria for an SBS Entity to
form a reasonable basis to believe that ERISA and non-ERISA special entities have
qualified independent representatives, is discussed in greater detail below.

Qualified Independent Representative
i.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a)(6) would require an SBS Entity to have a reasonable
basis to believe that, in the case of a special entity that is an employee benefit plan
subject to ERISA, the independent representative was a “fiduciary” as defined in section

3(21) of that Act (29 U.S.C. 1002). 883 The proposed rule was not intended to limit,
restrict, or otherwise affect the fiduciary’s duties and obligations under ERISA. 884
The Proposing Release solicited feedback regarding any specific requirements
that should be imposed on SBS Entities with respect to this obligation, as well as what
other independent representative qualifications might be deemed satisfied if an
independent representative of an employee benefit plan subject to ERISA, is a fiduciary
as defined in section 3 of ERISA.
ii.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission received six comment letters advocating a presumption of
qualification for ERISA plan fiduciaries, since ERISA already imposes fiduciary duties
upon the person who decides whether to enter into a security-based swap on behalf of an
ERISA plan, and imposes on this person a statutory duty to act in the best interests of the
plan and its participants, thereby prohibiting certain self-dealing transactions. 885
According to these commenters, the Commission’s proposed standards would be
unnecessary, redundant, would overlap with ERISA’s standards, and would only serve to

Entity’s reliance on a representation from the special entity to form this

increase the administrative burden and cost on SBS Entities without any corresponding
benefit. 886
To address the potential conflict with ERISA standards, one commenter suggested
that the Commission’s definition of “independent representative” should be inapplicable
to ERISA plans, and that the Commission should merely cross-reference the requirements
under ERISA for ERISA representatives. 887
Another commenter supported the presumptive qualification for ERISA plan
fiduciaries, provided that the plan satisfied a minimum $1 billion net asset requirement
for institutional investor organizations. 888 The commenter asserted that no public policy
objective would be achieved by permitting an SBS Entity to reject a risk manager
fiduciary selected by a sophisticated institutional investor organization with over $1
billion in net assets, which did not require the protections of the rules. 889
Since the adoption of the CFTC’s final rules, another commenter recently
advocated for the separate treatment of independent representatives of special entities
subject to ERISA. 890 Under this commenter’s proposal, an SBS Entity that transacts with
a special entity subject to Title I of ERISA must have a reasonable belief that the
qualified independent representative is a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3 of ERISA. 891
An SBS Entity that transacts with a non-ERISA special entity would be required to form

a reasonable belief that the special entity has a qualified independent representative,
defined by specific criteria. The commenter’s proposed modification recognizes “the
unique fiduciary regime already applicable to such special entities,” and harmonizes the
Commission’s criteria for qualified independent representatives with those of the
CFTC. 892
iii.

Response to Comments and Final Rule

After consideration of the comments, the Commission is reformulating the rules
to reflect a separate treatment for transactions with special entities subject to ERISA, and
transactions with special entities other than those subject to ERISA. Toward this end, we
have bifurcated Rule 15Fh-5(a) into parts (a)(1) (applicable to dealings with special
entities other than those subject to ERISA), and (a)(2) (applicable to dealings with special
entities subject to ERISA).
Under Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1), as adopted, an SBS Entity that transacts with a special
entity that is not subject to ERISA must have a reasonable basis to believe that the special
entity has a qualified independent representative. As defined in the rule, a qualified
independent representative is a representative who: has sufficient knowledge to evaluate
the transaction and risks; is not subject to a statutory disqualification; undertakes a duty
to act in the best interests of the special entity; makes appropriate and timely disclosures
to the special entity of material information concerning the security-based swap; will
provide written representations to the special entity regarding fair pricing and the
appropriateness of the security-based swap; in the case of a special entity defined in
15Fh-2(2) or (5), is subject to pay to play rules of the Commission, the CFTC, or a SRO
892

Id.

286

subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission or the CFTC; and is independent of the SBS
Entity. These qualifications are addressed, separately, in Section II.H.7, infra.
Under new Rule 15Fh-5(a)(2), (formerly proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a)(6)), an SBS
Entity that transacts with a special entity subject to ERISA must have a reasonable basis
to believe that the special entity has a representative that is a fiduciary, as defined in
Section 3 of ERISA. 893 In this regard, the SBS Entity need not undertake further inquiry
into the ERISA fiduciary’s qualifications. Such a presumption is based on the preexisting, comprehensive federal regulatory regime governing ERISA fiduciaries. 894
The Commission agrees with commenters that ERISA fiduciaries should be
presumptively deemed qualified as special entity representatives, 895 particularly because
an ERISA fiduciary is already required by statute and regulations to, among other things,
act with prudence and loyalty when evaluating a transaction for an ERISA plan. 896
Moreover, as several commenters noted, to overlap existing ERISA standards with the
business conduct standards would be unnecessary, redundant, and would unnecessarily
increase administrative costs for SBS Entities. 897

This bifurcated rule is designed to address the commenter’s concerns regarding
the need to align the Commission’s treatment of ERISA plans with that of the CFTC, 898
and will reflect the potential intersection of the business conduct rules with the
comprehensive framework of regulation under ERISA. Specifically, as discussed above
in Section I.D., supra, the bifurcated format of the rule addresses the concerns of
numerous commenters that the intersection between ERISA’s existing fiduciary
regulation and the business conduct standards could lead to conflict and unintended
consequences for SBS Entities transacting with ERISA special entities, up to and
including the preclusion of ERISA plans from participating in security-based swap
markets in the future. 899 By providing separate means for SBS Entities to comply with
the rules when transacting with ERISA and non-ERISA special entities, the final rule will
avoid the potential conflict between the comprehensive framework of regulation under
ERISA and business conduct rule regimes.
However, the Commission declines the commenter’s suggestion to exclude
ERISA plans with a minimum net asset requirement from the requirements of the rule. 900
Rule 15Fh-5 is designed to ensure that special entities are represented by a qualified
independent representative pursuant to the statutory requirement. The Commission does
not believe that it is appropriate in this context to provide an exception to ERISA plans
from the protections of representation by a qualified and independent representative
based on a net asset threshold. Different entities will have differing levels of

understanding of the security-based swap market, which may or may not be impacted by
the amount of their net assets. More generally, the rules are intended to provide certain
protections to special entities, and we think it appropriate to apply the rules so that special
entities receive the benefits of those rules.
c.

Definition of “Independent Representative”
i.

Proposed Rule

As noted above, an SBS Entity must have a reasonable basis to believe that a
special entity has a “qualified independent representative.” Proposed Rule 15Fh-2(c)
would establish parameters for the term “independent representative” of a special entity.
For instance, proposed Rule 15Fh-2(c)(1) would generally require that a
representative of a special entity be “independent” of the SBS Entity that is the
counterparty to a proposed security-based swap. Proposed Rule 15Fh-2(c)(2) would
provide that a representative of a special entity is “independent” of an SBS Entity if the
representative does not have a relationship with the SBS Entity, whether compensatory or
otherwise, that reasonably could affect the independent judgment or decision-making of
the representative. In the Proposing Release, the Commission noted that the SBS Entity
should obtain the necessary information to determine if, in fact, a relationship existed
between the SBS Entity and the independent representative that could impair the
independence of the representative in making decisions that affect the SBS Entity.
Proposed Rule 15Fh-2(c)(3) would deem a representative of a special entity to be
independent of an SBS Entity where two conditions are satisfied: (i) the representative is
not and, within one year, was not an associated person of the SBS Entity; and (ii) the
representative had not received more than ten percent of its gross revenues over the past

289

year, directly or indirectly, from the SBS Entity. This latter restriction would apply, for
example, with respect to revenues received as a result of referrals by the SBS Entity. It
was intended to encompass situations where a representative was hired by the special
entity as a result of a recommendation by the SBS Entity. The restriction would also
apply to revenues received, directly or indirectly, from associated persons of the SBS
Entity.
In order for an SBS Entity to reasonably believe that the independent
representative received less than ten percent of its gross revenue over the past year from
the SBS Entity, the Commission noted that the SBS Entity would likely need to obtain
information regarding the independent representative’s gross revenues from either the
special entity or independent representative.
ii.

Comments on the Proposed Rule
Independence from the Special Entity

The Commission requested comment on whether an independent representative
must be independent of the special entity entering into the security-based swap, or
whether the representative need only be independent of the SBS Entity. All five
commenters agreed that the independent representative need only be independent from
the SBS Entity, and emphasized that the intent of the proposed rule was to ensure a
special entity received advice from someone in no way affiliated with an SBS Entity. 901
One commenter, representing two trade associations for municipal power
producers, argued that the intended benefit of the proposed independent representative

901

See APPA, supra note 5; Ropes & Gray, supra note 5; BlackRock, supra note 5;
GFOA, supra note 5; ABA Committees, supra note 5.

290

requirement was to ensure that a special entity receives security-based swap advice from
a person other than the SBS Entity – not to force special entities to hire third-parties as
independent representatives. 902 The commenter noted that although many municipal
power producers rely on third-party advisors when entering interest-rate swaps, they have
internal experts to advise them on energy contracts.
Another commenter asserted that the legislative history for Dodd-Frank indicated
that a representative’s “independence” referred to its independence from the dealer or
broker – not its independence from the special entity. 903 The commenter pointed out that
Congress specifically recognized the possibility that special entities would use an inhouse risk specialist, and that the proposed rules seemed to incorporate this
assumption. 904
Standards for “Independence”
The Commission solicited comment regarding whether to adopt a different test
for a representative’s independence, or whether the definition of “independent
representative” should exclude certain categories of associated persons. Eleven
comment letters addressed the independence test in proposed Rule 15Fh-2(c)(2)-(3). 905

291

Four commenters argued that the proposed rule would not sufficiently ensure a
representative’s independence. 906 For instance, one commenter suggested that the oneyear prohibition on a representative being an associated person of the SBS Entity be
extended to two years. 907 This commenter also recommended that representatives who
receive any compensation of any kind, directly or indirectly, from an SBS Entity during
the prior year be disqualified. 908 According to this commenter, representatives and
associated persons should be barred from, directly or indirectly, working for or receiving
compensation from any SBS Entities for one year to act as an independent representative
for any special entity. 909
Another commenter argued that under the proposed rule, a representative might
be deemed to be independent even if he or she “worked with the SBS Entity as recently
as a year ago, was recommended by the SBS Entity, has a direct business relationship
with the SBS Entity that makes the representative highly financially dependent on that
entity, and earns more of its revenues from the SBS Entity than from the Special Entity
he or she purports to represent.” 910 This commenter also noted that, under the proposed
rule, a representative could earn virtually all of its gross revenues from various SBS
Entities, so long as no more than ten percent originated from the entity on the other side
of the transaction. For these reasons, the commenter urged the Commission to adopt

instead the version of the independence standard proposed by the CFTC, under which a
representative would be deemed to be independent if: “(1) the representative is not and,
within one year, was not an associated person of the swap dealer or major swap
participant, within the meaning of Section 1a(4) of the Act; (2) there is no principal
relationship between the representative of the Special Entity and the swap dealer or major
swap participant; and (3) the representative does not have a material business relationship
with the swap dealer or major swap participant, provided however, that if the
representative received any compensation from the swap dealer or major swap
participant, the swap dealer or major swap participant must ensure that the Special Entity
is informed of the compensation and the Special Entity agrees in writing, in consultation
with the representative, that the compensation does not constitute a material business
relationship.” 911
Similarly, since the adoption of the CFTC’s final business conduct rules, one
commenter has argued that the Commission should harmonize its standards of
independence with those of the CFTC, replacing the SEC’s restriction on revenues
received by the independent representative from the SBS Entity with the following
qualifications: (1) the representative is not, and within one year of representing the
special entity in connection with the security-based swap, was not an associated person of
the SBS Entity; (2) there is no principal relationship between the special entity’s
representative and the SBS Entity; (3) the representative provides timely and effective
disclosures to the special entity of all material conflicts of interest, complies with policies

and procedures designed to mitigate conflicts of interest, is not directly or indirectly
controlled by the SBS Entity, and does not receive referrals, recommendations, or
introductions from the SBS Entity within one year of representing the special entity in
connection with the security-based swap. 912 As the commenter asserted, “the CFTC’s
standard has, in our members’ experiences, proved sufficient to ensure the independence
of special entity representatives and mitigate possible conflicts of interest, while also
establishing an objective standard that special entities can apply in practice. As a result,
we believe harmonization would achieve the proposed rules’ intended objective while
also minimizing the extent to which SBS Entities and special entities need to incur
significant additional costs.” 913
A third commenter suggested that the Commission revise the independence test
for special entity representatives by: (1) using ERISA standards in assessing the
independence of a representative (but rejecting the DOL’s fiduciary standard, under
which a fiduciary may not derive more than 1% of its annual income from a party in
interest and its affiliates); (2) considering a representative’s relationships with an SBS
Entity on behalf of multiple special entities, including the representative’s relationships
with an SBS Entity outside of the security-based swap transaction at issue; (3) including
the revenues of an independent representative’s affiliates in applying the gross revenues
test; (4) decreasing the ten-percent gross revenue threshold; and (5) adopting a two-year
timeframe (rather than one year) to determine whether a representative is independent of

912

913

294

the SBS Entity. 914 The commenter argued that an independent representative should be
permitted to receive compensation from the proceeds of a security-based swap, so long as
the compensation was authorized by, and paid at the written direction of, the special
entity. 915 However, the commenter did not believe that a special entity should be allowed
to consent to an independent representative’s conflicts of interest, even if fully disclosed,
as such conflicts might still affect the independence of the representative. 916
The sole commenter that supported the independence test as proposed did so on
the grounds that market participants would benefit from the certainty of its safe
harbor. 917
Another commenter argued that the proposed rules’ definition of “independent
representative” should not apply to ERISA plans, as ERISA already defines the criteria
for “independence” of a representative. 918 According to this commenter, if a plan’s
representative is not independent of the plan’s counterparty, the transaction violates the
prohibited transaction rules under ERISA section 406(b). Rather than adopt such
overlapping regulations, the commenter suggested cross-referencing the independence
requirements under ERISA. Otherwise, the prohibition on investment managers who
receive revenues from SBS Dealers from serving as independent representatives could
cause plans to lose their best investment managers and counterparties. Moreover, the

commenter argued that “the administrative burden of applying the gross revenue test
could in many cases be enormous at best and simply unworkable at worst.” 919
However, the majority of commenters urged the Commission to modify the
proposed independence standards. For instance, while one commenter supported the
Commission’s one-year prohibition on associated persons of SBS Entities serving as
special entity representatives, the commenter suggested four changes to the gross
revenues component of the proposed rule: (1) only payments by or on behalf of the SBS
Entity (not by or on behalf of any affiliates or other associated persons) should be taken
into account; (2) the revenue computations should be based on the representative’s prior
fiscal year rather than a rolling twelve-month look-back to simplify the calculations and
reduce compliance costs; (3) payments to any affiliate (other than a wholly-owned
subsidiary) of the representative should not be taken into account for purposes of this test;
and (4) an SBS Entity should be able to rely on representations from the representative as
to its gross revenues and whether payments that have been made to the representative
equal or exceed the ten percent threshold. 920
Another commenter proposed reducing the one year disqualification period for
association with the SBS Entity to six months. 921 This commenter also suggested
excluding from the gross revenue test: (1) income from referrals from the gross revenue

919

921

See APPA, supra note 5.

296

test, because referrals “can be difficult to track;” and (2) income paid by an SBS Entity
on behalf of the special entity. 922
A third commenter generally opposed the proposed rule on the basis that it was
unclear, would require costly enhancements to compliance systems, and “would be
particularly problematic in instances where a corporate transaction changes the identity of
associated persons during the look-back year.” 923 With respect to the first prong of the
proposed rule, this commenter supported eliminating the one-year look back period, as it
believed the costs of compliance with that provision would outweigh any benefits.
Instead, the commenter argued that “independence” should be established if the
representative is not an associated person of an SBS Entity at the time of the
transaction. 924 With respect to the gross revenue test, the commenter argued that the term
“indirect compensation” was vague, and that “determining what would comprise indirect
compensation and establishing a compliance system to track that indirect compensation
represents a significant and time consuming burden,” the expense of which would likely
be passed on to special entities. 925 The commenter therefore suggested limiting the gross
revenue test to direct revenue received by the representative from the SBS Dealer –and
not its affiliates. 926
A fourth commenter objected to the compliance burdens raised by the proposed
rule, as well as various implementation concerns on the grounds that both prongs of the

test were “moving targets” that would substantially complicate compliance and impose
additional burdens and costs on advisors and special entities. 927 The commenter
recommended that the Commission eliminate the twelve-month “look-back” provision
altogether, but argued that if the Commission retained this provision, it should apply only
where a continuing agreement exists between the representative and the SBS Entity (such
as an ongoing corporate services agreement), that the one-year period be defined as a
calendar year rather than a rolling twelve-month period, and that it should only be
triggered by the SBS Entity and the representative – not by any associated persons of the
SBS Entity or the representative. 928 This commenter additionally urged the Commission
to eliminate the gross revenue test on the grounds that it was unduly restrictive and
difficult to apply. However, if the Commission retained the gross revenue test, the
commenter requested that the final rule clarify how gross revenues are to be calculated. 929
Another commenter argued that the final version of proposed Rule 15Fh-2(c)
clarify that the ten percent gross revenue test would not apply to any independent
representative employed by the special entity, as such a prohibition would be
inappropriate. 930 The commenter also suggested that the prohibition on independent
representatives who have worked for an SBS Entity within the past year should not
apply if the independent representative is an employee of the special entity, who owes
the special entity a fiduciary duty. 931 The commenter asserted that if an independent

representative is an employee of and owes a fiduciary duty to an institutional investor
organization, an SBS Entity should have no authority to assess the representative’s
qualifications. The commenter pointed out that, as a fiduciary, the employee’s prior
employment by an SBS Entity would be irrelevant – since any actual breach of
fiduciary duty would be governed by the special entity’s charter, state law or other
applicable legal requirements, rather than the Dodd-Frank Act. 932
iii.

Response to Comments and Final Rule

After consideration of the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh-2(c),
with certain modifications. First, we moved the rule defining the “independence” of a
special entity’s representative from Rule 15Fh-2 to Rule 15Fh-5 in an effort to minimize
confusion, and to consolidate the requirements of the qualified independent
representative into Rule 15Fh-5. Specifically, the Commission is renumbering proposed
Rule 15Fh-2(c) as Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vii). In doing so, we have subsumed the
requirement that a representative be independent of the SBS Entity under the criteria for a
special entity’s qualified independent representative.
Consistent with our proposal and with comments received, we continue to believe
that a qualified independent representative should be independent of the SBS Entity, but
need not be independent of the special entity itself. 933 We do not believe that special
entities would receive any greater protection by being required to incur the cost of
retaining a representative that was independent of the special entity; in fact, the special
entity may be better served by someone who has an ongoing relationship with it and is

more familiar with the uses of the proceeds of the swap and other needs of the special
entity. Although the Dodd-Frank Act is silent concerning the question of independence
from the special entity, nothing in the Dodd-Frank Act precludes the use of a qualified
independent representative that is affiliated with the special entity. Accordingly, Rule
15Fh-5(a)(1) only requires that the independent representative be independent of the SBS
Entity to be a qualified independent representative.
We are adopting Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vii) (formerly proposed Rules 15Fh-2(c)(1)
and (2)) with one modification. Proposed Rule 15Fh-2(c)(1) defined an independent
representative of a special entity, in part, as “independent of the security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant that is the counterparty to a proposed
security-based swap.” Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vii) as adopted eliminates the phrase “that is
the counterparty to a proposed security-based swap” from the definition. As described
immediately below, this change is intended to reconcile the use of the term “qualified
independent representative” in Rules 15Fh-5(a)(1) and 15Fh-2(a)(2) as adopted.
Specifically, Rule 15Fh-2(a)(2) as proposed and as adopted, under which an SBS
Dealer may seek to establish that it is not acting as an advisor to a special entity, refers to
the definition of “qualified independent representative” as defined in Rule 15Fh-5(a). 934
However, although the relevant part of the definition of the term “independent
representative of a special entity” in proposed Rule 15Fh-2(c)(1) included the phrase
“that is a counterparty to a proposed security-based swap,” the requirements in Rule
15Fh-2(a)(2) (as proposed and as adopted) are not limited to transactions in which the
934

Specifically, Rule 15Fh-2(a)(2) requires, among other things, a written
representation by the special entity that it “will rely on advice from a qualified
independent representative as defined in [Rule] 15Fh-5(a)” (emphasis added).

SBS Dealer is a counterparty to the special entity with respect to the security-based swap.
Thus, as noted, we are eliminating the phrase “that is the counterparty to a proposed
security-based swap” in Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vii) as adopted to reconcile the cross
reference to the term “qualified independent representative” in Rule 15Fh-2(a)(2).
This change will not alter the scope of Rule 15Fh-5(a) as adopted, because that
rule is only applicable to an SBS Entity acting as counterparty to a special entity. It will,
however, align the definition of qualified independent representative with the scope of
Rule 15Fh-2(a), which applies to recommended transactions whether or not the SBS
Dealer is a counterparty to the recommended security-based swap. As a result, there
must always be someone independent of the SBS Dealer reviewing any recommended
security-based swap transaction on behalf of the special entity, whether or not the SBS
Dealer making the recommendation is the counterparty to the transaction. Furthermore,
the elimination of the phrase “that is the counterparty to a proposed security-based swap”
in the rule as adopted will harmonize the rule more closely with the parallel CFTC
requirement.
Under Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vii)(A) as adopted, a representative of a special entity is
independent of an SBS Entity if the representative does not have a relationship with the
SBS Entity, “whether compensatory or otherwise, that reasonably could affect the
independent judgment or decision-making of the representative.” Rule 15Fh5(a)(1)(vii)(B) (as adopted) modifies the criteria for determining the independence of the
representative that was proposed in proposed Rule 15Fh-2(c)(3) by replacing the ten
percent gross revenues test with requirements for timely disclosures of all material
conflicts of interest and a prohibition against referrals, recommendations or introductions

301

by the SBS Entity within one year of the representative’s representation of the special
entity. Under Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vii)(B) as adopted, a representative of a special entity
will be deemed to be independent of an SBS Entity if three conditions are met: (1) the
representative is not and, within one year of representing the special entity in connection
with the security-based swap, was not an associated person of the SBS Entity; (2) the
representative provides timely disclosures to the special entity of all material conflicts of
interest that could reasonably affect the judgment or decision making of the
representative with respect to its obligations to the special entity and complies with
policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage and mitigate such material
conflicts of interest; and (3) the SBS Entity did not refer, recommend, or introduce the
representative to the special entity within one year of the representative’s representation
of the special entity in connection with the security-based swap.
Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vii)(B)(1) (formerly proposed Rule 15Fh-2(c)(2)) requires that
the independent representative is not and was not an associated person of the SBS Entity
“within one year of representing the special entity in connection with the security-based
swap.” One commenter agreed with the one-year time frame in this provision. 935 One
commenter suggested that one year was not long enough and suggested a two-year look
back 936 and another commenter suggested that one year was too long and suggested a sixmonth look back. 937 After consideration of the comments, the Commission continues to
believe that an appropriate amount of time is necessary to “cool off” any association with

935

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

936

See CFA, supra note 5.

937

See APPA, supra note 5.

302

an SBS Entity before being considered independent of the SBS Entity, and believes that a
one-year period between being an associated person of an SBS Entity and functioning as
an independent representative is an appropriate amount of time. We disagree with the
commenter that a shorter six-month look back would be appropriate, as we believe that a
one-year cooling off period provides greater assurances of independence. At the same
time, we do not want to unnecessarily place lengthy restrictions on a representative’s
ability to work as an independent representative or unnecessarily restrict a special entity’s
access to qualified independent representatives. For this reason, we believe that a one
year restriction strikes an appropriate balance. In addition to the comments received, we
note that many market participants have established compliance policies and procedures
to address a one-year look-back to comply with the CFTC rule that requires that the
independent representative was not an associated person of the Swap Entity within the
preceding twelve months or the independent representative complied with policies and
procedures reasonably designed to manage and mitigate the conflict of being an
associated person within the last twelve months. 938
Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vii)(B)(2) adds the new requirement that a representative must
provide timely disclosures to the special entity of all material conflicts of interest that
could reasonably affect the judgment or decision making of the representative regarding
its obligations to the special entity, and the representative must comply with policies and
procedures reasonably designed to manage and mitigate such material conflicts of
interest. This requirement establishes a standard that is designed to support the
development of an SBS Entity’s reasonable belief regarding the independence of the
938

See CFTC Adopting Release, 77 FR at 9795, supra note 21.

303

representative advising a special entity. One commenter recommended adopting such a
requirement, asserting that the CFTC standard, including the requirement for timely
disclosures has, in their “members’ experiences proved sufficient to ensure the
independence of special entity representatives and mitigate possible conflicts of interest,
while also establishing an objective standard that special entities can apply in
practice.” 939 In addition, harmonization with the parallel CFTC rule will result in
efficiencies for SBS Entities that have already established infrastructure to comply with
the CFTC rule.
In the Commission’s view, to be “timely,” a representative’s disclosures must
allow the special entity sufficient opportunity to assess the likelihood or magnitude of a
conflict of interest prior to entering into the security-based swap.
To determine which conflicts of interest disclosures are required, an SBS Entity
generally would need a reasonable basis to believe that the representative reviewed its
relationships with the SBS Entity and its affiliates, including lines of business in which
the representative solicits business. Additionally, where applicable, the SBS Entity
generally would also need a reasonable basis to believe the representative reviewed the
relationships of its principals and employees, who could affect the judgment or decision
making of the representative on behalf of the special entity.
Lastly, Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vii)(B)(3) replaces the proposed “gross revenues” test
with a standard under which a representative will not be deemed independent if the SBS
Entity refers, recommends, or introduces the representative to the special entity within
one year of the representative’s representation of the special entity in connection with the
939

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5.

304

security-based swap. The change is intended to provide a simpler standard for achieving
the policy goal that a special entity’s choice of representative and the advice the
representative provides should be made without any influence or input from the SBS
Entity.
In making this modification to the rule as adopted, the Commission seeks to
address commenters’ concerns about cost, clarity, and practicality. 940 Commenters had
expressed concerns regarding the gross revenues test and an SBS Entity’s ability to
accurately track the revenues. 941 One commenter suggested eliminating the gross
revenues standard altogether. 942 After consideration of the comments, the Commission
believes that the disclosures provided and the prohibition against referrals,
940

See SIFMA (August 2011), supra note 5; FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5;
APPA, supra note 5; BlackRock, supra note 5; and SIFMA (August 2015), supra
note 5.

941

See SIFMA (August 2011), supra note 5 (expressing concerns about calculating a
rolling twelve months of revenues and arguing that the ten percent threshold
would create a revenue ceiling that is unduly restrictive and difficult to apply
(e.g., a representative to multiple collective investment vehicles would be
required to consider each of its multiple distributors for each collective
investment vehicle as a source of indirect revenue)); FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra
note 5 (arguing for clarification that (1) payments to or from affiliates of the SBS
Entity or representative would not be taken into account; (2) revenue
computations should be determined as of the end of the prior fiscal year; and (3)
the SBS Entity may rely on representations from the representative as to its gross
revenues and whether payments equal or exceed the ten percent threshold);
APPA, supra note 5 (suggesting (1) elimination of income from referrals from the
gross revenue test because referrals are difficult to track; and (2) gross revenues
test should not take into account income paid by an SBS Entity on behalf of the
special entity); BlackRock, supra note 5 (expressing concerns regarding what
would comprise “indirect compensation” and the compliance systems to track it
and arguing that revenue received from affiliates of the SBS Dealer should not be
considered); and SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5 (arguing for the
replacement of the gross revenues test with the CFTC standard).

recommendations or introductions adequately addresses concerns regarding
independence more simply and directly than the proposed “gross revenues” test. 943
Furthermore, this prohibition harmonizes the Commission’s standards for the
independence of the representative with those of the CFTC.
6.

Qualifications of the Independent Representative

Proposed Rules 15Fh-5(a)(1)(i) – (vii) would list the required qualifications of a
special entity’s independent representative. The qualifications would be that the
independent representative: (1) has sufficient knowledge to evaluate a security-based
swap and its risks; (2) is not subject to statutory disqualification; (3) will undertake a duty
to act in the best interests of the special entity; (4) makes appropriate and timely
disclosures to the special entity of material information concerning the security-based
swap; (5) will provide written representations to the special entity regarding fair pricing
and the appropriateness of the security-based swap; (6) (in the case of employee benefit
plans subject to ERISA) is a fiduciary as defined in ERISA; and (7) is subject to the pay
to play prohibitions of the Commission, the CFTC, or an SRO that is subject to the
jurisdiction of the Commission or the CFTC. Each of these proposed qualifications is
discussed in turn below.

943

Although the independence safe harbor under Rule 15Fh-5(a)(vii)(B) does not
include a gross revenues test, SBS Entities should consider whether the sources of
revenues of a representative create a conflict of interest that must be disclosed
pursuant to Rule 15Fh-5(a)(vii)(B)(2) or 15Fh-5(b) or otherwise impede the
independence of the representative. Depending on the facts and circumstances,
failure to disclose material conflicts of interest when there is a recommendation
by a broker-dealer can be a violation of the antifraud rules. See, e.g., Chasins,
438 F.2d at 1172.

306

As discussed above in Section II.H.5.a.iii.B and more fully below, the rules as
adopted will distinguish between transactions with special entities subject to ERISA, and
transactions with special entities other than those subject to ERISA. Specifically, Rule
15Fh-5(a)(1) as adopted addresses the qualifications for the independent representatives
of special entities other than those subject to regulation under ERISA, and Rule 15Fh5(a)(2) as adopted addresses the qualifications for independent representatives of special
entities subject to regulation under ERISA.
a. Written or Other Representations Regarding Qualifications
i.

Proposal

In the Proposing Release, the Commission also requested comment regarding
whether independent representatives must furnish written representations about their
qualifications, or whether the rules should permit other means of establishing that a
special entity’s independent representative possessed the requisite qualifications.
ii.

Comments on the Proposal

The Commission received three comment letters on this point, all in favor of a
written representation requirement. 944 Although one such commenter agreed that written
representations should be sufficient to ensure that a qualified independent swap advisor
had been hired, the commenter proposed that the written representations include a
verification that the external swap advisor had registered with and met professional
standards set by the appropriate regulatory body overseeing swap advisors. 945 According
to the commenter, this would provide for independent verification that was not associated

944

945

See GFOA, supra note 5.

307

with the SBS Dealer or the special entity, thereby minimizing any potential conflict of
interests. 946
Another commenter suggested that, in the case of an internal representative,
written representations should be obtained either from the representative or from the
special entity, or a combination of the two, depending on the circumstances. 947 In the
case of third-party representatives, the commenter suggested that the third-party
representative provide the statement either directly to the SBS Entity or to the special
entity acknowledging that the statement would be relied on by SBS Entities for purposes
of the business conduct rules. 948
iii.

Response to Comments and Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission has determined not to mandate
a manner of compliance with the requirements of Rule 15Fh-5(a). As discussed above,
the obligation is on the SBS Entity to have a reasonable basis for believing that an
independent representative has the necessary qualifications. An SBS Entity may use
various means, such as reliance on representations from the special entity or its
representative or due diligence, to form its reasonable basis to believe the special entity’s
independent representative meets the qualifications outlined in Rule 15Fh-5(a).

Id. See also SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5 (asserting that an SBS Entity
should be deemed to have formed a reasonable basis to believe that a special
entity has a qualified independent representative by relying on written
representations that the representative is either an ERISA fiduciary, or that the
representative satisfies the criteria for a qualified independent representative).

308

When an SBS Entity is relying on representations from a special entity or its
representative to satisfy the requirements of the rule, the requirements of Rule 15Fh-1(b)
will apply. 949 Consistent with our approach to representations used to make institutional
suitability determinations, we believe that parties should be able to make representations
regarding the knowledge and qualifications of the independent representative on a
transaction-by-transaction basis, on an asset-class-by-asset-class basis, or broadly in
terms of all potential transactions between the parties. However, where there is an
indication that the independent representative is not capable of independently evaluating
investment risks, or does not intend to exercise independent judgment regarding all of an
SBS Entity’s recommendations, the SBS Entity necessarily will have to be more specific
in its approach. For instance, in some cases, an SBS Entity may be unable to determine
that an independent representative is capable of independently evaluating investment
risks with respect to any security-based swap. In other cases, the SBS Entity may
determine that the independent representative is generally capable of evaluating
investment risks with respect to some categories or types of security-based swaps, but
that the independent representative may not be able to understand a particular type of
security-based swap or its risk.

Proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1) would require an SBS Entity to have a reasonable

the security-based transaction and related risks.
ii.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Proposing Release solicited comment regarding what circumstances, if any,
would give rise to a presumption of qualification for certain independent representatives
other than ERISA fiduciaries.
Presumptive Qualification
Two commenters supported a finding of presumptive qualification for
sophisticated, professional advisers, such as banks, Commission-registered investment
advisers, registered municipal advisors, or other similarly qualified professionals. 950 The
commenter stated its view that applicable federal and/or state regulations governing these
entities already impose requirements that ensure a minimum qualification level, and any
additional evaluation of such representatives’ qualifications would add little or no value
to a special entity’s representative selection process. 951
Other commenters supported the presumption of qualification for in-house
representatives of a special entity, since those representatives should presumably act in
the best interests of the special entity by virtue of their employment with the special
entity. 952 More specifically, one commenter supported this presumption on the grounds
that the representative had been hired by the special entity to perform a hedging and risk

control function, that he or she would be subject to direct control by his or her employer,
and that he or she would be subject to regular review. 953 Another commenter supported
this presumption so long as the in-house representative met established requirements for
qualification, testing and continuing education. 954
Similarly, one commenter supported the presumption of qualification for
independent representatives where a governmental entity had verified the qualifications
of its independent representative employee through the hiring process. 955
Registration of Representative as Municipal
Advisor or Investment Adviser
In the Proposing Release, the Commission asked whether to require that an
independent representative be registered as a municipal advisor or an investment adviser
or otherwise subject to regulation, such as banking regulation. 956 Three commenters
expressed some support for the proposed registration requirement for independent
representatives, 957 while one commenter opposed it. 958

953

See APPA, supra note 5.

954

See NAIPFA, supra note 5. NAIPFA did not support a presumption of
qualification for “a sophisticated, professional adviser such as a bank,
Commission-registered investment adviser, insurance company or other
qualifying QPAM or INHAM for Special Entities subject to ERISA, a registered
municipal advisor, or a similar qualified professional.”

955

See GFOA, supra note 5.

956

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42429, supra note 3. Such registration would
subject independent representatives to rules such as MSRB rules (for example,
Notice 2011-04 Pay to Play Rules for Municipal Advisors) or other regulation (for
example, 17 CFR 275.206(4)-5). See also Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42431

See APPA, supra note 5.

311

The first commenter supporting the registration requirement suggested that the
written representations regarding a representative’s qualifications include a verification
that the external swap advisor had registered with and met professional standards set by
the appropriate regulatory body overseeing swap advisors. 959
Another commenter supported the requirement that independent representatives
be registered with the Commission as municipal advisors or investment advisers, or that
they otherwise be subject to regulation, such as banking regulations, under which the
independent representative would be bound by a fiduciary duty of loyalty and care at all
times. 960
The third commenter requested that the Commission establish a safe harbor
permitting an SBS Entity to conclude that the special entity’s representative was
“qualified” (but not necessarily “independent”) if the representative was a registered
municipal advisor or an SEC-registered investment adviser that provides investment
advice with respect to security-based swaps (or a foreign entity having an equivalent
status abroad). 961
As noted above, one commenter opposed requiring employees of a special entity
to register in any capacity, and suggested that any requirement to register third-party
representatives should first be issued in the form of a notice of proposed rulemaking. 962

312

In the Proposing Release, the Commission requested comment regarding whether
a proficiency examination should be developed to assess the qualifications of
independent representatives. Four commenters supported the development and usage of a
proficiency examination, 963 while one commenter opposed any proficiency examination
for in-house representatives. 964
One commenter, advocating for a proficiency examination, argued that such
testing should be mandatory for both in-house and third-party representatives. 965 Another
commenter suggested that the proficiency examination could be developed by the
Commission, an SRO (e.g., FINRA), or another recognized testing organization. 966
Furthermore, after passing the examination, this commenter suggested that an
independent representative be required to complete periodic continuing education. 967
On the other hand, one commenter opposed any proficiency examination for inhouse representatives, and argued that a proficiency exam for third-party representatives
might provide a false sense of expertise. 968 This commenter also expressed concern that
an examination requirement might, directly or indirectly, impose additional costs or
burdens on special entities or SBS Entities. 969

In the Proposing Release, the Commission asked whether an SBS Entity should
be required to reevaluate (or, as applicable, require a new written representation
regarding) the qualifications of the independent representative on a periodic basis.
The Commission received three comment letters in response to the request for
comment. 970 The first commenter viewed the reevaluation of a representative’s
qualifications as unnecessary if independent representatives were subject to continuing
education and periodic testing requirements. 971 Another commenter suggested that the
Commission permit the representations regarding a representative’s qualifications to be
set forth in a letter that could be relied on for the duration of a swap master agreement. 972
However, this commenter acknowledged a value in requiring periodic re-certification for
third-party representatives, and recommended that such re-certification occur every two
years. 973 The third commenter was concerned that trade-by-trade documentation of the
independent representative criteria could reduce the speed of trade execution for special
entities and add compliance burdens to each transaction. 974 This commenter requested
that the Commission clarify that an SBS Dealer may meet its burden of confirming the
qualifications of an independent representative through appropriate representations
provided by the special entity no more frequently than annually. 975

Upon consideration of the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh5(a)(1)(i) (formerly proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)), as proposed.
Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(i) as adopted requires that SBS Entities have a reasonable basis
to believe that the independent representative has sufficient knowledge to evaluate the
transaction and risks. The independent representative may be required to register by the
statutes and rules of another regulatory regime, such as municipal advisor or investment
adviser, and nothing in the business conduct standards modifies or otherwise alters those
registration requirements. Whether or not an independent representative is otherwise
registered under a different regulatory regime may inform the SBS Entity’s view of the
independent representative’s knowledge and qualifications, but would not automatically
satisfy the qualification requirements of the independent representative. For example, an
independent representative registered as an investment adviser may be very
knowledgeable with respect to a variety of asset classes that do not include security-based
swaps.
While some commenters supported the development of a proficiency
examination, we are neither developing nor requiring that a proficiency examination be
developed to assess the qualifications of independent representatives. 976 As noted above,
an SBS Entity may reasonably rely on written representations about the qualifications of
the independent representative to satisfy this obligation. In this regard, the Commission

976

See CFA, supra note 5; CalPERS (August 2011), supra note 5; GFOA, supra note
5; NAIPFA, supra note 5.

315

believes that the framework of Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1) provides an appropriate criteria for
assessing the qualifications of special entity representatives. 977
As discussed below, we are separately providing in new Rule 15Fh-5(a)(2) that
the qualified independent representative requirement will be satisfied if a special entity
that is subject to regulation under ERISA has a representative that is a fiduciary as
defined in Section 3 of ERISA. We recognize that Congress has established a
comprehensive federal regulatory framework that applies to plans subject to regulation
under ERISA. 978 Such recognition of the federal regulatory framework for ERISA plans
maintains statutory protections for ERISA plans, while addressing the potential conflict,
recognized by commenters, between the ERISA rules and business conduct standards
adopted today. 979
Commenters have suggested various time frames in which an independent
representative’s qualifications should be confirmed or recertified. 980 Whether or not an
independent representative’s qualifications should be periodically re-evaluated will likely
be dependent on whether it is reasonable for the SBS Entity to continue to rely on the
representations regarding the independent representative’s qualifications. The
Commission recognizes the potential benefit of requiring periodic re-evaluation, but is
also mindful of the costs of doing so. The Commission has determined that it is
977

However, as noted above in Section II.H.5., supra, to the extent a proficiency
examination or certification process develops in the future, such examination or
certification may inform an SBS Entity’s reasonable basis to believe the
qualifications of the independent representative.

appropriate to allow the SBS Entity to determine the necessity for a re-evaluation based
on the reasonableness of its reliance on the representations it receives from the special
entity regarding the qualifications of the independent representatives, which will provide
the SBS Entities and the special entities with flexibility to address their particular facts
and circumstances while still affording the special entities the protections of the rules. 981
c.

No Statutory Disqualification
i.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a)(2) would require an SBS Entity to have a reasonable
basis to believe that an independent representative is not subject to a statutory
disqualification. Although Exchange Act Section 15F(h) does not define “subject to a
statutory disqualification,” the term has an established meaning under Section 3(a)(39) of
the Exchange Act, 982 which defines circumstances that would subject a person to a
981

As discussed above in Section II.D, the question of whether reliance on
representations would satisfy an SBS Entity’s obligations under our business
conduct rules will depend on the facts and circumstances of the particular matter.
An SBS Entity can rely on a counterparty’s written representations unless the SBS
Entity has information that would cause a reasonable person to question the
accuracy of the representation. Similar to our approach to the reasonableness of
reliance of representations with respect to institutional suitability in Section
II.G.4, information that might be relevant to this determination includes whether
the independent representative has previously advised with respect to this type of
security-based swap or been involved in the type of trading strategy, and whether
the independent representative has a basic understanding of what makes the
security-based swap distinguishable from a less complex alternative. If the SBS
Entity knows that the security-based swap or trading strategy represents a
significant change from prior security-based swaps that the independent
representative has evaluated or knows that the representative lacks a basic
understanding of what distinguishes the security-based swap from a less complex
alternative, the SBS Entity generally should consider whether it can reasonably
rely on the representations regarding the qualifications of the independent
representative.

statutory disqualification with respect to membership or participation in, or association
with a member of, an SRO. While Section 3(a)(39) would not literally apply here, the
Commission proposed to define “subject to a statutory disqualification” for purposes of
proposed Rule 15Fh-5 by reference to Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act.
ii.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

In the Proposing Release, the Commission solicited comment regarding whether it
should require an SBS Entity to check publicly available databases, such as FINRA’s
BrokerCheck and the Commission’s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure program, to
determine whether an independent representative was subject to a statutory
disqualification.
The Commission received two comment letters on this issue. To minimize the
degree of diligence imposed on SBS Dealers, one commenter suggested requiring thirdparty representatives to affirm that they are not subject to statutory disqualification, are
not under investigation, and are not listed on the publicly available databases described
above. 983
After the adoption of the CFTC’s final rules, the Commission received one
comment letter addressing the definition of “statutory disqualification in the Proposing
Release.” 984 This commenter stated that, although the statutory disqualification standards
under the Exchange Act and the CEA differ somewhat, both cover comparable types of
disqualifying events. 985 Therefore, requiring a dual registrant to apply different standards

983

See APPA, supra note 5.

984

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5.

985

318

for statutory disqualification “would impose substantial and duplicative diligence
documentation, without material countervailing benefits.” 986 To avoid this conflict, the
commenter suggested including language to accommodate dually registered SBS Entities
by establishing a safe harbor where they are deemed to have a reasonable basis to believe
that a person is not subject to statutory disqualification under the Exchange Act if the
dually registered SBS Entity has a reasonable basis to believe that the person is not
subject to statutory disqualification under the CEA. 987 According to the commenter, this
would allow dually registered SBS Entities to determine whether a special entity’s
representative is subject to statutory disqualification based on the information it obtained
to ensure compliance with the parallel CFTC business conduct rule. 988
iii.

Response to Comments and Final Rule

The Commission is adopting proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a)(2), renumbered as Rule
15Fh-5(a)(1)(ii), as proposed, with one modification. The Commission is incorporating
the definition of “statutory disqualification” under Section 3(a)(39)(A)-(F) of the
Exchange Act, whereas the proposed rule incorporated the definition under Section
3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act.
Exchange Act Section 15F(h) does not define “subject to a statutory
disqualification,” however Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39) defines the term “statutory

definition in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39) specifically relates to persons associated

with an SRO. In recognition of the fact that an independent representative of a special
entity may not be associated with an SRO, we have modified the text of proposed Rule
15Fh-2(f) to reference Sections 3(a)(39)(A) – (F) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. This updated cross-reference incorporates the underlying issues that give rise to
statutory disqualification without reference to SRO membership. 989
In defining the phrase “subject to statutory disqualification,” the Commission
declines to reference any parallel provisions of the CEA. 990 The CFTC defines “statutory
disqualification” under relevant sections of the CEA, without reference to parallel
provisions of the Exchange Act. Therefore the inclusion of references to the CEA might
lead to greater confusion and less certainty among market participants regarding what
persons would be subject to statutory disqualification.
The Commission declines to adopt a commenter’s suggestion to require thirdparty representatives to provide specific affirmations that they are not subject to statutory
disqualifications, are not under investigation, and are not listed on publicly available
databases as subject to a statutory disqualification. We do not believe that it is necessary
or appropriate to prescribe in Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(ii) how an SBS Entity must form its
reasonable basis to believe that the independent representative is not subject to a statutory
disqualification; rather, the rule provides SBS Entities the flexibility to determine how

990

In determining whether an SBS Entity has a reasonable basis to believe an
independent representative is not subject to a statutory disqualification, the SBS
Entity may reasonably rely on representations regarding the absence of a statutory
disqualification. See Sections II.D. and II.H.6.a above.

regarding the qualifications of the independent representative to form its reasonable basis,

affirmations.

Undertakes a Duty to Act in the Best Interests of the
Special Entity
i.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a)(3) would require an SBS Entity to have a reasonable
basis to believe that the independent representative would undertake a duty to act in the
best interests of the special entity.
ii.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission requested comment regarding what circumstances, if any, would
give rise to a presumption that an independent representative was acting in the best
interests of the special entity. The Commission received seven comment letters
supporting the presumption that certain representatives would act in the best interests of
the special entity by virtue of their employment with the special entity or their status as
fiduciaries. 991 According to these commenters, in-house representatives of a special
entity should presumably act in the best interests of their special entity employer,
particularly where their performance would be subject to the special entity’s review and
evaluation. 992

Response to Comments and Final Rule

As discussed in Section I.D., supra, the Commission has modified Rule 15Fh-5 to
address the intersection of Dodd-Frank and ERISA regulation by distinguishing between
non-ERISA special entities and ERISA special entities. With respect to non-ERISA
special entities, under Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1), an SBS Entity must have a reasonable basis for
believing that a non-ERISA special entity counterparty has a qualified independent
representative that, among other things, undertakes a duty to act in the “best interests” of
the special entity. 993 With respect to ERISA special entities, under Rule 15Fh-5(b)(2),
the SBS Entity must have a reasonable basis to believe a special entity counterparty that
is “subject to” regulation under ERISA has a representative that is a “fiduciary” as
defined in Section 3 of ERISA. This bifurcated treatment of ERISA and non-ERISA
special entities under Rule 15Fh-5(a) addresses the commenter’s recommendation that
the business conduct rules recognize the comprehensive federal regulatory framework
that applies to plans that are subject to regulation under ERISA, as well as creates
efficiencies for special entities that have already conformed their relationships with their
representatives to satisfy the CFTC’s qualification criteria. 994
The Commission is adopting proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a)(3), renumbered as Rule
15Fh-5(a)(1)(iii), as proposed. The Commission agrees with commenters that an SBS
Entity may rely on information about legal arrangements between the special entity and
its representative to establish that the representative is obligated to act in the best interests
of the special entity, including by contract, employment agreement, or other requirements
993

Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(iii).

994

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5.

322

under state or federal law. In addition, Rule 15Fh-5(b) provides safe harbors for forming
a reasonable basis regarding the qualifications of the independent representative. 995
Specifically, part of the safe harbor is satisfied if the independent representative provides
a written representation that it is legally obligated to comply with the applicable
requirements in Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1) that describe the qualifications of the independent
representative – including that it undertakes to act in the best interests of the special
entity - by agreement, condition of employment, law, rule, or other enforceable duty.
Given the relief provided by the safe harbor, at this time, the Commission does not
believe a presumption is necessary regarding the reasonable belief of the SBS Entity
relating to the undertaking of the independent representative to act in the best interests of
the special entity.
e.

Makes Appropriate and Timely Disclosures to Special
Entity
i.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a)(4) would require an SBS Entity to have a reasonable
basis to believe that the special entity’s independent representative would make
“appropriate and timely” disclosures to the special entity of material information
concerning the security-based swap.
ii.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Proposing Release solicited comment regarding whether to impose specific
requirements with respect to the content of the disclosures in proposed Rule 15Fh5(a)(4). The Commission received six letters addressing this provision of the proposed

995

See Section II.H.6.g. below for a more detailed discussion of the safe harbor.

323

rule. Two commenters supported the use of specific disclosures to satisfy this
requirement. 996 In contrast, two commenters argued that the Commission should not
require specific content disclosures. 997 One commenter appeared to argue that the
standard of the proposed rule was too low, 998 and two commenters cautioned against
reading this portion of the proposed rule as requiring the disclosure of information before
the execution of each trade. 999
A commenter recommended that the final rules expressly state that the
appropriate and timely disclosure requirement would be satisfied if the SBS Entity
received a written representation affirming that the representative is “obligated by law
and/or agreement or undertaking to provide appropriate and timely disclosures to the
special entity.” 1000 However, this commenter additionally believed that, because this
provision of the proposed rule could be read to mandate pre-execution disclosure on a
transaction-by-transaction basis, it could cause delays in the execution of security-based
swaps, interfere with special entities’ ability to hedge positions and portfolio risks, and
deprive them of trading opportunities. 1001 Another commenter requested that the
Commission clarify that proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a)(4) would not require the disclosure of
information before a trade is executed. 1002

A third commenter urged the Commission not to impose specific requirements
regarding the content of the disclosures. 1003 According to this commenter, there are too
many types of swaps and circumstances to allow for a uniform set of mandated
disclosures. 1004 After the adoption of the CFTC’s final rules, a commenter argued against
the specific requirement that the qualified independent representative disclose “material
information concerning the security-based swap.” 1005 The commenter requested that the
Commission instead make the requirement a general requirement to make appropriate
and timely disclosures to the special entity to harmonize this provision with the parallel
CFTC requirement, “which would reduce costs for special entities since most of them
have already conformed their relationships with their representatives to satisfy the
CFTC’s qualification criteria.” 1006
iii.

Response to Comments and Final Rule

As noted above, the SBS Entity may reasonably rely on representations regarding
the independent representative making appropriate and timely disclosures to the special
entity to form its reasonable basis to believe that the independent representative will
comply with Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(iv). As with Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(iii), an SBS Entity may
rely on appropriate legal arrangements between a special entity and its representative to
form a reasonable basis to believe the representative will make appropriate and timely
disclosures to the special entity of material information regarding the security-based swap
– such as an existing contract or employment agreement.

In response to the comments arguing that pre-trade disclosure should not be
required, we believe the necessity of pre-trade disclosure will depend on the facts and
circumstances of the particular security-based swap in the context of the special entity
and independent representative. The SBS Entity is required to have a reasonable basis to
believe the independent representative will provide the appropriate and timely
disclosures. To the extent that any disclosures from the independent representative are
necessary for the special entity to make an investment decision with respect to the
security-based swap, the disclosure would not be timely if it was given after the
investment decision was made. Similarly, the CFTC rule also requires that the Swap
Entity have a reasonable basis to believe that the independent representative will make
“appropriate and timely” disclosures. Although the language of the Commission’s rule
narrows the requirement found in the parallel CFTC rule to appropriate and timely
disclosures of “material information concerning the security-based swap,” the timing
requirement is the same. 1007
f.

Pricing and Appropriateness
i.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a)(5) would require an SBS Entity to form a reasonable
basis to believe that the special entity’s independent representative would provide written
representations to the special entity regarding fair pricing and the appropriateness of the
security-based swap.
ii.

1007

Comments on the Proposed Rule

See Section II.H.5., supra.

326

Four commenters addressed this proposed rule. Two commenters supported the
Commission’s proposal that it “should be sufficient if the representation states that the
representative is obligated, by law and/or contract, to review pricing and appropriateness
with respect to any swap transaction in which the representative serves as such with
respect to the plan.” 1008 Both commenters urged the Commission to incorporate this
approach into the adopted rules.
The third commenter suggested that an independent representative should be
required to disclose the basis on which it determined that a particular transaction was
fairly priced, and that the underlying documentation should be sufficiently detailed to
enable a third party to evaluate the representative’s conclusion. 1009
After the adoption of the CFTC’s business conduct rules, the fourth commenter
urged the Commission to harmonize with the CFTC and require that the qualified
independent representative “evaluate[], consistent with any guidelines provided by the
special entity, regarding fair pricing and the appropriateness of the security-based
swap.” 1010 The commenter asserted that this harmonization would reduce compliance
costs for special entities that have already conformed their relationships with their
representatives to satisfy the CFTC’s qualification criteria. 1011
iii.

Response to Comments and Final Rule

Upon consideration of the comments, the Commission is modifying proposed
Rule 15Fh-5(a)(5), renumbered as Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(v). The Commission agrees with

See ABC, supra note 5; SIFMA (August 2011), supra note 5.

327

the commenter’s suggestion that the Commission should harmonize with the language of
the CFTC’s parallel provision, which requires an SBS Entity to form a reasonable basis
that the special entity’s independent representative will “evaluate” fair pricing and the
appropriateness of the security-based swap, “consistent with any guidelines provided by
the special entity.” In the Commission’s view, requiring an SBS Entity to form a
reasonable basis to believe that an independent representative will evaluate, consistent
with any guidelines provided by the special entity, fair pricing and the appropriateness of
the security-based swap will achieve the purpose of the proposed rule to ensure the
special entity receives advice specifically with respect to pricing and whether or not to
enter into the security-based swap. The rule will also provide the special entity the
flexibility to provide parameters to its independent representative regarding the pricing
and appropriateness of its security-based swap. The Commission therefore agrees with
the commenter’s suggestion that the special entity’s guidelines, to the extent a special
entity provides them, should establish the criteria for assessing the fair pricing and
appropriateness of a security-based swap. In addition, this change will harmonize the
rule with the parallel CFTC rule, thus creating efficiencies for entities that have already
established infrastructure to comply with the CFTC standard. In the absence of any
guidelines provided by the special entity, Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(v) requires the SBS Entity to
form a reasonable basis to believe that the independent representative will evaluate the
fair pricing and appropriateness of the security-based swap.
An SBS Entity also could form a reasonable basis for its determination by relying
on a written representation that the independent representative will document the basis
for its conclusion that the transaction was fairly priced and appropriate in accordance

328

with any guidelines provided by the plan, and that the independent representative or the
special entity will maintain that documentation in its records for an appropriate period of
time, and make such records available to the special entity upon request. 1012 In response
to commenters’ concerns, the Commission clarifies that this provision does not
necessarily require that a representative provide the special entity transaction-bytransaction documentation with respect to fair pricing and appropriateness of each
security-based swap. For example, where the representative is given trading authority,
the representative could consider undertaking in its agreement with the special entity to
ensure that the representative will evaluate the pricing and appropriateness of each swap
consistent with any guidelines provided by the Special Entity prior to entering into the
swap. In such a situation, the independent representative could prepare and maintain
adequate documentation of its evaluation of pricing and appropriateness to enable both
the representative and the special entity to confirm compliance with any such agreement.
g.

Subject to “Pay to Play” Prohibitions
i.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a)(7) would require an SBS Entity to have a reasonable
basis to believe that a special entity’s independent representative is subject to rules of the
Commission, the CFTC, or an SRO subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission or the
CFTC that prohibit it from engaging in specified activities if certain political
contributions have been made, unless the independent representative is an employee of
the special entity.

1012

Id.

329

While not addressed in the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission proposed to include
this “pay-to-play” provision among the qualifications for independent representatives. 1013
As discussed more fully in Section II.H.10 , infra, pay-to-play practices in connection
with security-based swap transactions could result in significant harm to special entities –
particularly where, as here, the independent representative is intended to act in the best
interests of special entities. 1014 The pay-to-play provisions of the proposed rules were
intended to deter independent representatives from participating, even indirectly, in such
practices.
ii.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission received one comment letter addressing the inclusion of a payto-play restriction among the qualifications for independent representatives. This
commenter supported the exception to the pay-to-play restrictions for advisors who are
employees of the special entity. 1015
iii.

Response to Comment and Final Rule

The Commission is adopting proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a)(7), renumbered as Rule
15Fh-5(a)(1)(vi), as proposed. Accordingly, an SBS Entity must have a reasonable basis
for believing that the independent representative is subject to rules of the Commission,

1013

See Exchange Act Section 15F(h)(1)(C) (authorizing the Commission to prescribe
business conduct standards that relate to “such other matters as the Commission
determines to be appropriate”). For a discussion of abuses associated with pay to
play practices, see Section II.D.5, infra. See note 213, supra, and related text
regarding an SBS Entity’s reliance on a representation from the special entity to
form this reasonable basis.

Dealers: Proposed Rule 15Fh-6” at Section II.D.4.a., infra.

the CFTC or an SRO subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission or the CFTC that
prohibit it from engaging in specified activities if certain political contributions have been
made, unless the independent representative is an employee of the special entity. 1016 As
stated in the Proposing Release, the Commission continues to believe that an independent
representative in these circumstances would likely be either a municipal advisor or an
investment adviser that is already subject to the MSRB’s or the Commission’s pay-toplay prohibitions. The Commission does not, however, intend to prohibit other qualified
persons from acting as independent representatives, so long as those persons are similarly
subject to pay-to-play restrictions. The Commission believes that Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vi)
will sufficiently deter SBS Entities from participating, even indirectly, in such unlawful
practices.
h.

ERISA Fiduciary
i.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a)(6) would require an SBS Entity to have a reasonable
basis to believe that, in the case of a special entity that is an employee benefit plan
subject to ERISA, the independent representative was a “fiduciary” as defined in section
3(21) of that Act (29 U.S.C. 1002). 1017 The proposed rule was not intended to limit,

1016

See Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(4), 15 U.S.C 78o-4(e)(4) (defining “municipal
advisor” as a person “other than a municipal entity or an employee of a municipal
entity” that engages in the specified activities).

1017

See Section 15F(h)(5)(A)(i)(VII) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o10(h)(5)(A)(i)(VII). See note 225, supra, and related text regarding an SBS
Entity’s reliance on a representation from the special entity to form this
reasonable basis.

331

restrict, or otherwise affect the fiduciary’s duties and obligations under ERISA. 1018
The Proposing Release solicited feedback regarding any specific requirements
that should be imposed on SBS Entities with respect to this obligation, as well as what
other independent representative qualifications might be deemed satisfied if an
independent representative of an employee benefit plan subject to ERISA, is a fiduciary
as defined in section 3 of ERISA.
ii.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission received six comment letters advocating for a presumption of
qualification for ERISA plan fiduciaries, since ERISA already imposes fiduciary duties
upon the person who decides whether to enter into a security-based swap on behalf of an
ERISA plan, and imposes on this person a statutory duty to act in the best interests of the
plan and its participants, thereby prohibiting certain self-dealing transactions. 1019
According to these commenters, the Commission’s proposed standards would be
unnecessary, redundant, would overlap with ERISA’s standards, and would only serve to
increase the administrative burden and cost on SBS Entities without any corresponding
benefit. 1020
To address the potential conflict with ERISA standards, one commenter suggested
that the Commission’s definition of “independent representative” should be inapplicable

1018

See notes 99, 198 and 189, supra, regarding the DOL’s proposal to amend
definition of “fiduciary” for purposes of ERISA.

to ERISA plans, and that the Commission should merely cross-reference the requirements
under ERISA. 1021
Another commenter supported the presumptive qualification for ERISA plan
fiduciaries, provided that the plan satisfied a minimum $1 billion net asset requirement
for institutional investor organizations. 1022 The commenter asserted that no public policy
objective would be achieved by permitting an SBS Entity to reject a risk manager
fiduciary selected by a sophisticated institutional investor organization with over $1
billion in net assets, which did not require the protections of the rules. 1023 Another
commenter advocated for the separate treatment of independent representatives of special
entities subject to ERISA. 1024 Under this commenter’s proposal, an SBS Entity that
transacts with a special entity subject to Title I of ERISA must have a reasonable belief
that the qualified independent representative is a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3 of
ERISA. 1025 The commenter’s proposed modification for ERISA special entities was
intended to recognize “the unique fiduciary regime already applicable to such special
entities,” and to harmonize the Commission’s criteria for qualified independent
representatives with those of the CFTC. 1026

disclosure was “appropriate” and “timely” should be made with reference to ERISA. 1027
However, in the event the Commission imposed its own, separate requirements on such
disclosures, the commenter requested that the Commission allow the following
representations to satisfy this provision of the proposed rule: (1) that the representative
shall provide the special entity with such information, at such times, as the special entity
may reasonably request regarding any swap trade (either individually or in the aggregate)
entered into by such representative on behalf of the special entity; and (2) that, in the
absence of specific instruction to the contrary by the special entity regarding swap trade
disclosure, the representative shall comply with the disclosure requirements imposed on
the representative under other applicable law (e.g., ERISA) and by the special entity
under the special entity’s investment management agreement and investment
guidelines. 1028
iii.

Response to Comments and Final Rule

As discussed in Section II.H.5.b.iii, we are adopting a new Rule 15Fh-5(a)(2) that
expressly addresses dealings with special entities subject to ERISA.
Under new Rule 15Fh-5(a)(2), (formerly proposed Rule 15Fh-5(a)(6)), an SBS
Entity that acts as a counterparty to an employee benefit plan subject to Title I of ERISA
must have a reasonable basis to believe that the special entity has a representative that is a
fiduciary as defined in Section 3 of ERISA. In this regard, an ERISA fiduciary will be
presumed to be a qualified independent representative, and the SBS Entity need not

See ABC, supra note 5.

1028

334

undertake further inquiry into the ERISA fiduciary’s qualifications. Such a presumption
acknowledges the pre-existing, comprehensive federal regulatory regime governing
ERISA fiduciaries and the importance of harmonizing the Dodd-Frank Act requirements
with ERISA to avoid unintended consequences. 1029 This formulation also will align the
Commission’s treatment of ERISA plans with that of the CFTC.
i.

Safe Harbor
i.

Summary of Comments

Although not included in the proposed rules, after adoption of the CFTC’s final
rules, one commenter requested that the Commission adopt separate safe harbors for
transactions with ERISA and non-ERISA special entities regarding the requirement that
an SBS Entity form a reasonable basis to believe that the special entity has a qualified
independent representative. 1030 According to this commenter, the adoption of separate
safe harbors for ERISA and non-ERISA special entities would align the Commission’s
requirements with those of the CFTC by recognizing the “unique fiduciary regime
already applicable to” ERISA special entities, and, for transactions with non-ERISA
special entities, the safe harbor would “help speed implementation, reduce costs, and
mitigate counterparty confusion, because most special entity representatives have already
taken steps to ensure that they can provide the representations contained in the CFTC’s
safe harbor.” 1031

335

After consideration of the comments, the Commission has determined to add a
new bifurcated safe harbor in Rule 15Fh-5(b), similar to that adopted by the CFTC. The
Commission believes the safe harbor will provide SBS Entities an efficient manner with
which to comply with the requirement to have a reasonable basis to believe an
independent representative meets certain enumerated qualifications while meeting the
purposes of the rule.
Under Rule 15Fh-5(b)(1) as adopted, an SBS Entity shall be deemed to have a
reasonable basis to believe that a non-ERISA special entity has a representative that
satisfies the requirements of Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1) if: (i) the special entity represents in
writing to the SBS Entity that it has complied in good faith with written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to ensure that it has selected a representative that
satisfies the requirements of Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1), and that such policies and procedures
provide for ongoing monitoring of the performance of such representative consistent with
Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1); and (ii) the representative represents in writing to the special entity
and the SBS Entity that the representative: has policies and procedures reasonably
designed to ensure that it satisfies the requirements of Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1); meets the
independence test of Rule 15Fh-f(a)(1)(vii); has the knowledge required under paragraph
(a)(1)(i) of this section; is not subject to a statutory disqualification under paragraph
(a)(1)(ii) of this section; undertakes a duty to act in the best interests of the special entity
as required under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section; and is subject to the requirements
regarding political contributions, as applicable, under paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this section;

336

and is legally obligated to comply with the requirements of Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1) by
agreement, condition of employment, law, rule, regulation, or other enforceable duty. 1032
Under Rule 15Fh-5(b)(2) as adopted, an SBS Entity shall be deemed to have a
reasonable basis to believe that an ERISA special entity has a representative that satisfies
the requirements of Rule 15Fh-5(a)(2), provided that the special entity provides in
writing to the SBS Entity the representative’s name and contact information, and
represents in writing that the representative is a fiduciary as defined in Section 3 of
ERISA. Obtaining the name and contact information provides the SBS Entity with basic
information to investigate further if it becomes questionable whether it can reasonably
rely on the special entity’s representation or if the need arises for it to further investigate
any of the representatives qualifications. In addition, it is highly likely that the SBS
Entity will have the information in the ordinary course of negotiating the security-based
swap if the independent representative is advising or negotiating the security-based swap
on behalf of the special entity.
The Commission believes that the safe harbor will better enable an SBS Entity to
fulfill its obligations under Rule 15Fh-5(a), while at the same time appropriately
providing protections for special entities. The Commission also agrees with commenters
that the safe harbor will increase the efficiency of SBS transactions, reduce costs, and
mitigate counterparty confusion. We believe that although SBS Entities will need to
obtain additional representations relating to meeting certain of the standards in Rule

1032

SBS Entities should keep in mind that reliance on these representation must be
reasonable. As discussed in Section II.D, supra, reliance on a representation
would not be reasonable if the SBS Entity has information that would cause a
reasonable person to question the accuracy of the representation.

337

15Fh-5(a)(1), most SBS Entities and special entity representatives will still be able to
leverage any existing compliance infrastructure established pursuant to the CFTC’s safe
harbor. 1033 Additionally, as discussed above, the bifurcated nature of the safe harbor
appropriately recognizes existing ERISA regulations. 1034
7.

Disclosure of Capacity
a.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 15Fh-5(b) would require that, before initiation of a security-based
swap with a special entity, an SBS Dealer must disclose in writing the capacity or
capacities in which it is acting, and, if the SBS Dealer engages in business or has engaged
in business within the last twelve months with the counterparty in more than one
capacity, the SBS Dealer must disclose the material differences between such capacities
in connection with the security-based swap and any other financial transaction or service
involving the counterparty. 1035 Therefore, an SBS Dealer that is acting as a counterparty
but not an advisor to a special entity would need to make clear to the special entity the
capacity in which it is acting (i.e., that it is acting as a counterparty, but not as an
advisor).

1033

See Section VI.C.4.iv., infra. However, the CFTC safe harbor does not require
the representative to represent that it has the knowledge required under paragraph
(a)(1)(i) of this section; is not subject to a statutory disqualification under
paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section; undertakes a duty to act in the best interests of
the special entity as required under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section; and is
subject to the requirements regarding political contributions, as applicable, under
paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this section.

1034

As noted in the Proposing Release, a firm might act in multiple capacities in
relation to a special entity. For example, the firm might act as an underwriter in a bond
offering, as well as a counterparty to a security-based swap used to hedge the financing
transaction. 1036 Because the SBS Dealer’s duty to the special entity might vary according
to the capacity in which it is acting, the special entity and its independent representative
should understand the SBS Dealer’s roles in any transaction. 1037 The proposed rule
would therefore require an SBS Dealer that engages in business, or has engaged in
business within the last twelve months, with the counterparty in more than one capacity
to disclose the material differences between such capacities in connection with the
security-based swap and any other financial transaction or service involving the
counterparty. 1038 The requirements of the proposed rule would apply to SBS Dealers, but
not Major SBS Participants, because the statutory requirement, by its terms, requires
disclosure in writing of “the capacity in which the security-based swap dealer is acting”
(emphasis added).

Comments on the Proposed Rule

The Commission received five comment letters on this proposed rule. Three
commenters expressed concern over the burden imposed on large institutions, which
would have to identify and disclose a myriad of possible relationships with special
1036

See Swap Financial Group Presentation at 55.

1037

In the case of special entities that are municipal entities, MSRB Rule G-23
generally prohibits dealer-financial advisors from acting in multiple capacities in
the same municipal securities transactions. See also MSRB Notice 2011-29 (May
31, 2011) (discussing rule amendment and interpretive notice). Similarly, Section
206(3) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 governs disclosure to a client
when acting in certain capacities.

entities. 1039 Conversely, one commenter suggested broadening the rule to apply to Major
SBS Participants in addition to SBS Dealers. 1040 The last commenter suggested
conforming the disclosure of capacity requirement to that of the CFTC. 1041
The first commenter argued that the Commission’s proposed capacity disclosure
requirement was problematic for two reasons. 1042 First, it might conflict with some SBS
Dealers’ obligations to keep certain lines of business separated from one another. In this
commenter’s view, to comply with this requirement, large, multifaceted SBS Dealers that
have different relationships with the same special entity could be forced to review
activities throughout their entire organizations – in some cases, across informational
walls that separate the different business lines of the firm. Second, the requirement might
cause execution delays for special entities, since the SBS Dealer would need time to
determine the disclosures it must make to the special entity. The commenter asked the
Commission to clarify in the final rule that this disclosure requirement applied only to the
SBS Dealer and the special entity, and that it would not apply to any associated persons
of either the SBS Dealer or the special entity. The commenter additionally argued that
the twelve-month look back period constituted a “moving target,” and suggested that the
Commission define the period as a calendar year, rather than a rolling twelve-month
period. 1043

Another commenter urged the Commission to allow SBS Entities to represent the
capacity in which they were acting with respect to an ERISA plan in a schedule or
amendment to an ISDA Master Agreement, other transactional document, or in an annual
disclosure document provided by the SBS Entity to the special entity, which could be
changed if the SBS Entity were to act in a different capacity. 1044 Because ERISA plans
generally deal with SBS Entities as counterparties, the commenter believed this would be
an effective and non-burdensome way to make such representations. The commenter
additionally asserted that it might be harmful to a special entity to require an SBS Entity
to disclose the myriad different capacities in which the SBS Entity has acted with respect
to the special entity – since requiring SBS Dealers with diverse global operations to
disclose every relationship with a plan (which often has multiple investment managers
and service providers), then requiring the plan manager to review such disclosures would
pose a significant administrative burden and result in high costs and delayed trades.
These costs would likely be passed on to special entities.
Another commenter argued that it “would be impossible for an SBS Entity to
ascertain and disclose every other relationship it may have with its counterparties”
because large financial institutions have multiple points of contact with counterparties,
making it impossible to systematically collect and disclose the required information. 1045
This commenter argued that the Proposing Release did not include an analysis of the
costs associated with the requirement to disclose capacity. The commenter recommended
1044

See ABC, supra note 5. Some commenters referenced both SBS Dealers and
Major SBS Participants although the Commission only proposed to apply the
requirement to SBS Dealers.

1045

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

341

that the Commission narrow this requirement to cover only disclosure of the material
differences between the capacities in which the SBS Entity itself (and not any of its
affiliates or other associated persons) acted in connection with the relevant security-based
swap transaction. In the alternative, the commenter suggested that the Commission
require disclosure regarding the capacities in which the SBS Entity has acted with respect
to the counterparty other than in connection with the relevant security-based swap
transaction, and that the SBS Entity should be permitted to satisfy that requirement with a
generic disclosure of the general types of capacities in which it may act or have acted
with respect to the counterparty (along with a statement distinguishing those capacities
from the capacity in which the SBS Entity is acting with respect to the present securitybased swap).
One commenter suggested that the capacity disclosure requirement be applied
equally to SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants, as it would maximize the protection
for special entities. 1046
After the adoption of the CFTC’s final rules, a commenter subsequently
recommended deleting this twelve-month “look back” period, as well as the requirement
that SBS Dealers disclose the material differences between such capacities “in connection
with the security-based swap and any other financial transaction or service involving the
counterparty.” 1047 According to the commenter, these modifications would harmonize

the Commission’s rule with the parallel CFTC rule, and reduce confusion among
counterparties regarding the nature of their relationship with an SBS Dealer. 1048
c.

Response to Comments and Final Rule

Upon consideration of the foregoing comments, the Commission is adopting
proposed Rule 15Fh-5(b), renumbered as Rule 15Fh-5(c), with several modifications in
response to comments. Proposed Rule 15Fh-5(b) would require that, before initiation of
a security-based swap with a special entity, an SBS Dealer must disclose in writing the
capacity or capacities in which it is acting, and, if the SBS Dealer engages in business or
has engaged in business within the last twelve months with the counterparty in more than
one capacity, the SBS Dealer must disclose the material differences between such
capacities in connection with the security-based swap and any other financial transaction
or service involving the counterparty. As discussed below, in response to comments, the
Commission is amending the first part of the rule to clarify that the disclosure of the
capacity in which the SBS Dealer is acting is “in connection with the security-based
swap.” The Commission also is amending the second part of the rule to clarify the
capacities between which material differences must be disclosed. In addition, we are
deleting the 12 month look-back period. Specifically, under the rule, as adopted
(renumbered as Rule 15Fh-5(c)), before initiation of a security-based swap, an SBS
Dealer must disclose to the special entity in writing the capacity in which the SBS Dealer
is acting “in connection with the security-based swap,” and, if the SBS Dealer engages in

1048

Id.

343

business 1049 with the counterparty in more than one capacity, the SBS Dealer must
disclose the material differences between the capacity in which the SBS Dealer is acting
with respect to the security-based swap and the capacities in which it is acting with
respect to any other financial transaction or service involving the counterparty to the
special entity.
Several commenters argued that the proposed requirement that the SBS Dealer
disclose the capacity in which it was acting was too broad and would require the
disclosure of a myriad of possible relationships. 1050 Some commenters suggested that the
relevant disclosure should be the capacity in which the SBS Dealer is acting “in
connection with the security-based swap” and suggested the rule should be narrowed
accordingly. 1051 A commenter also suggested that the Commission revise the disclosure
of different capacities to eliminate the language that requires such disclosures to be “in
connection with the security-based swap and any other financial transaction or service
involving the counterparty.” 1052
The Commission agrees with commenters that the disclosure of capacity in the
first part of the rule should be limited to the capacity in which the SBS Dealer is acting in
connection with the security-based swap, and has amended the rule to clarify this
1049

As discussed below, the rule is designed to help ensure that the special entity
understands the SBS Dealer’s role in the security-based swap transaction that is
being initiated, and to distinguish that role, if applicable, from its role with respect
to any other services the SBS Dealer is providing or transactions in which it is
involved with the special entity. The term “engages in” should be interpreted
broadly to achieve that goal.

limitation. However, the Commission declines the commenter’s suggestion to eliminate
the disclosure of material differences between or among the different capacities in which
the SBS Dealer is acting “in connection with the security-based swap and any other
financial transaction or service involving the counterparty.” 1053 The proposed rule was
designed to provide the counterparty with sufficient information about the capacity in
which the SBS Dealer is acting, and any material differences between its capacity in
connection with the security-based swap and any other financial transaction or service
involving the counterparty, to help ensure that the counterparty understands the SBS
Dealer’s role in the security-based swap transaction that is being initiated, and to
distinguish that role, if applicable, from its role with respect to any other services it is
providing or transactions in which it is involved with the counterparty. Eliminating the
requirement that the SBS Dealer disclose the material differences in the different
capacities in which it is acting would not address potential counterparty confusion that
could arise when a SBS Dealer changes status from transaction to transaction.
Some commenters expressed concerns regarding the burden and practical issues
relating to having to apply this disclosure requirement to the activities of associated
persons of the SBS Dealer 1054 and associated persons of the special entity. 1055 The
Commission recognizes the practical and operational difficulties described in the
comment letters in determining the capacity in which associated persons, including
affiliates, are acting or have acted with respect to the special entity. The Commission

1053

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5; and SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5.

1054

See SIFMA (August 2011), supra note 5.

1055

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

345

also recognizes the role of the independent representative in advising the special entity
with respect to these transactions. Given these considerations, the Commission agrees
with the commenter it would be appropriate for the SBS Dealer to use generalized
disclosures regarding the other capacities in which the SBS Dealer and its associated
persons, including affiliates, have acted or may act with respect to the special entity and
its associated persons, along with a statement distinguishing those capacities from the
capacity in which the SBS Dealer is acting with respect to the present security-based
swap. 1056 Such disclosure would require consideration of the SBS Dealer’s business and
the types of capacities in which it and its associated persons has acted or may act with
respect to the particular special entity. We believe that this generalized disclosure of
other capacities will help ensure that the counterparty understands the SBS Dealer’s role
in the security-based swap transaction that is being initiated, and to distinguish that role,
if applicable, from its role with respect to any other services it is providing or transactions
in which it is involved with the counterparty.
After consideration of the comments, the Commission also acknowledges the
commenters’ concerns regarding the workability and potential delay in execution of
transactions and increased costs the twelve month look back may cause. Accordingly,
the Commission has also modified the adopted rule to eliminate the 12-month look back
period for business in which the SBS Dealer has engaged.
As discussed in Section II.G.2.b. above, the Commission does not prescribe the
manner in which these disclosure must be made. In response to comments received, 1057
1056

Id.

1057

See ABC, supra note 5.

346

the Commission notes that the required disclosures could be made in a transactional
document or an annual disclosure document, depending on the number of capacities in
which the SBS Dealer is acting and whether such capacities have changed. In any event,
the disclosure must be sufficient to meet the requirements of the rule, which is designed
to ensure that the special entity understands the SBS Dealer’s role in the security-based
swap transaction that is being initiated, and to distinguish that role, if applicable, from its
role with respect to any other services the SBS Dealer is providing or transactions in
which it is involved with the special entity.
Finally, the Commission declines to apply Rule 15Fh-5(c) to Major SBS
Participants, since the statutory requirement, by its terms, requires disclosure in writing
of “the capacity in which the security-based swap dealer is acting.” Furthermore, as
discussed in Section II.C., supra, we have not sought to impose the full range of business
conduct requirements on these Major SBS Participants. We note that our approach in this
regard largely mirrors that of the CFTC, under whose rules Swap Entities have operated
for some time.

Exceptions for Anonymous, Special Entity Transactions on An
Exchange or SEF
a.

Proposed Rules

As previously discussed in Section II.B, supra, Section 15F(h)(7) of the Exchange
Act provides that “[t]his subsection shall not apply with respect to a transaction that is
(A) initiated by a special entity on an exchange or security-based swap execution facility;
and (B) one in which the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap

347

participant does not know the identity of the counterparty to the transaction.” 1058 We
proposed to read Section 15F(h)(7) to apply to any transaction with a special entity on a
SEF or an exchange where the SBS Entity does not know the identity of its
counterparty. 1059 We further proposed exceptions from the requirement of proposed
Rules 15Fh-4 (special requirements for SBS Dealers acting as advisors to special entities)
and 15Fh-5 (special requirements for SBS Entities acting as counterparties to special
entities) for such transactions.

Comments on the Proposed Rules

The Commission received five comments that generally addressed the exception
for anonymous or SEF and exchange-traded security-based swaps , 1060 and five
comments that specifically addressed the exception for anonymous, exchange or SEFtraded security-based swaps with special entities. 1061 The comment letters that generally
address this exception are discussed above, in Section II.B, supra.
In the specific context of security-based swap transactions with special entities,
one commenter suggested that the business conduct standards should only apply to nonSEF and non-exchange traded transactions, regardless whether the transaction is
anonymous. 1062 This commenter urged the Commission to clarify that the proposed rules

would not apply to any security-based swap transaction that is entered into by a special
entity on a designated contract market or SEF. 1063
Two commenters addressed the Commission’s proposal to apply the statutory
exception to any anonymous transaction with a special entity on a registered exchange or
SEF. 1064 One commenter supported this proposal as a “reasonable approach which is
consistent with Congressional intent that the enhanced protections apply to transactions
where there is a degree of reliance by the special entity on the dealer or major swap
participant.” 1065 The second commenter argued that the exception in Section 15Fh(7)
was intended to apply to all external business conduct requirements promulgated under
subsection (h), and not merely those requirements relating to SBS Dealers acting as
advisors or counterparties to special entities. 1066
Another commenter argued that Congress did not intend for the exception to
apply when SBS Entities initiate transactions on a SEF or an exchange. 1067 According to
this commenter, SBS Entities seeking to conduct business on a SEF or exchange should
bear the risk that their counterparties are special entities, as the risk would incentivize
SBS Entities to determine the identity of their counterparties when they initiate securitybased swap transactions on an SEF or exchange. The commenter recommended that the
Commission adopt a “clear test” for determining when a special entity “initiates” a
security-based swap transaction, and that the test differentiate between initiating a

negotiation and initiating a transaction. 1068 After adoption of the CFTC’s business
conduct standards, another commenter urged the Commission to adopt an exception for
exchange-traded security-based swaps that are intended to be cleared if: (1) the
transaction is executed on a registered or exempt security-based swap execution facility
or registered national security exchange; and (2) is of a type that is, as of the date of
execution, required to be cleared pursuant to Section 3C of the Exchange Act; or (3) the
SBS Dealer does not know the identity of the counterparty, at any time up to and
including execution of the transaction. 1069 The commenter argued that these
modifications would harmonize the scope of the SEC’s special entity requirements with
the parallel CFTC requirements set forth under the relief provided by CFTC No-Action
Letter 13-70. 1070
c.

Response to Comments and Final Rules

After consideration of the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh4(b)(3) and Rule 15Fh-5(c) (the latter renumbered as 15Fh-5(d)) with several
modifications. Under the rules as adopted, the business conduct requirements of Rules
15Fh-4 and 15Fh-5 will not apply to a security-based swap with a special entity if: (1) the
transaction is executed on a registered SEF, exempt SEF, or registered national securities
exchange; and (2) the SBS Dealer and/or Major SBS Participant does not know the
identity of the counterparty at a reasonably sufficient time prior to the execution of the
transaction to permit the SBS Dealer and/or Major SBS Participant to comply with the

1068

Id.

1069

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5.

1070

Id.

350

obligations of the rule. 1071 The language of these exceptions, as adopted, differs from the
language of the proposed rules, which would have applied the exceptions where the SBS
Dealer or Major SBS Participant did not know the identity of its counterparty “at any
time up to and including” execution of the transaction, and only to transactions executed
on a registered SEF or national exchange.
As discussed in Section II.B, by limiting the scope of the business conduct
standards to situations where the counterparty’s identity is known at a reasonably
sufficient time prior to the execution of a transaction to permit the SBS Dealer and/or
Major SBS Participant to comply with the obligations of the rule, the Commission seeks
to relieve SBS Dealers and/or Major SBS Participants of the duty to comply with the
rules’ requirements where the counterparty’s identity is learned immediately prior to the
execution of a transaction, so that the SBS Entity would be able to comply with the
requirements of the rules in a manner that would not be disruptive to the counterparties to
the transaction. This change is intended to address commenters’ concerns that
compliance with the rules might be unreasonable or impractical where a counterparty’s
identity is learned immediately prior to the transaction, and compliance could result in the
delay or disruption of the transaction. 1072 Such delay or disruption would negate a
primary advantage of electronic trading and discourage market participants from
executing security-based swaps on electronic platforms. By only applying the rules’
requirements to situations where the counterparty’s identity is known “at a reasonably

As noted above, Rule 15Fh-4 applies only to SBS Dealers, whereas Rule 15Fh-5
applies to both SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants. See Sections II.H.2 and
II.H.5.a.iii.A, respectively, supra.

1072

See CFA, supra note 5; FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

351

sufficient time prior to” the execution of a transaction, the rules’ requirements are limited
to situations where an SBS Entity has sufficient time before the execution of the
transaction to comply with its obligations under the rules. For this reason, we decline to
adopt language, suggested by a commenter, which would apply the exception to
circumstances where the identity of the counterparty “is not known at any time up to and
including execution of the transaction.” 1073 For clarification, and in response to
commenters, 1074 the exception would encompass transactions that are executed by an
SBS Entity on a registered or exempt SEF or registered national securities exchange via a
request for quote method, as long as the identity of the counterparty is not known to the
SBS Entity at a reasonably sufficient time prior to the execution of a transaction to permit
the SBS Entity to comply with the obligations of the rules. 1075
Also, as explained in Section II.B, the exception would apply with respect to
transactions on exempt as well as registered SEFs. We believe that including transactions
on exempt SEFs is appropriate since, as discussed in Section II.B, the practical
considerations that underlie the exception are not affected by whether a SEF is registered
or not.
We believe that the exceptions under Rule 15Fh-4(b)(3) and 15Fh-5(d), as
adopted, appropriately interpret the intended statutory carve-outs for SBS Entities
1073

See SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5.

1074

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5; MFA, supra note 5.

1075

The rule will apply to situations where an SBS Entity negotiates or pre-arranges a
security-based swap transaction with a special entity and routes such a prearranged transaction through a SEF or registered national securities exchange. In
such instances, we believe the SBS Entity would have known the identity of the
counterparty at a reasonably sufficient time prior to the execution of the
transaction to permit the SBS Entity to comply with the obligations of the rule.

352

engaged in anonymous, registered exchange-traded, registered or exempt SEF
transactions with special entities, while avoiding the ambiguity inherent in determining
which party “initiated” the security-based swap. The final rule therefore obviates the
need to differentiate between initiating a negotiation and initiating a transaction, as one
commenter had requested. 1076
We acknowledge the commenter’s suggestion that the exception should apply
irrespective of which party initiates a transaction, 1077 as well as another commenter’s
suggestion that Congress may have intended to deny the exception in situations in which
an SBS Entity initiates a transaction, so that SBS Entities would be incentivized to
determine the identities of their counterparties when they initiate security-based swap
transactions. 1078 As explained in Section II.B, we understand there may be practical
difficulties in determining which counterparty “initiates” a transaction on a SEF or an
exchange. However, we believe the rules adopted today avoid the ambiguity inherent in
determining which party “initiated” the security-based swap, while appropriately
interpreting the intended statutory carve-outs for SBS Entities that execute anonymous,
security-based swap transactions with special entities on a registered or exempt SEF or
registered national securities exchange.
We are not accepting the commenter’s suggestion that we revise the exceptions
under 15Fh-4(b)(3) and 15Fh-5(d) to include transactions that are intended or required to
be cleared, which are either executed on a registered national securities exchange or SEF,

1076

See Better Markets (August 2011), supra note 5.

1077

See CFA, supra, note 5.

1078

See Better Markets (August 2011), supra note 5.

353

regardless of whether the transaction is anonymous. 1079 Similarly, we reject commenters’
more general assertion that the exceptions should apply to all SEF or exchange traded
transactions, even where the identity of the counterparty is known. 1080 Rather, we agree
with the commenter that it is appropriate to apply the protections of the business conduct
rules to all security-based swap transactions with special entities other than anonymous
transactions executed on a registered national securities exchange or SEF. 1081 The rules
adopted today are intended to provide certain protections for special entities, and we
think it is appropriate to apply the rules, to the extent practicable, so that special entities
receive the benefits of those protections. Where the identity of the special entity is
known, we believe that it is appropriate to apply the rules so that the special entity
receives the benefits of the protections provided by the rules, including the assistance of
an advisor or qualified independent representative acting in the best interests of that
special entity.
Lastly, we acknowledge the improbability that an SBS Dealer who is acting as an
advisor to a special entity and is therefore subject to the requirements of Rule 15Fh-4
would not know the identity of its special entity counterparty. Consequently, we also
acknowledge that the circumstances where the exception under Rule 15Fh-4(b)(3) would
apply are unlikely, and, in any event, we would question the appropriateness of an SBS
Dealer making a recommendation to an unknown special entity. Nevertheless, we
believe there is value is providing legal certainty for SBS Dealers that seek to transact on

Certain Political Contributions by SBS Dealers
a.

Proposed Rule

As proposed, Rule 15Fh-6(b)(1) would generally make it unlawful for an SBS
Dealer to offer to enter into, or enter into, a security-based swap, or a trading strategy
involving a security-based swap, with a “municipal entity” within two years after any
“contribution” to an “official of such municipal entity” has been made by the SBS Dealer
or any of its “covered associate[s].” Proposed Rule 15Fh-6(b)(3)(i) would also prohibit
an SBS Dealer from paying a third party to “solicit” municipal entities to offer to enter
into, or enter into, a security-based swap, unless the third party is a “regulated person”
that is itself subject to a pay to play restriction under applicable law. Proposed Rule
15Fh-6(b)(3)(ii) would prohibit an SBS Dealer from coordinating or soliciting a third
party, including a political action committee, to make any: (a) contribution to an official
of a municipal entity with which the SBS Dealer is offering to enter into, or has entered
into, a security-based swap, or (b) payment to a political party of a state or locality with
which the SBS Dealer is offering to enter into, or has entered into, a security-based swap.
Finally, proposed Rule 15Fh-6(c) would make it unlawful for an SBS Dealer to do
indirectly or through another person or means anything that would, if done directly, result
in a violation of the prohibitions contained in the proposed rule.
As proposed, Rule 15Fh-6(b) included three main exceptions. First, proposed
Rule 15Fh-6(b)(2)(i) would permit an individual who is a covered associate to make
aggregate contributions without being subject to the two-year time out period, of up to
$350 per election, to any one official for whom the individual was entitled to vote at the
355

time of the contributions, and up to $150 per election, to any one official for whom the
individual was not entitled to vote at the time of the contributions. 1082 Second, proposed
Rule 15Fh-6(b)(2)(ii) would not apply the proposed pay to play rules to contributions
made by an individual more than six months prior to becoming a covered associate of the
SBS Dealer, unless such individual solicits the municipal entity after becoming a covered
associate. Third, proposed Rule 15Fh-6(b)(2)(iii) would not apply the proposed pay to
play rules to a security-based swap that is initiated by a municipal entity on a registered
national securities exchange or SEF, for which the SBS Dealer does not know the identity
of the counterparty at any time up to and including the time of execution of the
transaction.
In addition to the above exceptions, proposed Rule 15Fh-6(e)(1) would provide an
automatic exception to allow an SBS Dealer a limited ability to cure the consequences of
an inadvertent political contribution where: (i) the SBS Dealer discovered the
contribution within four months (120 calendar days) of the date of the contribution; (ii)
the contribution made did not exceed $350; and (ii) the contribution was returned to the
contributor within 60 calendar days of the date of discovery. However, an SBS Dealer
would not be able to rely on this exception more than twice in any 12-month period, or
more than once for any covered associate, regardless of the time between contributions.
Furthermore, under proposed Rule 15Fh-6(d) an SBS Dealer may apply to the

1082

As discussed below, we are modifying the text of this rule to clarify that the de
minimis contribution exception is limited to contributions made by individuals so
that the rule text tracks the explanation of the exception that was outlined in the
Proposing Release and in the CFTC’s Adopting Release for its analogous
exception, as well as the text of the Advisers Act Rule, upon which the exception
is modeled and is intended to complement.

the exemption, the Commission would consider, among other factors: (i) whether the
exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes of the Exchange Act; (ii) whether the SBS
Dealer, (a) before the contribution resulting in the prohibition was made, had adopted and
implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the
proposed rule, (b) prior to or at the time the contribution was made, had any actual
knowledge of the contribution, and (c) after learning of the contribution, had taken all
available steps to cause the contributor to obtain return of the contribution and such other
remedial or preventative measures as may be appropriate under the circumstances; (iii)
whether, at the time of the contribution, the contributor was a covered associate or
otherwise an employee of the SBS Dealer, or was seeking such employment; (iv) the
timing and amount of the contribution; (v) the nature of the election (e.g., state or local);
and (vi) the contributor’s intent or motive in making the contribution, as evidenced by the
facts and circumstances surrounding the contribution.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Six commenters addressed proposed Rule 15Fh-6. 1083 One commenter, who
supported the proposal as applied to SBS Dealers, stated that pay-to-play is an
appropriate area for the Commission to exercise its authority and suggested that this
proposal “would help to eliminate what would otherwise be a serious gap in

protections.” 1084 However, this same commenter does not believe the Commission
should exempt Major SBS Participants from the proposed pay-to-play rules based on
what this commenter claims “may turn out to be a false ‘assumption’ that they will not be
engaged in the type of activity that would make them appropriate.” 1085
Another commenter agreed that the prohibition timeframe should be two years,
consistent with proposed Rule 15Fh-6(b)(1). 1086 That same commenter also believed that
there are no circumstances where an independent representative that is advising a special
entity that is a State, State agency, city, county, municipality, or other political
subdivision of a State, or a governmental plan, as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA,
other than an employee of the special entity, would not be subject to pay to play rules. 1087
One commenter recommended that, with respect to the proposal that independent
representatives be subject to “pay to play” limitations, an exception is needed “for
advisors that are employees of the special entity, given the employer-employee
relationship.” 1088 That same commenter also urged the Commission to delay imposing
the proposed pay to play rule until after the “dealer” definitions are finalized. 1089

procedures in place to deal with pay-to-play rules, other entities that may

in place or to be familiar with these types of rules”).

358

Another commenter suggested, as a general matter, that because the Dodd-Frank
Act did not mandate any restrictions on political contributions by SBS Dealers it is not
clear to that commenter that the Commission needs to impose such a requirement on a
discretionary basis. 1090 This same commenter, however, recommended that the
Commission revise the language of the proposed rule to, at least in the commenter’s
view, parallel the following aspects of MSRB’s regulations: (1) replace as the triggering
occasion for the application of the proposed rule an “offer to enter into or enter into a
security-based swap or a trading strategy involving a security-based swap” with a term—
“engage in municipal security-based swap business”—which they suggest is “more akin
to the terms used in the relevant MSRB Rules”; (2) define “municipal security-based
swap business” in the proposed rule to mean “the execution of a security-based swap with
a municipal entity”; (3) narrow the definition of “solicit” in the proposed rule to include
only “any direct communication by any person with a municipal entity for the purpose of
obtaining or retaining municipal security-based swap business,” so that the term “solicit”
does not “implicate communication by employees of a financial institution that do not
have a role in the security-based swap business and who are already regulated by the
MSRB or the SEC”; (4) clarify the definition of “solicit” in the proposed rule to
“exclude[s] any communication by any person with a municipal entity for the sole
purpose of obtaining or retaining any other type of business covered under pay to play
1090

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5 (stating that MSRB rules “on political
contributions made in connection with municipal securities business will already
cover most [SBS Dealers] doing business with municipal entities, and, there may
not be much marginal benefit to imposing additional restrictions on SBSDs
generally”). See also id. (“Because the Commission’s proposal is nearly identical
to the CFTC Proposal, our comments generally track those we made in response
to the CFTC Proposal.”).

359

restrictions, such as municipal securities business or municipal advisory business”; and
(5) modify the proposed rule to allow for up to three exemptions for inadvertent
contributions, depending on the number of SBS Dealer employees. 1091 The same
commenter also recommended that the Commission include a provision specifying “an
operative date of the rule such that it only applies to contributions made on or after its
effective date.” 1092
Finally, one commenter suggested that the Commission create a safe harbor from
the pay to play rule for a special entity that is represented by a qualified independent
representative that affirmatively selects the SBS Dealer. 1093 That commenter also
suggests excluding state-established plans that are managed by a third-party, such as 529
college savings plans, from the pay to play provisions because otherwise, the provisions
would deter SBS Dealers from transacting with the plans.
After the adoption of the CFTC’s rules in 2015, this same commenter
subsequently proposed that the Commission expressly except from the prohibitions of
Rule 15Fh-6(b)(1) contributions that were “made before the security-based swap dealer
registered with the Commission as such.” 1094 According to the commenter, these changes
would be consistent with CFTC No-Action relief, which clarified that the “look back”
period would not include any time period before an SBS Dealer is required to register as
such, and would therefore prevent retroactive application of the rule. 1095 The commenter

further suggested that the Commission modify the exception under 15Fh-6(b)(2)(B)(iii),
such that it would apply to a security-based swap that was “executed” by a municipal
entity on a registered national securities exchange or registered or an “exempt” securitybased swap execution facility, and was of a “type that is, as of the date of execution,
required to be cleared pursuant to Section 3C of the Act.” 1096 In the alternative, the
commenter suggested that the exception should apply where the SBS Dealer does not
know the identity of the counterparty to the transaction at any time up to and including
execution of the transaction. 1097

Response to Comments and Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fh-6 with
six modifications. First, after the Proposing Release was published, an inadvertent
omission was identified in the definition of “contribution” in proposed Rule 15Fh6(a)(1)(i). The Proposing Release inadvertently omitted the word “federal” in subsection
(i) of the proposed definition of “contribution” in Rule 15Fh-6(a)(1). Although the
Commission did not receive any comments noting this omission, we are modifying the
rule text to include the word “federal” in subsection (i) of the final definition of
“contribution” in Rule 15Fh-6(a)(1) ). 1098 Furthermore, and as stated in the Proposing
Release, the Commission explained that “Rule 15Fh-6 is modeled on, and intended to

1096

Id.

1097

Id.

1098

As such, Final Rule 15Fh-6(a)(1)(i) will read “[f]or the purpose of influencing
any election for federal, state or local office.” In light of this modification, and
for purposes of internal consistency with a parenthetical reference to this rule text
elsewhere in the rule, a parallel modification is being made to Final Rule 15Fh6(d)(5), which will read: “The nature of the election (e.g., federal, state or local).”

361

complement, existing restrictions on pay to play practices under Advisers Act Rule
206(4)-5 . . . and under MSRB Rules G-37 and G-38.” 1099 Importantly, both Advisers
Act Rule 206(4)-5(f)(1)(i) and MSRB Rule G-37(g)(i)(A)(1) include the word “federal”
in their largely identical definitions of the term “contribution.” The Commission is
correcting this inadvertent omission to make the definition of “contribution” in Rule
15Fh-6(a)(1)(i) consistent with the Commission’s existing definition of “contribution”
under Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-5(f)(1)(i). 1100 Correcting this omission also will make
the definition of “contribution” in Rule 15Fh-6(a)(1) consistent with the existing
definition of “contribution” under CFTC Regulation 23.451(a)(1)(i) and, therefore, create
a harmonized regulatory framework that complements and is comparable to Advisers
Act Rule 206(4)–5, MSRB Rules G–37 and CFTC Regulation 23.451. 1101 Based on the
foregoing, the Commission believes that correcting this inadvertent omission in a rule
that was, as set forth in the Proposing Release, “modeled on, and intended to
1099

Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42433, supra note 3.

1100

See Political Contributions by Certain Investment Advisers, Advisers Act Release
No. 3043 (Jul. 1, 2010), 75 FR 41018 (Jul.14, 2010) (“Advisers Act Pay-to-Play
Release”) (adopting Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-5 and stating, among other things,
that the definition of “contribution” in Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-5 “is the same as
. . . the one used in MSRB rule G-37”).

1101

Although subsection (iii) of CFTC Regulation 23.451(a)(1) also includes the term
“federal” in the definition of “contribution”—“[f]or transition or inaugural
expenses incurred by the successful candidate for federal, state, or local office.”—
as explained by the Commission in the Advisers Act Pay-to-Play Release, neither
Rule 206(4)-5 nor MSRB Rule G-37 includes the transition or inaugural expenses
of a successful candidate for federal office in the definition of “contribution.” See
Advisers Act Pay-to-Play Release, 75 FR at 41030, n.154, supra note 1100.
Therefore, because this rule is modeled on, and intended to complement, existing
restrictions on pay to play practices under Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-5 and MSRB
Rules G-37, we also do not include the term “federal” in subsection (iii) of Rule
15Fh-6(a)(1) for the same reasons stated by the Commission when adopting the
Advisers Act pay-to-play rules.

362

complement, existing restrictions on pay to play practices” 1102 will eliminate an
unintentional gap in pay to play protections across regulatory regimes that would
otherwise be created. In light of cross-market participation and expected dual registration
of some entities, substantial consistency across pay to play regulatory regimes, including
having largely consistent definitions of “contribution,” will also be helpful for those
entities that have already established a regulatory infrastructure to comply with pay to
play standards under existing rules.
Second, the Commission is correcting another inadvertent omission in the text of
Rule 15Fh-6(b)(2)(i). As outlined in the Proposing Release, the de minimis contribution
exception found in Rule 15Fh-6(b)(2)(i) is intended to be limited to contributions made
by individuals that are covered associates to track and complement the similar de minimis
contribution exception found in Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-5(b)(1), upon which this
exception was modeled. 1103 Because this exception is conditioned on whether the
covered associate was entitled to vote for the official at the time of the contribution, we
believe it was implicit in the proposed rule text that this exception only applies to
contributions made by a natural person since other legal persons are not entitled to vote.
However, we are modifying the text of Rule 15Fh-6(b)(2)(i) to clarify that this exception
only applies to contributions made by a natural person. With that modification, the rule
text as adopted will track the explanation behind this exception, as explained in the
1102

Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42433, supra note 3.

1103

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42434, supra note 3 (“The proposed rule would
permit an individual who is a covered associate to make aggregate contributions
without being subject to the two-year time out period, of up to $350 per election,
for any one official for whom the individual is entitled to vote, and up to $150 per
election, to an official for whom the individual is not entitled to vote.”) (emphases
added).

363

Proposing Release, as well as the text of Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-5(b)(1). This
modification will also make Rule 15Fh-6(b)(2)(i) consistent with the CFTC’s analogous
de minimis contribution exception, which the CFTC described as similarly intended to
be limited to individuals that are covered associates. 1104
Third, as discussed in Section II.B, the Commission is modifying the exception
under Rule 15Fh-6(b)(2)(iii) so as to apply when the SBS Dealer does not know the
identity of the counterparty with reasonably sufficient time prior to execution of the
transaction to permit the SBS Dealer to comply with the obligations of the rule. This
language differs from the language used in the proposal, which would apply the
exception when the dealer does not know the identity of the counterparty “at any time up
to and including execution of the transaction.” The adoption of this language will
comport with the language used in the verification of counterparty status and disclosure
requirements of final Rule 15Fh-3, as well as the exceptions to the special entity
requirements under Rules 15Fh-4(b)(3) and 15Fh-5(d). As discussed in those sections,
this language is intended to exclude situations where the identity of the counterparty is
not discovered until after execution of a transaction, or where the SBS Dealer learns the
identity of the counterparty with insufficient time to be able to satisfy its obligations
under the rule without delaying the execution of the transaction.

1104

See CFTC Adopting Release, 77 FR at 9799, supra note 21 (explaining that
CFTC’s “proposed rule permitted an individual that is a covered associate to
make aggregate contributions up to $350 per election, without being subject to the
two-year time out period, to any one official for whom the individual is entitled to
vote, and up to $150 per election to an official for whom the individual is not
entitled to vote.”) (emphases added).

364

Fourth, as discussed above in Section II.H.8, the Commission is also modifying
the exception under Rule 15Fh-6(b)(2)(iii) to apply to all security-based swap
transactions executed on a registered or exempt SEF or registered national securities
exchange , rather than just with respect to transactions “initiated by a municipal entity”
on such exchange or SEF (as long as the other conditions of Rule 15Fh-6(b)(2)(iii) are
met). We are revising the rule to be consistent with the adopted Rules 15Fh-4(b)(3) and
15Fh-5(d), and avoid the ambiguity inherent in determining which party “initiated” the
security-based swap. 1105
Fifth, we are also modifying Rule 15Fh-6(e)(2), as one commenter suggested, 1106
to allow for up to three exemptions for inadvertent contributions per calendar year,
depending on the number of natural person covered associates at the SBS Dealer.
Specifically, we are modifying the text of Rule 15Fh-6(e)(2), as suggested by this same
commenter, 1107 to provide that an SBS Dealers that has more than 50 covered associates
would be able to rely on this exception no more than three times per calendar year, while
an SBS Dealer that has 50 or fewer covered associates would be able to rely on this
exception no more than two times per calendar year. This modification will parallel the
provision in Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-5, which also allows “larger” investment advisers
to avail themselves of three automatic exceptions, instead of two, in any calendar year.

1105

See supra Section II.H.8.

proposed rule to allow for up to three exemptions for inadvertent contributions,
depending on the number of SBS Dealer employees).

1107

See id. (suggesting that the Commission modify proposed rule to parallel the
provisions in SEC Rule 206(4)-5, relating to contributions from certain covered
associates of investment advisers).

365

As the Commission noted when modifying its Advisers Act rule proposal to include three
automatic exceptions for larger firms, we agree that inadvertent violations of the rule are
more likely at firms with greater numbers of covered associates, and we believe that the
twice per year limit is appropriate for smaller firms and that the three times per year limit
is appropriate for larger firms. 1108 Although we recognize that this modification will
create an additional exception not found in the CFTC’s analogous rule, 1109 we believe
that harmonization across the Commission’s regulatory regimes will help to create
regulatory efficiencies for entities that have already established a regulatory infrastructure
based on the Commission’s analogous exception.
Finally, the Commission is also correcting in the final rule the following
typographical errors: (1) revising an internal cross-reference in Rule 15Fh-6(a)(2)(iii) to
cross-reference “paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section” rather than
“paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section”; (2) revising an internal crossreference in Rule 15Fh-6(d) to cross-reference “paragraph (b) of this section” rather than
“paragraph (a)(1) of this section”; (3) revising Rule 15Fh-6(b)(3)(ii)(A) to delete a phrase
that was inadvertently repeated “a security-based swap security-based swap”; and (4)
revising Rule 15Fh-6(b)(3)(ii)(B) to also delete a phrase that was inadvertently repeated
“a security-based swap security-based swap.”

1108

See Advisers Act Pay-to-Play Release, 75 FR at 41035-36, n. 238, supra note
1100 (“We do not believe it is appropriate for there to be greater variation in the
number of times advisers may rely on the exception than that based either on their
size or on other characteristics. We are seeking to encourage robust monitoring
and compliance.”).

1109

See CFTC Adopting Release, 77 FR at 9828, supra note 21.

366

With respect to the balance of Rule 15Fh-6, after considering the comments
submitted, the Commission is adopting the Rule as proposed. The Commission disagrees
with certain commenters’ view that Rule 15Fh-6 is not an appropriate area for the
Commission to exercise its authority to prescribe business conduct standards. 1110 The
Commission also disagrees with one commenter’s suggestion that there may not be much
marginal benefit to imposing additional restrictions on SBS Dealers generally. 1111 We
proposed the rule in the context of security-based swaps because pay to play practices
may result in municipal entities entering into transactions not because of hedging needs
or other legitimate purposes, but rather because of campaign contributions given to an
official with influence over the selection process. Where pay to play exists, SBS Dealers
may compete for security-based swap business based on their ability and willingness to
make political contributions, rather than on their merit or the merit of a proposed
transaction. We believe these practices may result in significant harm to municipalities
and others in connection with security-based swap transactions, just as they do in
connection with other municipal securities transactions. 1112 We note that SBS Dealers
1110

See, e.g., FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5 (suggesting that because Dodd-Frank
did not mandate any restrictions on political contributions by SBS Dealers it is not
clear that the Commission needs to impose such a requirement on a discretionary
basis). But see CFA, supra note 5.

may have an incentive to participate in pay to play practices out of concern that they may
be overlooked if they fail to make such contributions. These concerns, coupled with the
furtive nature of pay to play practices and the inability of markets to properly address
them, strongly support the need for prophylactic measures to address them in the context
of security-based swaps. 1113 Furthermore, and as the same commenter concedes, there
would still be a regulatory gap as only “most” SBS Dealers would be covered and, as
another commenter observed, this rule would help to eliminate that gap in protection. 1114
We made this same point in the Proposing Release, noting that while Rule 15Fh-6 is
consistent with and would complement the pay to play prohibition adopted by the MRSB
and CFTC, there are no existing federal pay to play rules that would apply to all SBS
Dealers in their dealings with municipal entities. 1115 Therefore, this rule was proposed to
help eliminate that regulatory gap.
The Commission continues to believe and a commenter also agrees that the twoyear time out provided for in Rule 15Fh-6 is appropriate. 1116 As explained in the
Proposing Release, Rule 15Fh-6(b)(1) would prohibit an SBS Dealer from offering to
enter into, or entering into, a security-based swap or a trading strategy involving a
Jefferson County in connection with undisclosed payments by employees of the
firm).

security-based swap, with a municipal entity within two years after a contribution to an
official of such municipal entity has been made by the SBS Dealer or any of its covered
associates. We believe the two-year time out requirement strikes an appropriate balance,
as it is sufficiently long to act as a deterrent but not so long as to be unnecessarily
onerous. The two-year time out is generally consistent with the time out provisions in
Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-5, MSRB Rule G-37 and CFTC Regulation 23.451.
As we also explained in the Proposing Release, because the rule would attribute to
an SBS Dealer those contributions made by a person even prior to becoming a covered
associate of the SBS Dealer, SBS Dealers need to “look back” in time to determine
whether the two-year time out applies when an employee becomes a covered
associate. 1117 Given that one commenter suggested further specificity as to whether the
rule applies only to contributions made on or after the rules effective date, 1118 we are
interpreting the prohibition in Rule 15Fh-6(b)(1) and its exceptions in Rule 15Fh-6(b)(2),
as well as the restrictions on soliciting or coordinating contributions found in Rule 15Fh6(b)(3), to not be triggered for an SBS Dealer or any of its covered associates by
contributions made before the SBS Dealer registered with the Commission as such. This
1117

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42434, supra note 3. In the Proposing Release,
we explained, as an example, that if the contribution at issue was made less than
two years (or six months, as applicable under Rule 15Fh-6(b)(2)(ii)) before an
individual becomes a covered associate, the rule would prohibit the firm from
entering into a security-based swap with the relevant municipal entity until the
two-year time out period has expired. As noted above, Rule 15Fh-6(b)(2)(ii)
provides an exception to the prohibition in Rule 15Fh-6(b)(1) such that the
prohibition would not apply to contributions made by an individual more than six
months prior to becoming a covered associate of the SBS Dealer, unless such
individual solicits the municipal entity after becoming a covered associate.

1118

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5 (requesting clarification that “the rule would
not unintentionally ban SBS activity as a result of contributions made during the
pre-effectiveness period”). See also SIFMA (August 2015), supra note 5.

369

interpretation is, as one commenter noted, also consistent with CFTC No-Action
relief. 1119 However, such prohibitions will apply to contributions made on or after the
SBS Dealer is required to register with the Commission. We also note that these
prohibitions do not apply to contributions made before the compliance date of this rule
by new covered associates to which the rule’s “look back” applies (i.e., a person who
becomes a covered associate within two years after the contribution is made). This
interpretation is similar to the approach taken by the Commission in connection with
Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-5. 1120 For example, if an individual who becomes a covered
associate on or after the effective date of the rule made a contribution before the effective
date of the rule, that new covered associate’s contribution would not trigger the two-year
time out. On the other hand, if an individual who later becomes a covered associate made
the contribution on or after the compliance date of this rule, the contribution would
trigger the two-year time out if it were made less than, as applicable, six months or two
years before the individual became a covered associate. 1121
With respect to the comment recommending amending the proposed rule to
include Major SBS Participants in the prohibitions of Rule 15Fh-6, 1122 the Commission
does not believe that it is necessary or appropriate to do so. We have considered how the
differences between the definitions of SBS Dealer and Major SBS Participant may be

contributions made before the compliance date established for Rule 206(4)-5 by
new covered associates to which the look back applies).

relevant in formulating the business conduct standards applicable to these entities. 1123
The Commission does not believe it is necessary to revisit its assumption, outlined in the
Proposing Release, that Major SBS Participants are unlikely to give rise to the pay-toplay concerns that this rule is intended to address. 1124 As discussed above, SBS Dealers
may have an incentive to compete for security-based swap business based on their ability
and willingness to participate in pay to play activity, rather than on their merit or the
merit of a proposed transaction, out of concern that they may be overlooked if they fail to
make such contributions. However, we believe the incentives for Major SBS Participants
to engage in pay to play activity are unlikely to be as strong as the incentives for SBS
Dealers given that, by definition, Major SBS Participants are not engaged in securitybased swap dealing activity at levels above the de minimis threshold. 1125

As such,

Major SBS Participants are less likely than SBS Dealers to be acting as dealers in the
security-based swap market and, like any other person whose dealing activity does not
exceed the dealer de minimis thresholds, should therefore be less susceptible to the types
of competitive pressures that may create an incentive to participate in pay to play activity.
We further note that, if a Major SBS Participant is, in fact, engaged in security-based

1123

See, e.g., Section II.B (explaining that, unlike the definition of “security-based
swap dealer,” which focuses on the way a person holds itself out in the market
and whose function is to serve as the point of connection in those markets, the
definition of “major security-based swap participant,” focuses on the market
impacts and risks associated with an entity’s security-based swap positions).

1124

See, e.g., MFA, supra note 5 (urging the Commission to consider separate
regulatory regimes for SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants, arguing that they
are different, and there are “different reasons why the Dodd-Frank Act requires
additional oversight of each”).

See Exchange Act rule 3a61-1(a)(1) (limiting the definition of “major securitybased swap participant” to persons that are not security-based swap dealers).

371

swap dealing activity above the de minimis threshold, it would need to register as an SBS
Dealer and, as such, would need to comply with the pay to play rules imposed by Rule
15Fh-6.
Therefore, SBS Dealers, unlike Major SBS Participants, may have an incentive to
participate in pay to play practices out of concern that they may be overlooked if they fail
to make such contributions which, in turn, would necessitate application of pay to play
prohibitions. Furthermore, the exclusion of Major SBS Participants from Rule 15Fh-6
will also be consistent with the pay to play prohibition adopted by the CFTC. 1126
Substantial consistency across pay to play regulatory regimes will be helpful for those
entities that have already established a regulatory infrastructure to comply with existing
rules. One commenter suggested that, with respect to the proposal that independent
representatives be subject to pay to play limitations, an exception is needed “for advisors
that are employees of the special entity, given the employer-employee relationship.” 1127
However, the Commission notes that the rules already include such an exception. As
explained previously, Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vi) as adopted requires an SBS Entity to have a
reasonable basis for believing that the independent representative is a person that is
subject to rules of the Commission, the CFTC or an SRO subject to the jurisdiction of the
Commission or the CFTC prohibiting it from engaging in specified activities if certain
political contributions have been made, unless the independent representative is an
employee of the special entity.

The same commenter also urged the Commission, in a comment letter dated
August 2011, to delay imposing the proposed pay to play rule until after the “dealer”
definitions are finalized. 1128 As explained in Section IV.B below, the Commission is
adopting a compliance date for final Rules 15Fh-1 through 15Fh-6 and Rule 15Fk-1 that
is the same as the compliance date of the SBS Entity registration rules. 1129
The Commission declines to revise Rule 15Fh-6, as one commenter suggested, by
limiting the triggering event for the application of the pay to play rules to “engag[ing] in
municipal security-based swap business” or “the execution of a security-based swap with
a municipal entity.” 1130 As explained in the Proposing Release, pay to play occurs when
persons seeking to do business with municipal entities make political contributions, or are
solicited to make political contributions, to elected officials or candidates to influence the
selection process. 1131 Hence, pay to play could occur when an SBS Dealer is merely
offering to enter into a security-based swap with a municipal entity, before that SBS
Dealer has yet to actually enter into, engage in, or execute any such transaction. Rather,
the SBS Dealer is seeking to influence the selection process to generate business.
Therefore, the Commission believes that further parsing of the trigging event applicable

1128

APPA, supra note 5.

1129

The Commission explained in the Registration Adopting Release that persons
determined to be SBS Dealers or Major SBS Participants under those rules need
not register as such until the dates provided for in the Commission’s final rules
regarding SBS Entity registration requirements, “and will not be subject to the
requirements applicable to those dealers and major participants until the dates
provided in the applicable final rules.” Registration Adopting Release, supra note

to this rule, as suggested by the commenter, would create an unintended regulatory gap
that would not capture those who offer to enter into a security-based swap transaction
with a municipal entity with the hope that their contributions or payments will influence
the selection process so that they may later enter into, engage in, or execute securitybased swaps with that municipal entity. As one court noted,“[w]hile the risk of
corruption is obvious and substantial, actors in this field are presumably shrewd enough
to structure their relations rather indirectly.” 1132 Furthermore, this same suggestion was
raised to and declined by the CFTC. 1133 As a result, the triggering event for the
application of Rule 15Fh-6 is consistent with the CFTC’s rule and substantially consistent
with the trigging event for certain prohibitions found in the Commission’s Advisers Act
Rule 206(4)-5. 1134
One commenter that addressed the definition of “solicit” in the proposed rule
generally urged us to adopt a narrower definition. 1135 However, the Commission declines
to revise Rule 15Fh-6 to further parse the definition of “solicit.” We believe that it is
unnecessary, as the commenter suggested, for the definition to cover only direct
communications or to state what communications are not covered by the term

“solicit.” 1136 The proposed definition makes clear that to fall within its scope the
communication, whether direct or indirect, must be “with a municipal entity for the
purpose of obtaining or retaining an engagement related to a security-based swap.”
Further parsing and thus narrowing of the definition of “solicit” is unwarranted given the
covert and secretive nature of pay to play practices where, as noted above, “actors in this
field are presumably shrewd enough to structure their relations rather indirectly.” 1137
Rule 15Fh-6 is intended to deter SBS Dealers from participating, even indirectly, in pay
to play practices. The Commission believes that the definition of “solicit” is clear as to
what communications are covered by the pay to play rule, and the definition is also
consistent with the CFTC’s rule and the Commission’s definition of “solicit” in Advisers
Act Rule 206(4)-5 1138 which, as noted above, Rule 15Fh-6 was modeled on and intended
to complement.
Another commenter suggested that the Commission revise Rule 15Fh-6 to create
a safe harbor from the pay to play rule for a special entity that is represented by a
“qualified independent representative” that affirmatively selects the SBS Dealer. 1139
However, the Commission declines to create a safe harbor as the commenter suggested.
For one, the commenter’s argument that such a safe harbor would “assist municipal
1136

See id. (suggesting that the rule should exclude any communication with a
municipal entity for the sole purpose of obtaining or retaining any other type of
business covered under pay-to-play restrictions because, in that commenter’s
view, such communications would already trigger pay-to-play restrictions under
other regulations).

entities and their advisors by preserving their ability to execute security-based swap
transactions” is not persuasive to support this suggested modification when, for example,
one of the purposes behind this rule is the need for prophylactic measures to address
stealthy pay to play practices. 1140 As stated in the Proposing Release and noted above, by
its nature, pay to play is covert and secretive because participants do not broadcast that
contributions or payments are made or accepted for the purpose of influencing the
selection of a financial services provider. The Commission believes that adopting such a
safe harbor, as suggested, could create a means for would-be wrongdoers to covertly and
secretively engage in pay to play practices by, among other things, using situations where
the special entity, represented by a qualified independent representative, selects the SBS
Dealer as a way to evade or otherwise circumvent the rule’s prohibitions. The
commenter’s suggestion would also create a material difference between the regulatory
regimes established by the Commission under the Advisers Act as well as the CFTC’s
rules and would decrease regulatory efficiencies for market participants.
Finally, we are not expressly excluding, as one commenter suggested, stateestablished plans that are managed by a third-party, such as 529 college savings plans,
from the pay to play provisions. 1141 We do not find the commenter’s unsupported claim
that pay to play provisions will deter SBS Dealers from transacting business with such
plans persuasive. More importantly, even if we were to accept this argument, the same
concerns, outlined above, that we are attempting to address with these pay to play
restrictions, including but not limited to the furtive nature of pay to play practices, are
1140

Cf. Blount, 61 F.3d at 945 (noting that, with respect to pay to play practices “the
likelihood of stealth great,” while “the legislative purpose prophylactic”).

See SIFMA (August 2011), supra note 5.

376

also applicable for state-established plans that are managed by a third-party. As noted
above, we believe that SBS Dealers may have an incentive to participate in pay to play
practices, even in connection with state-established plans that are managed by a thirdparty, out of concern that they may be overlooked for business if they fail to make such
contributions. We further believe these practices may result in significant harm to
municipalities and others, including state-established plans, in connection with securitybased swap transactions. Rule 15Fh-6(b)(3)(i) is intended to deter SBS Dealers from
participating, even indirectly, in such practices.

Proposed Rule
a.

Designation, Reporting Line, Compensation and
Removal of the CCO

Proposed Rule 15Fk-1(a) would require an SBS Entity to designate a CCO on its
registration form. Proposed Rule 15Fk-1(b)(1) would require that the CCO report
directly to the board of directors or to the senior officer of the SBS Entity. 1143 Proposed
Rule 15Fk-1(e)(1) would define “board of directors” to include a body performing a
function similar to the board of directors. Proposed Rule 15Fk-1(e)(2) would define
“senior officer” to mean the chief executive officer or other equivalent officer. Finally,
proposed Rule 15Fk-1(d) would require that the compensation and removal of the CCO
be approved by a majority of the board of directors of the SBS Entity.

Duties of the CCO

Proposed Rule 15Fk-1(b) would impose certain duties on the CCO. Proposed
Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2) would require the CCO to review the compliance of the SBS Entity
with respect to the requirements in Section 15F of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. 1144 Proposed Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2) would further require that, as
part of the CCO’s obligation to review compliance by the SBS Entity, the CCO establish,
maintain, and review policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to achieve
compliance by the SBS Entity with Section 15F of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.
Proposed Rule 15Fk-1(b)(3) would require that the CCO, in consultation with the
board of directors or the senior officer of the organization, promptly resolve conflicts of
interest that may arise. 1145 Under proposed Rule 15Fk-1(b)(4), the CCO would be
responsible for administering each policy and procedure that is required to be established
pursuant to Section 15F of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. 1146
Proposed Rule 15Fk-1(b)(5) would require the CCO to establish, maintain and review
policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance with the provisions of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder relating to the SBS Entity’s
business as an SBS Entity. 1147 Proposed Rule 15Fk-1(b)(6) would require the CCO to
establish, maintain and review policies and procedures reasonably designed to remediate
promptly non-compliance issues identified by the CCO through any compliance office

review, look-back, internal or external audit finding, self-reporting to the Commission
and other appropriate authorities, or complaint that can be validated. 1148 Proposed Rule
15Fk-1(e)(3) would define “complaint that can be validated” to mean any written
complaint by a counterparty involving the SBS Entity or an associated person that can be
supported upon reasonable investigation. Proposed Rule 15Fk-1(b)(7) would require the
CCO to establish and follow procedures reasonably designed for prompt handling,
management response, remediation, retesting, and resolution of non-compliance
issues. 1149
c.

Annual Compliance Report

Proposed Rule 15Fk-1(c)(1) would require that the CCO annually prepare and
sign a report describing the SBS Entity’s compliance policies and procedures (including
the code of ethics and conflicts of interest policies) and the compliance of the SBS Entity
with the Exchange Act and rules and regulations thereunder relating to its business as an
SBS Entity. 1150 Proposed Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2) would require that each compliance report
also contain, at a minimum, a description of: (1) the SBS Entity’s enforcement of its
policies and procedures relating to its business as an SBS Entity; (2) any material changes
to the policies and procedures since the date of the preceding compliance report; (3) any

noted in the Proposing Release, the Commission believes there is a drafting error
in the reference to compliance of the “major swap participant” in Section
15F(k)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act, and accordingly, proposed Rule 15Fk-1(c)(1)
would apply the requirement with respect to the compliance of the “major
security-based swap participant.” See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42436 n.288,
supra note 3.

recommendation for material changes to the policies and procedures as a result of the
annual review, the rationale for such recommendation, and whether such policies and
procedures were or will be modified by the SBS Entity to incorporate such
recommendation; and (4) any material compliance matters identified since the date of the
preceding compliance report. Proposed Rule 15Fk-1(e)(4) would define “material
compliance matter” to mean any compliance matter about which the board of directors of
the SBS Entity would reasonably need to know to oversee the compliance of the SBS
Entity, and that involves, without limitation: (1) a violation of the federal securities laws
relating to its business as an SBS Entity by the SBS Entity or its officers, directors,
employees or agents; (2) a violation of the policies and procedures of the SBS Entity
relating to its business as an SBS Entity by the SBS Entity or its officers, directors,
employees or agents; or (3) a weakness in the design or implementation of the policies
and procedures of the SBS Entity relating to its business as an SBS Entity.
Proposed Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(ii)(D) would require the compliance report to include
a certification, under penalty of law, that the compliance report is accurate and
complete. 1151 Proposed Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(ii)(A) would require that the compliance
report accompany each appropriate financial report of the SBS Entity that is required to
be furnished or filed with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15F and the
rules and regulations thereunder. 1152 To allow the compliance report to accompany each
appropriate financial report within the required timeframe, proposed Rule 15Fk1(c)(2)(ii)(B) would require the compliance report to be submitted to the board of

directors, the audit committee and the senior officer of the SBS Entity at the earlier of
their next scheduled meeting or within 45 days of the date of execution of the
certification.
Proposed Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(ii)(C) would require the compliance report to include
a written representation that the chief executive officer(s) (or equivalent officer(s))
has/have conducted one or more meetings with the CCO in the preceding 12 months, the
subject of which addresses the SBS Entity’s obligations as set forth in the proposed rules
and in Exchange Act Section 15F. The subject of the meeting(s) must include: (1) the
matters that are the subject of the compliance report; (2) the SBS Entity’s compliance
efforts as of the date of such meeting; and (3) significant compliance problems and plans
in emerging business areas relating to its business as an SBS Entity. 1153
Under proposed Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(iii), if compliance reports are separately bound
from the financial statements, the compliance reports shall be accorded confidential
treatment to the extent permitted by law.

Comments on the Proposed Rule
a.

Designation, Reporting Line, and Compensation and
Removal of the CCO

Five commenters addressed the designation, reporting line and compensation and
removal of the CCO. 1154 Two commenters argued for greater flexibility for SBS Entities
with respect to these requirements. 1155 The first commenter objected to the mandated line

of reporting of the CCO in the proposed rule (which would require the CCO to report
directly to the board of directors or to the senior officer of the SBS Entity) and
recommended allowing SBS Entities greater flexibility in determining the most effective
reporting framework in light of their individual structure and circumstances. 1156 The
commenter noted that, particularly in large institutions where security-based swap
transactions are one of many lines of business, the proposed rule would prohibit the CCO
from reporting to other senior management who may be more familiar with the securitybased swap activities of the SBS Entity. 1157 Accordingly, the commenter recommended
that the Commission define the term “senior officer” to include a more senior officer
within the SBS Entity’s compliance, risk, legal or other control function as the SBS
Entity shall reasonably determine to be appropriate. 1158
Similarly, the second commenter asked the Commission to provide guidance
specifying that if a division of a larger company is an SBS Entity, then the CCO of such
entity could report to the senior officer of that division. 1159 Additionally, the commenter
requested guidance: (1) regarding the supervisory liability of compliance and legal
personnel employed by SBS Entities that is consistent with the guidance it has issued for
broker-dealers’ legal and compliance personnel; and (2) clarifying that the CCO may
share additional executive responsibilities within the SBS Entity. 1160
Both commenters objected to the proposed requirement that the compensation and

removal of the CCO be approved by a majority of the SBS Entity’s board of directors. 1161
The first commenter recommended eliminating the requirement, noting that the provision
is not mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, is not consistent with other requirements
applicable to similarly situated employees, and would impose organizational
inefficiencies and other unwarranted costs while offering minimal benefits. 1162 The
second commenter recommended allowing either the board of directors or the senior
officer of the SBS Entity to approve the compensation or removal of the CCO to be
consistent with the parallel CFTC requirement, asserting that this change would
reasonably ensure the independence and effectiveness of the CCO while providing for
greater flexibility. 1163
Three commenters argued for more stringent requirements with respect to the
designation, reporting line and compensation and removal of the CCO. 1164 The first
commenter asserted that ensuring market participants have CCOs with real authority and
autonomy to police a firm from within is one of the most efficient and effective tools
available to regulators, and accordingly, recommended adopting additional measures to
protect the authority and independence of CCOs. 1165 Specifically, the commenter
suggested: (1) requiring the CCO to meet competency standards, including a lack of
disciplinary history and criteria demonstrating relevant knowledge and experience; (2)

prohibiting the CCO from serving as General Counsel or a member of the legal
department of the SBS Entity; (3) appointing a senior CCO with overall responsibility for
compliance by a group of affiliated or controlled entities; (4) vesting authority in
independent board members to oversee the hiring, compensation, and termination of the
CCO; (5) requiring the CCO to have direct access to the board; and (6) prohibiting
attempts by officers, directors, or employees to coerce, mislead, or otherwise interfere
with the CCO. 1166
Similarly, the second commenter recommended that the authority and
responsibility to appoint or remove the CCO, or to materially change its duties and
responsibilities, be vested only in the independent directors and not the full board. 1167
Additionally, the commenter suggested that the CCO have only a compliance role and no
other role or responsibility that could create conflicts of interest or threaten its
independence, and that the CCO’s compensation be designed in a way that avoids
conflicts of interest. 1168
The third commenter asserted that firms should not be permitted to allow the
CCO to report to a senior officer of the firm as a substitute for reporting to the board. 1169
b.

Duties of the CCO

supported the Commission’s approach in the proposal regarding the role and
responsibilities of the CCO, but recommended the following modifications: (1) changing
the phrase “ensure compliance” in proposed Rule 15Fk-1(b)(5) to “achieve compliance,”
(2) confirming that the relevant conflicts of interest under proposed Rule 15Fk-1(b)(3)
would be those which are reasonably identified by the SBS Entity’s policies and
procedures, taking into consideration the nature of the SBS Entity’s business, and (3)
clarifying that a CCO’s responsibility under proposed Rule 15Fk-1(b)(4) to “administer”
a firm’s policies and procedures is limited to coordinating supervisors’ administration of
the relevant policies and procedures. 1171
The second commenter recommended harmonizing the Commission’s CCO
requirements with FINRA Rule 3130 and the CFTC’s CCO requirements for Swap
Entities to enable SBS Entities that are also broker-dealers and/or Swap Entities to make
use of their existing infrastructure and to minimize confusion. 1172 Specifically, the
commenter recommended a number of changes to proposed Rule 15Fk-1(b) to align the
description of the duties of an SBS Entity’s CCO with those of a broker-dealer CCO, as
described in applicable FINRA and SEC guidance, and guidance in the Proposing
Release regarding the supervisory responsibilities of an SBS Entity’s CCO. 1173 In
particular, the commenter sought clarification that the SBS Entity has the responsibility,
and not the CCO in his or her personal capacity, to establish, maintain and review

required policies and procedures. 1174 The recommended changes include: (1) replacing
the requirement in proposed Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2) to “establish, maintain and review”
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Section
15F of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with a requirement to “prepare
the registrant’s annual assessment of” such policies and procedures; (2) qualifying the
requirement in proposed Rule 15Fk-1(b)(3) to promptly resolve conflicts of interest in
consultation with the board of directors or the senior officer of the SBS Entity with the
qualifying language “take reasonable steps to” resolve; (3) clarifying that the requirement
in proposed Rule 15Fk-1(b)(4) to administer required policies and procedures involves
“advising on the development of, and reviewing, the registrant’s processes for (i)
modifying those policies and procedures as business, regulatory and legislative changes
and events dictate, (ii) evidencing supervision by the personnel responsible for the
execution of those policies and procedures, and (iii) testing the registrant’s compliance
with those policies and procedures;” (4) qualifying the requirements in proposed Rules
15Fk-1(b)(5)-(7) to establish, maintain and review certain policies and procedures with
the qualifying language “take reasonable steps to ensure that the registrant” establishes,
maintains and reviews such policies and procedures; and (5) eliminating the timing
requirements in proposed Rules 15Fk-1(b)(6) and (7) that the CCO “promptly” take the
required actions. 1175 Finally, the commenter requested that the Commission provide
guidance explaining that resolution of a conflict of interest encompasses both elimination
and mitigation of the conflict, and that the CCO’s role in resolving conflicts may involve
1174

1175

386

actions other than making the ultimate decision with regard to such conflict. 1176
In contrast, the third commenter recommended mandating that CCOs have greater
authority to resolve and mitigate conflicts of interest that may cause compliance
problems. 1177 At a minimum, the commenter suggested requiring the CCO to highlight in
the compliance report any recommendations it made with regard to resolution or
mitigation of conflicts of interest that were not adopted. 1178
c.

Annual Compliance Report

Four commenters addressed the annual compliance report requirements. 1179 One
commenter noted several concerns with the annual compliance report requirement. 1180
First, the commenter requested that the Commission permit the consolidation of annual
compliance reporting requirements for SBS Entities under common control (including
those that are also registered broker-dealers) to avoid forcing a consolidated financial
institution to submit separate compliance reports for each SBS Entity and broker-dealer
within the corporate structure. 1181 Second, the commenter expressed concern regarding
the requirement in proposed Rule 15Fk-1(c)(1)(i) that the compliance report contain a
description of the compliance of the SBS Entity, as well as a description of the SBS
Entity’s compliance policies and procedures, as required under proposed Rule 15Fk-

1(c)(1)(ii). 1182 The commenter requested that the Commission clarify that proposed Rule
15Fk-1(c)(1)(i) would be satisfied by a description of the particular matters set forth in
proposed Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(i), noting that a requirement to describe an SBS Entity’s
“compliance” in an absolute sense is so broad and so vague as to be incapable of being
fulfilled in practice. 1183 Third, the commenter recommended that the Commission amend
its Freedom of Information Act regulations in a manner consistent with proposed Rule
15Fk-1(c)(2)(iii), which would provide that compliance reports bound separately from
financial statements shall be accorded confidential treatment to the extent permitted by
law. 1184
The commenter also had several concerns regarding the required certification of
the compliance report in proposed Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(ii)(D). 1185 The commenter noted
that the Dodd-Frank Act does not explicitly require the CCO to be the individual
responsible for certifying the compliance report and recommended that the CEO or other
relevant senior officer, not the CCO, be responsible for the certification. 1186
Alternatively, if the CCO is required to certify, the commenter requested that the CEO
also be required to do so. 1187 Additionally, the commenter requested that the
Commission clarify that the liability standard for the certification is the same as that
which applies to other documents filed with the Commission, including liability under

Section 32 of the Exchange Act for willfully and knowingly making false or misleading
material statements or omissions to the Commission. 1188 The commenter also asserted
that the certifier should, as in other contexts, be responsible solely for stating that the
documents were prepared under his or her direction or supervision in accordance with a
system designed to ensure that qualified personnel would properly gather and evaluate
the documents, and that based on his or her inquiry of those persons who were
responsible for gathering the documents, to the best of his or her knowledge, the
documents are accurate in all material respects. 1189
Similarly, the second commenter requested that the Commission provide guidance
clarifying that if a certifying officer has complied in good faith with policies and
procedures reasonably designed to confirm the accuracy and completeness of annual
compliance report, both the SBS Entity and the certifying officer would have a basis for
defending accusations of false, incomplete, or misleading statements or representations
made in the report. 1190 The commenter also requested a number of changes to the annual
compliance report requirements in proposed Rule 15Fk-1(c) to harmonize them with the
CFTC’s parallel requirements. 1191 The commenter argued that alignment of the content
requirements for annual compliance reports “would allow SBS Entities to leverage the
extensive and rigorous procedures they have adopted to comply with the CFTC CCO
Rule and related guidance.” 1192 Specifically, the recommended changes include: (1)

eliminating the proposed requirement to include a “description of compliance” in the
annual compliance report, asserting that this requirement would add unnecessary
ambiguity; (2) specifying that the report need only contain a description of the “written”
compliance policies and procedures of the SBS Entity; (3) changing the proposed
description requirement in proposed Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(i)(A) from “enforcement” of the
SBS Entity’s policies and procedures to an “assessment of the effectiveness” of such
policies and procedures; (4) specifying that the requirement to describe material changes
to policies and procedures in proposed Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(i)(B) refers to the “registrant’s”
policies and procedures; (5) changing the proposed description requirement in proposed
Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(i)(C) from “any recommendation for material changes to the policies
and procedures” to “areas for improvement, and recommended potential or prospective
changes or improvements to its compliance program and resources devoted to
compliance;” (6) changing the proposed description requirement in proposed Rule 15F1(c)(2)(i)(D) from “any material compliance matters” to “any material non-compliance
matters” identified since the date of the preceding report (and eliminating the definition
of material compliance matter); (7) aligning the deadline for filing of the compliance
report with the CFTC’s 90 day deadline; (8) allowing for submission of the compliance
report to either the board of directors or the senior officer, as opposed to requiring
submission to both the board of directors (and audit committee) and the senior officer, as
proposed; (9) eliminating the proposed requirement that the report contain a written
representation regarding the required annual meeting between the CEO and the CCO;
(10) eliminating the proposed specifications for what topics such meeting must cover;
(11) allowing either the CCO or the senior officer to certify the annual compliance report

390

to the best of his or her knowledge; and (12) providing for amendments to, extensions of
filing deadlines for, and incorporation of other reports by reference in the annual
compliance report. 1193
The third commenter suggested: (1) requiring the CCO to meet quarterly with the
Audit Committee in addition to annual meetings with the board of directors and senior
management; and (2) requiring the board to review and comment on, but not edit, the
compliance report. 1194 Similarly, the fourth commenter expressed support for requiring
the audit committee to review and the CCO to certify the compliance report, and argued
that the CCO should not be permitted to qualify its report. 1195

Response to Comments and Final Rule

Rule 15Fk-1, as adopted, is designed to be generally consistent with the current
compliance obligations applicable to CCOs of other Commission-regulated entities, 1196 as
well as with the CFTC’s CCO rules applicable to Swap Entities. As noted in the
Proposing Release, the requirements of Rule 15Fk-1 underscore the central role that
sound compliance programs play to help ensure compliance with the Exchange Act and

Designation, Reporting Line, and Compensation and
Removal of the CCO

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fk-1(a)
(designation of the CCO), Rule 15Fk-1(b)(1) (reporting line of the CCO), Rule 15Fk-1(d)
(compensation and removal of the CCO), and the associated definitions of “board of
directors” and “senior officer” in Rule 15Fk-1(e)(1) and (2) as proposed. To address
concerns that an SBS Entity’s commercial interests might have undue influence on a
CCO’s ability to make forthright disclosure to the board of directors or the senior officer
about any compliance failures, the rule is designed to help promote CCO independence
and effectiveness by establishing a direct reporting line to the board or senior officer, and
by requiring compensation and removal decisions to be made by a majority of the board
of directors. Accordingly, Rule 15Fk-1(b)(1) requires the CCO to report directly to the
board or senior officer of the SBS Entity. 1199 In addition, pursuant to Rule 15Fk-1(d) any

1199

One commenter recommended that the Commission define the term “senior
officer” to include a more senior officer within the SBS Entity’s compliance, risk,
legal or other control function as the SBS Entity shall reasonably determine to be
appropriate. See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5. The Commission declines to
make this change because it could potentially undercut the independence of the
CCO, and as noted above, the Commission believes it is important for the CCO to
be independent to mitigate potential conflicts for the CCO in reporting or
addressing compliance failures. Another commenter requested that the
Commission provide guidance specifying that if a division of a larger company is
an SBS Entity, then the CCO of such entity could report to the senior officer of

392

decision to remove the CCO from his or her responsibilities or approve his or her
compensation must be made by a majority of the board. The Commission is not
eliminating the requirement that only a majority of the board can approve the
compensation or removal of the CCO, as suggested by one commenter, 1200 nor is the
Commission broadening the rule to allow an SBS Entity’s senior officer to approve the
compensation and removal of the CCO, as suggested by another commenter. 1201 The
Commission believes that eliminating the requirement that only a majority of the board
can approve the compensation or removal of the CCO, or allowing an SBS Entity’s
senior officer to approve the compensation and removal of the CCO could undermine the
CCO’s independence and effectiveness, particularly if the CCO is responsible for
reviewing the senior officer’s compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. 1202

that division. See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5. The Commission has
not yet addressed a process through which firms could submit an application for
limited designation as an SBS Entity, such as for a division within a larger
company. See Registration Adopting Release, 80 FR at 48966 n.13, supra note
989 (addressing limited designation and registration).
1200

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5.

1201

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

1202

This is consistent with the position the Commission took in adopting CCO
requirements for security-based swap data repositories (“SDRs”). See SecurityBased Swap Data Repository Registration, Duties, and Core Principles, Exchange
Act Release No. 74246 (Feb. 11, 2015), 80 FR 14438, 14507 (Mar. 19, 2015)
(“SDR Registration Release”) (“The Commission is not extending the
applicability of this rule to an SDR’s senior officer because the Commission
believes that this may unnecessarily create conflicts of interest for the CCO,
particularly if the CCO is subsequently responsible for reviewing the senior
officer’s compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.”). The Commission also declines to narrow the reporting line
requirement to specify that the CCO must report only to the board of directors
(and not the senior officer), as suggested by one commenter. See CFA, supra note

393

In promoting a CCO’s independence and effectiveness, the Commission does not
believe that it is necessary to adopt additional requirements suggested by commenters
prohibiting a CCO from having additional roles or responsibilities outside of compliance,
such as being a member of the SBS Entity’s legal department or from serving as the SBS
Entity’s general counsel. 1203 To the extent that this poses a potential or existing conflict
of interest, the Commission believes that an SBS Entity’s written policies and procedures
can be designed to adequately identify and mitigate any such conflict. 1204

5. Exchange Act Section 15F(k)(2)(A) gives SBS Entities the flexibility of
allowing the CCO to report to either the board or senior officer, and the
Commission believes that requiring a majority of the board to approve the
compensation or removal of the CCO is sufficient to promote the independence of
the CCO, allowing for greater flexibility in the reporting line.
1203

See Better Markets (August 2011), supra note 5; Better Markets (October 2013),
supra note 5; Barnard, supra note 5. Cf. SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5
(requesting clarification that the CCO may share additional executive
responsibilities within the SBS Entity). The Commission is also not adopting a
commenter’s suggestion to require the appointment of a senior CCO with overall
responsibility for compliance by a group of affiliated or controlled entities. See
Better Markets (August 2011), supra note 5; Better Markets (October 2013), supra
note 5. The Commission believes entities should have the flexibility to design
their organizational structure to meet their business needs.

1204

As discussed in Section II.G.6, supra, Rule 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii)(H) requires SBS
Entities to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to prevent the supervisory system from being compromised
due to the conflicts of interest that may be present with respect to the associated
person being supervised. This is consistent with the position the Commission
took in adopting CCO requirements for SDRs. See SDR Registration Release, 80
FR at 14507, supra note 1202 (“In promoting a CCO’s independence and
effectiveness, the Commission does not believe that it is necessary to adopt, as
two commenters suggested, a rule prohibiting a CCO from being a member of the
SDR’s legal department or from serving as the SDR’s general counsel. To the
extent that this poses a potential or existing conflict of interest, the Commission
believes that an SDR’s written policies and procedures can be designed to
adequately identify and mitigate any associated costs.”).

394

The Commission also is not adopting rules requiring independent board members
to oversee the hiring, compensation and termination of the CCO or any material changes
to the CCO’s duties, requiring the CCO to have direct access to the board, or expressly
prohibiting attempts by officers, directors, or employees to coerce, mislead or otherwise
interfere with the CCO, as suggested by commenters. 1205 The Commission continues to
believe that requiring a majority of the board to approve the compensation and removal
of the CCO is appropriate to promote the CCO’s independence and effectiveness, and
believes that it is appropriate not to provide for additional requirements such as those
suggested by the commenters. 1206 With this approach, the Commission intends to
promote the independence and effectiveness of the CCO while also providing SBS
Entities flexibility in structuring their businesses and directing their compliance
resources.
One commenter suggested requiring the CCO to meet certain competency
standards, including criteria demonstrating relevant knowledge and experience. 1207
Given the critical role that a CCO is intended to play in helping to ensure an SBS Entity’s
compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, the
Commission believes that an SBS Entity’s CCO generally should be competent and
knowledgeable regarding the federal securities laws, empowered with full responsibility
1205

See Better Markets (August 2011), supra note 5; Better Markets (October 2013),
supra note 5; Barnard, supra note 5.

1206

The Commission also believes that requiring a majority of the board to approve
the compensation of the CCO will address a commenter’s concern regarding
designing the compensation of the CCO in a way that avoids conflicts of interest.
See Barnard, supra note 5.

1207

395

and authority to develop appropriate policies and procedures for the SBS Entity, as
necessary, and responsible for monitoring compliance with the SBS Entity’s policies and
procedures adopted pursuant to rules under the Exchange Act. 1208 However, we believe
that such considerations are properly vested in the SBS Entity, based on the particulars of
its business, and thus, the Commission is not adopting specific requirements concerning
the background, training or business experience for a CCO.
Another commenter asked that the Commission provide guidance regarding the
supervisory liability of compliance and legal personnel employed by SBS Entities to
reflect the guidance Commission staff has issued for broker-dealers’ legal and
compliance personnel. 1209 The Commission recognizes that compliance and legal
personnel play a critical role in efforts by regulated entities to develop and implement
effective compliance systems, including by providing advice and counsel to business line
personnel. As noted in the Proposing Release, the title of CCO does not, in and of itself,
carry supervisory responsibilities, and a CCO does not become a “supervisor” solely
1208

This is generally consistent with the position the Commission took in adopting
CCO requirements for SDRs. See SDR Registration Release, 80 FR at 14510,
supra note 1202 (“Given the critical role that a CCO is intended to play in
ensuring an SDR’s compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, the Commission believes that an SDR’s CCO should be
competent and knowledgeable regarding the federal securities laws, should be
empowered with full responsibility and authority to develop and enforce
appropriate policies and procedures for the SDR, as necessary, and should be
responsible for monitoring compliance with the SDR’s policies and procedures
adopted pursuant to rules under the Exchange Act. However, the Commission
will not substantively review a CCO’s competency, and is not requiring any
particular level of competency or business experience for a CCO.”).

because he or she has provided advice or counsel concerning compliance or legal issues
to business line personnel, or assisted in the remediation of an issue. Consistent with
current industry practice, the Commission generally would not expect a CCO appointed
in accordance with Rule 15Fk-1 to have supervisory responsibilities outside of the
compliance department. 1210 Accordingly, absent facts and circumstances that establish
otherwise, the Commission generally would not expect that a CCO would be subject to a
sanction by the Commission for failure to supervise other SBS Entity personnel. 1211
Moreover, a CCO with supervisory responsibilities could rely on the provisions of Rule
15Fh-3(h)(3), under which a person associated with an SBS Entity shall not be deemed to
have failed to reasonably supervise another person if the conditions in the rule are
met. 1212 The fact that the Exchange Act does not presume that compliance or legal
personnel are supervisors solely because of their compliance or legal functions does not
in any way diminish the compliance duties of the CCO pursuant to Rule 15Fk-1(b), as
discussed below.
b.

Duties of the CCO

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2)(4) (duties of the CCO) with a number of modifications. In response to a commenter’s
concerns, 1213 the modifications (discussed below) are primarily intended to provide
certainty regarding the CCO’s duties under the final rule, consistent with the duties in

FINRA Rule 3130 and the CFTC’s CCO requirements for Swap Entities, and to clarify
the role of the CCO generally. To the extent our requirements are consistent with FINRA
and/or CFTC standards, this consistency should result in efficiencies for SBS Entities that
have already established infrastructure to comply with the FINRA and/or CFTC
standards. Consistent wording regarding expectations for CCOs will also allow such
SBS Entities to more easily analyze compliance with the Commission’s rule against their
existing activities to comply with FINRA Rule 3130 and the CFTC’s CCO rule for Swap
Entities.
First, we are reorganizing Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2) to provide additional clarity and
certainty as to the obligations of the CCO. Specifically, our modifications are designed
to make clear that in taking reasonable steps to ensure that the SBS Entity establishes,
maintains and reviews written policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder relating to its
business as an SBS Entity, the CCO must satisfy the three specific obligations
enumerated in Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2)(i)–(iii), discussed below.
Second, in addition to the reorganization described above, we are making some
changes to the descriptions of the duties listed in Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2). As described above,
we are making changes to the duty that now appears in Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2). Specifically,
the Commission agrees with a commenter that it is the responsibility of the SBS Entity,
not the CCO in his or her personal capacity, to establish and enforce required policies and
procedures. 1214 Accordingly, to reflect that, the Commission is qualifying the proposed
requirement to establish, maintain and review policies and procedures reasonably
1214

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5.

398

designed to ensure compliance with the Exchange Act and rules and regulations
thereunder with the qualifying language “take reasonable steps to ensure that the
registrant” establishes, maintains and reviews such policies and procedures. The
Commission is also changing the requirement in Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2) from a requirement to
“ensure compliance” to a requirement to “achieve compliance” with the Exchange Act
and rules and regulations thereunder relating to the SBS Entity’s business as an SBS
Entity in response to a specific suggestion from a commenter, 1215 and adding the word
“written” before policies and procedures to clarify that the policies and procedures
required by the rule must be written. Similar to the qualifying language with respect to
the registrant’s policies and procedures, the Commission is making the change from
“ensure compliance” to “achieve compliance” to clarify that it is not the role of the CCO
to “ensure” compliance. The Commission believes the formulation “take reasonable
steps to ensure that the registrant establishes, maintains and reviews written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance” (as opposed to the proposed
formulation of “establish, maintain and review policies and procedures reasonably
designed to ensure compliance”) more appropriately describes the CCO’s role. The
Commission also notes that the policies and procedures referred to in Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2)
include those required by Rules 15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii), 15Fk-1(b)(2)(ii) and 15Fk-1(b)(2)(iii),
and any other policies and procedures the SBS Entity deems necessary to achieve
compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder relating to its
business as an SBS Entity.

1215

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

399

We are also modifying the three specific obligations of the CCO now enumerated
in Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2)(i)–(iii) that the CCO must perform to satisfy his or her duty to take
reasonable steps to ensure that the registrant establishes, maintains and reviews policies
and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance. As adopted, Rule 15Fk1(b)(2)(i) requires the CCO to “revie[w] the compliance of the [SBS Entity] with respect
to the [SBS Entity] requirements described in [S]ection 15F of the [Exchange Act], and
the rules and regulations thereunder, where the review shall involve preparing the
registrant’s annual assessment of its written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to achieve compliance with [S]ection 15F of the [Exchange Act] and the rules and
regulations thereunder, by the [SBS Entity].” The requirement that the CCO “prepare the
registrant’s annual assessment of its” written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to achieve compliance with Section 15F of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder represents a change from the proposed requirement that the CCO
“establish, maintain and review” such policies and procedures. We are making this
change in response to a specific suggestion from a commenter. 1216 As discussed above,
the Commission agrees with the commenter that it is the responsibility of the SBS Entity,
not the CCO in his or her personal capacity, to establish and enforce required policies and
procedures, and believes that this change clarifies that point.
As adopted, Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2)(ii) requires the CCO to “tak[e] reasonable steps to
ensure that the registrant establishes, maintains and reviews policies and procedures
reasonably designed to remediate non-compliance issues identified by the [CCO] through
any means, including any: (A) Compliance office review; (B) Look-back; (C) Internal or
1216

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5.

400

external audit finding; (D) Self-reporting to the Commission and other appropriate
authorities; or (E) Complaint that can be validated.” This represents a change from the
proposed requirements: (1) that the CCO “establish, maintain and review” such policies
and procedures, and (2) that such policies and procedures be reasonably designed to
remediate “promptly” non-compliance issues. Additionally, as adopted, Rule 15Fk1(b)(2)(iii) requires the CCO to “tak[e] reasonable steps to ensure that the registrant
establishes and follows procedures reasonably designed for the handling, management
response, remediation, retesting, and resolution of non-compliance issues.” This also
represents a change from the proposed requirements: (1) that the CCO “establish and
follow” such procedures, and (2) that such procedures be reasonably designed for the
“prompt” handling, management response, remediation, retesting, and resolution of noncompliance issues.” We are making these changes in response to specific suggestions
from a commenter. 1217 As discussed above, the Commission agrees with the commenter
that it is the responsibility of the SBS Entity, not the CCO in his or her personal capacity,
to establish and enforce required policies and procedures, and believes that the first
change to each provision clarifies that point. Additionally, as discussed above,
eliminating the proposed timing requirements with respect to the “prompt” remediation
and handling of non-compliance issues provides greater consistency with the parallel
CFTC requirements. With this change, the Commission intends to focus the CCO’s
efforts on the effective remediation and handling of non-compliance issues, without
placing undue emphasis on speed at the expense of other factors. We believe, however,

1217

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5.

401

that the remediation and handling of non-compliance issues generally should occur
within a reasonable timeframe.
In addition to the changes described above, the Commission is making one more
modification to the duty to remediate non-compliance issues in final Rule 15Fk1(b)(2)(ii). The proposed rule referred only to non-compliance issues “identified by the
[CCO] through any: (A) Compliance office review; (B) Look-back; (C) Internal or
external audit finding; (D) Self-reporting to the Commission and other appropriate
authorities; or (E) Complaint that can be validated.” However, as noted above, Rule
15Fk-1(b)(2)(iii) requires that the CCO “tak[e] reasonable steps to ensure that the
registrant establishes and follows procedures reasonably designed for the handling,
management response, remediation, retesting, and resolution of non-compliance issues”
(emphasis added). Because this requirement is not limited to non-compliance issues
identified by the CCO through a specific means, the Commission believes it is
appropriate to clarify that final Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2)(ii) covers non-compliance issues
identified by the CCO through any means, including the means specifically listed in subparagraphs (A)-(E) of the rule.
Third, the Commission is modifying the duties of the CCO now enumerated in
Rules 15Fk-1(b)(3) and (4). As adopted, Rule 15Fk-1(b)(3) requires the CCO to “[i]n
consultation with the board of directors or the senior officer of the [SBS Entity], take
reasonable steps to resolve any material conflicts of interest that may arise.” This
represents a change from the proposed requirement, which would have required the CCO
to “[i]n consultation with the board of directors or the senior officer of the [SBS Entity],
promptly resolve any conflicts of interest that may arise.” The Commission is adding the

402

“take reasonable steps” language and materiality qualifier to further clarify and qualify
the role of the CCO in resolving conflicts of interest in response to concerns raised by
commenters. 1218 Such conflicts of interest could include conflicts between the
commercial interests of an SBS Entity and its statutory and regulatory responsibilities,
and conflicts between, among, or with associated persons of the SBS Entity. As noted in
the Proposing Release and consistent with the discussions of the CCO’s role above, the
Commission understands that the primary responsibility for the resolution of conflicts
generally lies with the business units within SBS Entities because the business line
personnel are those with the power to make decisions regarding the business of the SBS
Entity. 1219 As a result, the Commission anticipates that the CCO’s role with respect to
such resolution and mitigation of conflicts of interest would include the recommendation
of one or more actions, as well as the appropriate escalation and reporting with respect to
any issues related to the proposed resolution of potential or actual conflicts of interest,
rather than responsibility to execute the business actions that may be associated with the
ultimate resolution of such conflicts. Furthermore, the Commission recognizes that a
CCO typically will not exercise the supervisory authority to resolve conflicts of interest,
1218

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5 (requesting confirmation that the relevant
conflicts of interest under proposed Rule 15Fk-1(b)(3) would be those which are
reasonably identified by the SBS Entity’s policies and procedures, taking into
consideration the nature of the SBS Entity’s business); SIFMA (September 2015),
supra note 5 (recommending qualifying the requirement to promptly resolve
conflicts of interest in consultation with the board or senior officer with the
qualifying language “take reasonable steps to” resolve, and requesting guidance
explaining that resolution of a conflict of interest encompasses both elimination
and mitigation of the conflict and that the CCO’s role in resolving conflicts may
involve actions other than making the ultimate decision with regard to such
conflict).

1219

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42436, supra note 3.

403

and the revisions to the rule are intended to clarify that CCOs are not required to actually
resolve such conflicts. 1220 Finally, in response to a specific suggestion made by a
commenter, 1221 the Commission is eliminating the proposed timing requirement with
respect to the “prompt” resolution of conflicts of interest to harmonize with the parallel
CFTC requirement. With this change, the Commission intends to focus the CCO’s
efforts on the effective resolution of conflicts of interest, without placing undue emphasis
on speed at the expense of other factors. We believe, however, that the resolution of
conflicts of interest generally should occur within a reasonable timeframe.
As adopted, Rule 15Fk-1(b)(4) requires the CCO to “[a]dminister each policy and
procedure that is required to be established pursuant to [S]ection 15F of the [Exchange
Act] and the rules and regulations thereunder.” This represents a change from the
proposed requirement that the CCO “be responsible for” administering such policies and
procedures. The Commission is eliminating the words “be responsible for” because we
believe they are unnecessary and could cause confusion. The CCO is responsible for
1220

This is consistent with the position the Commission took in adopting a similar
requirement for CCOs of SDRs. See SDR Registration Release, 80 FR at 14510,
supra note 1202. The Commission is not, as suggested by one commenter,
expressly requiring the CCO to highlight in the annual compliance report any
recommendations he or she made with regard to resolution or mitigation of
conflicts of interest that were not adopted. See CFA, supra note 5. The
Commission believes the requirement in Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(i)(C) to include a
description in the annual compliance report of areas for improvement, and
recommended potential or prospective changes or improvements to its compliance
program and resources, as discussed below, will adequately cover such issues.
The requirement is broadly framed and will allow the CCO the flexibility to
include in the annual compliance report a description of any areas where the CCO
thinks the compliance program needs to be improved, including, as appropriate,
any recommendations the CCO made with regard to the resolution or mitigation
of conflicts of interest that have not yet been adopted.

complying with all of the duties listed in Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2)-(4). Commenters requested
clarifications as to what the CCO’s administration of the required policies and procedures
would entail. 1222 The Commission recognizes that the CCO cannot be a guarantor of the
SBS Entity’s conduct. The Commission believes that such administration generally
should involve: (1) reviewing, evaluating, and advising the SBS Entity and its risk
management and compliance personnel on the development, implementation and
monitoring of the policies and procedures of the SBS Entity, including procedures
reasonably designed for the handling, management response, remediation, retesting and
resolution of non-compliance issues as required by Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2)(iii); and (2)
reviewing, evaluating, following and reasonably responding to the development,
implementation and monitoring of the SBS Entity’s processes for (a) modifying its
policies and procedures as business, regulatory and legislative changes dictate; (b)
evidencing supervision by the personnel responsible for the execution of its policies and
procedures; (c) testing the SBS Entity’s compliance with, and the adequacy of, its
policies and procedures; and (d) resolving, escalating and reporting issues or concerns.
In carrying out this administration, the Commission believes that the CCO generally

1222

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5 (requesting the addition of rule text
explaining that “such administration shall involve advising on the development
of, and reviewing, the registrant’s processes for (i) modifying those policies and
procedures as business, regulatory and legislative changes and events dictate, (ii)
evidencing supervision by the personnel responsible for the execution of those
policies and procedures, and (iii) testing the registrant’s compliance with those
policies and procedures”); FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5 (requesting
clarification that a CCO’s responsibility to administer a firm’s policies and
procedures is limited to coordinating supervisors’ administration of the relevant
policies and procedures).

should consult, as appropriate, with business lines, management and independent review
groups regarding resolution of compliance issues.
c.

Annual Compliance Report

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Fk-1(c)
(annual compliance report) with a number of modifications, as discussed below. In
response to concerns raised by a commenter, 1223 these changes are primarily intended to
harmonize the annual compliance report requirements with the CFTC’s parallel
requirements. As discussed above, this consistency will result in efficiencies for SBS
Entities that have already established infrastructure to comply with the CFTC
requirements. Consistent wording regarding expectations for the annual compliance
report will also allow such SBS Entities to more easily analyze compliance with the
Commission’s rule against their existing activities to comply with the CFTC’s parallel
rule for Swap Entities.
First, the Commission is making a clarifying change to Rule 15Fk-1(c)(1) to
consistently refer to the annual report required by Rule 15Fk-1(c) as the “compliance
report.” This wording change will not alter the substantive requirements of the rule. It is
only meant to clarify that the rule refers to a single annual compliance report. Second,
the Commission is eliminating the proposed requirement to include a description of “the
compliance” of the SBS Entity in the annual compliance report in response to concerns
raised by commenters, 1224 and specifying that the requirement to include a description of
the compliance policies and procedures only requires a description of the “written”
1223

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5.

1224

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5; FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

406

compliance policies and procedures of the SBS Entity pursuant to Rule 15Fk-1(c)(1), in
response to a specific suggestion from a commenter. 1225 The Commission agrees with
commenters that the proposed requirement to describe “the compliance” of the SBS
Entity was vague and believes these clarifying changes will facilitate SBS Entities’
compliance with the rule, which will still require an SBS Entity to provide information
demonstrating how the SBS Entity complies with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder in the form of the SBS Entity’s
written compliances policies and procedures. As adopted, Rule 15Fk-1(c)(1) requires the
CCO to “annually prepare and sign a compliance report that contains a description of the
written policies and procedures of the [SBS Entity] described in paragraph (b) (including
the code of ethics and conflict of interest policies).” The Commission believes that SBS
Entities can fulfill this requirement by either providing copies or summaries of their
written compliance policies and procedures in the annual compliance report. These
changes will also harmonize the annual compliance report requirements with the CFTC’s
parallel requirements, as discussed above.
The Commission is also making certain modifications to the required content of
the annual compliance report in Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2) in response to specific suggestions
from a commenter. 1226 First, the Commission is specifying that the requirement to
describe material changes to policies and procedures since the date of the preceding
1225

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5. Cf. Commodity Exchange Act Rule
3.3(e)(1) (“The annual report shall, at a minimum…[c]ontain a description of the
written policies and procedures, including the code of ethics and conflicts of
interest policies, of the futures commission merchant, swap dealer, or major swap
participant.”).

1226

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5.

407

compliance report in Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(i)(B) refers to the “registrant’s” policies and
procedures. This is a clarification and does not change the substance of the requirement.
The phrase “since the date of the preceding compliance report” in the rule refers to the
coverage date of the prior year’s compliance report, not the date on which it was
prepared. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(i)(B), as adopted, an SBS Entity
must describe in its annual compliance report any material changes to the SBS Entity’s
policies and procedures for the time period covered by the report.
Second, the Commission is making a number of changes to harmonize the content
requirements for the annual compliance report with the CFTC’s parallel requirements for
the annual compliance reports of Swap Entities. The Commission agrees with the
commenter that alignment of the content requirements will allow SBS Entities that are
also registered as Swap Entities to leverage the procedures they have adopted to comply
with the CFTC’s parallel CCO rule. 1227 Specifically, the Commission is changing the
proposed requirement in Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(i)(A) that the annual compliance report
contain a description of the “enforcement” of the SBS Entity’s policies and procedures to
an “assessment of the effectiveness” of such policies and procedures. 1228 The
Commission believes that an “assessment of the effectiveness” of the SBS Entity’s
policies and procedures is a more appropriate description because the Commission is
looking for a self-evaluation in the annual compliance report, not a detailed description of
the mechanisms through which the SBS Entity’s policies and procedures are enforced.
1227

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5.

1228

Cf. Commodity Exchange Act Rule 3.3(e)(2)(ii) (“The annual report shall, at a
minimum…[r]eview each applicable requirement under the Act and Commission
regulations, and with respect to each…[p]rovide an assessment as to the
effectiveness of these policies and procedures.”).

408

Additionally, the Commission believes that providing consistency with the parallel CFTC
requirement will allow SBS Entities to leverage any existing procedures, as discussed
above.
The Commission is also changing the proposed requirement in Rule 15Fk1(c)(2)(i)(C) that the annual compliance report contain a description of “any
recommendation for material changes to the policies and procedures” to a requirement to
describe “areas for improvement, and recommended potential or prospective changes or
improvements to its compliance program and resources devoted to compliance.” 1229 As
discussed above, this change is in response to a specific suggestion from a
commenter. 1230 A description of “areas for improvement, and recommended potential or
prospective changes or improvements to [an SBS Entity’s] compliance program and
resources devoted to compliance” is broader and would include any recommendations
made by the CCO with respect to material changes to the SBS Entity’s compliance
policies and procedures. Accordingly, the Commission does not believe this wording
change diminishes the scope of the required content of the annual compliance report. At
the same time, however, this wording change makes the rule consistent with the parallel
CFTC requirements and thus will allow SBS Entities to leverage any existing procedures,
as discussed above.

1229

Cf. Commodity Exchange Act Rule 3.3(e)(2)(iii) (“The annual report shall, at a
minimum…[r]eview each applicable requirement under the Act and Commission
regulations, and with respect to each…[d]iscuss areas for improvement, and
recommend potential or prospective changes or improvements to its compliance
program and resources devoted to compliance.”).

1230

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5.

409

Additionally, the Commission is changing the proposed requirement that the
annual compliance report contain a description of “any material compliance matters
identified since the date of the preceding compliance report” to a requirement to describe
“any material non-compliance matters identified” in Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(i)(D). 1231 The
change from “material compliance matter” to “material non-compliance matter” is in
response to a specific suggestion from a commenter. 1232 It is not a substantive change
and is simply intended to provide consistency with the parallel CFTC requirement to
allow SBS Entities to leverage any existing procedures, as discussed above. The
Commission is also otherwise adopting the definition of material non-compliance matter
in Rule 15Fk-1(e)(4), as proposed. 1233 The elimination of the phrase “since the date of
the preceding compliance report” in the final rule is also intended to harmonize with the
parallel CFTC requirement and respond to commenters’ general concerns regarding
consistency with parallel CFTC requirements. 1234 Additionally, with this change, the
Commission intends to clarify that the annual compliance report should describe both
material non-compliance matters that are newly identified during the time period covered

1231

Cf. Commodity Exchange Act Rule 3.3(e)(5) (“The annual report shall, at a
minimum…[d]escribe any material non-compliance issues identified, and the
corresponding action taken.”).

1232

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5.

1233

The Commission declines to eliminate the definition of material non-compliance
matter to be consistent with the CFTC’s parallel requirement (which does not
contain a definition), as suggested by a commenter. See SIFMA (September
2015), supra note 5. The Commission believes it is important to provide an
explanation in the rule of what should be included in the annual compliance
report.

See, e.g., Barnard, supra note 5; Levin, supra note 5; BlackRock, supra note 5;
Nomura, supra note 5.

by the report and previously identified material non-compliance matters that have not yet
been resolved as of the end of the time period covered by the report.
Finally, the Commission is adding a requirement in Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(i)(E) for an
SBS Entity to include a description in its annual compliance report of the “financial,
managerial, operational, and staffing resources set aside for compliance with the
[Exchange Act] and the rules and regulations thereunder relating to [the SBS Entity’s]
business as [an SBS Entity], including any material deficiencies in such resources.” 1235
The Commission is adding this requirement to harmonize with the CFTC’s parallel
content requirement for the annual compliance reports of Swap Entities, and to respond to
commenters’ general concerns regarding consistency with parallel CFTC
requirements. 1236 The Commission believes that a description of an SBS Entity’s
compliance resources and any deficiencies in such resources will be useful in assessing
the compliance of the SBS Entity.
The Commission is also making a number of changes with respect to the
submission of the annual compliance report. First, the Commission is aligning the
deadline for submitting the report with the CFTC’s deadline of 90 days after the end of
the Swap Entity’s fiscal year in response to concerns raised by a commenter. 1237 As
1235

Cf. Commodity Exchange Act Rule 3.3(e)(4) (“The annual report shall, at a
minimum…[d]escribe the financial, managerial, operational, and staffing
resources set aside for compliance with respect to the [Commodity Exchange Act]
and [CFTC] regulations, including any material deficiencies in such resources.”).

Relating to Annual Reports by Chief Compliance Officers, CFTC Letter No. 15-

411

adopted, Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(ii)(A) will require an SBS Entity’s compliance report to “be
submitted to the Commission within 30 days following the deadline for filing the [SBS
Entity’s] annual financial report with the Commission pursuant to Section 15F of the Act
and rules and regulations thereunder.” 1238 This represents a change from the proposed
requirement that the compliance report “[a]ccompany each appropriate financial report of
the [SBS Entity] that is required to be furnished to or filed with the Commission pursuant
to Section 15F of the Act and rules and regulations thereunder.” In response to concerns
raised by a commenter, this change will provide SBS Entities with additional time to
prepare their annual compliance reports after they have filed their annual financials. 1239
The Commission proposed a 60 day deadline from the end of the SBS Entity’s fiscal year
for the filing of an SBS Entity’s annual financials, so to the extent the Commission
adopts its proposed deadline for the annual financials, this change should also result in
consistency with the CFTC’s 90 day deadline for furnishing the annual compliance
report. 1240
Second, in connection with the change described above, the Commission is
eliminating the proposed provision that “[i]f compliance reports are separately bound
from the financial statements, the compliance reports shall be accorded confidential
15 (Mar. 27, 2015), available at
http://www.cftc.gov/idc/groups/public/@lrlettergeneral/documents/letter/1515.pdf.
1238

Section 15F(k)(3)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act provides that a compliance report
shall “accompany each appropriate financial report of the [SBS Entity] that is
required to be furnished to the Commission pursuant to this section.” 15 U.S.C.
78o-10(k)(3)(B)(i). The Commission is interpreting “accompany” in Section
15F(k)(3)(B)(i) to mean follow within 30 days.

412

treatment to the extent permitted by law.” The Commission believes this provision is no
longer necessary in light of the changes we are making to Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(ii)(A),
discussed above, which will no longer require the compliance report to accompany the
SBS Entity’s financial report. SBS Entities may request confidential treatment for their
annual compliance reports pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 24b-2. 1241
Third, in response to comment, 1242 the Commission is adding a new Rule 15Fk1(c)(2)(iii) allowing an SBS Entity to request from the Commission an extension of the
deadline for submitting its annual compliance report to the Commission. The
Commission agrees with the commenter that it is appropriate to establish a framework for
when an SBS Entity is unable to meet the deadline. Pursuant to Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(iii),
an SBS Entity may request an extension, provided that the SBS Entity’s failure to timely
submit the report could not be eliminated without unreasonable effort or expense.
Extensions of the deadline will be granted at the discretion of the Commission. Rule
15Fk-1(c)(2)(iii) will also be consistent with CFTC rules regarding extensions of
deadlines for compliance reports by Swap Entities. 1243
Fourth, the Commission is changing the required timing of submission of the
compliance report to the board of directors, audit committee and senior officer of the SBS

1241

See 17 CFR 240.24b-2. The change to the rule renders moot a commenter’s
request that the Commission amend its FOIA regulations in a manner consistent
with proposed Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(iii). See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

Entity. The timing requirement in proposed Rule 15Fk-1(c)(3)(ii)(B) (“at the earlier of
their next scheduled meeting or within 45 days of the date of execution of the required
certification”) was based on the timeframe provided in the FINRA rule regarding annual
certification of compliance and supervisory processes. 1244 The FINRA rule allows for
submission of the compliance report to the board of directors either before or after
execution of the required certification. 1245 The Commission understands, however, that
prudent corporate governance generally would require submission to the board of
directors and senior officer before the execution of the certification. Accordingly, as
adopted, Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(ii)(B) requires that the compliance report be submitted to the
board of directors, audit committee and senior officer of the SBS Entity “prior to
submission to the Commission.” This timing requirement will be consistent with both
Commission rules regarding compliance reports by SDRs and CFTC rules regarding
compliance reports by Swap Entities. 1246 This consistency with CFTC requirements will
allow SBS Entities to leverage any existing procedures, as discussed above.
The Commission declines to modify this provision, as suggested by a commenter,
to allow for submission of the compliance report to either the board or the senior
officer. 1247 The Commission believes that requiring submission to the board, audit
committee and senior officer will promote an effective compliance system by ensuring
that all of these groups, not just the senior officer, have the opportunity to review the

report. The Commission believes it is important for the board, the audit committee and
the senior officer to all have the opportunity to receive the compliance report so that they
remain informed regarding the SBS Entity’s compliance system in the context of their
overall responsibility for governance and internal controls of the SBS Entity. However,
the Commission declines to explicitly require the board to review and comment on the
compliance report, require the audit committee to review the compliance report, or
require the CCO to meet quarterly with the audit committee, as suggested by other
commenters. 1248 The Commission does not think it is necessary to explicitly require the
board, audit committee or senior officer to review or comment on the compliance report
that they receive, or to require the CCO to meet with the audit committee because we
believe the goals of the rule can be achieved without such a requirement.
Additionally, in response to concerns raised by a commenter 1249 and to harmonize
with the parallel CFTC requirement and FINRA Rule 3130, the Commission is
eliminating: (1) the proposed requirement that the report contain a written representation
regarding the required annual meeting between the senior officer and the CCO, and (2)
the proposed specifications for what topics such meeting must cover. The Commission
agrees with the commenter that since the purpose of the required annual meeting between
the senior officer and CCO is to discuss the annual compliance report and since the
contents of the annual compliance report are already specified in Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(i), it
is unnecessary to also specify the topics that should be discussed in the annual meeting.

1249

See SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5.

415

Additionally, this consistency with CFTC and FINRA requirements will allow SBS
Entities to leverage any existing procedures, as discussed above.
To address concerns raised by commenters, 1250 we also are modifying Rule15Fk1(c)(2)(ii)(D) to provide that either the senior officer or CCO can execute the compliance
report certification and to add knowledge and materiality qualifiers to the certification
requirement. The proposed rule would have required the compliance report to include a
certification that, under penalty of law, the compliance report is accurate and complete,
without specifying who must execute the certification. As adopted, Rule 15Fk1(c)(2)(ii)(D) requires the compliance report to include a certification “from the senior
officer or Chief Compliance Officer that, to the best of his or her knowledge and
reasonable belief, under penalty of law, the compliance report is accurate and complete in
all material respects.” The Commission believes that allowing either the senior officer or
CCO to execute the certification is appropriate because both the senior officer and the
CCO should be in a position to certify the accuracy and completeness of the compliance
report. As noted by a commenter, 1251 Exchange Act Section 15F(k)(3)(B)(ii) requires
that the compliance report include a certification but does not specify who must execute
the certification. 1252 The FINRA rule regarding annual certification of compliance and

1250

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5 (requesting that the CEO or other relevant
senior officer be the individual responsible for executing the certification, or in
the alternative, if the CCO is required to certify, that the CEO also be required to
do so); CFA, supra note 5 (requesting that the CCO be the individual responsible
for executing the certification); SIFMA (September 2015), supra note 5
(requesting that either the senior officer or CCO be permitted to execute the
certification).

supervisory processes requires the CEO (or an equivalent officer) to execute the
certification. 1253 In contrast, Commission rules regarding compliance reports by SDRs
require the CCO to execute the certification. 1254 CFTC rules regarding compliance
reports by Swap Entities allow either the CEO or the CCO to execute the required
certification. 1255 Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(ii)(D) will be consistent with the parallel CFTC rule
and will allow flexibility for SBS Entities who might also be registered broker-dealers
and FINRA members, and therefore, subject to the FINRA rule regarding annual
certification of compliance and supervisory processes. As discussed above, consistency
with CFTC requirements will allow SBS Entities to leverage any existing procedures.
Additionally, the Commission believes it is appropriate to add the knowledge and
materiality qualifiers described above to the required certification to address commenters’
concerns regarding the liability standard for the certification. 1256 The Commission
believes that a certification to the best of the knowledge and reasonable belief of the
certifying officer that the compliance report is accurate and complete in all material
respects is appropriate to ensure effective reporting with respect to the compliance of the
SBS Entity. 1257

filing is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith
argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law”).

417

In response to a specific suggestion from a commenter, 1258 the Commission is
also adding a new Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(iv) allowing an SBS Entity to incorporate by
reference sections of a compliance report that have been submitted within the current or
immediately preceding reporting period to the Commission. The rule allows an SBS
Entity to: (1) incorporate by reference items from a previous year’s compliance report, or
(2) for an SBS Entity that is registered in more than one capacity with the Commission
and required to submit more than one compliance report, 1259 incorporate by reference into
its compliance report required by Rule 15Fk-1(c) sections in another compliance report
submitted to the Commission by it in its capacity as another type of registered entity
within the current or immediately preceding reporting period. 1260 The Commission is
limiting incorporation by reference to reports submitted within the current or immediately
preceding reporting period, which will be the fiscal year of the SBS Entity, because we
want to ensure that compliance reports do not simply continue to refer back to prior
year’s reports. Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(iv) will also be consistent with CFTC rules regarding
compliance reports by Swap Entities. 1261

1260

The Commission declines to permit the consolidation of annual compliance
reporting requirements for SBS Entities under common control, as suggested by
one commenter. See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5. The Commission believes
it is appropriate to require an SBS Entity to submit a separate compliance report,
as contemplated by Section 15F(k)(3)(B) of the Exchange Act. However, as
discussed above, the Commission has made a number of changes to Rule 15Fk-1
to further harmonize the requirements of the rule with FINRA Rule 3130 and the
CFTC’s CCO requirements for Swap Entities so that SBS Entities that are also
registered broker-dealers that are FINRA members and/or Swap Entities can
leverage their existing procedures to comply with the rule.

1261

See CFTC CCO Adopting Release, 77 FR at 20201, supra note 1243.

418

Finally, in response to a specific suggestion from a commenter, 1262 the
Commission is adding a new Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(v) requiring an SBS Entity to submit an
amended compliance report if material errors or omissions in the report are identified.
The amended report must contain the required certification by the CCO or senior officer,
described above. The Commission is adding this rule to promote accurate and complete
compliance reports. When an SBS Entity discovers a material error or omission in its
annual compliance report subsequent to submitting the report to the Commission, we
believe it is appropriate for an SBS Entity to be required to submit an amended report.
This does not include a situation where an SBS Entity’s annual compliance report
becomes inaccurate or incomplete due to events occurring after the coverage date of the
report. Material errors or omissions should be judged as of the coverage date of the
report. Rule 15Fk-1(c)(2)(v) will also be consistent with CFTC rules regarding amended
compliance reports by Swap Entities. 1263

Prime Brokerage Transactions

One commenter recommended that the Commission adopt a new rule that would,
in connection with security-based swaps executed under a prime brokerage arrangement,
permit the executing dealer and prime broker to allocate responsibility for compliance
with certain external business conduct obligations in a manner consistent with CFTC NoAction Letter 13-11. 1264 The commenter noted that the Commission staff has previously
addressed circumstances in which the executing broker and prime broker in a securities

419

prime brokerage arrangement allocate certain responsibilities between themselves in
different contexts. 1265
The commenter described a particular situation in which a counterparty (“Prime
Broker Client”) enters into an agreement with a registered SBS Dealer (“Prime Broker”).
That agreement establishes parameters under which the Prime Broker Client, acting as
agent of the Prime Broker, can negotiate and enter into security-based swaps with certain
registered SBS Dealers (collectively, the “Executing Dealer”). If a security-based swap
negotiated by the Prime Broker Client with the Executing Dealer is accepted by the Prime
Broker, the Prime Broker will enter into a corresponding security-based swap with the
Prime Broker Client, the terms of which mirror the terms of the security-based swap
between the Executing Dealer and the Prime Broker, subject to associated prime
brokerage fees agreed by the parties.
In these circumstances, the Prime Broker Client may have entered into a securitybased swap with the Prime Broker based not only on communications with the Prime
Broker but also on communications including disclosure of material terms and other
representations, and possibly on the basis of a recommendation by the Executing Dealer.
According to this commenter, in these circumstances, the Prime Broker is in the best
position to take responsibility for compliance with the external business conduct
standards that relate to the general relationship between the Prime Broker and the Prime
Broker Client, whereas the Executing Dealer is in the best position to take responsibility
for compliance with business conduct standards that are transaction-specific. The
1265

See Letter to Mr. Jeffrey C. Bernstein, Prime Broker Committee, from Brandon
Becker, Director, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated January 25,
1994.

420

commenter expressed the view that unless SBS Dealers are permitted to allocate
compliance with the external business conduct standards between the Prime Broker and
the Executing Dealer, it would be impossible to continue existing prime brokerage
arrangements. 1266
The commenter proposed a rule under which the Prime Broker and the Executing
Dealer would have the full range of business conduct obligations that they would allocate
between themselves. The commenter’s request is beyond the scope of this rulemaking
although we acknowledge the concerns raised by the commenter, and may consider them
in the future.

Other Comments

The CFTC proposed rules regarding best execution and front running that it did
not ultimately adopt. One commenter urged the Commission to adopt a best execution
requirement similar to the CFTC’s proposal. 1267 Another commenter urged the
Commission not to adopt a prohibition on front running. 1268 Although the Commission is
not adopting such rules, we note that SBS Entities remain subject to the antifraud
provisions of the federal securities laws, including the antifraud provisions of Exchange
Act Section 15H(h)(4)(A) and Rule 15Fh-4(a), as discussed in Section II.H.4, with
respect to their dealings with counterparties.

1266

We recognize that there may be other ways that parties structure their prime
brokerage arrangements. The above discussion is based on the description of the
arrangement in the proposed rule text provided by the commenter.

The Commission did not propose rules regarding portfolio reconciliation and
compression. Four commenters generally supported portfolio reconciliation and
compression requirements. 1269 A fifth commenter asserted that inter-affiliate swaps
should not trigger portfolio reconciliation and compression requirements. 1270 The
Commission is not adopting rules regarding portfolio reconciliation and compression at
this time.

Cross-Border Application of Business Conduct Requirements
1.

Proposed Rule

The Commission proposed generally to apply all requirements in Section 15F of
the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, to all SBS Entities, whether
U.S. persons or non-U.S. persons. 1271 The Commission also proposed to classify each
requirement that applies to SBS Entities either as a transaction-level requirement, which
applies to specific transactions, or as an entity-level requirement, which applies to the
dealing entity as a whole. 1272 In this taxonomy, entity-level requirements would include
most requirements applicable to SBS Entities, including those relating to the CCO
requirements under Section 15F(k) of the Exchange Act, the supervision requirement
under Section 15F(h)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act, and the requirement to establish

regulatory system governing such registered entities.” Id. at 30986.

procedures to comply with the duties set forth in Section 15F(j) of the Exchange Act,
including conflict of interest systems and procedures. 1273 Transaction-level requirements
would include primarily business conduct standards under Section 15F(h) of the
Exchange Act (except for the diligent supervision requirement under Section
15F(h)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act). 1274
Under the proposed approach, the entity-level requirements would apply to all
transactions of an SBS Entity, regardless of the U.S.-person status of the SBS Entity or its
counterparty to any particular transaction. 1275 With respect to the business conduct
standards under Section 15F(h) of the Exchange Act (except for the diligent supervision
requirement under Section 15F(h)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act), however, the Commission
proposed to provide an exception from these requirements for certain transactions of SBS
Entities, proposing slightly different approaches for SBS Dealers and Major SBS
Participants.
With respect to SBS Dealers, the Commission proposed a rule that would have
provided that registered foreign SBS Dealers and registered U.S. SBS Dealers, with
respect to their foreign business, would not be subject to the requirements relating to
business conduct standards described in Section 15F(h) of the Exchange Act, 1276 and the
rules and regulations thereunder, other than the rules and regulations prescribed by the

Commission pursuant to Section 15F(h)(1)(B). 1277 The proposed rule would define
“foreign business” for both foreign SBS Dealers and U.S. SBS Dealers to mean any
security-based swap transactions entered into, or offered to be entered into, by or on
behalf of the SBS Dealer that do not include its U.S. business. 1278 The proposed
definition of “U.S. business,” however, would differ for foreign SBS Dealers and U.S.
SBS Dealers. For a foreign SBS Dealer, “U.S. business” would mean (i) any transaction
entered into, or offered to be entered into, by or on behalf of such foreign SBS Dealer,
with a U.S. person (other than with a foreign branch), or (ii) any transaction conducted
within the United States. 1279 For a U.S. SBS Dealer, “U.S. business” would mean any
transaction by or on behalf of such U.S. SBS Dealer, wherever entered into or offered to
be entered into, other than a transaction conducted through a foreign branch with a nonU.S. person or another foreign branch of a U.S. person. 1280
In April 2015, the Commission re-proposed the rule defining the application of
business conduct rules to SBS Dealers to incorporate the modified approach to U.S.
activity proposed in that release and to make certain technical changes to the “foreign

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31016, supra note 6. Section

the same factors used in that proposal to determine whether a foreign SBS Dealer
is engaging in dealing activity within the United States or with U.S. persons and
whether a U.S. person was conducting a transaction through a foreign branch.

business” definition relating to transactions conducted through a foreign branch. 1281
Under the modified approach, “U.S. business” of a foreign SBS Dealer would have been
defined to mean (i) any transaction entered into, or offered to be entered into, by or on
behalf of such foreign SBS Dealer, with a U.S. person (other than a transaction conducted
through a foreign branch of that person), or (ii) any security-based swap transaction that
is arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel of the foreign SBS Dealer located in a
U.S. branch or office, or by personnel of its agent located in a U.S. branch or office. 1282
With respect to a U.S. SBS Dealer, “U.S. business” would have been defined to mean
“any transaction by or on behalf of such U.S. SBS Dealer, entered into or offered to be
entered into, other than a transaction conducted through a foreign branch with a non-U.S.
person or with a U.S.-person counterparty that constitutes a transaction conducted
through a foreign branch of the counterparty.” 1283 The definitions of “U.S. securitybased swap dealer,” 1284 “foreign security-based swap dealer,” 1285 and “foreign

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(8)(i). The Commission explained in the U.S. Activity
Proposing Release that it intended the proposed rule to indicate the same type of
activity by personnel located in the United States as it proposed to use in the de
minimis context. Moreover, for purposes of proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(8)(i)(B),
the Commission explained that it would interpret the term “personnel” in a
manner consistent with the definition of “associated person of a security-based
swap dealer” contained in section 3(a)(70) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(70), regardless of whether such non-U.S. person or such non-U.S. person’s

Rule 3a71-3(c), which would create the exception to the business conduct requirements
for the foreign business of registered security-based swap dealers.
With respect to Major SBS Participants, the Commission proposed to provide an
exception from the business conduct standards as described in Section 15F(h) of the
Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder (other than the rules and
regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to Section 15F(h)(1)(B)), only for
foreign Major SBS Participants, with respect to their transactions with non-U.S.
persons. 1287

Comments on the Proposed Application of Business Conduct
Requirements to SBS Entities

In response to the U.S. Activity Proposing Release, commenters focused on the
proposal to impose business conduct standards on a transaction of a registered foreign
SBS Dealer with other non-U.S. persons when the SBS Dealer uses personnel located in
the United States to arrange, negotiate, or execute the transaction. Several commenters
expressed general support for the Commission’s proposed test to determine when various
Title VII requirements should apply to transactions between two non-U.S. persons based
on U.S. activity. 1288 Moreover, although these commenters generally urged that the

See proposed Rule 3a67-10(b) (providing that a Major SBS Participant “shall not
be subject, with respect to its security-based swap transactions with counterparties

thereunder, other than rules and regulations prescribed pursuant to Section
15F(h)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act); proposed Rule 3a67-10(a)(1) (defining
“foreign major security-based swap participant”).

Commission not impose business conduct requirements (or impose only certain of the
requirements, as described below) on a registered foreign SBS Dealer solely based on
U.S. activity, they indicated that they support the tailoring of the Commission’s test
(“U.S. Activity Test”) from the initial proposal, if the Commission ultimately determines
that the business conduct requirements should apply to such transactions. 1289 One
commenter urged the Commission to return to its initially proposed approach to the
definition of “transactions conducted within the United States,” which would have looked
to the location of relevant activity of both counterparties. 1290 Such an approach would
thus apply the business conduct requirements fully to any transactions involving activity
in the United States, not just dealing activity in the United States but also relevant activity
carried out by a non-dealing counterparty in the United States. 1291
Some commenters that objected to the Commission’s proposed approach argued
that none of the business conduct requirements should apply to transactions between nonU.S. persons, even if these transactions involve U.S. activity and therefore constitute
“U.S. business” under the proposed definition. 1292 These commenters explained that the

1289

See IIB (July 2015), supra note 10, at 2; SIFMA/FSR (July 2015), supra note 10,
at 3, 10. One commenter supported the proposal’s use of the same U.S. Activity
Test for business conduct as for de minimis calculations because applying the
business conduct standards solely based on the use of a U.S. fund manager is not
dealing activity, would be inconsistent with investor expectations, and is
unnecessary to protect the U.S. markets. See ICI Global (July 2015), supra note
10, at 2, 5.

2015), supra note 10, at 2 (urging that the Commission not apply the business

non-U.S. counterparties of foreign SBS Dealers do not expect these protections; the
dealer is likely to be subject to similar requirements in its home jurisdiction; and
application is unlikely to protect the U.S. market and is inconsistent with international
comity. 1293 In a related comment, one commenter explained that the business conduct
requirements, as well as other requirements related to reporting and dealer registration,
should not apply to transactions that are executed on an anonymous electronic platform
or other means that “involve[s] no human contact within the United States,” because the
parties would have no expectation that the rules would apply to such a transaction. 1294
Some commenters taking this view also explained that U.S. asset managers may
face challenges in servicing non-U.S. client accounts under the proposed approach,
noting that non-U.S. clients may be reluctant to deal with Dodd-Frank-related
documentation or to make required representations and describing the significant burdens

these requirements would impose on asset managers. 1295 One of these commenters
argued that the U.S. Activity Proposing Release considered only the costs of the SBS
Dealers that would be directly subject to the business conduct requirements but not the
costs borne by buy-side market participants, such as asset managers. 1296
Some commenters that objected to the Commission’s proposed application of
business conduct requirements to transactions between two non-U.S. persons solely on
the basis of activity in the United States urged the Commission to limit the application to
specific requirements that, in the commenters’ views, address regulatory concerns
directly related to the relevant activity in the United States. These commenters supported
dividing the business conduct requirements into two separate categories of “relationshipbased” requirements and “transaction-specific” or “communication-based”

1295

Specifically, the commenters expressed concern that, under the proposal, the U.S.
asset manager executing a trade on behalf of a non-U.S. client would need to
know whether the transaction involved U.S. activity and would also need to verify
that the non-U.S. client satisfies the business conduct requirements. See SIFMAAMG (July 2015), supra note 10, at 4; ICI Global (July 2015), supra note 10, at 6
(explaining that regulated fund parties would need appropriate documentation and
representations in place to execute such trades and would face interruptions in
investment activities in doing so).

1296

See SIFMA-AMG (July 2015), supra note 10, at 4-5. This commenter
specifically argued that the proposed rules would effectively require asset
managers to verify the eligibility of a non-U.S. client as having satisfied the
Commission’s business conduct requirements, imposing costs on asset managers
and, through impeding block trades on behalf of U.S. persons and non-U.S.
persons, negatively affecting liquidity and execution price. See SIFMA-AMG
(July 2015), supra note 10, at 4. The commenter also argued that the proposed
approach has “no ascertainable benefit” to non-U.S. counterparties who would not
expect the protections and would instead look to the law of the dealer’s
jurisdiction or its own jurisdiction. See SIFMA-AMG (July 2015), supra note 10,
at 5.

429

requirements. 1297 Commenters argued that relationship-based requirements—which they
identified as requirements related to counterparty status, disclosure of daily marks, know
your counterparty, and counterparty suitability—should not apply to transactions between
two non-U.S. persons solely on the basis of U.S. activity for reasons similar to those
described above. 1298
On the other hand, commenters explained that application of business conduct
requirements that are “communication-based” or transaction-specific—which they
identified as including disclosure of material risks and characteristics and material
incentives or conflicts of interest and related recordkeeping, disclosures regarding
clearing rights and related recordkeeping, product suitability, and fair and balanced
communications and supervision—to such transactions would be simpler and less costly
1297

See SIFMA/FSR (July 2015), supra note 10, at 8-10; IIB (July 2015), supra note
10, at 11-13.

1298

For example, one commenter argued that non-U.S. counterparties would not
expect such protections and that the requirements may duplicate requirements in
the counterparty’s home jurisdiction. See SIFMA/FSR (July 2015), supra note
10, at 8-9. Commenters also argued that the non-U.S. counterparty would not
expect to provide any representations as to its status or to complete questionnaires
to comply with U.S. relationship-level requirements, particularly at the beginning
of a trading relationship when neither counterparty may expect the relationship to
involve U.S. activity and that such burdens have no benefit. See SIFMA/FSR
(July 2015), supra note 10, at 8-9; IIB (July 2015), supra note 10, at 11-12
(arguing that non-U.S. counterparties would not expect the “trade-relationship”
requirements to apply in their trades with non-U.S. persons and would be
surprised to be required to agree to covenants or fill out questionnaires related to
U.S. requirements); SIFMA-AMG (July 2015), supra note 10, at 4 (explaining
that non-U.S. clients of asset managers would be surprised to need to verify
eligibility under the business conduct requirements after instructing asset
managers to trade only with non-U.S. dealers). See also ICI Global (July 2015),
supra note 10, at 6 (noting that, even though the registered dealer (and not the
non-U.S. person) is subject to the business conduct requirements, the non-U.S.
fund counterparty would likely need to have in place appropriate documentation
and representations if its dealer is subject to business conduct requirements, which
may cause interruptions in their investment activities).

430

to implement. 1299 These commenters, however, urged the Commission, if it does apply
the transaction-specific requirements to these transactions, to harmonize FINRA’s
existing sales practice requirements with the “communication-based” or transactionspecific rules applicable under Title VII to avoid unnecessary duplication or conflicts, as
the U.S. activity in many of these transactions may be carried out by registered brokerdealers subject to FINRA requirements. 1300 One commenter requested that if the
Commission does apply relationship-based requirements to transactions involving U.S.
activity, it make substituted compliance available to foreign registered SBS Dealers in
such transactions. 1301
Two commenters suggested that, if the Commission does apply the business
conduct requirements as proposed, it offer an “opt-out” for sophisticated non-U.S. person
counterparties that would allow them to trade under their existing documentation rather

1299

See IIB (July 2015), supra note 10, at 12-13 (noting that compliance with these
requirements would not require “wholesale modifications” to the relationship
documentation or onboarding processes as long as the non-U.S. security-based
swap dealer is able to satisfy the requirements under the rules of the relevant nonU.S. jurisdictions and that there may be benefits to applying these rules uniformly
to front office personnel in the United States as a supplement to generally
applicable antifraud and anti-manipulation rules); SIFMA/FSR (July 2015), supra
note 10, at 9-10 (explaining that the application of these rules would be consistent
with the parties’ expectations).

1300

See SIFMA/FSR (July 2015), supra note 10, at 9-10; IIB (July 2015), supra note
10, at 13. Commenters also urged the Commission to work toward a harmonized
approach to all the business conduct rules with the CFTC and FINRA to ensure
that security-based swap dealers and swap dealers are not subject to two different
sets of business conduct requirements. See ISDA (July 2015), supra note 10, at 2,
n.7; IIB (July 2015), supra note 10, at 6, 7. See also ISDA (July 2015), supra note
10, at 9 (asking the Commission to evaluate whether imposing business conduct
requirements adds value if the intermediary is already subject to broker-dealer
regime).

1301

See IIB (July 2015), supra note 10, at 12.

431

than develop new documentation pursuant to U.S. rules. 1302 One commenter explained
that, because the requirements are for the benefit of the non-U.S. counterparty, that
counterparty should be able to waive them. 1303
Two commenters argued that the Commission should not allow concern about
special entity protections to influence its consideration of whether U.S. activity alone
should trigger business conduct requirements. These commenters noted that the
Commission has previously explained that only U.S. persons would be special entities
and, as such, a registered foreign SBS Dealer would already be subject to the full range of
business conduct requirements in transactions with special entities, because such
transactions would constitute “U.S. business” under the proposed approach even if the
Commission were to eliminate U.S. Activity from the definition of “U.S. business.” 1304

Response to Comments and Final Rule

After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting final Rule 3a71-3(c)
and amendments to the definitions in Rule 3a71-3(a) largely unchanged from the April
2015 re-proposal. 1305 The Commission is also adopting amendments to Rule 3a67-10 to

1302

See IIB (July 2015), supra note 10, at 13; SIFMA/FSR (July 2015), supra note 10,
at 10-11 (requesting the non-U.S. counterparty have option to opt-out of
“transaction-specific” rules if they apply solely as a result of U.S. activity).

1303

See SIFMA/FSR (July 2015), supra note 10, at 10-11.

1304

See IIB (July 2015), supra note 10, at 12; SIFMA/FSR (July 2015), supra note 10,
at 9.

1305

The final rules incorporate minor conforming edits. The definition of U.S.
business for U.S. security-based swap dealers (Rule 3a71-3(a)(8)(ii)) is modified
for consistency with the surrounding rules by moving the phrase “entered into or
offered to be entered into” and deleting the word “wherever” to further clarify that
the definition of U.S. business for a U.S. security-based swap dealer does not
depend on the location of personnel arranging, negotiating, or executing the
transaction. Rule 3a71-3(a)(9) defining foreign business and Rule 3a71-3(c)

432

incorporate an exception from these requirements for registered Major SBS Participants,
modified slightly from the initial proposal. Consistent with the Cross-Border Proposing
Release, the Commission is not providing any exception from the entity-level
requirements being adopted in this release. 1306
a.

Entity-Level Requirements for SBS Entities

The Commission continues to believe that the rules and regulations prescribed by
the Commission relating to diligent supervision pursuant to Section 15F(h)(1)(B), those
relating to the CCO under Section 15F(k) of the Exchange Act, and those relating to
requirements under Section 15F(j) of the Exchange Act should be treated as entity-level
requirements that apply to the entire business of the registered foreign or U.S. SBS
contain minor edits to simplify the rule text primarily by eliminating unnecessary
separate references to U.S. and foreign security-based swap dealers.
1306

The Commission does not believe that these final rules apply Title VII to persons
that are “transact[ing] a business in security-based swaps without the jurisdiction
of the United States,” within the meaning of section 30(c) of the Exchange Act.
A final rule that did not treat security-based swaps that a registered foreign
security-based swap dealer has arranged, negotiated, or executed using its
personnel or personnel of its agent located in the United States as the “U.S.
business” of that dealer for purposes of proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71–3(c)
would, in our view, reflect an understanding of what it means to conduct a
security-based swap dealing business within the jurisdiction of the United States
that is divorced both from Title VII’s statutory objectives and from the various
structures that non-U.S. persons use to engage in security-based swap dealing
activity. But in any event we also believe that the final rule is necessary or
appropriate as a prophylactic measure to help prevent the evasion of the
provisions of the Exchange Act that were added by the Dodd-Frank Act, and thus
help prevent the relevant purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act from being
undermined. See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47291–92, supra note
193 (interpreting anti-evasion provisions of Exchange Act Section 30(c)). Without
this rule, non-U.S. persons could simply carry on a dealing business within the
United States with non-U.S. persons. Permitting this activity could allow these
firms to retain full access to the benefits of operating in the United States while
avoiding compliance with business conduct requirements, which could increase
the risk of misconduct. See U.S. Activity Proposing Release, 80 FR 27477 n.255,
supra note 9.

433

Entity. 1307 Accordingly, the following requirements would apply to all security-based
swap transactions of an SBS Entity, regardless of the U.S.-person status of the SBS
Entity or that of its counterparty in any particular transaction: 1308 supervision
requirements under Rule 15Fh-3(h), including the requirement in Rule 15Fh3(h)(2)(iii)(I) that SBS Entities establish procedures reasonably designed to comply with
the duties set forth in Section 15F(j) of the Exchange Act; and CCO requirements under
Rule 15Fk-1. The Commission, however, is adopting a rule that would potentially make
substituted compliance available for these requirements for registered foreign SBS
Entities as discussed below. 1309
As the Commission has previously stated, it is appropriate to subject a registered
SBS Entity to the diligent supervision requirements regardless of the status or location of
its counterparties to ensure that the SBS Entity is adequately supervising its business and
its associated persons to ensure compliance with the full range of its obligations under the
federal securities laws. 1310 Similarly, the Commission continues to believe that Rule

the duties set forth in Section 15F(j) of the Exchange Act, including conflict of interest
systems and procedures, should apply to all of an SBS Entity’s security-based swap

these requirements, among others, as entity-level). But see ISDA (July 2015),

interest in imposing entity-level requirements in connection with security-based

transactions, as such systems and procedures cannot be effective unless so applied. 1311
As we have previously noted, to prevent conflicts of interest from biasing the judgment
or supervision of these entities, application to only a portion of an SBS Entity’s securitybased swap transactions would not be effective at addressing conflicts that may arise as a
result of transactions that arise out of an SBS Entity’s foreign business. 1312 Each of the
remaining duties under section 15F(j) 1313 would not be effective if not applied at the
entity level. 1314
The CCO requirements under Rule 15Fk-1 also raise entity-wide concerns.
CCO’s responsibilities include establishing, maintaining, and reviewing policies and
procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance with applicable Exchange Act

1313

Section 15F(j) of the Exchange Act requires an SBS Entity to comply “at all
times” with obligations concerning: (1) monitoring of trading to prevent
violations of applicable position limits; (2) establishing sound and professional
risk management systems; (3) disclosing to regulators information concerning its
trading in security-based swaps; (4) establishing and enforcing internal systems
and procedures to obtain any necessary information to perform any of the
functions described in Section 15F of the Exchange Act, and providing the
information to regulators, on request; (5) implementing conflict-of-interest
systems and procedures; and (6) addressing antitrust considerations such that the
SBS Entity does not adopt any process or take any action that results in any
unreasonable restraint of trade or impose any material anticompetitive burden on
trading or clearing. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(j).

1314

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31014, supra note 6 (explaining that
the purpose of the diligent supervision requirements is to prevent violations of
applicable federal securities laws, and the rules and regulations thereunder,
relating to an entity’s entire business as a security-based swap dealer, which is not
limited to either its foreign business or its U.S. business, but rather is comprised
of its entire global security-based swap dealing activity, and as such, to be
effective, the requirements should apply at the entity level).

requirements. 1315 Because such responsibilities apply to the entity as a whole and many
of the requirements that the CCO oversees are entity-level requirements, the Commission
believes that it is necessary to treat the CCO requirement as an entity-level requirement
applicable to all of an SBS Entity’s security-based swap business. 1316

Transaction-Level Requirements for SBS Dealers

As noted above, the Commission is adopting final Rule 3a71-3(c) and
amendments to the definitions in Rule 3a71-3(a) largely unchanged from the proposal.
Accordingly, the final rule provides that registered SBS Dealers, with respect to their
foreign business, shall not be subject to the requirements relating to business conduct
standards described in Section 15F(h) of the Exchange Act, 1317 and the rules and
regulations thereunder, 1318 other than the rules and regulations prescribed by the
Commission pursuant to Section 15F(h)(1)(B). 1319 The final rule defines “foreign

See Section II.I, supra.

1316

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31014-15, supra note 6.

1317

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h).

1318

These rules and regulations are Rules 15Fh-1 through 15Fh-6. With the exception
of Rule 15Fh-3(h), which prescribes certain entity-level requirements pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 15F(h)(1)(B), these rules are transaction-level
requirements, which is consistent with the proposed approach. See, supra,
Section III.0.

1319

See Rule 3a71-3(c).
Section 15F(h)(1)(B) requires registered security-based swap dealers to conform
with such business conduct standards relating to diligent supervision as the
Commission shall prescribe. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(1)(B). The rules being
prescribed pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15F(h)(1)(B) are those in Rule 15F3(h), which are entity-level requirements, as discussed above. See, supra, Section
III.0. The exception as adopted applies to Section 15F(h)(1)(A) of the Exchange
Act, and any rules and regulations thereunder. However, this exception does not
affect applicability of the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities

business” for both foreign SBS Dealers and U.S. SBS Dealers to mean any security-based
swap transactions entered into, or offered to be entered into, by or on behalf of the SBS
Dealer that do not include its U.S. business. 1320
However, the final rule defines “U.S. business” differently for foreign SBS
Dealers and U.S. SBS Dealers. The final rule defines “U.S. business” of a foreign SBS
Dealer to mean (i) any transaction entered into, or offered to be entered into, by or on
behalf of such foreign SBS Dealer, with a U.S. person (other than a transaction conducted
through a foreign branch of that person), or (ii) any security-based swap transaction that
is arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel of the foreign SBS Dealer located in a
U.S. branch or office, or by personnel of its agent located in a U.S. branch or office. 1321
For a U.S. SBS Dealer, the final rule defines “U.S. business” to mean “any transaction
entered into or offered to be entered into by or on behalf of such U.S. security-based
swap dealer, other than a transaction conducted through a foreign branch with a non-U.S.
person or with a U.S.-person counterparty that constitutes a transaction conducted
through a foreign branch of the counterparty.” 1322 The Commission also is adopting,
unchanged from the proposals, the definitions of “U.S. security-based swap dealer,” 1323
and “foreign security-based swap dealer.” 1324 The Commission also is adopting the

laws to the activity of a foreign SBS Dealer. See Cross-Border Proposing
Release, 78 FR 31016 n.476, supra note 6.

definition of “foreign business,” 1325 with minor edits to simplify the rule text primarily by
eliminating unnecessary separate references to foreign SBS Dealers and U.S. SBS
Dealers. Finally, the Commission is adopting Rule 3a71-3(c), which creates the
exception from the application of the business conduct requirements to foreign business,
again, unchanged from the proposal except for minor edits eliminating separate
references to foreign SBS Dealers and U.S. SBS Dealers.
The final rule reflects the Commission’s continuing view that all registered SBS
Dealers should be required to comply with the transaction-level elements of the business
conduct standards with respect to their U.S. business. 1326 The Dodd-Frank counterparty
protection mandate focuses on the U.S. markets and participants in those markets. 1327
The business conduct standards are intended to bring professional standards of conduct
to, and increase transparency in, the security-based swap market and to require registered
SBS Dealers to treat parties to these transactions fairly. 1328 Accordingly, with respect to
both foreign and U.S. SBS Dealers, we are adopting a definition of “U.S. business” that
encompasses those transactions that appear particularly likely to affect the integrity of the
security-based swap market in the United States and the U.S. financial markets more
generally or that raise concerns about the protection of participants in those markets.

1325

See Rule 3a71-3(a)(9).

See U.S. Activity Proposing Release, 80 FR 27475, supra note 9.

1327

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31017-018, supra note 6.

1328

See id. The rules require, among other things, that registered SBS Dealers
communicate in a fair and balanced manner with potential counterparties and that
they disclose conflicts of interest and material incentives to potential
counterparties.

438

With respect to foreign SBS Dealers, the Commission continues to believe that
the final definition of “U.S. business” should generally encompass transactions with U.S.
persons and transactions that the foreign SBS Dealer arranges, negotiates, or executes
using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office. 1329 As we have previously noted, this
approach would both preserve customer protections for U.S. counterparties that would
expect to benefit from the protection afforded to them by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act
and help maintain market integrity by subjecting the large number of transactions that
involve relevant dealing activity in the United States to these requirements, even if both
counterparties are non-U.S. persons. 1330
With respect to U.S. SBS Dealers, the Commission continues to believe that the
definition of “U.S. business” should encompass all of their transactions, regardless of the
U.S.-person status of the counterparty, except for transactions that a U.S. SBS Dealer
arranges, negotiates, or executes through a foreign branch with another foreign branch or
with a non-U.S. person. As noted above, Title VII is concerned with the protection of
U.S. markets and participants in those markets, and it remains our view that imposing
these requirements on a U.S.-person dealer when it arranges, negotiates, or executes

1329

We also note that relying on the same approach to U.S. activity that is used in the
de minimis context should simplify implementation of Title VII for market
participants. See U.S. Activity Proposing Release, 80 FR 27473, supra note 9.

1330

The exception from the definition for transactions involving the foreign branch of
a U.S. person reflects our view that transactions between the foreign branch of a
U.S. person and a non-U.S. person, in which the personnel arranging, negotiating,
and executing the transaction are all located outside the United States, are less
likely to affect the integrity of the U.S. market and reflects our consideration of
the role of foreign regulators in non-U.S. markets. See Cross-Border Proposing
Release, 78 FR 31017, supra note 6.

439

through its foreign branch with another foreign branch or a non-U.S. person would
produce little or no benefit to U.S. market participants. 1331
One commenter urged the Commission to return to its initially proposed approach
to the definition of “transactions conducted within the United States,” which would have
looked to the location of relevant activity of both counterparties. 1332 Such an approach
would thus apply the business conduct requirements fully to any transactions involving
activity in the United States, not just dealing activity in the United States but also relevant
activity carried out by a non-dealing counterparty in the United States. Given the
structure of the security-based swap market and the concentration of security-based swap
dealing among a small group of firms, the Commission believes the final rules are
appropriately tailored to apply the business conduct requirements to dealing activity,
including dealing activity in the United States, that is likely to raise market integrity and
transparency concerns. 1333 Further, as the Commission discussed in the U.S. Activity
Adopting Release, the final rules adopted in that release should mitigate some
commenters’ concerns regarding the costs associated with the initially proposed
application of the de minimis exception to “transactions conducted within the United
States.” 1334 The initially proposed approach supported by the commenter would have
required a dealer engaged in dealing activity to consider both the location of its personnel
and the personnel of its counterparty in determining whether to include transactions in its

de minimis calculation thresholds. 1335 The final rules in the U.S. Activity Adopting
Release and the final rule being adopted here focus on the location of relevant personnel
of only the dealer (or its agent), which should impose lower costs on market participants
than the initially proposed approach, while applying the business conduct requirements to
dealing activity in the United States that is likely to raise the types of concerns addressed
by the business conduct requirements. 1336 Moreover, given the Commission’s action in
the U.S. Activity Adopting Release, taking a different approach in the definition of “U.S.
business” would mean using a different test to identify relevant U.S. activity from the test
used in the de minimis context. The Commission believes that this would present
unnecessary implementation and compliance challenges. 1337
Some commenters have argued that the business conduct standards should not
apply to any transactions between two non-U.S. persons because the foreign
counterparties may not expect to receive such protections, or to any such transactions
where expectations of receiving such protections are likely to be particularly low. 1338

non-dealing counterparty, to the U.S. Activity Proposing Release, which proposed
to focus only on the activity of personnel in the United States of the dealing
counterparty).

activity); ISDA (July 2015), supra note 10, at 7 (arguing that business conduct
requirement, as well as other requirements, should not apply to transactions that

441

The Commission has determined not to limit the application of the business conduct
standards in this way. Counterparty expectations are not particularly relevant in
determining whether a transaction that involves relevant activity in the United States has
the potential to affect the integrity of the U.S. markets, particularly given that all of the
registered foreign SBS Dealers subject to these requirements will have, by definition, a
sufficient level of activity in the U.S. security-based swap market to exceed the de
minimis threshold, many by an order of magnitude. 1339 Given the significant role
registered SBS Dealers play in the market, applying the business conduct requirements to
their U.S. business should help protect the integrity of the U.S. market. 1340
Moreover, the approach to identifying relevant dealing activity in the United
States reflects the Commission’s determination that focusing solely on the location of the
personnel arranging, negotiating, or executing the transaction on behalf of the foreign
SBS Dealer appropriately balances the regulatory objectives of the business conduct
standards with concerns about workability of an activity-based test. To create additional
exceptions, particularly for activity occurring in the United States, based on the
expectations of the non-dealing counterparty or the mode of its interaction with the

are executed on an anonymous electronic platform or other means that “involve[s]
no human contact within the United States,” because the parties would have no
expectation that the rules would apply to such a transaction).

dealing activity likely exceeds the de minimis threshold by at least an order of
magnitude).

foreign SBS Dealer would unnecessarily complicate this approach in a manner, as noted
above, that would not advance the regulatory objectives served by these standards. 1341
Some commenters have urged the Commission to harmonize any standards that
the Commission does impose on these transactions with requirements that may separately
apply to the foreign registered SBS Dealer’s U.S.-person intermediary to avoid
unnecessary duplication or conflicts. 1342 The Commission recognizes that business
conduct standards could apply to transactions arising from relevant dealing activity in the
United States, including Title VII and home jurisdiction requirements on the registered
SBS Dealer and SRO requirements on the U.S. intermediary. As discussed above, the
rules being adopted today are generally designed to be consistent with the relevant SRO
requirements (and to harmonize with CFTC requirements), taking into account the nature
of the security-based swap market and the statutory requirements for SBS Entities. 1343
The Commission does not believe that the commenters’ concerns warrant a complete or
partial exception from Title VII requirements for the registered SBS Dealer.

1341

To the extent that anonymously executed transactions raise specific challenges or
concerns, these are not unique to transactions between two non-U.S. persons
involving relevant dealing activity in the United States. The Commission has
separately addressed this issue above. See Section II.B, supra.

1342

Commenters urged the Commission to harmonize FINRA’s existing sales practice
requirements with the “communication-based” or transaction-specific rules
applicable under Title VII. See SIFMA/FSR (July 2015), supra note 10, at 9-10;
IIB (July 2015), supra note 10, at 13. Commenters also urged the Commission to
work toward a harmonized approach to all the business conduct rules with the
CFTC and FINRA to ensure that security-based swap dealers and swap dealers
are not subject to two different sets of business conduct requirements. See also
ISDA (July 2015), supra note 10, at 2, n.7; IIB (July 2015), supra note 10, at 6, 7.

1343

See Sections I.C and I.F, supra.

443

First, as discussed below, the Commission is adopting a rule that potentially
would make substituted compliance available for the business conduct requirements
following a substituted compliance determination by the Commission. 1344 Accordingly,
substituted compliance, if available, could mitigate the commenters’ concerns regarding
home country regulation. 1345 A person relying on substituted compliance would remain
subject to the applicable Exchange Act requirements, but could comply with those
requirements in an alternative fashion. 1346 In practice, however, we recognize that there
will be limits to the availability of substituted compliance. For example, it is possible
that substituted compliance may be permitted with regard to some requirements and not
others with respect to a particular jurisdiction. For certain jurisdictions, moreover,
substituted compliance may not be available with respect to any requirements depending
on our assessment of the comparability of the relevant foreign requirements, as well as
the availability of supervisory and enforcement arrangements among the Commission and
relevant foreign financial regulatory authorities. Although comparability assessments
will focus on regulatory outcomes rather than rule-by-rule comparisons, the assessments
will require inquiry regarding whether foreign regulatory requirements adequately reflect
the interests and protections associated with the particular Title VII requirement. In some
circumstances, such a conclusion may be difficult to achieve.

1344

See Rule 3a71-6. See also note 1301, supra (citing IIB (July 2015), supra note 10,
at 12).

1345

See note 1338, supra (citing ICI Global (July 2015), supra note 10, at 5-6;
SIFMA-AMG (July 2015), supra note 10, at 2, 5; IIB (July 2015), supra note 10,
at 11; SIFMA/FSR (July 2015), supra note 10, at 9).

1346

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31085, supra note 6.

444

In the event that we are unable to determine that an entity may satisfy certain Title
VII requirements via substituted compliance, we recognize that such persons may, as a
result, be subject to requirements that are duplicative of particular Title VII requirements.
While we recognize the significance of such a result, in our view compliance with the
Title VII requirements is necessary to advance the policy objectives of Title VII. This
would be undermined by permitting foreign dealers to comply with their Title VII
obligations by satisfying foreign requirements, unless the alternative route provided by
substituted compliance has been made available.
Second, although the Commission is mindful that the U.S. intermediary of a
registered foreign SBS Dealer may be subject to business conduct requirements under the
Exchange Act and relevant SRO rules and that such requirements may be similar in
certain respects to those in Title VII, 1347 the Commission continues to believe that
notwithstanding any requirements that may apply to such intermediaries, it is appropriate
to impose the Title VII business conduct standards directly on registered foreign SBS
1347

See U.S. Activity Proposing Release, 80 FR 27476 n.249, supra note 9 (stating
that the agent of a foreign SBS Dealer would need to consider whether it
separately would need to register as a security-based swap dealer (if, for example,
the agent acted as principal in a security-based swap with the counterparty, and
then entered into a back-to-back transaction with the booking entity), a broker
(e.g., by soliciting or negotiating the terms of security-based swap transactions),
or other regulated entity); Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31027 n.574,
supra note 6 (same).
Commenters urged the Commission to harmonize FINRA’s existing sales practice
requirements with the “communication-based” or transaction-specific rules
applicable under Title VII. See SIFMA/FSR (July 2015), supra note 10, at 9-10;
IIB (July 2015), supra note 10, at 13. Commenters also urged the Commission to
work toward a harmonized approach to all the business conduct rules with the
CFTC and FINRA to ensure that security-based swap dealers and swap dealers
are not subject to two different sets of business conduct requirements. See ISDA
(July 2015), supra note 10, at 9; IIB (July 2015), supra note 10, at 6, 7.

445

Dealers when they use personnel located in the United States to arrange, negotiate, or
execute security-based swaps, even with counterparties that are also non-U.S. persons. 1348
The Commission continues to believe that it is appropriate to subject all registered SBS
Dealers engaged in U.S. business to the same business conduct framework, rather than
encouraging a patchwork of business conduct protections under U.S. law that may offer
counterparties varying levels of protections and limit the Commission’s ability to pursue
enforcement actions against the registered SBS Dealer for violation of Title VII
depending on the business model that the registered SBS Dealer has chosen to use in its
U.S. business. 1349
Further, as we have previously discussed, Congress established a comprehensive
framework of business conduct standards in Title VII that applies to registered SBS
Dealers, and we continue to believe that the transactional requirements we adopt to
implement this framework should govern their transactions with counterparties when
such transactions raise market integrity, transparency, and counterparty protection

1348

See U.S. Activity Proposing Release, 80 FR 27476, supra note 9. Consistent with
the Commission’s position in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the dealer and
its agent(s) may choose to allocate the responsibility for compliance with all U.S.
business conduct requirements in a manner consistent with its business structure,
although the foreign security-based swap dealer would remain responsible for
ensuring that all relevant Title VII requirements applicable to a given securitybased swap transaction are fulfilled. See U.S. Activity Proposing Release, 80 FR
27476 n.249, supra note 9; Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31026-27,
supra note 6. This allocation, however, would not affect the non-U.S. person’s
responsibilities with respect to performing the de minimis calculations required
under Rules 3a71-2 and 3a71-3(b). See U.S. Activity Proposing Release, 80 FR
27476 n.249, supra note 9; Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31026-27
n.574, supra note 6.

1349

See U.S. Activity Proposing Release, 80 FR 27476, supra note 9.

446

concerns that are addressed by these requirements. 1350 As we have already noted, SBS
Dealers are involved in an overwhelming majority of SBS transactions in the U.S.,
meaning that business conduct standards intended to achieve market integrity,
transparency, and counterparty protection across the U.S. market in security-based swaps
are more likely to achieve these objectives if they apply to all transactions that SBS
dealers arrange, negotiate, or execute using personnel located in a U.S. branch or
office. 1351
Some commenters supported dividing the business conduct standards into two
categories, one of which they argued should not apply to transactions between two nonU.S. persons. These commenters urged the Commission not to impose “relationshipbased” requirements (which they defined to include rules relating to the counterparty’s
ECP status, “know your counterparty” requirements, daily mark disclosure, and
1350

See U.S. Activity Adopting Release, Sections IV.B.2, IV.B.3, and n.162
(describing regulatory concerns raised by security-based swap dealing activity
carried out in the U.S., including risk, market integrity and transparency, and
counterparty protection). See Section II.G.3, supra (explaining that the “know
your counterparty” standard would be consistent with basic principles of legal and
regulatory compliance, and operational and credit risk management); Section
II.G.2.e, supra (explaining that the daily mark disclosure requirement is directly
relevant to a counterparty’s understanding of its financial relationship under a
security-based swap transaction and ensures a counterparty’s ability to monitor
the transaction during the relationship); Section II.G.4, supra (explaining that the
suitability requirement enables security-based swap dealers to understand the riskreward tradeoff of their security-based swap transactions).

1351

Firms that act as dealers play a central role in the security-based swap market.
Based on an analysis of 2014 single name CDS data in TIW, dealer accounts of
those firms that are likely to exceed the de minimis thresholds and trigger
registration requirements intermediated transactions with a gross notional amount
of approximately $8.5 trillion, over 60% of which was intermediated by top 5
dealer accounts. Commission staff analysis of TIW transaction records indicates
that approximately 99% of single name CDS price-forming transactions in 2014
involved an ISDA-recognized dealer. See U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR
8606 n.77.

447

suitability requirements) on these transactions but suggested that imposing “tradespecific” or “communication-based” requirements (which they which they identified as
including disclosure of material risks and characteristics and material incentives or
conflicts of interest and related recordkeeping, disclosures regarding clearing rights and
related recordkeeping, product suitability, and fair and balanced communications and
supervision) could be a reasonable approach, particularly if they were made more
consistent with similar FINRA rules that may apply to the U.S. intermediary. 1352
The Commission does not agree with commenters who argue that the foreign SBS
Dealers should be excepted from the “relationship-based” requirements when entering
into transactions with other non-U.S. persons. 1353 The Commission believes that
applying each of these requirements should improve market integrity and enhance
transparency and counterparty protections, even if that dealing activity is entirely with
non-U.S.-person counterparties, particularly given that the foreign SBS Dealers that
engage in the relevant dealing activity in the United States at levels above the de minimis
threshold account for a significant proportion of transactions in the U.S. market.
Moreover, certain underlying substantive requirements may require SBS Dealers to
obtain representations from counterparties (or to otherwise confirm their status) even
absent these business conduct requirements, meaning that, as a practical matter, for
example, we would not expect that the requirement in Rule 15Fh-3(a)(1) to verify ECP
status would increase the burden on market participants. 1354 Accordingly, the

The Exchange Act prohibits any person from effecting a security-based swap with

448

Commission does not believe it would be appropriate to provide an exception from these
“relationship-based” requirements for foreign SBS Dealers when they are required to
comply with the business conduct standards in a security-based swap transaction with a
non-U.S.-person counterparty because they have used personnel located in the United
States to arrange, negotiate, or execute the transaction.
The Commission recognizes that some non-U.S. person counterparties may
express reservations about making certain representations or completing questionnaires to
comply with the “relationship-based” business conduct requirements when they have no
intention of interacting with the dealer’s personnel located in the United States. 1355 At
the same time, nothing in the rule requires a registered SBS Dealer to comply with these
requirements if it intends to engage in transactions with a counterparty solely as part of
its foreign business. If the relationship later develops in such a way that future
exchange and the Securities Act makes it unlawful to offer to sell, offer to buy or
purchase or sell a security-based swap to any person who is not an eligible
contract participant unless a registration is in effect. See Section II.G.1.c, supra.
See also Section 6(l) of the Exchange Act; Section 5(e) of the Securities Act.
Accordingly, section 6(l) is broader than the activity covered by Rule 15Fh3(a)(1), and the SBS Dealer has an independent obligation under section 6(l) even
absent the requirement in Rule 15Fh-3(a)(1), to perform some due diligence in
confirming that its counterparty is an ECP. The requirement to verify the ECPstatus of a counterparty pursuant to Rule 15Fh-3(a)(1) simply provides a means
for complying with certain of the relevant substantive statutory provisions. See
id. See Section II.G.1.c, supra.

See SIFMA/FSR (July 2015), supra note 10, at 8-9. See also ICI Global (July
2015), supra note 10, at 6 (noting that, even though the registered dealer (and not
the non-U.S. person) is subject to the business conduct requirements, the non-U.S.
person counterparty would likely need to have in place appropriate documentation
and representations if its dealer is subject to business conduct requirements, which
may cause interruptions in their investment activities); IIB (July 2015), supra note
10, at 11-12 (arguing that non-U.S. counterparties would not expect the “traderelationship” requirements to apply in their trades with non-U.S. persons and

related to U.S. requirements). See note 1298, supra.

transactions may be expected to be part of the SBS Dealer’s U.S. business, under the final
rules the SBS Dealer then would be required to comply with these business conduct
standards, including these “relationship-based” requirements.
As noted above, some commenters acknowledged that the “communicationbased” or “trade-specific” requirements likely would advance regulatory objectives, such
as the prevention of fraud or manipulation, even in connection with SBS transactions
between two non-U.S. persons where one counterparty is using personnel located in the
United States to arrange, negotiate, or execute transactions. 1356 They urged, however,
that the Commission harmonize its Title VII business conduct standards to existing
FINRA rules to the extent that it chooses to impose Title VII requirements on these
transactions. 1357 As discussed above, the rules being adopted today are generally
designed to be consistent with the relevant SRO requirements (and to harmonize with
CFTC requirements), taking into account the nature of the security-based swap market
and the statutory requirements for SBS Entities. 1358
The Commission recognizes that application of these requirements may impose
costs on asset managers servicing non-U.S. clients and impede their ability to execute
certain block trades. 1359 However, we believe that the rules appropriately balance the

1358

See Sections I.C and I.F, supra.

See notes 1295 and 1296, supra. Specifically, the commenters expressed concern
that, under the proposal, the U.S. asset manager executing a trade on behalf of a
non-U.S. client, including in the context of a block trade, would need to know
whether the transaction involved U.S. activity and would also need to verify that
the non-U.S. client satisfies the business conduct requirements. See SIFMAAMG (July 2015), supra note 10, at 4; ICI Global (July 2015), supra note 10, at 6

regulatory objectives of the business conduct rules with concerns for a workable
approach. The rules adopted here are generally applicable to transactions of registered
SBS Dealers; the rules do not apply directly to asset managers, and asset managers will
incur no liability under these rules. We recognize that SBS Dealers may arrange their
business in a variety of ways and may have certain expectations of asset managers in
connection with the transactions involving funds. The entities involved in the transaction
may allocate these costs in the manner most efficient for the counterparties to the
transactions. Although the Commission recognizes that, depending on how the SBS
Dealer and the asset manager choose to allocate these responsibilities, the asset manager
may incur certain costs, neither these private allocation issues nor the potential liquidity
or execution price concerns change the Commission’s view that the U.S. business of SBS
Dealers should be subject to these business conduct requirements.
The Commission also disagrees with the commenters that urged the Commission
to permit sophisticated counterparties to “opt-out” completely from the business conduct
standards and with commenters that requested that the U.S. Activity Test not be applied
to transactions with special entities. 1360 The Commission has considered the concerns
raised by commenters and determined, on balance, not to permit counterparties to opt out
of the protections provided by the business conduct rules. The rules are intended to

representations in place to execute such trades and would face interruptions in
investment activities in doing so).

“transaction-specific” rules if they apply solely as a result of U.S. activity). See
note 1302, supra. See note 1304 (citing IIB (July 2015), supra note 10, at 12;

provide certain protections for counterparties, including certain heightened protections
for special entities. We think it is appropriate to apply the rules so that counterparties
receive the benefits of those protections and so do not think it appropriate to permit
parties to “opt out” of the benefits of those provisions. 1361

Transaction-Level Requirements for Major SBS
Participants

As noted above, the Commission is also adopting amendments to Rule 3a67-10 to
incorporate a modified exception from the business conduct standards for registered
foreign Major SBS Participants. 1362 The Commission received no comments in response
to the proposed exception from the business conduct requirement for registered foreign
Major SBS Participants in their transactions with non-U.S. persons. However, the final
rule is slightly modified from the proposal to address the concerns that non-U.S. persons
would limit or stop trading with foreign branches of U.S. banks that led us to adopt a
similar exception in the Cross-Border Adopting Release for certain transactions from the
position threshold calculations to determine whether one is a Major SBS Participant. 1363

1361

See Section II.A.3, supra. We also explained above that, while we are not
adopting an opt out provision, as discussed in connection with the relevant rules,
the Commission has determined to permit means of compliance with the final
rules that should promote efficiency and reduce costs (e.g., Rule 15Fh-1(b)
(reliance on representations)) and, where appropriate, allow SBS Entities to take
into account the sophistication of the counterparty (e.g., Rule 15Fh-3(f)
(regarding recommendations of security-based swaps or trading strategies)).

1362

Rule 3a67-10(d).

1363

See Rule 3a67-10. See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47343, supra note
193 (explaining the Commission’s view that an exclusion from the counting
requirement for positions that arise from transactions conducted through foreign
branches of registered security-based swap dealers appropriately accounts for the
risk in the U.S. financial system created by such positions).

452

As proposed, Exchange Act Rule 3a67-10(c), which addressed cross-border
application of the definition of “major security-based swap participant,” would require
non-U.S. persons to count toward the Major SBS Participant thresholds only their
security-based swap transactions with U.S. persons and would have permitted no
exception from that requirement. As adopted, however, in the Cross-Border Adopting
Release, the relevant rule (Exchange Act Rule 3a67-10(b)) provides that a non-U.S.
person need not include in these threshold calculations its security-based swap positions
with a U.S. person to the extent that the positions “arise from transactions conducted
through a foreign branch of the counterparty, when the counterparty is a registered SBS
Dealer.” 1364 This change to the final rule made the Commission’s approach to the
threshold calculations for Major SBS Participant consistent with its final approach to the
SBS Dealer de minimis calculation thresholds under Exchange Act rule 3a713(b)(1)(iii)(A)(1), which also permitted non-U.S. persons to exclude such transactions
with U.S. persons from their de minimis threshold calculations. 1365 The Commission
noted that this expanded exception from counting certain security-based swap positions
towards a non-U.S. person’s Major SBS Participant thresholds should help mitigate
concerns that non-U.S. persons will limit or stop trading with foreign branches of U.S.
banks. 1366
The Commission believes similar concerns about the ability of foreign branches
of U.S. banks to do business with non-U.S. persons apply in the context of application of

1364

See Exchange Act rule 3a67-10(b)(3)(i)(A).

1365

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47343, supra note 193.

1366

453

the business conduct requirement to these transactions. This exception from the
application of the business conduct requirements adopted in the final rules today should
address concerns that non-U.S. persons would limit or stop trading with foreign branches
of U.S. banks. The Commission is therefore amending Exchange Act rule 3a67-10 to
incorporate exceptions for transactions through the foreign branch of a U.S. person
modeled on those that are available in the final rule as it applies to registered SBS
Dealers. 1367 Accordingly, the final rules except registered foreign Major SBS
Participants from the business conduct standards described in section 15F(h) of the
Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder (other than the rules and
regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 15F(h)(1)(B)) 1368 with
respect to any transaction with a non-U.S. person, as proposed, or with a U.S. person in a
transaction conducted through the foreign branch of the U.S. person. 1369 The final rules
also except a registered U.S. Major SBS Participant from the business conduct standards
described in section 15F(h) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder
(other than the rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section

1367

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(8)(i)(A) (excluding from the definition of “U.S.
business” of a foreign SBS Dealer any transaction with U.S. persons that
constitutes a transaction conducted through a foreign branch of that U.S. person);
Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(8)(ii) (excluding from the definition of “U.S.
business” of U.S. SBS Dealers any transaction of the U.S. SBS Dealer that is a
transaction conducted through a foreign branch with a non-U.S. person or with a
U.S.-person counterparty that constitutes a transaction conducted through a
foreign branch of the counterparty).

See, supra, notes 1318-1319.

1369

See Exchange Act rule 3a67-10(d)(1). Consistent with the Cross-Border

Act rule 3a67-10(a)(6).

through a foreign branch of the counterparty. 1371

Availability of Substituted Compliance
1.

Proposed Substituted Compliance Rule

As part of the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission proposed to
make substituted compliance potentially available in connection with the requirements
applicable to SBS Dealers pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15F, other than the
registration requirements applicable to dealers. 1372 Because the business conduct
requirements being adopted today are grounded in Section 15F, substituted compliance
generally would have been available for those requirements under the proposal.
The proposal would have specifically provided that a foreign SBS Dealer 1373
could satisfy applicable requirements under Section 15F by complying with comparable
regulatory requirements of a foreign jurisdiction. 1374 The Commission explained that a

1370

See, supra, notes 1318-1319.

1371

See Exchange Act rule 3a67-10(d)(2). The Commission is also amending
Exchange Act rule 3a67-10(a) to define “U.S. major security-based swap
participant.” See Exchange Act rule 3a67-10(a)(5).

1372

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31088, 31207-08, supra note 6
(proposed Exchange Act Rule 3a71-5).

1373

In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission proposed to define a
“foreign security-based swap dealer” as a security-based swap dealer that is not a
U.S. person. See 78 FR at 31206, supra note 6 (proposed Exchange Act Rule
3a71-3(a)(3)).

1374

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31207, supra note 6 (proposed
Exchange Act Rule 3a71-5(b), providing that a security-based swap dealer may

455

person relying on substituted compliance would remain subject to the applicable
Exchange Act requirements, but could comply with those requirements in an alternative
fashion. Failure to comply with the applicable foreign requirement would mean that the
person would be in violation of the requirement in the Exchange Act. 1375
The Commission further explained that allowing substituted compliance for the
dealer requirements would have the goal of increasing the efficiency of the security-based
swap market and promoting competition “by helping to avoid subjecting foreign securitybased swap dealers to potentially conflicting or duplicative compliance obligations, while
still achieving the policy objectives of Title VII.” The Commission also stated that such
an approach would be consistent with the global nature of the security-based swap
market, and may be less disruptive of business relationships than not permitting
substituted compliance. 1376
Under the proposal, the Commission would not permit dealer requirements to be
satisfied by substituted compliance unless the Commission determined that the foreign
regime’s requirements were comparable to the otherwise applicable requirements, after
taking into account such factors as the Commission determines are appropriate, including
the scope and objectives of the relevant foreign regulatory requirements and the
effectiveness of the supervisory compliance program administered, and the enforcement

comply with Section 15F requirements by complying with certain corresponding
foreign requirements).

456

authority exercised, by the foreign financial regulatory authority in support of its
oversight. 1377
The Commission also stated that in making a substituted compliance
determination, it would focus on the similarities in regulatory objectives, rather than
requiring that the foreign jurisdiction’s rules be identical. Moreover, depending on the
assessment of comparability, the Commission could condition the substituted compliance
determination by limiting it to a particular class or classes of registrants in the foreign
jurisdiction. 1378
The proposal would have required that, prior to making a substituted compliance
determination, the Commission must have entered into a supervisory and enforcement
memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) or other arrangement with the foreign authority
addressing the oversight and supervision of security-based swap dealers subject to the
substituted compliance determination. 1379 The proposal further provided for the potential
withdrawal of substituted compliance orders, after notice and comment. 1380 In addition,
the proposal would have required that a foreign security-based swap dealer could not

See id. at 31086-88.

1378

See id. at 31088. The Commission added that it intended to take a category-bycategory approach toward substituted compliance under the proposal, and that
“certain requirements are interrelated such that the Commission would expect to
make a substituted compliance determination for the entire group of related
requirements.” See id. at 31088-89 (further stating that the Commission
anticipated considering substituted compliance related to capital and margin
requirements in connection with requirements related to risk management,
recordkeeping and reporting, and diligent supervision).

submit a substituted compliance request unless it is directly supervised by the foreign
financial regulatory authority, and the security-based swap dealer provides a certification
and opinion of counsel that the security-based swap dealer can provide the Commission
with prompt access to its books and records, and that the security-based swap dealer as a
matter of law can submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission. 1381
Under the proposal, substituted compliance would not have been available to
Major SBS Participants. In this regard, the Commission particularly noted “the limited
information currently available to us regarding what types of foreign entities may become
major security-base swap participants, if any, and the foreign regulation of such
entities.” 1382

Comments on the Proposal

Commenters raised issues in connection with a variety of aspects regarding the
proposed substituted compliance rule:
•

Basis for substituted compliance. One commenter to the Cross-Border
Proposing Release questioned the Commission’s authority to grant substituted
compliance, 1383 and expressed skepticism regarding the policy basis for

1381

See id. at 31089 & n.1126.

1382

See id. at 31035-36.

1383

See Better Markets (August 2013), supra note 7, at 24 (“Nowhere does the SEC
address its authority for adopting such a framework, nor does it explain how the
possibility of ‘conflicting or duplicative compliance obligations’ [justifies]
supplanting Congress's determination that, to protect the American taxpayer and
economy, those subject to the Commission's jurisdiction must comply with the
actual provisions of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.”).
This commenter particularly described the use of substituted compliance as
constituting an impermissible exemption from the Title VII requirements, stating:
“Had Congress intended the SEC to permit compliance with foreign regulation to

458

permitting the use of substituted compliance to satisfy Title VII
requirements. 1384 That commenter further suggested that any Commission
relief should be used sparingly, and should be predicated on a finding that
there is an actual conflict between Title VII and foreign requirements. 1385
•

Availability to U.S. persons. One commenter suggested that substituted
compliance for the dealer requirements should be available to foreign
branches of U.S. persons, 1386 while another commenter opposed the

suffice for all Title VII regulation of entities under U.S. jurisdiction, directly or by
way of anti-evasion regulations, it certainly could have done so.” In support, the
commenter cited Exchange Act section 17A(k), 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(k), added by
Dodd-Frank, which specifically permits the Commission to exempt clearing
agencies from registration when they are subject to comparable and
comprehensive oversight by the CFTC or by foreign regulators. See Better
Markets (August 2013), supra note 7, at 25.
1384

See Better Markets (August 2013), supra note 7, at 24-25 (“The SEC's duty is to
protect investors and the public consistent with congressional policy, not to
minimize the costs, burdens, or inconvenience that regulation imposes on
industry. This is particularly important when any claimed industry burden is not
only self-serving, but without basis and entirely speculative.”). The commenter
also alluded to potential loopholes associated with opportunities for regulatory
arbitrage, encouraging “a race to the regulatory bottom so that financial firms can
increase profits by avoiding regulations that protect the American people and
taxpayers,” and that the “financial industry is among the most notorious business
sectors for searching the globe to exploit such loopholes.” See id.

1385

See Better Markets (August 2013), supra note 7, at 26 (“Rather than following a
substituted compliance approach, the SEC should use its exemptive authority
sparingly, and only upon a finding of actual conflict with a particular foreign
regulation.”).

1386

See SIFMA (August 2013), supra note 7, at A-33 (stating that not allowing
substituted compliance for foreign branches in connection with confirmation
requirements and certain other requirements would put foreign branches at a
competitive disadvantage to foreign dealers, although foreign branches “are, in
most cases, subject to extensive supervision and oversight in their host country”;
further noting that the Commission proposed to allow substituted compliance for
foreign branches in connection with regulatory reporting, public dissemination
and trade execution requirements).

459

availability of substituted compliance to U.S. persons. 1387 One commenter
expressed the view that substituted compliance should be made available to
U.S. persons in connection with transactions with non-U.S. persons, 1388 while
another stated that substituted compliance should be made available to U.S.
persons in connection with all transaction-level requirements. 1389
•

Availability in connection with U.S. business. One commenter expressed the
view that substituted compliance generally should not be available in
connection with transactions involving U.S. counterparties, or in connection
with transactions that occur within the U.S. 1390

1387

See Better Markets (August 2013), supra note 7, (generally opposing substituted
compliance for U.S. persons, including foreign branches, and stating that allowing
substituted compliance in those circumstances would constitute “carve-outs” that
would “essentially nullify U.S. law in favor of foreign regulatory requirements”).

1388

See ESMA, supra note 8, at 3-4 (expressing the view that “substituted compliance
should apply when a counterparty to the derivative transaction is established in an
equivalent jurisdiction and is a non-US person. In such case, substituted
compliance should be possible whatever the status of the other party is, including
if it is a U.S. person, and whatever the place out of which the transaction is
conducted or executed.”).

1389

See MFA/AIMA, supra note 8 (stating the Commission should extend substituted
compliance to “to all transaction-level requirements that apply to U.S. and nonU.S. persons,” and that “by extending the scope of substituted compliance to all
market participants, irrespective of their ‘U.S. person’ status, and to all regulatory
categories . . . the Commission would mitigate the risk of duplicative and/or
conflicting regulatory requirements, without curtailing the reasonable application
of Title VII of Dodd-Frank to relevant market participants”).

1390

See Better Markets (August 2013), supra note 7, at 26-27 (“The SBS activities of
a U.S. person directly and immediately impact the United States and endanger the
U.S. taxpayer if improperly regulated. . . . Substituted compliance is simply
impermissible for transactions with U.S. persons or for transactions that occur
within the United States, regardless of the status of the counterparty.”).

460

•

Comparability criteria. Certain commenters opposed the proposed holistic
approach toward assessing comparability based on regulatory outcomes, and
instead expressed the view that any assessments should be done on a
requirement-by-requirement basis. 1391 Conversely, a number of commenters
supported the proposed approach. 1392 Some commenters requested further

1391

See AFR (stating that an “‘outcomes-based’ assessment of regulation is thus
likely to be far more subjective than a careful, point-by-point comparison of the
actual substance of the rules,” and that “a hypothesized similarity in outcomes for
sets of rules that are quite different in substance should not suffice to certify
comparability”; further stating that an outcomes-based assessment may not be
consistent with the need for different sets of requirements to be standardized);
Better Markets, supra note 7, (August 2013) at 3, 30 (stating that the SEC must
abandon the regulatory outcomes test and must ensure that foreign regulation is
comparable in substance, form, over time, and as enforced,” and also questioning
whether “one can ever predict whether regulatory outcomes will be comparable”).
A legislative comment letter to the CFTC in connection with the CFTC’s own
cross-border initiative, on which the SEC Chair and Commissioners were copied,
also took the view that there should be a presumption against comparability for
substituted compliance purposes and that any assessment be made on a
requirement-by-requirement basis. See U.S. Senators, supra note 8 (“However,
the ‘substituted compliance’ determination must be made through a judicious
process, on a country-by-country and requirement-by-requirement basis, and
subject to a presumption that other jurisdictions do not comply unless proven
otherwise.”).

1392

See, e.g., SIFMA (August 2013), supra note 7, at A-30 (the proposed approach “is
consistent with the goal of international comity and is preferable to a rule-by-rule
comparison”); IIB (August 2013), supra note 8, at 18 (“We agree with the
Commission that requirements related to internal controls (such as risk
management, recordkeeping and reporting, internal systems and controls, diligent
supervision and chief compliance officer requirements) should generally be
evaluated holistically. These requirements are commonly overseen and
administered by a single prudential regulator.”); EC, supra note 8 (“We support
the consideration of regulatory outcomes as the standard for permitting substituted
compliance, as well as the consideration of particular market practices and
characteristics in individual jurisdictions. This flexible approach recognises the
differing approaches that regulators and legislators may take to achieving the
same regulatory objectives in the derivatives markets.”); ABA (October 2013),
supra note 8.

clarity regarding the assessment criteria and regarding the information that
should be submitted in support of applications, 1393 while one commenter
challenged the proposal’s lack of particularized elements for assessing
comparability in connection with certain requirements. 1394 One commenter
questioned how the Commission would be notified of material changes to
foreign law that underpins a substituted compliance determination. 1395
Commenters also expressed the views that regulatory comparisons should

See SIFMA (August 2013), supra note 7 (requesting that the Commission provide
a “more granular and detailed framework” for clarity regarding the assessment
process, including the factors relevant to the determination and the method and
metrics for comparing regulatory outcomes); CDEU, supra note 8 (addressing
vagueness in criteria); ISDA (August 2013), supra note 7, at 3 (“Without a more
concrete definition of the outcomes-based standard, applicants will face
uncertainty in determining what information should be supplied in connection
with an application. ISDA proposes that the appropriate ‘outcomes’ to guide
substituted compliance determinations should be the common principles based on
the consensus G-20 goals as described above, rather than details of domestic
legislation; in other words, a substituted compliance determination should be an
assessment that the non-US regulatory approach under consideration adheres to
the common principles.”); FOA, supra note 8 (requesting additional detail
regarding relevant regulatory outcomes).

1394

See Better Markets (August 2013), supra note 7, at 30 (noting that the
Commission proposed particularized comparability elements in connection with
regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements, and stating that the
lack of such elements for other requirements would be confusing and would
create “the opportunity for the Commission to approve much more relaxed
foreign regulations based on more vague standards”; further stating that it would
be arbitrary and capricious not to make use of “consistently robust and publicly
disclosed” standards to guide substituted compliance determinations for each
requirement).

1395

See Better Markets (August 2013), supra note 7, at 29 (“Any entity making use of
substituted compliance must be held responsible for immediately informing the
SEC if either the relevant regulation or the factors that qualified the entity for

urged the need for consistency and coordination with the work of other
regulators and IOSCO, 1397 and supported building on existing cooperative
initiatives. 1398 Commenters also stated that the Commission should
coordinate substituted compliance determinations with the CFTC. 1399 One

1396

See ISDA (August 2013), supra note 7 (stating that “the Commission could
consider and adopt a regime-based approach, whereby comparability would exist
if a jurisdiction has implemented regulations to meet the G-20 commitments. The
Commission’s rejection of this approach based on its ‘responsibility to implement
the specific statutory provisions ... added by Title VII’ overlooks the principle that
comity should inform the extraterritorial application of statutory directives”;
citation omitted).

1397

See II.F, supra note 8 (“Nevertheless, the proposed approach (and any similar
approaches used in other jurisdictions) will be even more effective and beneficial
if they are consistent with, and coordinated with, the work and approaches of
other authorities in the same jurisdiction (particularly in the case where multiple
supervisors have responsibility for swaps regulation), national authorities in other
jurisdictions and international standard setters such as the International
Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).”).

1398

See JSDA, supra note 8 (noting that the CFTC and the European Union had
announced a “Path Forward” regarding their joint understandings for how to
approach cross-border derivatives, and stating “[w]e expect that the SEC and
CFTC will jointly adopt the same approach regarding application of substituted
compliance to Japan”).

1399

See, e.g., CDEU, supra note 8 (“The SEC should also work closely with the
CFTC when determining whether substituted compliance is applicable with
respect to a particular jurisdiction. With respect to substituted compliance, the
regulatory requirements of end-users operating globally depend on whether the
SEC has made a comparability determination for the relevant non-U.S.
jurisdiction. Conflicting regimes will lead to increased costs and unnecessary
duplicative regulations which may be directly or indirectly imposed on derivatives
end users.”); ISDA (August 2013), supra note 7 (“Differences in the
Commission’s and CFTC’s approaches to derivatives regulation produce
uncertainties and confusion for market participants. Moreover, the lack of
coordination severely limits potential efficiencies in the substituted compliance
process. We note here some of the significant differences between the Proposal
and the CFTC July 2013 Guidance. We respectfully urge the agencies to prioritize
harmonization of their approaches to substituted compliance.”). But see ISDA

that a substituted compliance assessment must address a foreign regime’s
supervisory and enforcement capabilities in practice. 1401 Another commenter
expressed the view that differences among the supervisory and enforcement

consequences of ‘partial’ substituted compliance determination for market
participants and, wherever possible, to presume that where a significant portion of
a jurisdiction's regulatory regime is determined to be comparable to Title VII of
the Dodd-Frank Act, the remainder of the jurisdiction's regulatory regime should
also be deemed to be comparable”).

1401

This commenter also highlighted particular factors for analysis of foreign
supervision and enforcement. See Better Markets (August 2013), supra note 7, at
29-31 (stating that the “foreign regulatory regime must incorporate strong
investigative tools and meaningful penalty provisions, and the foreign regulator
must have a demonstrable commitment to enforcement and the resources to carry
out such a commitment,” that the Commission “must evaluate a host of factors
regarding the foreign regulatory system, including staff expertise, agency funding,
agency independence, technological capacity, supervision in fact, and
enforcement in fact,” and that the Commission “must determine that there is a
track record of robust enforcement by the foreign jurisdiction before making or
renewing any such finding”).
Another commenter more generally supported the Commission’s ability to not
grant substituted compliance due to the substantive enforcement of foreign
regulatory regimes. See AFR, supra note 8 (also supporting withdrawal of
substituted compliance due to a foreign regulator’s failure to exercise its
supervisory or enforcement authority).

consider such enforcement and supervisory practices. 1403

Multi-jurisdictional issues. One commenter raised questions regarding the
application of substituted compliance in connection with third-country
branches of non-U.S. dealers, 1404 while another commenter raised issues
regarding which sets of rules apply to transactions between parties in different
markets, and whether the parties to cross-jurisdiction transactions may choose
which rules apply. 1405 Commenters also raised issues regarding the

See ISDA (August 2013), supra note 7 (“While the G-20 commitments for the
reform of derivatives markets are globally shared, supervisory practices vary
significantly among jurisdictions. Supervisory practices established in one
jurisdiction will be adapted to the facts of that jurisdiction. This lack of
commonality should not be assumed to be a defect in supervisory standards;
common objectives may be reached through differing means. Moreover,
commonality may not present meaningful benefits beyond those already achieved
by virtue of the Commission and its counterpart regulators negotiating and
entering into memoranda of understanding, a process that is separately a predicate
for substituted compliance.”).

1403

See ABA, supra note 8 (“In addition, we believe that the Commission's
comparability analysis should extend to the existence and effectiveness of the
foreign jurisdiction's supervisory examination and enforcement programs.
However, we urge the Commission to provide further guidance as to how these
factors will be analyzed in particular scenarios.”).

1404

See FOA, supra note 8 (“However, multi-jurisdictional scenarios are quite
common and the SEC must provide additional guidance on how it intends to
address substituted compliance when a bank headquartered in one country (e.g.,
the UK) may have a swap dealing branch that operates in another country (e.g.,
Hong Kong). Any substituted compliance determination by the SEC must
account for the interplay of the regulatory regimes in the relevant non-US
jurisdictions.”).

Deference and coordination. One commenter suggested that the Commission
should defer to non-U.S. oversight when possible. 1407 Commenters further

States, then either the parties should be free to choose which rules apply or the
rules where the [transaction] occurs should be the default position.”).

and examination by the Commission. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78

See Better Markets (August 2013), supra note 7, at 29 (supporting proposed
approach, citing lack of data and limited information, and adding that the
Commission should not consider substituted compliance for major participants
“until and unless industry participants provide reliable and comprehensive data
proving that it would be otherwise prudent to do so”).

1414

See, e.g., ISDA (August 2013), supra note 7, at 7 (opposing potential conditions
requiring that U.S. counterparties be qualified institutional buyers or qualified
investors, and opposing any use of a threshold requirement that non-U.S. securitybased swap dealers predominantly engage in non-U.S. business); ABA, supra note
8 (opposing limiting substituted compliance to qualified institutional buyers or
qualified investors); see also Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31091-92,
supra note 6 (soliciting comment on those potential limitations to the availability
of substituted compliance).

1415

See FOA, supra note 8 (“The FOA recognises that the timeline for reviewing a
request for substituted compliance and reaching an informed decision will likely
vary, for example due to the nature of the regulatory regime in a given jurisdiction
or the SEC staff's lack of familiarity with a particular jurisdiction's approach.
Nevertheless, the FOA believes that it is essential that there be a standard
timeframe for the SEC to reach a substituted compliance determination. Any
uncertainty regarding the timeline for compliance with regulatory obligations
creates a significant amount of additional complexity for market participants that
are already faced with substantial operational and compliance burdens in
preparing for the compliance dates of new regulations.”).

conduct requirements being adopted today. 1416 The final rule has been modified from the
proposal in a number of ways, including, as discussed below: consistent with the scope
of the current rulemaking, the final rule solely addresses the use of substituted
compliance to satisfy those business conduct requirements (rather than addressing the
availability of substituted compliance more generally in connection with section 15F
requirements other than registration requirements, as proposed); 1417 and the final rule
makes substituted compliance potentially available to registered Major SBS Participants
(rather than limiting the potential availability of substituted compliance to registered SBS
Dealers, as proposed). 1418
a.

Basis for Availability of Substituted Compliance in
Connection with Business Conduct Requirements

As discussed elsewhere, the security-based swap market is global, with a
prevalence of cross-border transactions within that market. 1419 The cross-border nature
of this market poses special regulatory challenges in connection with the rules we are
adopting today, in that the Title VII business conduct requirements applicable to SBS
Dealers or Major SBS Participants have the potential to lead to requirements that are
duplicative of or in conflict with applicable foreign business conduct requirements, even
when the two sets of requirements implement similar goals and lead to similar results.
Such results have the potential to disrupt existing business relationships and, more
generally, to reduce competition and market efficiency.

1416

The final rule has been renumbered from the proposal.

1417

See Section III.B.3.b, infra.

1418

See Section III.B.3.c, infra.

1419

See Section VI.B.3, infra.

470

The Commission accordingly proposed to implement a substituted compliance
framework “to address the effect of conflicting or duplicative regulations on competition
and market efficiency and to facilitate a well-functioning global security-based swap
market.” 1420 In the Commission’s view, under certain circumstances it may be
appropriate to allow for substituted compliance whereby market participants may satisfy
certain of the Title VII business conduct requirements by complying with comparable
foreign requirements. In this manner, registered entities could comply with a single set of
requirements where substituted compliance is deemed appropriate, while remaining
subject to robust oversight. Accordingly, substituted compliance may be expected to help
achieve the goals of Title VII in a way that promotes market efficiency, enhances
competition and facilitates a well-functioning global security-based swap market.
In reaching this conclusion, the Commission notes that one commenter has
questioned the Commission’s authority to grant substituted compliance and has expressed
skepticism regarding the policy basis for permitting the use of substituted compliance to
satisfy Title VII requirements. 1421 In contrast to the suggestion of that comment,
however, substituted compliance does not constitute exemptive relief and does not excuse
registered SBS Entities from having to comply with the Exchange Act business conduct
requirements. Instead, substituted compliance provides an alternative method of
satisfying those requirements under Title VII.
Moreover, the same commenter’s view that substituted compliance would lead to
a lowering of regulatory standards is addressed by the provision that any grant of
1420

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31086, supra note 6.

1421

See notes 1383 and 1384, supra.

471

substituted compliance would be predicated on there being comparable requirements in
the foreign jurisdiction. Indeed, in the Commission’s view, the potential for substituted
compliance will help to promote the effective application of Title VII requirements, by
making it less likely that certain market participants that are complying with comparable
foreign requirements will determine that they need to choose between modifying their
business conduct systems to reflect the requirements of U.S. rules, or else limiting or
ceasing their participation in the U.S. market. 1422
This commenter also expressed the view that any Commission action of this
nature at a minimum should be predicated on a finding that there is an actual conflict
between Title VII and foreign requirements. 1423 In the Commission’s view, however,
requiring a showing of actual conflict as a condition to substituted compliance should not
be necessary as substituted compliance is intended to promote compliance efficiencies in
connection with potentially duplicative requirements (as well as conflicting
requirements). 1424

1422

The Commission further notes that section 752(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act in part
requires that the Commission consult with the foreign regulatory authorities on
the establishment of consistent regulatory standards with respect to the regulation
of security-based swaps. The use of substituted compliance to help mitigate the
impacts of inconsistent and duplicative requirements is consistent with that
statutory direction.

1423

See note 1385, supra.

1424

In light of the benefits associated with substituted compliance, the final rule also
does not include potential limitations, for which the proposing release solicited
comment, that would have conditioned substituted compliance on a non-U.S.
entity not transacting with U.S. counterparties that are not qualified institutional
buyers or qualified investors, or that would have required that non-U.S. entities
receiving substituted compliance predominantly engage in non-U.S. business.
See note 1414, supra.

b.

Structure and Scope of the Final Rule
i.

In General

As noted, the final rule has been revised from the proposal to reflect that until
other Title VII rules are adopted, substituted compliance will be available only with
respect to the business conduct rules. The Commission expects to assess the potential
availability of substituted compliance in connection with other requirements when the
Commission considers final rules to implement those requirements.
To implement this revised approach, paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 3a71-6 as adopted
provides that the Commission may, conditionally or unconditionally, by order, make a
determination with respect to a foreign financial regulatory system that compliance with
specified requirements under that foreign financial regulatory system by a registered SBS
Dealer and/or by a registered Major SBS Participant – each a “security-based swap
entity” under the rule – or class thereof, may satisfy the corresponding requirements
identified in paragraph (d) of rule 3a71-6 that would otherwise apply. 1425 Paragraph (d),

1425

See Exchange Act Rule 3a71-6(a)(1). The proposed rule would have made
substituted compliance potentially available for all of the section 15F dealer
requirements other than registration requirements. The structure of the final rule
implements a more targeted approach whereby the Commission will assess the
availability of substituted compliance when the Commission considers the
applicable substantive rules. Consistent with this approach, the final rule does not
include proposed paragraph (a)(3), which would have specified that substituted
compliance would not be available in connection with the registration
requirements of section 15F. See generally Registration Adopting Release, 80 FR
at 48972-73, supra note 989 (determining that substituted compliance would not
be available in connection with the registration requirements for security-based
swap dealers, and stating that “[p]ermitting a foreign SBS Dealer to satisfy these
requirements through compliance with the relevant requirements in its home
jurisdiction, even with appropriate notice of such compliance to the Commission,
may deprive the Commission of the necessary information, including information

473

discussed below, is an addition from the proposal that specifies the business conduct
requirements that the Commission is adopting. 1426
Paragraph (a)(2) of the final rule provides that the Commission will not make a
substituted compliance determination unless it determines that the foreign requirements
applicable to the SBS Entity (or class thereof), or to the activities of such entity (or class
thereof), are comparable to the otherwise applicable requirements, after taking into
account such factors as the Commission determines are appropriate, such as the scope
and objectives of the relevant foreign regulatory requirements (taking into account
applicable criteria set forth in paragraph (d)), as well as the effectiveness of the
supervisory compliance program administered, and the enforcement authority exercised,
by the foreign authority to support its oversight of the SBS Entity (or class thereof) or of
the activities of the entity (or class thereof). This provision has been revised from the
proposal in part to make the rule more flexible, by permitting substituted compliance to
be predicated either on foreign regulation of the entity (or class), or, alternatively, on
foreign regulation of the entity’s (or class’s) activities. In this way, the rule can account
for situations in which a foreign regulatory regime does not specifically provide for the

resulting from inspection and examination of the books and records of a firm
engaged in dealing activity at levels above the de minimis threshold.”).
Paragraph (a)(1) of the final rule also has been modified from the proposal to
remove language limiting substituted compliance to “foreign” entities.
Substituted compliance for the business conduct standards at issue here will be
available only to foreign security-based swap dealers and foreign major securitybased swap participants, and the Commission expects to assess whether
substituted compliance should be limited to foreign entities in connection with
other section 15F requirements.
1426

Exchange Act Rule 3a71-6(d).

474

registration of a particular category of market participant, but nonetheless effectively
regulates the activities of members of that category. 1427
Paragraph (a)(2) of the rule further provides that the Commission will not make a
substituted compliance determination unless the Commission has entered into a
supervisory and enforcement memorandum of understanding and/or other arrangement
with the relevant foreign financial regulatory authority addressing supervisory and
enforcement cooperation and other matters arising under the substituted compliance
determination. 1428 This provision should help ensure that both regulators will cooperate
with each other within the substituted compliance framework, such that both regulators
have information that will assist them in fulfilling their respective regulatory mandates.
Moreover, the Commission may, on its own initiative, by order, modify or withdraw a

1427

In other words, for example, under the final rule the Commission may make
substituted compliance available in connection with a foreign regulatory regime
that does not make use of a specific registration category for dealers in securitybased swaps, but that nonetheless regulates such dealers in a manner that is
comparable to the section 15F requirements.
As proposed, paragraph (a)(2) made no mention of particular criteria associated
with a substituted compliance determination. Paragraph (a)(2) of the final rule,
however, specifies that in considering the scope and objectives of the relevant
foreign requirements, the Commission intends to consider applicable criteria that
are set forth in new paragraph (d). See Section III.B.3.e, infra.

1428

See Exchange Act Rule 3a71-6(a)(2)(ii). Paragraph (a)(2)’s reference to
supervisory and enforcement cooperation and other matters further has been
revised from the proposal, which addressed the “oversight and supervision” of
applicable security-based swap dealers. This change is to help ensure that
enforcement cooperation is encompassed within those arrangements, given the
importance of enforcement in promoting compliance with applicable
requirements. The change parallels comparable language in the substituted
compliance rules applicable to Regulation SBSR. See Regulation SBSR
908(c)(2)(iv).

475

substituted compliance determination after appropriate notice and opportunity for
comment. 1429
Paragraph (b) of the final rule specifies that a registered SBS Entity may satisfy
the Exchange Act requirements identified in paragraph (d) of the rule by complying with
corresponding law, rules and regulations under a foreign financial regulatory system,
provided that: (1) the Commission has made a determination providing that compliance
with specified requirements under the foreign financial regulatory system by such
registered security-based swap entity (or a class thereof) may satisfy the corresponding
requirements, and (2) such entity satisfies any conditions set forth in the Commission’s
determination. 1430

1429

See Exchange Act Rule 3a71-6(a)(3).
Commenters stated that any withdrawal or modification of a substituted
compliance determination by the Commission should also be subject to a phase-in
period. See note 1411, supra. The final rule does not contain any such provision
for a phase-in period, however, given that substituted compliance is predicated on
the relevant foreign requirements being comparable to the Title VII requirements,
and on the adequacy of the relevant foreign authority’s supervision and
enforcement in connection with those foreign requirements. Subject to that
principle, the Commission in practice would expect to consider such timing and
operational issues in the event that it were to reconsider a previous grant of
substituted compliance. The particular facts and circumstances surrounding such
a reconsideration would be relevant to how long substituted compliance would
remain available after Commission action.

1430

See Exchange Act Rule 3a71-6(b). This paragraph has been changed from the
proposal in certain ways consistent with the changed scope of the rule (i.e.,
deleting the word “foreign” and replacing “dealer” with “entity”) or for clarifying
purposes. This paragraph also has been changed from the proposal, which
referred to “legislative requirements, rules and regulations,” to more flexibly
account for the variety of potential sources of applicable requirements.

476

Paragraph (c) of the final rule addresses requests for substituted compliance
determinations. As discussed below, those application provisions have been revised from
the proposal in certain respects. 1431
To implement the final rule’s targeted approach toward substituted compliance,
paragraph (d) of rule 3a71-6 states that substituted compliance will be available in
connection with the business conduct and supervision requirements of sections 15F(h)
and 15F(j) and rules 15Fh-3 through 15Fh-6, and the CCO requirements of section
15F(k) and rule 15Fk-1, subject to exceptions discussed below. 1432
As discussed below, moreover, paragraph (d) specifies that prior to making these
substituted compliance determinations, the Commission intends to consider whether the
information required to be provided to counterparties pursuant to the requirements of the
foreign jurisdiction, the counterparty protections of the foreign jurisdiction, the mandates
for supervisory systems under the requirements of the foreign jurisdiction, the duties
imposed by the foreign jurisdiction, and the CCO requirements of the foreign jurisdiction,
are comparable to the Exchange Act requirements. 1433 Those factors are relevant to the
comparability analysis, and their inclusion in the final rule also responds to commenters

1431

See Section III.B.3.h, infra.

1432

The business conduct requirements that are the subject of this rulemaking in large
part are derived from Exchange Act section 15F(h). As discussed above,
however, Exchange Act section 15F(j) imposes on SBS Entities a series of selfexecuting duties with regard to trade monitoring, risk management systems,
regulatory disclosures, information access systems and procedures, conflict-ofinterest systems and procedures, and antitrust considerations. Rule 15h3(h)(2)(iii)(I) requires SBS Entities to adopt written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to comply with those duties. See note 605, supra, and
accompanying text.

1433

See note 1458, infra, and accompanying text.

477

that expressed the view that the rules should provide more guidance regarding
comparability criteria. 1434 At the same time, as discussed below, substituted compliance
does not require that there be requirement-by-requirement comparability between
Exchange Act requirements and foreign requirements, as the operative question is
whether there is the comparability of the associated regulatory outcomes. 1435
Finally, the Commission is not persuaded by commenter requests that we provide
phase-in periods or other means to link the timing of the substantive requirements under
the Exchange Act with the availability of substituted compliance. 1436 The effective dates
and compliance dates for these business conduct requirements reflect the need to
implement those requirements in a timely manner, regardless of whether the alternative
route provided by substituted compliance is available. 1437
ii.

Unavailability in Connection with Antifraud
Prohibitions and Certain Other Requirements

Paragraph (d)(1) of the final rule provides that substituted compliance is not
available in connection with Exchange Act section 15F(h)(4)(A), which in relevant part
prohibits SBS Dealers from engaging in fraudulent activities in connection with special
entities and more generally. The rule also provides that substituted compliance is not
available in connection with Exchange Act rule 15Fh-4(a), which implements that
statutory antifraud provision.
1434

See notes 1393 and 1394, supra.

1435

See Section III.B.3.e, infra.

1436

See note 1410, supra.

1437

Given the facts and circumstances nature of the substituted compliance
assessment, the Commission also does not believe that it would be practicable to
provide a standard timeframe for reaching substituted compliance determinations.
See note 1415, supra.

478

In the Commission’s view, substituted compliance is not appropriate in connection
with those explicit statutory prohibitions of fraudulent conduct, given the central role of
the antifraud provisions of the securities laws in protecting the integrity and reputation of
U.S. financial markets. The Commission also notes that concerns regarding regulatory
duplication do not arise in the context of such antifraud prohibitions in the same way they
may arise with respect to other provisions.
Paragraph (d)(1) further provides that substituted compliance is not available in
connection with Exchange Act sections 15F(j)(3) and (j)(4)(B). Section 15F(j)(3)
requires that SBS Entities disclose, to the Commission and the applicable prudential
regulators, information concerning: the terms and conditions of the entity’s securitybased swaps; security-based swap trading operations, mechanisms and practices;
financial integrity protections relating to security-based swaps; and other information
relevant to the entity’s trading in security-based swaps. Section 15F(j)(4)(B) provides
that the SBS Entity upon request shall provide the Commission and any applicable
prudential regulator with information necessary to perform statutory functions under
Section 15F. In our view, the Commission’s oversight of SBS Entities requires that the
Commission be able to directly access relevant information from those
entities. Accordingly, the Commission does not believe that those requirements that SBS
Entities provide information to the Commission are reasonably amenable to being
satisfied via compliance with the requirements of a foreign jurisdiction. 1438

1438

In addition, Exchange Act Section 15F(j)(7) authorizes the Commission to
prescribe rules governing the duties of SBS Entities. While the Commission is
not excluding that provision from the potential availability of substituted
compliance, the Commission expects to separately consider whether substituted

479

iii.

Application to Particular Requirements

It is possible that substituted compliance may be granted with regard to some of
these requirements but not others. As discussed below, the Commission intends to assess
the comparability of foreign requirements using a holistic approach that focuses on
regulatory outcomes rather than predicating substituted compliance on requirement-byrequirement similarity. 1439 At the same time, however, the business conduct
requirements being adopted today encompass a range of distinct categories (e.g.,
supervision, counterparty protection, special entity protection) such that those individual
categories may be subject to differing conclusions regarding the comparability of
regulatory outcomes and/or the associated foreign enforcement and supervisory practices.
Thus, for example, it may be possible that the Commission would make substituted
compliance available with regard to a particular foreign regulatory regime in connection
with certain counterparty protections required by these rules but not the supervision
requirements, or vice versa. Ultimately, this would depend on the relevant facts and
circumstances, and their impact upon specific assessments of comparability, 1440 and of
supervision and enforcement.
The Commission further anticipates that certain categories of the requirements we
are adopting today – related to ECP verification, special entities and political
contributions – will raise special issues with regard to comparability, and with regard to
compliance may be available in connection with any future rules promulgated
pursuant to that provision.
1439

See Section III.B.3.e, infra.

1440

As discussed below, substituted compliance is predicated on the comparability of
regulatory outcomes, and does not mandate rule-by-rule equivalence between
specific requirements under Title VII and analogous foreign requirements.

480

whether adequate supervision and enforcement is available under the foreign regulatory
regime. Such issues are likely to arise with regard to those particular requirements
because each of those requirements address protections that may have no foreign law
analogues, as those requirements reflect heightened concerns under U.S. law regarding
potential abuses involving particular categories of persons. Indeed, those categories and
the protections afforded to them under U.S. law may not correspond with any specified
categories of persons or protections under relevant foreign law. As a result, substituted
compliance assessments in connection with those categories will require inquiry
regarding whether foreign regulatory requirements adequately reflect the same particular
interests and protections.
c.

Availability to Major SBS Participants

Under the proposed rule, substituted compliance would have been available only
to registered SBS Dealers, and would not have been available to registered Major SBS
Participants. In taking that proposed position, the Commission noted a lack of
information regarding the types of entities that may become Major SBS Participants, and
the foreign regulation of those entities. 1441
Two commenters disagreed with that aspect of the proposal, with one commenter
expressing concern regarding major participants being forced to comply with duplicative
or potentially conflicting regulatory regimes, and the other commenter suggesting there
would be no reason to distinguish between SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants in
this regard. 1442 One commenter, in contrast, opposed the possibility of substituted
1441

See note 1382, supra.

1442

See note 1412, supra.

481

compliance for Major SBS Participants by citing the lack of relevant information, and
stated that the Commission should not consider substituted compliance for Major SBS
Participants unless the industry provided data proving that this step would be prudent. 1443
After further consideration of the issues, the final rule provides that substituted
compliance is potentially available in connection with these business conduct
requirements for registered Major SBS Participants as well as for registered SBS Dealers.
This decision reflects the fact that the business conduct standards apply to registered
Major SBS Participants as well as to registered SBS Dealers, and recognizes that the
market efficiency goals that underpin substituted compliance also can apply when
substituted compliance is granted to registered Major SBS Participants.
To implement this approach, the final rule has been revised from the proposal to
specify that the Commission may determine that compliance by a registered SBS Dealer
and/or by a registered Major SBS Participants – each a “security-based swap entity”
under the rule – may satisfy the business conduct requirements through substituted
compliance. 1444 The remainder of the final rule refers to a security-based swap “entity”
rather than a security-based swap “dealer.”
One commenter had expressed the view that more information is needed before
substituted compliance is made available to Major SBS Participants. 1445 In the
Commission’s view, however, those concerns are adequately addressed by the fact that
any grant of substituted compliance in connection with the business conduct requirements

1443

See note 1413, supra.

1444

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-6(a)(1).

1445

See note 1413, supra, and accompanying text.

482

applicable to Major SBS Participants would be predicated on a determination that the
Major SBS Participants is subject to comparable regulation in a foreign jurisdiction.
Absent such a determination – and consistent with the Commission’s previously noted
concerns regarding the need for information regarding the types of entities that may
become Major SBS Participants, and the foreign regulation of those entities – the
Commission would not grant substituted compliance in connection with registered Major
SBS Participants, even if the Commission were to grant substituted compliance in
connection with registered SBS Dealers in the same jurisdiction.
d.

Availability of Substituted Compliance with Regard to
U.S. and Foreign Entities, Counterparties and Activity

Under the final rule, substituted compliance in connection with the business
conduct requirements is not available to entities that are U.S. persons. 1446 On the other
hand, entities that are not U.S. persons may rely on substituted compliance to satisfy the
business conduct requirements with regard to the entirety of their security-based swap
business, regardless of whether their counterparty for a particular transaction is a U.S.
person, or whether any of the associated activity occurs in the U.S.
i.

No Availability to U.S. Security-Based Swap
Dealers or U.S. Major Security-Based Swap
Participants

Consistent with the proposal, the final rule does not make substituted compliance
available to U.S. security-based swap dealers or U.S. major security-based swap
participants in connection with these business conduct requirements.

1446

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-6(d). For these purposes, the term “U.S. person” has
the meaning set forth in Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4).

483

Certain commenters had suggested that substituted compliance for these dealer
requirements should be available to foreign branches of U.S. persons, 1447 or to U.S.
persons in certain circumstances in connection with transaction-level requirements. 1448
One commenter further expressed the view that foreign branches of U.S. banks may be
subject to extensive host country supervision, and that concerns regarding duplicative or
inconsistent regulation may arise in connection with the security-based swap activities of
U.S. entities. Conversely, one commenter argued that such an extension of the proposed
scope of substituted compliance would be inconsistent with the application of U.S.
law. 1449
The Commission concludes on balance that it is appropriate to limit the
availability of substituted compliance such that only entities that are not U.S. persons
may take advantage of that alternative route for satisfying the Title VII business conduct
requirements. In part, this conclusion accounts for the fact that concerns regarding
duplication and inconsistency in connection with transaction-level business conduct
requirements should be mitigated by the amendment we are adopting to Exchange Act
rule 3a71-3, to provide an exception from the business conduct requirements under
Exchange Act section 15F(h) – other than supervision requirements pursuant to Exchange
Act section 15F(h)(1)(B) – for registered U.S. SBS Dealers in connection with foreign
business conducted through their foreign branches. 1450

1447

See note 1386, supra.

1448

See notes 1388 and 1389, supra.

1449

See note 1387, supra.

1450

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(c); see also Section III.A.3.b, supra. There is a
similar exception from the section 15F(h) business conduct requirements (other

484

The Commission recognizes that the above exception would not mitigate the
possibility that U.S. entities may face duplication or inconsistency in certain
circumstances. For example, for non-U.S. business that U.S. SBS Dealers and U.S.
Major SBS Participants conduct through their foreign branches, such duplication or
inconsistency may still arise in connection with the entity-level supervision and CCO
regulations being adopted today. For the other security-based swap business of those
U.S. SBS Entities, such duplication or inconsistency potentially may arise in connection
with any of the business conduct requirements being adopted today.
The Commission nonetheless believes that substituted compliance should not be
available to registered entities that are U.S. persons. This conclusion reflects a number of
policy considerations. Fundamentally, this approach acknowledges that dealers and
major participants that fall within the “U.S. person” definition have a heightened
connection to the U.S. market. 1451 As a result of that heightened connection, it is the

than supervision) for registered U.S. Major SBS Participants with respect to
security-based swap transactions that constitute transactions through a foreign
branch of the registered U.S. Major SBS Participant, that are either with a nonU.S. person or with a U.S.-person counterparty that constitutes a transaction
conducted through a foreign branch of that counterparty. See Exchange Act rule
3a67-10(d)(2). These exceptions are not available in connection with the CCO
requirements, which are promulgated pursuant to Exchange Act section 15F(k).
1451

The definition of “U.S. person” is designed to encompass persons that have a
significant portion of their financial and legal relationships within the U.S. “[T]he
definition of ‘U.S. person’ in [17 CFR 240.3a71-3] is intended, in part, to identify
those persons for whom it is reasonable to infer that a significant portion of their
financial and legal relationships are likely to exist within the United States and
that it is therefore reasonable to conclude that risk arising from their securitybased swap activities could manifest itself within the United States, regardless of
the location of their counterparties, given the ongoing nature of the obligations
that result from security-based swap transactions.” “Application of ‘SecurityBased Swap Dealer’ and ‘Major Security-Based Swap Participant’ Definitions to
Cross-Border Security-Based Swap Activities,” Exchange Act Release No. 72472

485

Commission’s judgment that a U.S. SBS Entity’s compliance with the business conduct
requirements of Title VII, and the Commission’s associated oversight of that entity’s
security-based swap business, should occur without the potential availability of
substituted compliance. Although substituted compliance is predicated on there being
comparability with Title VII requirements, and does not exempt or otherwise excuse
compliance with Title VII, in the Commission’s view direct compliance with the Title
VII business conduct requirements by U.S. SBS Entities will efficiently facilitate the
Commission’s regulatory oversight of entities that have a heightened connection to the
U.S. market. That warrants such limits to substituted compliance in our view,
notwithstanding the general considerations that support the availability of substituted
compliance in connection with the business conduct requirements.
This conclusion also reflects our view that U.S. market participants generally
would have a reasonable expectation that the business conduct requirements of Title VII
would apply directly, and that the activities of such U.S. persons would be subject to

(Jun. 25, 2014), 79 FR 47278, 47289 (Aug. 12, 2014) (“SBS Entity Definitions
Adopting Release”).
Moreover, the definition of “U.S. person” does not carve out the foreign branches
of U.S. persons. In part this reflects the fact that “a person does not hold itself out
as a security-based swap dealer as anything other than a single person even when
it enters into transactions through its foreign branch or office.” See id..
Based on the direct nature of this link between the U.S. market and those persons
that fall within the “U.S. person” definition, Title VII applies to the security-based
swap activities of U.S. persons in a manner that is more comprehensive than its
application to the activities of other persons. See generally id. at 47288-91
(addressing how dealer and major participant definitions account for all securitybased swap activity of U.S. persons because all such activity occurs in the U.S.,
but account for a more limited subset of the activity of foreign entities).

486

Commission oversight with a degree of directness that may not be present in connection
with substituted compliance.
ii.

Availability in Connection with U.S.
Counterparties and U.S. Activity

Consistent with the proposal, the final rule does not contain any provisions that
would limit the ability of foreign registered entities to use substituted compliance to
satisfy the business conduct requirements in connection with transactions involving U.S.
counterparties or U.S. activity.
One commenter had expressed the view that substituted compliance should not be
available in connection with activities involving U.S. persons or U.S. activity, arguing
that the security-based swap activity of U.S. persons directly and immediately impacts
the U.S., and would endanger U.S. taxpayers if improperly regulated. 1452 We concur
with that commenter regarding the need for proper regulation of SBS Entities in
connection with their security-based swap business involving U.S. counterparties and
activity (as well as more generally). At the same time, however, we note that substituted
compliance is not an alternative to rigorous regulation, but instead is predicated on there
being business conduct regulation comparable with the rules we are adopting today. So
long as the Commission determines that corresponding foreign requirements are
comparable with those Title VII business conduct requirements, the use of substituted
compliance accordingly would uphold the interests associated with those Title VII
requirements.

1452

See note 1390, supra.

487

Also, following alternative approaches – such as an approach whereby substituted
compliance would not be available to a foreign SBS Entity in connection with
transactions involving U.S. counterparties or U.S. activity, but would be available in
connection with other transactions – in practice may have the effect of forcing the foreign
SBS Entity to choose between modifying its business conduct systems, including its
supervisory and CCO arrangements to reflect the requirements of U.S. rules, or else
exiting the U.S. market and thereby generally reducing competition and market
efficiency. 1453
e.

Comparability Criteria

As discussed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission will
endeavor to take a holistic approach in considering whether regulatory requirements are
comparable for purposes of substituted compliance, and will focus on the comparability
of regulatory outcomes rather than predicating substituted compliance on requirementby-requirement similarity. The Commission also continues to recognize that foreign
regulatory systems differ in their approaches to achieving particular regulatory outcomes,
and that foreign requirements that differ from those adopted by the Commission
nonetheless may achieve regulatory outcomes comparable with those of Title VII. The
Commission further continues to recognize that different regulatory systems may be able

1453

Other alternative approaches for addressing the application of substituted
compliance could be, for example, to permit substituted compliance in connection
with U.S. activity that does not involve U.S. counterparties, or allowing
substituted compliance for transaction with U.S. counterparties only so long as no
U.S. activity is involved. Reducing the availability of substituted compliance in
such a manner, however, would be expected to be accompanied by a
corresponding reduction to the competition and market efficiency benefits
associated with substituted compliance.

488

to achieve some or all of those regulatory outcomes by using more or fewer specific
requirements than the Commission, and that in assessing comparability the Commission
may need to take into account the manner in which other regulatory systems are informed
by business and market practices in those jurisdictions. 1454
Accordingly, in considering whether the requirements of a foreign regulatory
regime are comparable with the various categories of requirements being adopted today
(such as the supervision and counterparty protection requirements we are adopting) the
Commission will evaluate whether the foreign requirements provide for regulatory
outcomes that are consistent with the regulatory outcomes of the applicable category of
requirements. Moreover, as noted above, in application the Commission may determine
that for a particular jurisdiction, the prerequisites for substituted compliance have been
met in connection with certain categories of requirements but not others.
In reaching this conclusion, the Commission notes that certain commenters
opposed the proposed holistic approach toward assessing comparability based on
regulatory outcomes, and that instead expressed the views that any assessments should be
done on a requirement-by-requirement basis. Those views at least in part reflected the
reasoning that an outcomes-based approach would be subjective and would lead to a
“hypothesized similarity in outcomes for sets of rules that are quite different in
substance.” 1455 In this regard, the Commission recognizes that a requirement-byrequirement approach would be easier to implement and simpler to translate into
objective criteria than an alternative approach that focuses on regulatory outcomes. Such
1454

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31085-86, supra note 6.

1455

See note 1391, supra.

489

a requirement-by-requirement approach, however, could foreclose any grants of
substituted compliance, because even highly similar regulatory regimes are likely to have
technical differences in the implementing rules. More generally, the Commission
believes that the proper focus for analyzing substituted compliance should address
regulatory outcomes, because a standard that turns upon the comparability of regulatory
outcomes can promote regulatory efficiency in a way that preserves the key protections
associated with the business conduct rules, and in a manner that reflects the cross-border
nature of the market and helps to curb fragmentation, while facilitating the ability of U.S.
persons to participate in the global security-based swap market. 1456
As noted above, the Commission foresees that there will be difficult questions
connected with comparability assessments for Dodd-Frank requirements related to ECP
verification, special entities and political contributions, given that those particular
requirements all address activities involving certain classes of U.S. persons, and reflect
heightened concerns regarding potential abuses involving such persons. 1457 Recognizing
that the comparability assessments will focus on regulatory outcomes rather than rule-byrule comparisons, the assessments will require inquiry regarding whether foreign
regulatory requirements adequately reflect those particular interests and protections.
Moreover, paragraph (d) of the final rule (which as discussed above has been
added to the rule to specify the requirements for which substituted compliance potentially
is available), provides that prior to making these substituted compliance determinations,
1456

A requirement-by-requirement standard, in contrast, similarly would promote key
protections, but would not adequately address the cross-border nature of the
market and the ability of U.S. persons to participate in the global market.

1457

See Section III.B.3.b.iii, supra.

490

the Commission intends to consider whether the information required to be provided to
counterparties pursuant to the requirements of the foreign jurisdiction, the counterparty
protections of the foreign jurisdiction, the mandates for supervisory systems under the
requirements of the foreign jurisdiction, the duties imposed by the foreign jurisdiction,
and the CCO requirements of the foreign jurisdiction, are comparable to the Exchange
Act requirements. 1458 Those provisions have been included as part of new paragraph (d)
in response to commenters to the Cross-Border Proposing Release that requested specific
guidance regarding the criteria the Commission will consider in making comparability
assessments, 1459 or that challenged the rule’s lack of particularized elements for assessing
comparability. 1460 While recognizing those commenters’ wish for additional guidance to
assist in making applications for substituted compliance, and for assessment criteria that
are as specific and objective as possible, in this circumstance the Commission believes
that the comparability assessments will turn upon relevant facts and circumstances in a
manner such that it would not be practicable to include more specific criteria in the rule.
One commenter questioned how the Commission would be notified of material
changes to foreign law that underpins a substituted compliance determination. 1461 The
Commission expects to address those issues in connection with considering specific

1458

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-6(d)(1). The rule further provides that prior to
making a substituted compliance determination in connection with the CCO
requirements of section 15F(k), the Commission intends to consider whether the
requirements of the foreign jurisdiction regarding CCO requirements are
comparable to those required pursuant to the applicable Exchange Act
requirements. See Exchange Act rule 3a71-6(d)(2).

1459

1460

applications for substituted compliance, and notes that, potentially, the requirement that
the Commission be notified of material changes in foreign law could be incorporated as
conditions to substituted compliance orders, or as part of memoranda of understanding or
other arrangements between the Commission and the relevant foreign financial
regulators. 1462
Commenters also expressed the views that regulatory comparisons should focus
on common principles associated with shared G-20 Leaders goals, 1463 urged the need for
consistency and coordination with the work of other regulators and IOSCO, 1464 and with
the CFTC, 1465 and also supported building on existing cooperative initiatives, 1466 and
supported deference to non-U.S. oversight when possible. 1467 While the Commission
intends to be mindful of those various goals and principles as part of its comparability
analyses, the decision whether to grant substituted compliance ultimately must focus on
whether a foreign regime produces regulatory outcomes consistent with the applicable

1462

Substituted compliance orders further may be conditioned on security-based swap
dealers and major security-based swap participants that rely on substituted
compliance notifying the Commission of that reliance. In that respect, the forms
that the Commission has adopted for use by applicants for registration as securitybased swap dealers or major security-based swap participants provides for
applicants to notify the Commission regarding intended reliance on substituted
compliance. See Registration Adopting Release, 80 FR at 49049, supra note 989
(questions 3A, B and C of Form SBSE-A, addressing potential reliance on
substituted compliance determinations).

1463

See note 1396, supra.

See note 1398, supra.

1467

See note 1407, supra.

492

provisions of the Exchange Act. That type of assessment necessarily must focus on
Exchange Act requirements.
Finally, one commenter argued that to help manage operational complexities, the
entirety of a regulatory regime should be deemed comparable with the Exchange Act
requirements if a significant portion of that regime is found to be comparable. 1468 In the
Commission’s view, however, such an approach would be inconsistent with the predicate
for substituted compliance that there be the comparability of regulatory outcomes. If a
foreign regulatory regime does not achieve a regulatory outcome that is comparable to
the regulatory outcome associated with particular Exchange Act requirements, then the
basis for substituted compliance will not have been satisfied. In that case, substituted
compliance would not be appropriate with regard to such requirements, notwithstanding
its potential availability in connection with other requirements.
f.

Consideration of Supervision and Enforcement
Practices

Assessment of a foreign regulatory regime’s supervisory and enforcement
practices is expected to be a critical component of any Commission decision to permit
substituted compliance. As discussed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, when the
Commission assesses a foreign regulatory regime’s oversight for purposes of making a
substituted compliance determination, the Commission expects to consider not only
overall oversight activities, but also oversight specifically directed at conduct and activity
that would be relevant to the substituted compliance determination. 1469 For example, it
would be difficult for the Commission to make a comparability determination in support
1468

See note 1400, supra.

1469

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31088 n.1117, supra note 6.

493

of substituted compliance if oversight is directed solely at the local activities of foreign
security-based swap dealers, as opposed to the cross-border activities of such dealers.
In making this consideration a prerequisite for substituted compliance, the
Commission in no way should be interpreted as minimizing the significance of the
Commission’s own independent obligation to supervise the compliance of registered
entities with Title VII requirements, even when requirements may be satisfied via
substituted compliance. Registered entities are subject to the requirements of Title VII,
and the Commission retains its full authority to inspect, examine and supervise those
entities’ compliance with Title VII, and take enforcement action as appropriate,
regardless of the availability of substituted compliance.
One comment emphasized that the assessment must address a foreign regulatory
regime’s supervisory and enforcement capabilities in practice, not merely on paper. 1470
Another comment stated that differences among the supervisory and enforcement regimes
should not be assumed to reflect flaws in one regime or another. 1471 The Commission
expects that its consideration of the effectiveness of a foreign regulatory regime’s
practices will account for those factors in conjunction with other relevant factors. 1472

1470

See note 1401, supra.

1471

See note 1402, supra.

1472

In this regard, the Commission notes that one commenter requested further
guidance regarding the Commission’s consideration of the effectiveness of
foreign supervision and enforcement. See note 1403, supra. In the Commission’s
view, however, consideration of foreign supervisory and enforcement
effectiveness will turn upon relevant facts and circumstances in a manner such
that it would not be practicable to provide more specific guidance regarding
specific factors that may be included within that analysis.

494

Applying those principles here, the Commission notes that the difficult questions
noted above with respect to requirements regarding ECP verification, special entities and
political contributions also can be expected to manifest themselves in connection with our
consideration of a foreign regulatory regime’s supervisory and enforcement practices.
That is, as the Commission evaluates the foreign regulatory regime’s supervisory and
enforcement practices in connection with substituted compliance, the Commission
necessarily will seek to evaluate whether those supervisory and enforcement practices
will adequately support regulatory outcomes consistent with those particular
requirements (as well as the other business conduct requirements).
More generally, the scope of any grant of substituted compliance may be linked to
the scope of foreign regulatory regime’s supervision and enforcement practices. For
example, if a foreign regulatory regime closely oversees the security-based swap business
that an SBS Entity conducts through an office located in that non-U.S. jurisdiction, but
does not exercise the same degree of regulatory oversight over a branch of that entity that
is located in the U.S., it is possible that any grant of substituted compliance would not
extend to activities conducted through the entity’s U.S. branch.
g.

Multi-Jurisdictional Issues

Commenters further have raised certain issues – that were not addressed in the
Cross-Border Proposing Release – regarding how the substituted compliance rule would
apply to certain special circumstances involving multi-jurisdictional activities of foreign
security-based swap dealers. While recognizing the facts-and-circumstances nature of
the application of substituted compliance under the final rule, the Commission anticipates
that the final rule would apply generally to such circumstances in the following manner:

495

i.

Third-Country Branches

One commenter particularly raised questions regarding the application of
substituted compliance in connection with third-country branches of foreign securitybased swap dealers, and requested further guidance regarding how substituted
compliance would apply to circumstances where an entity located in one country has a
branch located in another country that engages in dealing activity. 1473 The potential
availability of substituted compliance under the final rule will reflect the scope of any
relevant substituted compliance order, including, for instance, whether an order for a
particular jurisdiction extends to third-country branches of entities domiciled within that
jurisdiction. The scope of any such order – and hence the potential availability of
substituted compliance for a third-country branch – necessarily will turn upon the
applicable facts and circumstances.
ii.

Substituted Compliance and the European
Union

Commenters also raised issues regarding the assessment of substituted
compliance in the context of the European Union, stating that certain rules are adopted at
a European level and are applied directly by individual member states. 1474 In the
Commission’s view, such issues may be expected to affect analyses of substantive
comparability in a manner that differs from the way they may apply to consideration of
the adequacy of a foreign regulatory regime’s enforcement and supervisory system. In
particular, to the extent that substantive requirements are promulgated at a multi-state
level, the Commission’s analysis may consider whether those multi-state requirements
1473

See note 1404, supra.

1474

See note 1406, supra.

496

are comparable to the corresponding Exchange Act requirements. In contrast, to the
extent that the enforcement and supervision of those requirements is conducted at the
member state level, then the Commission necessarily would assess the adequacy of a
foreign regulatory regime’s enforcement and supervisory system at the member state
level. Any grant of substituted compliance necessarily would take into account both the
substantive requirements and the adequacy of the relevant enforcement and supervisory
system.
iii.

Additional Cross-Jurisdictional Issues

Another commenter raised issues regarding which sets of requirements would
apply to transactions between parties in different markets, and whether the parties to
cross-jurisdiction transactions may choose which rules apply. 1475 As discussed above,
substituted compliance is intended to help promote efficiency, enhance competition and
facilitate a well-functioning market by helping SBS Entities avoid regulatory conflicts or
duplication. Substituted compliance is not mandatory, moreover, so when it is available a
non-U.S. SBS Entity may elect whether to rely on comparable foreign requirements with
regard to its security-based swap business or some discrete portion of that business.
However, the policies and procedures of non-U.S. SBS Entities generally should address
with particularity when the entity will rely on substituted compliance with regard to
particular requirements (e.g., with regard to particular portions of their security-based
swap business and/or particular counterparties).

1475

See note 1405, supra.

497

h.

Applications for Substituted Compliance and Related
Prerequisites

Paragraph (c)(1) of the final rule provides that a party or group of parties that
potentially would rely on substituted compliance, or any foreign financial regulatory
authority or authorities supervising such a party or its security-based swap activities, may
file an application, pursuant to the procedures set forth in Exchange Act Rule 0-13
requesting that the Commission make a substituted compliance determination. 1476
Exchange Act Rule 0-13 is a procedural rule that the Commission has adopted regarding
the submission of substituted compliance applications, and provides for the opportunity
for public comment on completed applications. 1477 Paragraph (c)(1) has been revised
from the proposal (which only referred to applications by security-based swap dealers) to
reflect the fact that Rule 0-13 provides for applications by foreign financial
authorities. 1478 Also, to avoid duplicating the requirements of Rule 0-13, paragraph
1476

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-6(c)(1). The final rule accordingly provides that a
foreign financial regulatory authority may submit a substituted compliance
application if that authority supervises a party that would rely on substituted
compliance, or supervises that party’s activities. A regulatory authority that does
not possess such supervisory responsibilities would not be eligible to submit a
substituted compliance application, even if that authority promulgates rules or
other requirements applicable to such parties’ security-based swap activities.

1477

Among other respects, Rule 0-13 provides that applications must include any
supporting documents necessary to make the application complete, “including
information regarding applicable requirements established by the foreign financial
regulatory authority or authorities, as well as the methods used by the foreign
financial regulatory authority or authorities to monitor and enforce compliance
with such rules.” Rule 0-13 further provides that Commission staff will review
the application after the filing is complete, and that completed applications will be
published for public comment.

1478

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47358, supra note 193 (concluding,
in adopting Rule 0-13, that “allowing foreign regulators to submit such requests
would promote the completeness of requests and promote efficiency in the
process for considering such requests”).

498

(c)(1) also has been revised from the proposal by removing references to the need for the
applicant to provide the reasons for the request and provide supporting documentation as
the Commission may request.
In addition, paragraph (c)(1) has been revised from the proposal to provide that
applications may be made by parties or groups of parties that potentially would rely on
substituted compliance, in lieu of the proposed reference to applications by foreign
security-based swap dealers or groups of dealers “of the same class.” This change in part
accommodates the possibility that market participants may seek approval to rely on
substituted compliance prior to their being deemed to be “security-based swap dealers” or
“major security-based swap participants” under the applicable definitions. The final rule
also does not limit joint applications to those that come from persons “of the same class,”
to facilitate the Commission’s ability to consider applications jointly submitted by
multiple entities notwithstanding differences in their businesses. 1479
In connection with applications submitted by such parties, Rule 3a71-6(c)(2)(i)
states that such a party (or group of parties) may make a substituted compliance request
only if the party or the party’s activities are “directly supervised by the foreign financial
regulatory authority or authorities with respect to the foreign regulatory requirements
relating to the applicable requirements.” 1480 This condition should help promote the

1479

Paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) also have been changed to reflect the possibility that
the foreign regulators may supervise the party, or the party’s activities.

1480

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-6(c)(2)(i). This provision has been changed from the
proposal to reflect the fact that potential applicants will not be limited to securitybased swap dealers. This provision also has been changed from the proposal by
removing a redundant reference to the foreign authorities being “under the
system.” In addition, the introductory part of paragraph (c)(2) has been modified
from the proposal to refer to requests made “pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)” (rather

499

principles that condition substituted compliance on the effectiveness of the supervision
and enforcement exercised by the foreign authority, by reflecting the fact that substituted
compliance will not be allowed for entities that are not subject to foreign oversight in
connection with their security-based swap business.
The final rule further provides that to make a request for substituted compliance,
each such party must provide the certification and opinion of counsel that is described in
Exchange Act rule 15Fb2-4(c), as if the party were subject to that requirement at the time
of the request. 1481 Rule 15Fb2-4(c) requires that nonresident security-based swap dealers
and major security-based swap participants must certify, and provide an associated
opinion of counsel, that the entity can as a matter of law, and will, provide the
Commission with prompt access to the entity’s books and records and submit to onsite
inspection and examination by the Commission. 1482 This part of the final rule is

than “pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)” as set forth in the proposal), consistent with
the revised structure of the rule.
1481

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-6(c)(2)(ii).

1482

See Exchange Act rule 15Fb2-4(c). Under that rule, the certification must state
that the entity “can, as a matter of law, and will” provide such access to the
Commission, while the opinion of counsel only says that the entity “can, as a
matter of law” provide such a certification.
As noted, although commenters to the Cross-Border Proposing Release had
questioned such direct access on deference-related grounds, the Commission
subsequently adopted a final rule requiring those certifications and opinions of
counsel as prerequisites to registration by nonresident entities. See notes 1408
and 1409, supra. In adopting that prerequisite, we noted our belief that
“significant elements of an effective regulatory regime are the Commission’s
abilities to access registered SBS Entities’ books and records and to inspect and
examine the operations of registered SBS Entities.” See Registration Adopting
Release, 80 FR at 48981, supra note 989.

500

generally consistent with the proposal, with one change to permit an entity to apply for
substituted compliance before the entity registers with the Commission. 1483
The final rule also has been revised from the proposal to implement an analogous
requirement in connection with substituted compliance applications by foreign financial
regulatory authorities. 1484 In particular, the final rule provides that foreign financial
regulatory authorities may make substituted compliance requests only if each such
authority provides adequate assurances that no law or policy of any relevant foreign
jurisdiction would impede the ability of any entity that is directly supervised by the
foreign financial regulatory authority, and that may register with the Commission as a
security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, to provide prompt
access to the Commission to such entity’s books and records or to submit to onsite
inspection or examination by the Commission. 1485

1483

The final rule, in contrast to the proposal, states that the party must provide the
certification and opinion of counsel “as if the party were subject to that
requirement at the time of the request.” Because the requirements of rule 15Fb24(c) are imposed on an entity applying for registration with the Commission, the
addition of that language should facilitate the ability of an entity to apply for
substituted compliance before the entity is required to register with the
Commission as a security-based swap dealer or as a major security-based swap
participant.

1484

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-6(c)(3). As noted above, the final rule has been
modified from the proposal to permit foreign financial regulatory authorities to
submit substituted compliance applications, necessitating the addition of this
prerequisite to applications by such authorities.

1485

While applications by foreign financial regulatory authorities must include such
adequate assurances, the rule does not specifically require those applications to be
accompanied by opinions of counsel (in contrast to applications submitted by
entities that seek to rely on substituted compliance). Opinions of counsel,
however, provide one possible way in which such authorities may provide the
necessary adequate assurances.

501

In general, those prerequisites to the submission of substituted compliance
applications by entities or by foreign financial authorities should promote efficiency in
the substituted compliance assessment process. The prerequisites particularly will help
focus such assessments upon those jurisdictions that would not effectively prohibit
entities from registering as dealers or major participants as a result of blocking statutes or
other laws or policies that otherwise would impede the Commission’s ability to exercise
its supervisory authority and responsibilities over registered entities. In other words, if a
jurisdiction has blocking statutes or other laws or policies that would preclude the
registration of such dealers and major participants with the Commission, there would be
no purpose to the Commission considering a substituted compliance application in
connection with that jurisdiction.
Exchange Act rule 0-13, which addresses the submission of substituted
compliance applications, states that the Commission will not consider hypothetical
requests for substituted compliance orders. 1486 Consistent with that limitation, when the
Commission reviews substituted compliance applications, it would take into account
whether particular jurisdictions contain entities that reasonably may be expected to
register with the Commission as security-based swap dealers or major security-based
swap participants based on their level of security-based swap activity connected with
U.S. persons or the U.S. market.
IV.

Explanation of Dates
A.

1486

Effective Date

See Exchange Act rule 0-13(e).

502

These final rules will be effective 60 days following publication in the Federal
Register.
B.

Compliance Date

The Commission believes it appropriate not to apply these rules until entities are
required to register as SBS Dealers or Major SBS Participants. Therefore, with the
exception of the application of customer protection requirements described in final Rule
3a71-3(c) to transactions described under final Rule 3a71-3(a)(8)(i)(B), the Commission
is adopting a compliance date for final Rules 15Fh-1 through 15Fh-6 1487 and Rule 15Fk-1
that is the same as the compliance date of the SBS Entity registration rules (“Registration
Compliance Date”). 1488
In the Registration Adopting Release, the Commission provided that the
Registration Compliance Date will be the later of: six months after the date of publication
in the Federal Register of final rules establishing capital, margin and segregation
requirements for SBS Entities; 1489 the compliance date of final rules establishing

1487

See Section II.H.9 (Certain Political Contributions by SBS Dealers), supra,
discussing, among other things, how Rule 15Fh-6 applies to contributions made
before the SBS Dealer registered with the Commission as such as well as how the
rule’s “look back” provision will not apply to contributions made before the
compliance date of the rule by newly covered associates to which the look back
applies.

1488

See Registration Adopting Release, supra note 989.

1489

The Commission previously has proposed rules to establish capital, margin and
segregation requirements for SBS Entities. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation
Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap
Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, Exchange Act Release
No. 68071 (Oct. 18, 2012), 77 FR 70213 (Nov. 23, 2012).

503

recordkeeping and reporting requirements for SBS Entities; 1490 the compliance date of
final rules establishing business conduct requirements under Sections 15F(h) and 15F(k)
of the Exchange Act; or the compliance date for final rules establishing a process for a
registered SBS Entity to make an application to the Commission to allow an associated
person who is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting
security-based swaps on the SBS Entity’s behalf. 1491
The Commission has previously noted the potential complexities associated with
identifying transactions of a dealer that it arranges, negotiates, or executes by personnel
located in the United States under Rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C), 1492 which requires a nonU.S.-person dealer to include such transactions in its de minimis threshold calculations.
In the U.S. Activity Adopting Release, the Commission specified that the compliance
date for that rule is “the later of (a) 12 months following publication in the Federal
Register, or (b) the SBS Entity Counting Date.” 1493 Because the Commission believes
similar potential complexities exist with respect to such transactions that are included in
“U.S. business” as defined in final Rule 3a71-3(a)(8)(i)(B), the Commission is adopting a
compliance date for application of customer protection requirements described in final
Rule 3a71-3(c) to transactions described under final Rule 3a71-3(a)(8)(i)(B) that is the
later of (a) 12 months following publication in the Federal Register, or (b) the
Registration Compliance Date.
1490

The Commission previously has proposed rules to establish recordkeeping and
reporting requirements for SBS Entities. See Recordkeeping Release, 79 FR
25193, supra note 242.

The Commission believes that these timing requirements should provide firms
with adequate time to review the business conduct rules being adopted today and make
appropriate business decisions before being required to comply with the requirements of
the rules.
C.

Application to Substituted Compliance

For the substituted compliance provisions of Rule 3a71-6, the Commission
similarly is adopting an effective date of 60 days following publication in the Federal
Register. There will be no separate compliance date in connection with that rule, as the
rule does not impose obligations upon entities separate and apart from the underlying
business conduct requirements. As discussed above, security-based swap dealers and
major security-based swap participants will not be required to comply with the business
conduct requirements until they are registered, and the registration requirement for those
entities will not be triggered until a number of regulatory benchmarks have been met.
In practice, the Commission recognizes that if the requirements of a foreign
regime are comparable to Title VII requirements, and the other prerequisites to
substituted compliance also have been satisfied, then it may be appropriate to permit a
security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant to rely on substituted
compliance commencing at the time that entity is registered with the Commission.
Accordingly, the Commission would consider substituted compliance requests that are
submitted prior to the compliance date for the entity registration requirements.
V.

Paperwork Reduction Act

505

Certain provisions of the Rules impose new “collection of information”
requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). 1494
In accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507 and 5 CFR 1320.11, the Commission submitted the
provisions to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review when it issued
the Proposing Release. The titles for these collections are “Business Conduct Standards
for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants,” and
“Designation of Chief Compliance Officer of Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major
Security-Based Swap Participants.”
Compliance with collection of information requirements is mandatory. An
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. OMB
assigned control number 3235-0732 to the new collections of information.
In the Proposing Release, the Commission requested comment on the collection
of information requirements contained therein, as well as the accuracy of the
Commission’s related estimates and statements regarding the associated costs and
burdens of the proposed rules. As noted above, the Commission received 43 comment
letters addressing the Proposing Release, as well as those portions of the Cross-Border
Proposing Release that referenced the proposed rules governing business conduct
standards for security-based swap dealers. Although none of the comment letters
specifically addressed the Commission’s estimates for the proposed collection of
information requirements, the views of commenters relevant to the Commission’s
1494

44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

506

analysis of burdens, costs, and benefits of the proposed rules are discussed in Section
IV.C, below.
The Commission continues to believe that the methodology used for calculating
the burdens set forth in the Proposing Release is appropriate. However, where noted,
certain estimates have been modified, as necessary, to conform to the adopted rules and
to reflect the most recent data available to the Commission. Other than these changes,
the Commission’s estimates remain unchanged from those in the Proposing Release.
As a part of this release, the Commission also is adopting Rule 3a67-10(d) and
Rule 3a71-3(c), which among other things, provide an exception to certain of the
business conduct standards described in section 15F(h) of the Act, and the rules and
regulations thereunder, to registered Major SBS Participants and registered SBS Dealers
in certain transactions conducted through the foreign branch of their U.S.-person
counterparty. As part of the process of availing themselves of this exception, registered
Major SBS Participants (in the case of Rule 3a67-10(d)) and registered SBS Dealers (in
the case of Rule 3a71-3(c)) would be permitted to rely on certain representations
provided to them by their counterparties regarding whether a transaction is conducted
through a foreign branch. The requirements regarding those representations are
contained in Rule 3a71-3(a)(3)(ii). The Commission previously published a notice
requesting comment on the collection of information requirements in Rule 3a71-3 as part
of the Cross-Border Proposing Release, and submitted those proposed collection of
information requirements to OMB for review in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507 and 5
CFR 1320.11. The title of the collection of information related to the representation in

507

Rule 3a71-3 is “Reliance on Counterparty Representations Regarding Activity Within the
United States.” OMB has not yet assigned a control number to this collection.
The Commission also is adopting Rule 3a71-6 to provide for substituted
compliance in connection with the business conduct requirements. As proposed, the title
of the information collection associated with that rule was “Rule 3a71-5 Substituted
Compliance for Foreign Security-Based Swap Dealers.” 1495 The OMB assigned control
number 3235-0715 to the new collection of information. In the Cross-Border Proposing
Release, the Commission solicited comment on the collection of information
requirements associated with the substituted compliance rule and on the accuracy of the
Commission’s related statements. The Commission received no comments on those
proposed information collection requirements.
A.

Summary of Collections of Information
1.

Definitions

Rule 15Fh-2(d) defines a “special entity” as: (1) a Federal agency; (2) a State,
State agency, city, county, municipality, other political subdivision of a State, or any
instrumentality, department, or a corporation of or established by a State or political
subdivision of a State; (3) any employee benefit plan subject to Title I of ERISA; (4) any
employee benefit plan defined in Section 3 of ERISA, not otherwise defined as a special
entity, unless such employee benefit plan elects not to be a special entity by notifying an
SBS dealer or Major SBS Participant of its election prior to entering into a security-based

1495

Consistent with the renumbering of the rule and the potential availability of
substituted compliance to Major SBS Participants, the revised title of the
collection of information is “Rule 3a71-6 Substituted Compliance for Foreign
Security-Based Swap Entities.”

508

swap; (5) any governmental plan, as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA; or (6) any
endowment, including organizations described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code.
The proposed rule included employee benefit plans “defined in” ERISA within
the special entity definition. The final rule similarly includes employee benefit plans
“defined in” ERISA that are not otherwise “subject to” ERISA within the special entity
definition, although it provides such benefit plans with the ability to opt out of special
entity status.
2.

Verification of Status

Rule 15Fh-3(a)(1) requires an SBS Entity to verify that a counterparty meets the
eligibility standards for ECP status before entering into a security-based swap with that
counterparty other than with respect to a transaction executed on a registered national
securities exchange.
Rule 15Fh-3(a)(2) requires an SBS Entity to verify whether a counterparty is a
special entity before entering into a security-based swap transaction with that
counterparty, unless the transaction is executed on a registered or exempt SEF or
registered national securities exchange, and the SBS Entity does not know the identity of
the counterparty at a reasonably sufficient time prior to the transaction to permit the SBS
Entity to comply with the obligations of the rule.
Rule 15Fh-3(a)(3) requires an SBS Entity, in verifying the special entity status of
a counterparty pursuant to Rule 15Fh-3(a)(2), to verify whether a counterparty is eligible
to elect not to be a special entity as provided for in the adopted special entity definition in
Rule 15Fh-2(d)(4), and if so, to notify such counterparty of its right to make such an

509

election. An SBS Entity may satisfy these verification requirements through any
reasonable means including, among other things, by obtaining written representations
from the counterparty as to specific facts about the counterparty. 1496
3.

Disclosures by SBS Entities

Rule 15Fh-3(b) generally requires an SBS Entity at a reasonably sufficient time
prior to entering into a security-based swap to disclose to a counterparty (other than an
SBS Entity or Swap Entity) material information concerning the security-based swap in a
manner reasonably designed to allow the counterparty to assess: (1) the material risks and
characteristics of a particular security-based swap; and (2) any material incentives or
conflicts of interest that the SBS Entity may have in connection with the security-based
swap. These disclosure requirements do not apply unless the identity of the counterparty
is known to the SBS Entity at a reasonably sufficient time prior to execution of the
transaction to permit the SBS Entity to comply with the obligations of the rule. The rule
also requires the SBS Entity to make a written record of any non-written disclosures
made pursuant to this provision, and timely provide a written version of these disclosures
to counterparties no later than the delivery of the trade acknowledgement of the particular
transaction.
Rule 15Fh-3(c)(1), for cleared security-based swaps, requires an SBS Entity to,
upon request of the counterparty, disclose the daily mark to the counterparty (other than
an SBS Entity or Swap Entity). the daily mark that the SBS Entity receives from the

1496

The Commission separately has proposed rules regarding recordkeeping and
reporting requirements for SBS Entities that would require an SBS Entity to keep
records of its verification. See Recordkeeping Release, 79 FR 25193, 25208 and
25217-25218, supra note 242.

510

appropriate clearing agency. Rule 15Fh-3(c)(2), for uncleared security-based swaps,
requires an SBS Entity to disclose the daily mark to the counterparty, which is the
midpoint between the bid and offer, or the calculated equivalent thereof, as of the close of
business, unless the parties agree in writing to a different time, on each business day
during the term of the security-based swap. Rule 15Fh-3(c)(2) also requires disclosure of
the data sources and a description of the methodology and assumptions used to prepare
the daily mark for an uncleared security-based swap, as well as disclosure of any material
changes to such data sources, methodology or assumptions during the term of the
security-based swap. Rule 15Fh-3(c)(1) and (2) also require an SBS Entity to provide the
daily mark without charge to the counterparty and without restrictions on the internal use
of the daily mark by the counterparty.
Rule 15Fh-3(d) requires an SBS Entity to disclose information regarding clearing
rights to its counterparties(other than an SBS Entity or Swap Entity), so long as the
identity of the counterparty is known to the SBS Entity at a reasonably sufficient time
prior to execution of the transaction to permit the SBS Entity to comply with the
obligations of the rule. Pursuant to the rule, before entering into a security-based swap
that is subject to the clearing requirements of Section 3C(a) of the Exchange Act, the SBS
Entity shall disclose to the counterparty the names of the clearing agencies that accept the
security-based swap for clearing, and through which of those clearing agencies the SBS
Entity is authorized or permitted, directly or through a designated clearing member, to
clear the security-based swap; disclose to the counterparty whether any of the named
clearing agencies satisfy the standard for clearing under Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange
Act; and notify the counterparty that it shall have the sole right to select which clearing

511

agency shall be used to clear the security-based swap. For security-based swaps, not
subject to the clearing requirements of Section 3C(a) of the Exchange Act, before
entering into a security-based swap, the SBS Entity shall determine whether the securitybased swap is accepted for clearing by one or more clearing agencies; disclose to the
counterparty the names of the clearing agencies that accept the security-based swap for
clearing, and whether the SBS Entity is authorized or permitted, directly or through a
designated clearing member, to clear the security-based swap through such clearing
agencies; and notify the counterparty that it may elect to require clearing of the securitybased swap and shall have the sole right to select the clearing agency at which the
security-based swap will be cleared, provided it is a clearing agency at which the SBS
Entity is authorized or permitted, directly or through a designated clearing member, to
clear the security-based swap. To the extent that the disclosures required by Rule 15Fh3(d) are not provided in writing prior to the execution of the transaction, the SBS Entity
is required to make a written record of the non-written disclosures and provide the
counterparty with a written version of these disclosure no later than the delivery of the
trade acknowledgement for the transaction.
4.

Know Your Counterparty and Recommendations

Rule 15Fh-3(e) requires an SBS Dealer to establish, maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to obtain and retain a record of the essential
facts concerning each counterparty whose identity is known to the SBS Dealer that are
necessary for conducting business with such counterparty. The essential facts are: (1)
facts required to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules; (2) facts required to
implement the SBS Dealer’s credit and operational risk management policies in

512

connection with transactions entered into with such counterparty; and (3) information
regarding the authority of any person acting for such counterparty.
Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1) requires an SBS Dealer recommending a security-based swap
or trading strategy involving a security-based swap to a counterparty (other than an SBS
Entity or a Swap Entity) to: (i) undertake reasonable diligence to understand the potential
risks and rewards associated with the recommendation; and (ii) have a reasonable basis to
believe that the recommendation is suitable for the counterparty. To establish a
reasonable basis for a recommendation, an SBS Dealer must have or obtain relevant
information regarding the counterparty, including the counterparty’s investment profile,
trading objectives, and its ability to absorb potential losses associated with the
recommended security-based swap or trading strategy involving a security-based swap.
Under Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2), an SBS Dealer may also fulfill its suitability obligations
under Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(ii) with respect to an institutional counterparty (defined as a
counterparty that is an eligible contract participant as defined in clauses (A)(i), (ii), (iii),
(iv), (viii), (ix) or (x), or clause (B)(ii) (other than a person described in clause (A)(v)) of
Section 1a(18) of the Commodity Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder,
or any person (whether a natural person, corporation, partnership, trust or otherwise) with
total assets of at least $50 million) if: (i) the SBS Dealer reasonably determines that the
counterparty (or its agent) is capable of independently evaluating the investment risks
with regard to the relevant security-based swap or trading strategy involving a securitybased swap; (ii) the counterparty (or its agent) affirmatively represents in writing that it is
exercising its independent judgment in evaluating the recommendations of the SBS
Dealer with regard to the relevant security-based swap or trading strategy; and (iii) the

513

SBS Dealer discloses to the counterparty that it is acting in its capacity as a counterparty
and is not undertaking to assess the suitability of the security-based swap or trading
strategy for the counterparty. Under Rule 15Fh-3(f)(3), an SBS Dealer will be deemed to
have satisfied the requirements of Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2)(i) if it receives written
representations, as provided in Rule 15Fh-1(b), that: (i) in the case of a counterparty that
is not a special entity, the counterparty has complied in good faith with written policies
and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the persons responsible for
evaluating the recommendation and making trading decisions on behalf of the
counterparty are capable of doing so; and (ii) in the case of a counterparty that is a special
entity, satisfy the terms of the safe harbor in Rule 15Fh-5(b).
5.

Fair and Balanced Communications

Rule 15Fh-3(g) requires an SBS Entity to communicate with its counterparties in
a fair and balanced manner based on principles of fair dealing and good faith. The rule
requires that: (1) communications provide a sound basis for evaluating the facts with
regard to a particular security-based swap or trading strategy involving a security-based
swap; (2) communications not imply that past performance will recur or make any
exaggerated or unwarranted claim, opinion, or forecast; and (3) any statement referring to
potential opportunities or advantages presented by a particular security-based swap be
balanced by an equally detailed statement of the corresponding risks.
6.

Supervision

Rule 15Fh-3(h) requires an SBS Entity to establish and maintain a system to
supervise, and to diligently supervise, its business and the activities of its associated
persons. Such a system shall be reasonably designed to prevent violations of the

514

provisions of applicable federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder
relating to its business as an SBS Entity. At a minimum, the supervisory system must: (i)
designate at least one person with authority to carry out supervisory responsibilities for
each type of business in which the SBS Entity engages for which registration as an SBS
Entity is required; (ii) use reasonable efforts to determine all such supervisors are
qualified, either by virtue of experience or training, to carry out their assigned
responsibilities; and (iii) establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
addressing the supervision of the types of security-based swap business in which the SBS
Entity is engaged and the activities of it associated persons that are reasonably designed
to prevent violations of applicable securities laws and rules and regulations thereunder.
Such written policies and procedures must include, at a minimum, procedures: (a)
for the review by a supervisor of transactions for which registration as an SBS Entity is
required; (b) for the review by a supervisor of incoming and outgoing written (including
electronic) correspondence with counterparties or potential counterparties and internal
written communications relating to the SBS Entity’s security-based swap business; (c) for
a periodic review, at least annually, of the security-based swap business in which the SBS
Entity engages that is reasonably designed to assist in detecting and preventing violations
of applicable federal securities laws and regulations; (d) to conduct a reasonable
investigation regarding the good character, business repute, qualifications, and experience
of any person prior to that person’s association with the SBS Entity; (e) to consider
whether to permit an associated person to establish or maintain a securities or
commodities account or a trading relationship in the name of, or for the benefit of, such
associated person at another financial institution, and if permitted, to supervise the

515

trading at such institution; (f) describing the supervisory system, including the titles,
qualifications and locations of supervisory persons and the responsibilities of each
supervisory person with respect to the types of business in which the SBS Entity is
engaged; (g) prohibiting an associated person who performs a supervisory function from
supervising his or her own activities or reporting to, or having his or her compensation or
continued employment determined by, a person or persons he or she is supervising;
provided that if the SBS Entity determines, with respect to any of its supervisory
personnel, that compliance with this requirement is not possible because of the firm’s size
or a supervisory person’s position within the firm, then the SBS Entity must document
the factors used to reach such determination and how the supervisory arrangement
otherwise complies with this rule, and include a summary of such determination in the
annual compliance report prepared by the SBS Entity’s CCO pursuant to Rule 15Fk-1(c);
(h) reasonably designed to prevent the supervisory system from being compromised due
to conflicts of interest that may be present with respect to the associated person being
supervised, including the position of such person, the revenue such person generates for
the SBS Entity, or any compensation that the associated person conducting the
supervision may derive from the associated person being supervised; and (i) reasonably
designed, taking into consideration the nature of the SBS Entity’s business, to comply
with the duties set forth in Section 15F(j) of the Exchange Act.
Rule 15Fh-3(h)(3) provides that an SBS Entity (or associated person of an SBS
Entity) will not be deemed to have failed to diligently supervise another person if that
person is not subject to his or her supervision, or if: (i) the SBS Entity has established and
maintained written policies and procedures (as required in Rule15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii)), and a

516

documented system for applying those policies and procedures that would reasonably be
expected to prevent and detect, insofar as practicable, any violation of the federal
securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder relating to security-based swaps;
and (ii) the SBS Entity or associated person has reasonably discharged the duties and
obligations required by such written policies and procedures and documented system and
did not have a reasonable basis to believe that such written policies and procedures and
documented system were not being followed.
Rule 15Fh-3(h)(4) provides that an SBS Entity must also promptly amend its
written supervisory procedures as appropriate when material changes occur in applicable
securities laws, rules, or regulations thereunder, as well as when material changes occur
in its business or supervisory system, and promptly communicate any material
amendments to its supervisory procedures to all associated person to whom such
amendments are relevant based on their activities and responsibilities.
7.

SBS Dealers Acting as Advisors to Special Entities

Rule 15Fh-4(b)(1) imposes the duty on an SBS Dealer that acts as an advisor to a
special entity regarding a security-based swap to make a reasonable determination that
any security-based swap or trading strategy involving a security-based swap
recommended by the SBS Dealer is in the best interests of the special entity. Paragraph
(b)(2) also requires an SBS Dealer acting as an advisor to a special entity to make
reasonable efforts to obtain such information as it considers necessary to make a
reasonable determination that a security-based swap or related trading strategy is in the
best interests of the special entity. The information that must be obtained to make this
reasonable determination includes, but is not limited to: (i) the authority of the special

517

entity to enter into a security-based swap; (ii) the financial status and future funding
needs of the special entity; (iii) the tax status of the special entity; (iv) the hedging,
investment, financing or other objectives of the special entity; (v) the experience of the
special entity with respect to security-based swaps, generally, and security-based swaps
of the type and complexity being recommended; (vi) whether the special entity has the
financial capability to withstand changes in market conditions during the term of the
security-based swap; and (vii) such other information as is relevant to the particular facts
and circumstances of the special entity, market conditions and the type of security-based
swap or trading strategy being recommended. However, the requirements of Rule 15Fh4(b) do not apply to a security-based swap if: (i) the transaction is executed on a
registered or exempt SEF or a registered national securities exchange; and (ii) the SBS
Dealer does not know the identity of the counterparty at a reasonably sufficient time prior
to execution of the transaction to permit the SBS Dealer to comply with the obligations of
this rule.
Rule 15Fh-2(a) generally provides that an SBS Dealer acts as an advisor to a
special entity when it recommends a security-based swap or security-based swap trading
strategy to that special entity. Rule 15Fh-2(a)(1) provides a safe harbor under which an
SBS Dealer will not be deemed to act as an advisor to a special entity that is subject to
Title I of ERISA if: (i) the special entity represents in writing that it has a fiduciary as
defined in Section 3 of ERISA that is responsible for representing the special entity in
connection with the security-based swap; (ii) the fiduciary represents in writing that it
acknowledges that the SBS Dealer is not acting as an advisor; and (iii) the special entity
represents in writing that (a) it will comply in good faith with written policies and

518

procedures reasonably designed to ensure that any recommendation the special entity
receives from the SBS Dealer involving a security-based swap transaction is evaluated by
a fiduciary before it is entered into; or (b) that any recommendation the special entity
receives from the SBS Dealer involving a security-based swap transaction will be
evaluated by a fiduciary before the transaction is entered into. 1497
Rule 15Fh-2(a)(2) provides a safe harbor for transactions between an SBS Dealer
and any special entity. Under this rule, an SBS Dealer that recommends a security-based
swap or security-based swap trading strategy to any special entity (other than a special
entity subject to Title I of ERISA) will not be deemed to act as an advisor to that special
entity if the special entity represents in writing that it acknowledges that the SBS Dealer
is not acting as an advisor, and that it will rely on advice from a qualified independent
representative, as defined in Rule 15Fh-5(a). The SBS Dealer must also disclose to the
special entity that it is not undertaking to act in the best interests of the special entity, as
otherwise required by Section 15F(h)(4) of the Exchange Act. 1498
8.

SBS Entities Acting as Counterparties to Special Entities

Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1) requires an SBS Entity that offers to enter into or enters into a
security-based swap with a special entity (other than a special entity that is an employee
benefit plan subject to Title I of ERISA), to have a reasonable basis to believe that the
special entity has a qualified independent representative that meets certain specified
qualifications. For purposes of Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1), a qualified independent representative
must: (i) have sufficient knowledge to evaluate the transaction and related risks; (ii) not
1497

Rule 15Fh-2(a)(1)

1498

Rule 15Fh-2(a)(2)

519

be subject to a statutory disqualification; (iii) undertake a duty to act in the best interests
of the special entity; (iv) make appropriate and timely disclosures to the special entity of
material information concerning the security-based swap; (iv) evaluate, consistent with
any guidelines provided by the special entity, the fair pricing and appropriateness of the
security-based swap; (v) in the case of a special entity defined in Rule 15Fh-2(d)(2) or
(5), be subject to the pay-to-play prohibitions of the Commission, the CFTC, or a selfregulatory organization that is subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission or the CFTC
(unless the independent representative is an employee of the special entity); and (vii) be
independent of the SBS Entity that is the counterparty to a proposed security-based
swap. 1499
Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1) also provides that a representative of a special entity will be
“independent” of an SBS Entity if the representative does not have a relationship with the
SBS Entity, whether compensatory or otherwise, that reasonably could affect the
independent judgment or decision-making of the representative. 1500 In addition, a special
entity’s representative will be deemed to be “independent” of an SBS Entity if: (1) the
representative is not and was not an associated person of the SBS Entity within one year
of representing the special entity in connection with the security-based swap; (2) the
representative provides timely disclosures to the special entity of all material conflicts of
interest that could reasonably affect the judgment or decision making of the
representative with respect to its obligations to the special entity, and complies with
policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage and mitigate such material
1499

Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vii)

1500

Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vii)(A)

520

conflicts of interest; and (3) the SBS Entity did not refer, recommend, or introduce the
representative to the special entity within one year of the representative’s representation
of the special entity in connection with the security-based swap. 1501
Rule 15Fh-5(a)(2) provides that an SBS Entity that offers to enter into or enters
into a security-based swap with a special entity as defined in Rule 15Fh-2(d)(3) (any
employee benefit plan that subject to Title I of ERISA) must have a reasonable basis to
believe the special entity has a representative that is a fiduciary as defined in Section 3 of
ERISA.
Rule 15Fh-5(b) provides safe harbors for SBS Dealers seeking to form a
reasonable basis regarding the qualifications of the independent representative. Under
Rule 15Fh-5(b)(1), an SBS Entity shall be deemed to have a reasonable basis to believe
that a special entity (other than an ERISA special entity) has a representative that satisfies
the requirements of Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1) if: (i) the special entity represents in writing to the
SBS Entity that it has complied in good faith with written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to ensure that it has selected a representative that satisfies the
requirements of Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1), and that such policies and procedures provide for
ongoing monitoring of the performance of such representative consistent with Rule 15Fh5(a)(1); and (ii) the representative represents in writing to the special entity and the SBS
Entity that the representative: (a) has policies and procedures reasonably designed to
ensure that it satisfies the applicable requirements of Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1); (b) meets the
independence requirements of Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vii); and (c) is legally obligated to

1501

Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vii)(B)

521

comply with the requirements of Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1) by agreement, condition of
employment, law, rule, regulation, or other enforceable duty.
Under Rule 15Fh-5(b)(2), an SBS Entity shall be deemed to have a reasonable
basis to believe that an ERISA special entity has a representative that satisfies the
requirements of Rule 15Fh-5(a)(2), provided that the special entity provides in writing to
the SBS Entity the representative’s name and contact information, and represents in
writing that the representative is a fiduciary as defined in Section 3 of ERISA.
Under Rule 15Fh-5(c), before initiation of a security-based swap, an SBS Dealer
must disclose to the special entity in writing the capacity in which the SBS Dealer is
acting in connection with the security-based swap, and, if the SBS Dealer engages in
business with the counterparty in more than one capacity, the SBS Dealer must disclose
the material differences between such capacities and any other financial transaction or
service involving the counterparty to the special entity.
Under Rule 15Fh-5(d), formerly Rule 15Fh-5(c), the provisions of Rule 15Fh-5
do not apply when two conditions are satisfied: (1) the transaction is executed on an
registered or exempt SEF or registered national securities exchange; and (2) the SBS
Entity is unaware of the counterparty’s identity, at a reasonably sufficient time prior to
the execution of the transaction to permit the SBS Entity to comply with the obligations
of the rule.
9.

Political Contributions

Rule 15Fh-6(b) prohibits an SBS Dealer from offering to enter into, or entering
into a security-based swap, or a trading strategy involving a security-based swap, with a
municipal entity within two years after any contribution by the SBS Dealer or its covered

522

associates to an official of such municipal entity, subject to certain exceptions. These
prohibitions do not apply to certain contributions made by an SBS Dealer’s covered
associate if the SBS Dealer discovered the contribution within 120 calendar days of the
date of such contribution, the contribution did not exceed $350, and the covered associate
obtained a return of the contribution within 60 calendar days of the date of discovery of
the contribution by the SBS Dealer. However, a SBS dealer may not rely on that
provision more than three times in any 12-month period if it has more than 50 covered
associated, and no more than twice if it has 50 or fewer covered associates. The
Commission may also, upon application, exempt a security-based swap dealer from the
prohibitions of the rule after consideration of several factors.
The provisions of Rule 15Fh-6 do not apply when two conditions are satisfied: (1)
the transaction is executed on an registered or exempt SEF or registered national
securities exchange; and (2) the SBS Dealer is unaware of the counterparty’s identity, at a
reasonably sufficient time prior to the execution of the transaction to permit the SBS
Dealer to comply with the obligations of the rule.
10.

Chief Compliance Officer

Rule 15Fk-1 requires an SBS Entity to designate an individual to serve as CCO on
its registration form. Under Rule 15Fk-1(b)(1) the CCO must report directly to the board
of directors or senior officer of the SBS Entity. Under Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2), the CCO must
take reasonable steps to ensure that the SBS Entity establishes, maintains, and reviews
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder relating to its business as an SBS
Entity by: (1) reviewing the SBS Entity’s compliance with the SBS Entity requirements

523

described in Section 15F of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
(where such review shall involve preparing the SBS Entity’s annual assessment of its
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Section
15F of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder); (2) taking reasonable
steps to ensure the SBS Entity establishes, maintains, and reviews policies and
procedures reasonably designed to remediate non-compliance issues identified by the
CCO through any means, including any compliance office review, look-back, internal or
external audit finding, self-reporting to the Commission and other appropriate authorities,
or complaint that can be validated; and (3) taking reasonable steps to ensure that the SBS
Entity establishes and follows procedures reasonably designed for the handling,
management response, remediation, retesting, and resolution of non-compliance issues.
Under Rule 15Fk-1(b)(3), the CCO must take reasonable steps to resolve any material
conflicts of interest that may arise, in consultation with the board or the senior officer of
the SBS Entity. Under Rule 15Fk-1(b)(4), the CCO must administer each policy and
procedure that is required to be established pursuant to Section 15F of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Under Rule 15Fk-1(c), the CCO must also prepare and sign an annual compliance
report that must be submitted to the Commission within 30 days following the deadline
for filing the SBS Entity’s annual financial report with the Commission pursuant to
Section 15F of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. This annual
compliance report must contain a description of the written policies and procedures of the
SBS Entity described in Rule 15Fk-1(b), outlined above, including the code of ethics and
conflict of interest policies. The compliance report must also include, at a minimum, a

524

description of: (1) the SBS Entity’s assessment of the effectiveness of its policies and
procedures relating to its business as an SBS Entity; (2) any material changes to the
policies and procedures since the date of the preceding compliance report; (3) any areas
for improvement and recommended potential or prospective changes or improvements to
its compliance program and resources devoted to compliance; (4) any material noncompliance matters identified; and (5) the financial, managerial, operational, and staffing
resources set aside for compliance with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder relating to its business as an SBS Entity, including any material deficiencies in
such resources. The report must be submitted to the board of directors and audit
committee (or equivalent bodies) and the senior officer of the SBS Entity prior to
submission to the Commission. The report also must be discussed in one or more
meetings (addressing the obligations of this rule) that were conducted by the senior
officer with the CCO in the preceding 12 months, and must include a certification by the
CCO or senior officer that, to the best of his or her knowledge and reasonable belief and
under penalty of law, the information contained in the compliance report is accurate and
complete in all material respects.
The final rule allows an SBS Entity to incorporate by reference sections of a
compliance report that has been submitted with the current or immediately preceding
reporting period to the Commission, and allows an SBS Entity to request from the
Commission an extension of time to submit its compliance report, provided that the SBS
Entity’s failure to timely submit the report could not be eliminated by the SBS Entity
without unreasonable effort or expense. Extensions of the deadline will be granted at the
discretion of the Commission. The final rule also requires an SBS Entity to promptly

525

submit an amended compliance report if material errors or omissions in the report are
identified.
Under Rule 15k-1(d), the compensation and removal of the CCO shall require the
approval of a majority of the board of directors of the SBS Entity.
11.

Foreign Branch Exception

Rule 3a67-10(d), as adopted, provides that registered major security-based swap
participants shall not be subject to business conduct standards described in section 15F(h)
of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o–10(h)), and the rules and regulations thereunder, other than
rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 15F(h)(1)(B) of
the Act, in certain transactions conducted through the foreign branch of their U.S.-person
counterparty. Rule 3a71-3(c), as adopted, provides a similar exception for registered
security-based swap dealers. The previously adopted definition of “transaction
conducted through a foreign branch” permits a person to rely on its U.S. bank
counterparty’s representation that the transaction “was arranged, negotiated, and executed
on behalf of the foreign branch solely by persons located outside the United States, unless
such person knows or has reason to know that the representation is not accurate.” 1502
12.

Substituted Compliance Rule

Rule 3a71-6, as adopted, provides that the Commission may, conditionally or
unconditionally, by order, make a determination with respect to a foreign financial
regulatory system that compliance with specified requirements under such foreign
financial regulatory system by a registered non-U.S. SBS Entity, or class thereof, may
satisfy certain business conduct requirements by complying with the comparable foreign
1502

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(3)(ii).

526

requirements. The availability of substituted compliance would be predicated on a
determination by the Commission that the relevant foreign requirements are comparable
to the requirements that otherwise would be applicable, taking into account the scope and
objectives of the relevant foreign requirements, 1503 and the effectiveness of supervision
and enforcement under the foreign regulatory regime. 1504 The availability of substituted
compliance further would be predicated on there being a supervisory and enforcement
MOU or other arrangement between the Commission and the relevant foreign authority
addressing supervisory and enforcement cooperation and other matters arising under the
substituted compliance determination. 1505
Requests for substituted compliance may come from parties or groups of parties
that may rely on substituted compliance, or from foreign financial authorities supervising
such parties or their security-based swap activities. 1506 Under the final rule, the
Commission would make any determinations with regard to the applicable business
conduct requirements, rather than on a firm-by-firm basis. Once the Commission has
made a substituted compliance determination, other similarly situated market participants
1503

In the specific context of substituted compliance for the business conduct
requirements, prior to making any comparability determination the Commission
intends to consider whether the information that is required to be provided to
counterparties pursuant to the requirements of the foreign jurisdiction, the
counterparty protections under the requirements of the foreign jurisdiction, the
mandates for supervisory systems under the requirements of the foreign
jurisdiction, and the CCO requirements under the foreign jurisdiction are
comparable with the applicable Exchange Act provisions. See Exchange Act
Rule 3a71-6(d).

1504

See Exchange Act Rule 3a71-6(a)(2)(i).

1505

See Exchange Act Rule 3a71-6(a)(2)(ii).

1506

See Exchange Act Rule 3a71-6(c)(1). Such parties or groups of parties may make
requests only if each such party or its activities is directly supervised by the
foreign financial authority. See Exchange Act Rule 3a71-6(c)(2).

527

would be able to rely on that determination to the extent applicable and subject to any
corresponding conditions. Accordingly, the Commission expects that requests for a
substituted compliance determination would be made only where an entity seeks to rely
on particular requirements of a foreign jurisdiction that has not previously been the
subject of a substituted compliance request. The Commission believes that this approach
would substantially reduce the burden associated with requesting substituted compliance
determinations for an entity that relies on a previously issued determination, and,
therefore, complying with the Commission’s rules and regulations more generally.
As provided by Exchange Act Rule 0-13, which the Commission adopted in 2014,
applications for substituted compliance determinations in connection with these
requirements must be accompanied by supporting documentation necessary for the
Commission to make the determination, including information regarding applicable
requirements established by the foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities, as
well as the methods used by the foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities to
monitor and enforce compliance with such rules, and to cite to and discuss applicable
precedent. 1507
B.
1507

Use of Information

See Exchange Act Rule 0-13(e). Rule 0-13 also specifies other prerequisites for
the filing of substituted compliance applications (e.g., requirements regarding the
use of English, the use of electronic or paper requests, contact information, and
public notice and comment in connection with complete applications).
In adopting Rule 0-13, the Commission also noted that because Rule 0-13 was a
procedural rule that did not provide any substituted compliance rights,
“collections of information arising from substituted compliance requests,
including associated control numbers, [would] be addressed in connection with
any applicable substantive rulemakings that provide for substituted compliance.”
See SBS Entity Definitions Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47366 n.778, supra note
1451.

528

1.

Verification of Status

Rule 15Fh-3(a) requires an SBS Entity to verify that a counterparty meets the
eligibility standards for ECP status before offering to enter into or entering into a
security-based swap other than with respect to a transaction executed on a registered
national securities exchange. The SBS Entity will use this information to comply with
Section 6(l) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78(f)(l)), which prohibits a person from
entering into a security-based swap with a counterparty that is not an ECP other than on a
registered national securities exchange. The rule also requires the SBS Entity to verify,
for non-anonymous transactions, whether a counterparty is a special entity before
entering into a security-based swap transaction with that counterparty, unless the
transaction is executed on a registered or exempt security-based swap execution facility
or registered national securities exchange. The SBS Entity will use this information to
assess its need to comply with the requirements applicable to dealings with special
entities under Rules 15Fh-4(b) and 15Fh-5. In addition, the Commission staff may
review this information in connection with examinations and investigations.
2.

Disclosures by SBS Entities

The disclosures that SBS Entities must provide to a counterparty (other than an
SBS Entity or a Swap Entity) will help the counterparty understand the material risks and
characteristics of a particular security-based swap, as well as the material incentives or
conflicts of interest that the SBS Entity may have in connection with the security-based
swap. As a result, these disclosures will assist the counterparty in assessing the
transaction by providing them with a better understanding of the expected performance of
the security-based swap under various market conditions. The disclosures will also give

529

counterparties additional transparency and insight into the pricing and collateral
requirements of security-based swaps.
Rule 15Fh-3(d) requires SBS Entities, before entering into a security-based swap
with a counterparty (other than an SBS Entity or Swap Entity), to determine whether the
security-based swap is subject to the clearing requirements of Section 3C(a) of the
Exchange Act and to disclose its determination to counterparties, along with certain
information regarding the clearing alternatives available to them. In addition to assisting
the SBS Entity and its CCO in supervising and assessing internal compliance with the
statute and rules, the Commission staff may also review this information in connection
with examinations and investigations.
3.

Know Your Counterparty and Recommendations

These collections of information will help SBS Dealers comply with applicable
laws, regulations and rules, as well as assist SBS Dealers in effectively dealing with
counterparties. For example, these collections of information may better enable SBS
Dealers to make appropriate recommendations for counterparties, and to gather from the
counterparty any information that the SBS Dealer needs for credit and risk management
purposes. Furthermore, these collections of information will assist SBS Dealers in
determining whether it is reasonable to rely on various representations from a
counterparty, and in evaluating the risks of trading with that counterparty. The
information will also assist a CCO in determining whether the SBS Entity has written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to obtain and retain a record of the essential
facts concerning each known counterparty, and to make suitable recommendations to its

530

counterparties. The Commission staff may also review this information in connection
with examinations and investigations.
4.

Fair and Balanced Communications

The collection of information concerning the risks of a security-based swap will
assist an SBS Entity in communicating with counterparties in a fair and balanced manner
by requiring, among other things, that communications provide a sound basis for
evaluating the facts with regard to a particular security-based swap and, if a statement
refers to potential opportunities or advantages presented by a particular security-based
swap, that statement must be balanced by an equally detailed statement of corresponding
risks. It will also help the CCO in ensuring that the SBS Entity is communicating with
counterparties in a fair and balanced manner based on principles of fair dealing and good
faith by establishing certain express requirements with which these communications must
comply. Acting on the basis of fair and balanced information, the counterparty will also
be better equipped to make more informed investment decisions. The Commission staff
may also review this information in connection with examinations and investigations.
5.

Supervision

The requirement to establish and maintain a reasonably designed system to
supervise, and to diligently supervise, the business and the activities of associated persons
will assist an SBS Entity in preventing violations of the applicable securities laws, rules
and regulations related to the business of an SBS Entity. The CCO may use this
information in discharging his or her duties under Rule 15Fk-1 and in determining
whether remediation efforts are required. The collection of information will also be
useful to supervisors in understanding and carrying out their supervisory responsibilities.

531

The Commission staff may also review this information in connection with examinations
and investigations.
6.

SBS Dealers Acting as Advisors to Special Entities

Certain information collected under Rule 15Fh-4(b) will help SBS Dealers that
act as advisors to special entities to make a reasonable determination that they are acting
in the best interests of those special entities.
Other information collected under Rule 15Fh-2(a) will help SBS Dealers establish
that they are not acting as advisors to special entities.
These collections of information will also assist CCOs in determining whether an
SBS Dealer has complied with relevant provisions of the Exchange Act, as well as the
rules and regulations thereunder. The Commission staff may also review this information
in connection with examinations and investigations.
7.

SBS Entities Acting as Counterparties to Special Entities

The information collected under Rule 15Fh-5(a) will assist an SBS Entity in
forming a reasonable basis to believe that a special entity has a qualified independent
representative that meets the requirements of the rule.
The written representations required under Rule 15Fh-5(b) will assist in, and
provide a safe harbor for, an SBS Entity forming a reasonable basis as to the
qualifications of the independent representative, including representations that: (i) the
special entity has complied in good faith with written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to ensure its representative satisfies the requirements of Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1), and
that such policies and procedures provide for ongoing monitoring of the performance of
such representative consistent with Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1); and that (ii) the representative has

532

policies and procedures designed to ensure that it satisfies the requirements of Rule 15Fh5(a)(1); meets the requirements of Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(i), (ii), (iii), (vi) and (vii); and is
legally obligated to comply with the requirements of Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1) by agreement,
condition of employment, law, rule, regulation, or other enforceable duty.
Disclosures under Rule 15Fh-5(c) regarding the capacity in which an SBS Dealer
is acting in connection with a security-based swap will provide additional transparency to
special entities as to any material differences between the SBS Dealer’s capacities and
any other financial transaction or service involving the counterparty to the special entity,
such as when an SBS Dealer is acting as a counterparty or principal on the other side of a
transaction with potentially adverse interests.
These collections of information will also assist a CCO in assessing the SBS
Entity’s compliance with relevant provisions of the Exchange Act. The Commission
staff may also review this information in connection with examinations and
investigations.
8.

Political Contributions

Rule 15Fh-6 will deter SBS Dealers from participating, even indirectly, in pay to
play practices. In addition to assisting the SBS Dealer and its CCO in supervising and
assessing internal compliance with the pay to play prohibitions, the Commission staff
may also review this information in connection with examinations and investigations.
9.

Chief Compliance Officer

The information collected under Rule 15Fk-1 will assist the CCO in overseeing
and administering an SBS Entity’s compliance with the provisions of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder relating to its business as an SBS Entity. The

533

Commission staff may also review this information in connection with examinations and
investigations.
10.

Foreign Branch Exception

Under the final rules, a registered major security-based swap participant or
registered security-based swap dealer is not subject to the requirements relating to
business conduct standards described in section 15F(h) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)),
and the rules and regulations thereunder, other than the rules and regulations prescribed
by the Commission pursuant to section 15F(h)(1)(B) of the Act, in certain transactions
conducted through the foreign branch of their U.S.-person counterparty. For these
purposes, the foreign branch of a U.S. bank must be the counterparty to the securitybased swap transaction, and the transaction must be arranged, negotiated, and executed
on behalf of the foreign branch solely by persons located outside the United States. 1508
As discussed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission
acknowledges that verifying whether a security-based swap transaction falls within the
definition of “transaction conducted through a foreign branch” could require significant
due diligence. The definition’s representation provision would mitigate the operational
difficulties and costs that otherwise could arise in connection with investigating the
activities of a counterparty to ensure compliance with the corresponding rules. 1509
11.

Substituted Compliance Rule

The Commission would use the information collected pursuant to Exchange Act
Rule 3a71–6, as adopted, to evaluate requests for substituted compliance with respect to
1508

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(3)(i).

1509

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31107, supra note 6.

534

the business conduct requirements applicable to security-based swap entities. The
requests for substituted compliance determinations are required when a person seeks a
substituted compliance determination.
Consistent with Exchange Act Rule 0-13(h), the Commission will publish in the
Federal Register a notice that a complete application has been submitted, and provide the
public the opportunity to submit to the Commission any information that relates to the
Commission action requested in the application.
C.

Respondents

In the Proposing Release, the Commission stated its belief that approximately
fifty entities may fit within the definition of SBS Dealer and that up to five entities may
fit within the definition of Major SBS Participant. 1510 Further, the Commission
understands swap and security-based swap markets to be integrated, and continues to
estimate that approximately thirty-five firms that may register as SBS Entities will also
be registered with the CFTC as Swap Entities. 1511 As a result, these entities will also be
subject to the business conduct standards applicable to Swap Entities, which the CFTC
adopted in 2012. In addition, the Commission continues to estimate that approximately
sixteen registered broker-dealers will also register as SBS Dealers. 1512 In the Proposing
Release, the Commission estimated that fewer than eight firms not otherwise registered
with the CFTC or the Commission would register as SBS Entities. Based on an analysis

535

of updated DTCC data, the Commission now estimates that four registrants would not
otherwise be registered with the CFTC or the Commission. 1513
In the Proposing Release, the Commission estimated that there were
approximately 8,500 market participants, including approximately 1,200 special entities
in the security-based swap markets. 1514 Based on an analysis of more recent DTCC data
and our understanding of security-based swap markets, we currently believe that there are
approximately 10,900 market participants in the security-based swap market, of which
1,141 are special entities. 1515 Of the 10,900 market participants, we estimate
approximately 68% of them (7,412) are also swap market participants. 1516 Based upon
the number of registered municipal advisors, we estimate that there are approximately
385 third-party independent representatives for special entities. 1517 In the Proposing

1513

See Registration Adopting Release, 80 FR at 48990, supra note 1129.

1514

Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42442, supra note 3.

1515

As discussed in the economic baseline, estimates of the number and type of
market participants are based on hand classifications of TIW data for 2006-2014.
Our classifications are not sufficiently granular to distinguish between ERISA
special entities, and special entities defined in, but not subject to ERISA, and our
estimates include both. Therefore, our estimates reflect both ERISA special
entities, and entities that may choose to opt out of the special entity status under
these final rules. See Sections VI.B and Section VI.C.4.i, infra.

1516

This estimation assumes that the proportion of single name CDS market
participants that also use index CDS is representative of the proportion of
security-based swap market participants that are swap market participants in
2014. See Section VI.B.6, infra.

As of January 1, 2016 there were 665 municipal advisors registered with the
Commission (http://www.sec.gov/help/foia-docs-muniadvisorshtm.html), of
which 381 indicated that they expect to provide advice concerning the use of
municipal derivatives or advice or recommendations concerning the selection of
other municipal advisors or underwriters with respect to municipal financial
products or the issuance of municipal securities. We expect that many of these
municipal advisors will also act as independent representatives for other special
entities. The Commission therefore estimates that approximately 385 municipal

536

Release, we estimated that approximately 95% of special entities would use a third-party
independent representative. 1518 Based on additional data from DTCC through 2014, the
Commission currently estimates that approximately 98% of special entities would use a
third-party independent representative in their security-based swap transactions. 1519 For
purposes of calculating reporting burdens, in the Proposing Release, we estimated that 60
special entities (the remaining 5% of special entities), had employees who could serve as
an in-house independent representative. 1520 The Commission currently estimates that the
remaining 2% of special entities, or 25 special entities, have employees who currently
negotiate on behalf of and advise the special entity regarding security-based swap
transactions, and who could likely fulfill the qualifications and obligations of the
independent representative. 1521 Consequently, the Commission estimates a total of 410
potential independent representatives. 1522 We received no comments on any of the
foregoing estimates or our basis for the estimates.
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission preliminarily estimated
that 50 entities may include a representation that a security-based swap is a “transaction

advisors will act as independent representatives to special entities with respect to
security-based swaps.

The estimate is based on available market data for November 2006 – December
2014 provided by DTCC that indicates approximately 98% of special entities used
registered or unregistered third-party investment advisers in connection with
security-based swaps transactions.

The estimate is based on the following calculation: 385 third-party independent

conducted through a foreign branch” in their trading relationship documentation. 1523 We
estimate that, consistent with the proposal, a total of 50 entities may incur burdens under
this collection of information, whether solely in connection with the business conduct
requirements being adopted in this release or also in connection with the application of
the de minimis exception. 1524
Under the final rule related to substituted compliance, applications for substituted
compliance may be filed by foreign financial authorities, or by non-U.S. SBS Entities.
Based on the analysis of recent data, the Commission staff expects that there may be
approximately 22 non-U.S. entities that potentially may register as SBS Dealers, out of
approximately 50 total entities that may register as SBS Dealers. 1525 Potentially, all such
non-U.S. SBS Dealers, or some subset thereof, may seek to rely on substituted
compliance in connection with these business conduct requirements. 1526
In practice, the Commission expects that the greater portion of any such
substituted compliance requests will be submitted by foreign financial authorities, given
their expertise in connection with the relevant substantive requirements, and in
connection with their supervisory and enforcement oversight with regard to securitybased swap dealers and their activities.

Consistent with prior estimates, the Commission staff further believes that there
may be zero to five major security-based swap participants. See Cross-Border
Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31103, supra note 6. It is possible that some subset
of those entities will be non-U.S. major security-based swap participants that will
seek to rely on substituted compliance in connection with the business conduct
requirements.

Total Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens

As discussed in Section I.C., above, aspects of Rules 15Fh-1 to 15Fh-6 conform,
to the extent practicable, to the business conduct standards applicable to Swap Dealers or
Major Swap Participants promulgated by the CFTC. 1527 Therefore, to the extent an SBS
Entity already complies with the CFTC’s business conduct standards, the Commission
believes there will be minimal additional burden in complying with the requirements
under the Commission’s business conduct standards, as adopted. 1528
Furthermore, a number of these rules are based on existing FINRA rules.
Accordingly, the Commission expects that the estimated 16 SBS Entities that are also
registered as broker-dealers are already complying with a number of these requirements
in the context of their equities businesses.
1.

Verification of Status

As discussed above, the Commission estimates that approximately 55 SBS
Entities (of which we expect approximately 35 will be dually registered with the CFTC as
Swap Entities) will be required to verify whether a counterparty is an ECP or special
entity, as required by Rule 15Fh-3(a). These verification requirements are the same
1527

See CFTC Adopting Release, supra note 21.

1528

Notably, the CFTC adopted its final rules in 2012. Current estimates reflect the
fact that the CFTC rules have been in place since that time, and that registrants
will not incur a de novo burden in complying with the Commission’s rules, which
largely conform to those of the CFTC. In addition, as noted in the Proposing
Release, some banks will register as SBS Dealers. Banking agencies, such as the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, have issued guidance to national banks
that engage in financial derivatives transactions regarding business conduct
procedures, and, accordingly, the banks that may register as SBS Entities are also
likely already complying with similar requirements. See e.g., Risk Management
of Financial Derivatives, Office of Comptroller of the Currency Banking Circular
No. 277 (Oct. 27, 1993).

539

under the business conduct standards adopted by the CFTC. 1529 We understand that
industry has developed protocols and questionnaires that allow the counterparty to
indicate its status, whether or not it is a special entity and whether it elects to be treated as
a special entity. 1530 As a result of these protocols and questionnaires, the Commission
continues to believe that these dually registered SBS Entities will not incur any start-up
or ongoing burdens in complying with the rules, as adopted, because they already adhere
to the relevant protocols to obtain the information under the CFTC’s business conduct
standards. The remaining 20 SBS Entities will each incur $500 in start-up burdens to
adhere to the protocols. In addition, each counterparty that does not already adhere to the
protocols will incur $500 in start-up burdens to adhere to the protocols. In addition to the
$500 fee to adhere to the protocol, in order to adhere to the protocol, an adherence letter
must also be submitted, the form of which is provided online. Accordingly, we
conservatively estimate that one hour will be needed to input the data required to generate
the adherence letter. 1531 We do not anticipate any ongoing burdens with respect to this
1529

See CFTC Adopting Release, 75 FR at 80658, supra note 21. Accordingly, the
SBS Entities that would also be registered as a Swap Dealer or Major Swap
Participant with the CFTC would have verification procedures for engaging in
swaps.

1530

See ISDA August 2012 DF Protocol at http://www2.isda.org/functionalareas/protocol-management/protocol/8 (“ISDA August 2012 DF Protocol”).

1531

In lieu of adhering to the protocol, market participants may engage in bilateral
negotiations either to obtain representations regarding the status of the
counterparty or the SBS Entity may conduct due diligence to determine the status
of the counterparty. However, given the relatively low cost and time burden to
adhere to the protocol, we estimate that market participants will choose to adhere
to the protocol rather than pay counsel to negotiate representations or conduct the
necessary due diligence in the absence of any indications that reliance on such
representations would not be reasonable. For the purposes of this estimate, we
have assumed that reliance on the representations in the protocol would be
reasonable.

540

rule. We anticipate that the parties will adhere to the protocol. We also anticipate that in
connection with each transaction, SBS Entities will require counterparties to provide a
certificate indicating that there are no changes to the representations included in the
protocol and that reliance on those representations would be reasonable.
As noted above, the Commission believes that approximately 7,412 of the 10,900
security-based swap market participants (which include SBS Entities and counterparties)
are also swap market participants and likely already adhere to the relevant protocol. 1532
These 7,412 market participants would not have any start-up burdens or ongoing burdens
with respect to verification. The remaining 3,488 market participants would incur $500
each to adhere to the protocol for an aggregate total of $1,744,000 and one hour for the
adherence letter for an aggregate total of 3,488 hours. 1533
2.

Disclosures by SBS Entities

Pursuant to Rule 15Fh-3(b), (c), and (d), SBS Entities would be required to
provide certain disclosures to market participants. Based on the Commission’s
experience with burden estimates for similar disclosure requirements, 1534 as well as our

1532

See supra Section V.C. regarding the estimate for the number of market
participants.

1533

Although we understand that ISDA offers bulk pricing for multiple entities that
are part of the same corporate group or for fund families, we do not have the data
as to how many of the 3,488 market participants are related entities that would be
able to take advantage of this bulk pricing. As a result, we have conservatively
estimated that each of the 3,488 market participants would incur the $500 fee and
the hour for the adherence letter.

1534

For disclosures similar to the disclosure of methodologies and assumptions of
daily mark, see Disclosure of Accounting Policies for Derivative Financial
Instruments and Derivative Commodity Instruments and Disclosure of
Quantitative and Qualitative Information about Market Risk Inherent in
Derivative Financial Instruments, Other Financial Instruments and Derivative

541

discussions with market participants, 1535 we understand that the SBS Entities that are
dually registered with the CFTC already provide their counterparties with disclosures
similar to those required under Rules 15Fh-3(b) and (c). To the extent that the material
characteristics required by Rule 15Fh-3(b)(1) are included in the documentation of a
security-based swap, such as the master agreement, credit support annex, trade
confirmation or other documents, the Commission does not believe that any additional
burden will be required for the disclosure of material characteristics. For other required
disclosures relating to material risks required by Rule 15Fh-3(b)(1) or disclosures relating
to material incentives or conflicts of interest required by Rule 15Fh-3(b)(2), the
Commission understands that certain market participants have developed standardized
disclosures for some of these requirements. 1536 For example, many SBS Dealers already
provide a statement of potential risks related to investing in certain security-based swaps
to their counterparties. However, to the extent that an SBS Entity and counterparty
engage in a highly bespoke transaction, the standardized disclosure may not satisfy all of
the SBS Entities disclosure requirements. In those cases, the SBS Entity will likely use a

6044 (Feb. 10, 1997).
1535

See Proposing Release n. 14, 76 FR at 42398, supra note 3. See also, supra note
19 regarding a list of Commission staff meetings with interested parties.

1536

See e.g., ISDA General Disclosure Statement for Transactions (August 2015). To
the extent that disclosures of material risks and characteristics under Rule 15Fh3(b)(1) or disclosures of material incentives and conflicts of interest under Rule
15Fh-3(b)(2) are initially provided orally, the additional burden of providing a
written version of the disclosure at or before delivery of the trade confirmation
pursuant to Rule 15Fh-3(b)(3) will be considered in connection with the overall
reporting and recordkeeping burdens of the SBS Entity. See Recordkeeping
Release, supra note 242.

542

combination of standardized disclosures and de novo disclosures to fulfill its obligations
under Rules 15Fh-3(b)(1) and (2).
In some cases, such as disclosures about the daily mark for a cleared securitybased swap, the SBS Entity is obligated to provide the daily mark upon request. We
understand that in the current model of clearing security-based swaps, the security-based
swap between the SBS Entity and counterparty is terminated upon novation by the
clearing agency. The SBS Entity would no longer have any obligation to provide a daily
mark to the original counterparty because a security-based swap no longer exists between
them. Therefore, there would not be any ongoing burden on the SBS Entity. Depending
on how quickly the security-based swap is cleared, there may not be an initial burden on
the SBS Entity either. Unlike the CFTC’s rule, Rule 15Fh-3(c)(1) does not require a pretrade daily mark. So if the security-based swap is cleared before the end of the next day
and the clearing results in novation of the original swap, the SBS Entity would not have
any daily mark obligations for the cleared swap.
For uncleared security-based swaps, the Commission believes that SBS Entities
may need to slightly modify the models used for calculating variation margin to calculate
the daily mark. In addition, the SBS Entity will need to provide the counterparty with a
description of the methodologies and assumptions used to calculate the daily mark.
Nevertheless, existing accounting standards and other disclosure requirements
under the Exchange Act, such as FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or Item 305 of Regulation S-K, require
disclosures similar to the description of the methodologies and assumptions of the daily
mark. To the extent that the model it uses and methodologies and assumptions are not

543

already prepared, the SBS Entity may need to prepare the initial description of the data
sources, methodologies and assumptions. In addition, the SBS Entity will have an
ongoing burden of updating the disclosure for any material changes to the data sources,
methodologies and assumptions.
The Commission continues to believe that SBS Entities will use internal staff to
revise existing disclosures to comply with Rules 15Fh-3(b) and (c), and to assist in
preparing language to comply with Rule 15Fh-3(d) regarding the clearing options
available for a particular security-based swap. In addition, the requirements of Rule
15Fh-3(d) are not the same as the CFTC requirements to disclose clearing choices, so
SBS Entities will need to develop new disclosures.
The Commission estimates that in 2014 there has been approximately 740,700
security-based swap transactions between an SBS Dealer and a counterparty that is not an
SBS Dealer. Of these, the Commission estimates that approximately 428,000 were new
or amended trades requiring these disclosures. 1537 In view of the factors discussed in the
Economic Analysis section and elsewhere in this release, the Commission recognizes that
the time required to develop an infrastructure to provide these disclosures will vary
significantly depending on, among other factors, the complexity and nature of the SBS
Entity’s security-based swap business, its market risk management activities, its existing
disclosure practices, whether the security-based swap is cleared or uncleared and other

1537

Available DTCC-TIW data for 2014 indicated approximately 740,700
transactions between SBS Entities and non-SBS Entities during that time period.
Of these, approximately 240,000 were new trades, and 188,000 were
amendments. Of the approximately 240,000 new trades between likely SBS
Dealers and non-dealers, only 1,000 trades or approximately 0.5% were
voluntarily cleared bilateral trades in 2014.

544

applicable regulatory requirements. Under the rule, as adopted, SBS Entities could make
the required disclosures to their counterparties through standardized documentation, such
as a master agreement or other written agreement, if the parties so agree. The
Commission recognizes that it will likely be necessary to prepare some disclosures that
are particular to a transaction to meet all of an SBS Entity’s disclosure obligations under
Rules 15Fh-3(b), (c) and (d). The Commission also believes that, because the reporting
burden will generally require refining or revising an SBS Entity’s existing disclosure
processes, the disclosures will be prepared internally.
Given the foregoing, the Commission continues to conservatively estimate that
on average, SBS Entities will initially require three persons from trading and structuring,
three persons from legal, two persons from operations, and four persons from
compliance, for 100 hours each, to comply with the rules. 1538 This team will analyze the
changes necessary to comply with the new disclosure requirements, including the
redesign of current compliance systems, if necessary, as well as the creation of functional
requirements and system specifications for any systems development work that may be
needed to automate the disclosure process. 1539 This will amount to an aggregate initial
burden of 66,000 hours. 1540
1538

In the Proposing Release, the Commission used this estimate and it recognizes the
development of market practice to comply with very similar CFTC rules. It also
recognizes that given the current model used for clearing security-based swaps,
daily mark disclosures in that context are unlikely to be required. Furthermore,
no comments were received on these estimates. As a result, the Commission
conservatively continues to use these estimates.

1539

Some SBS Entities may choose to utilize in-house counsel to review, revise and
prepare these disclosures.

1540

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (55 SBS Entities) x (12
persons) x (100 hours).

545

Following the initial analysis and development of specifications, the Commission
continues to estimate that half of these persons will still be required to spend 20 hours
annually to re-evaluate and modify the disclosures and system requirements as necessary,
amounting to an ongoing annual burden of 6,600 hours. 1541 In addition, the Commission
estimates that on average, the SBS Entities will require one burden hour per securitybased swap to evaluate whether more particularized disclosures are necessary for the
transaction and to develop the additional disclosures for an aggregate ongoing burden of
428,000 hours. 1542
The Commission also continues to estimate that, to create and maintain an
information technology infrastructure to the specifications identified by the team of
persons from trading and structuring, legal, operations and compliance described above,
each SBS Entity will require, on average, eight full-time persons for six months of
systems development, programming and testing, amounting to a total initial burden of
440,000 hours. 1543 The Commission continues to estimate that maintenance of this

1541

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (55 SBS Entities) x (6
persons) x (20 hours).

1542

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (428,000 security-based swaps
that require these disclosures) X (1 hour). The Commission realizes that some
assessments may take less time and some may take more. In addition, to the
extent that additional disclosures are required, drafting the disclosure is likely to
take more than an hour, but we expect the vast majority of transactions will not
require additional disclosures so that an average of one hour per transaction is a
reasonable estimate.

1543

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (55 SBS Entities) x (4
persons) x (2000 hours).

546

system will require two full-time persons for a total ongoing burden of 220,000 hours
annually. 1544
3.

Know Your Counterparty and Recommendations

As noted in the Proposing Release, the estimates in this paragraph reflect the
Commission’s experience with and burden estimates for similar collections of
information, as well as our discussions with market participants. 1545 The Commission
continues to believe that most SBS Dealers already have policies and procedures in place
for knowing their counterparties, to comply with existing CFTC and FINRA standards.
The Commission estimates that, on average, the rules will require each SBS Dealer to
initially spend approximately five hours to review existing policies and procedures and to
document the collection of information necessary to comply with its “know your
counterparty” obligations – for a total initial burden of 250 hours. The Commission also
continues to estimate that an SBS Dealer will spend an average of approximately 30
additional minutes each year per unique non-SBS Dealer counterparty to assess whether
the SBS Dealer is in compliance with the rules’ know your counterparty requirements – a

1544

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (55 SBS Entities) x (2
persons) x (2000 hours).

1545

See Proposing Release n. 14, 76 FR at 42398, supra note 3. See also supra note
19 regarding a list of Commission staff meetings with interested parties.

547

total ongoing burden of approximately 11,500 hours annually, 1546 or an average of 230
hours annually per SBS Dealer. 1547
In addition, the Commission estimates that the counterparties will require
approximately ten hours for each counterparty or its agent to collect and provide essential
facts to the SBS Dealer for a total initial burden of 109,000 hours. 1548
The Commission expects that, given the institutional nature of the participants
involved in security-based swaps, most SBS Dealers will obtain the representations in
Rules 15Fh-3(f)(2) and (3) to comply with Rule 15Fh-3(f). 1549 For the 1,141 special
entities, we expect SBS Entities will not act as an advisor pursuant to Rule 15Fh-2(a) and
accordingly, the burden estimates for the SBS Entities and special entities are included in
the context of the discussion for that rule, infra. For the 7,412 security-based swap
market participants that are also swap market participants, including the thirty-five firms
that we expect to be dually registered as Swap Dealers and SBS Dealers, most of the
requisite representations have been drafted for the swaps context. 1550 We understand that

1546

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (23,000 unique SBS Dealer –
non-dealer counterparty pairs ) x 30 minutes / 60 minutes. In the Proposing
Release, the Commission estimated 47,000 unique SBS Dealer—non-dealer
counterparty pairs. Based on updated DTCC-TIW data, we now estimate 23,000
SBS Dealer – non-dealer counterparty pairs.

1547

To the extent that the SBS Dealer is unfamiliar with the counterparty, the
Commission would expect a greater time burden and as an SBS Dealer becomes
more familiar with the particular counterparty, the Commission would expect a
lesser time burden. As a result, we use 30 minutes as an average estimate.

1548

The estimate is based on 10,900 market participants X 10 hours.

1549

The Commission bases its expectation on its observation and experience in the
context of transactions by broker-dealers with institutional clients and the use of
FINRA’s institutional suitability exception in that context.

1550

Of the 7,412 market participants that engage in both swaps and security-based
swaps, a proportion of them will also be special entities. This calculation assumes

548

swap market participants are currently utilizing standardized representations that are
currently in Schedule 3 of the ISDA August 2012 DF Protocol. The $50 million
institutional suitability threshold is consistent with the institutional suitability exception
in FINRA standards, but may require SBS Dealers to obtain an additional representation
or conduct due diligence to determine the counterparty has total assets of at least $50
million. To the extent that any modifications are necessary to adapt those representations
to the security-based swap context, we conservatively estimate that market participants
will each require two hours to assess the necessity and make any necessary modifications
for the security-based swap context for an aggregate initial burden of 12,542 hours for the
market participants that participate in both the security-based swaps market and the
swaps market. 1551 We do not anticipate any ongoing burden with respect to the requisite
representations because the representations in the swaps context are deemed repeated “as
of the occurrence of each Swap Communication Event” and we would anticipate a
similar construction in the security-based swap context. For the remaining 3,488 market
participants, we expect that they will draft the requisite representations to comply with
the institutional suitability analysis in Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2). We also anticipate that these
3,488 market participants are likely to model their representations on the representations
included in the ISDA August 2012 DF Protocol because the SBS Entity is already

all of the special entities are engaged in transactions in both markets, leaving
6,271 market participants (7,412 market participants – 1,141 special entities) to
adapt the representations in the ISDA August 2012 DF Protocol to the securitybased swap context, as necessary.
1551

This calculation is based on the assumption that all of the special entities are
engaged in both the swaps market and the security-based swaps market and that
the special entities will choose to comply with the safe harbor of Rule 15Fh-5(b).
(7,412 market participants – 1,141 special entities) X (2 hours).

549

familiar with those particular representations. Accordingly, we estimate that the
remaining 3,488 market participants will each require five hours to review and agree to
representations similar to those included in such protocol for an aggregate initial burden
of 17,440 hours. 1552 Again, we do not anticipate an ongoing burden for these
representations for the reasons set forth above.
4.

Fair and Balanced Communications

Rule 15Fh-3(g) requires SBS Entities to communicate with counterparties “in a
fair and balanced manner, based on principles of fair dealing and good faith.” The three
specific standards of Rule 15Fh-3(g) require that: (1) communications must provide a
sound basis for evaluating the facts with respect to any security-based swap or trading
strategy involving a security-based swap; (2) communications may not imply that past
performance will recur, or make any exaggerated or unwarranted claim, opinion, or
forecast; and (3) any statement referring to the potential opportunities or advantages
presented by a security-based swap or trading strategy involving a security-based swap
shall be balanced by an equally detailed statement of the corresponding risks. 1553 We
expect that a discussion of material risks of the transaction will be included in the
1552

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (3,488 market participants) X
(5 hours).

1553

To the extent that the 16 registered broker-dealers that are expected to register as
SBS Entities are also FINRA members, they are already subject to these similar
FINRA requirements in the non-security based swap context. Cf. FINRA Rule
2210(d)(1)(D) (“Members must ensure that statements are clear and not
misleading within the context in which they are made, and that they provide
balanced treatment of risks and potential benefits. Communications must be
consistent with the risks of fluctuating prices and the uncertainty of dividends,
rates of return and yield inherent to investments.”) The Commission believes that
this requirement addresses concerns raised by a commenter that to be fair and
balanced, communications must inform investors of both the potential rewards
and risks of their investments. See Levin, supra note 5.

550

documentation for the security-based swap. The Commission believes that all 55 SBS
Entities will be required to comply with Rule 15Fh-3(g), and that they will likely send
their existing marketing materials to outside counsel for review and comment.
Accordingly, the Commission continues to believe that each SBS Entity will likely incur
$6,000 in legal costs, or $330,000 in the aggregate initial burden, to draft or review
statements of potential opportunities and corresponding risks in the marketing materials
for single name and narrow based index credit default swaps, total return swaps and other
security-based swaps. 1554
The Commission additionally believes that compliance with Rule 15Fh-3(g)
would require a review of SBS Entities’ other communications to their counterparties,
such as e-mails and Bloomberg messages. However, we believe that such additional
communications would likely be reviewed internally, by in-house legal counsel or an
SBS Entity’s CCO. We estimate that the initial internal burden hours associated with this
review would be approximately six hours, for an aggregate total of 330 hours. 1555
For more bespoke transactions, the cost for outside counsel to review the
marketing materials will depend on the complexity, novelty and nature of the product, but
the Commission expects a higher cost associated with the review for more novel
products. The Commission accordingly estimates an initial, aggregate compliance cost
1554

The Commission estimates that the review of marketing materials for these three
categories of security-based swaps would require 5 hours of outside counsel time,
at an average cost of $400 per hour. This estimate also assumes that each SBS
Entity engages in all three categories of security-based swaps.

1555

The Commission estimates that the review of additional communications for these
three categories of security-based swaps would require internal burden hours for
each of the 55 SBS Entities. This estimate also assumes that each SBS Entity
engages in all three categories of security-based swaps.

551

for the marketing materials relating to bespoke single name and narrow based index
credit default swaps, total return swaps and other security-based swaps at $462,000. 1556
As stated above in Section II.G.5, Rule 15Fh-3(g) applies to communications made
before the parties enter into a security-based swap, and continues to apply over the term
of a security-based swap. The Commission believes that the ongoing compliance costs
associated with the rule will likely be limited to a review of SBS Entities’ e-mail
communications sent to counterparties, which we believe will likely be done by in-house
counsel. We estimate that the ongoing compliance costs of the rule will be
approximately two burden hours, for an aggregate total of 330 hours. 1557
5.

Supervision

As outlined above, Rule 15Fh-3(h) requires an SBS Entity to establish and
maintain a system to supervise, and to diligently supervise, its business and the activities
of its associated persons. Such a system shall be reasonably designed to prevent
violations of the provisions of applicable federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder relating to its business as an SBS Entity. The written policies and
procedures required by Rule 15Fh-3(h) must include, at a minimum, procedures for nine
specific areas of supervision.

1556

The Commission estimates the review of the marketing materials for each of these
categories would require seven hours of outside counsel time at a cost of $400 per
hour. This estimate also assumes that each SBS Entity engages in all three
categories of transactions.

1557

The Commission estimates that the review of additional communications for these
three categories of security-based swaps would require two internal burden hours
for each of the 55 SBS Entities. This estimate also assumes that each SBS Entity
engages in all three categories of security-based swaps.

As for the number of SBS Entities respondents, the Commission continues to
estimate that approximately 55 SBS Entities (of which we expect approximately 35 will
be dually registered with the CFTC as Swap Entities) will be required to comply with
analogous supervision rules like those required by Rule 15Fh-3(h). 1558 The supervision
requirements in Rule 15Fh-3(h) are largely the same under the business conduct
standards and related rules adopted by the CFTC. 1559
The estimates in this paragraph reflect the foregoing information, as well as the
Commission’s general experience with and understanding of the burden estimates in
similar contexts, including, but not limited to, FINRA’s analogous supervision rules.
While each of the nine written policies and procedures required, at a minimum, by Rule
15Fh-3(h) will vary in cost, the Commission continues to estimate that such policies and
procedures will require, on average, 210 hours per respondent, per policy and procedure
to initially prepare written policies and procedures in order to establish a system to
diligently supervise those policies and procedures, or an average of 1,890 burden hours
per SBS Entity – resulting in an initial aggregate burden of 103,950 hours. 1560 The

Release, 80 FR at 48990, supra note 1129.

See Commodity Exchange Act Rule 23.602. See also Commodity Exchange Act
Rule 23.402(a) (policies and procedures to ensure compliance); Commodity
Exchange Act Rule 3.3(d)(1) (administration of compliance policies and
procedures). Accordingly, the SBS Entities that would also be registered as a
swap dealer or major swap participant with the CFTC would have supervision
policies and procedures for engaging in swaps.

1560

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42446, supra note 3. The estimate is based on
the following calculation: (210 hours) x (9 policies and procedures) x (55 SBS
Entities). The estimates reflected do not include the burden and cost of actually
complying with the underlying substance of these written policies and procedures
as that is beyond the scope of the PRA analysis.

553

Commission also continues to expect that many SBS Entities will primarily rely on
outside counsel for the collection of information required under this rule at a rate of $400
per hour, for an average of 450 hours per respondent, with a minimum of nine policies
and procedures, resulting in an outside initial cost burden of $180,000 per respondent – or
an aggregate initial cost of $9,900,000. 1561 Once these policies and procedures are
established, the Commission continues to estimate that, on average, each SBS Entity will
spend approximately 540 hours (approximately 60 hours per policy and procedure) each
year to maintain these policies and procedures, yielding a total ongoing annual burden of
approximately 29,700 internal burden hours (55 SBS Entities x 540 hours). 1562 The
Commission believes that the maintenance of these policies and procedures will be
conducted internally.

SBS Dealers Acting as Advisors to Special Entities

As discussed above, Rule 15Fh-4 imposes on SBS Dealers that act as advisors to
special entities a duty to make a reasonable determination that any security-based swap or
related trading strategy that the SBS Dealer recommends is in the “best interests” of the
special entity. Rule 15Fh-2(a) states that an SBS Dealer “acts as an advisor” to a special
entity when it recommends a security-based swap or related trading strategy to the special
entity. However, the rule provides a safe harbor whereby an SBS Entity will not be
deemed an “advisor” if an ERISA special entity counterparty relies on advice from an

1561

Some SBS Entities may choose to utilize in-house counsel to initially prepare
these policy and procedure, which would mitigate the aggregate initial cost, but
the Commission’s estimate of $9,900,000 reflects a conservative assumption of
SBS Entities primarily relying on outside counsel to prepare these materials.

1562

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42446, supra note 3.

554

ERISA fiduciary, or where any special entity counterparty relies on advice from a
qualified independent representative that acts in its best interests. 1563
In the Proposing Release, the Commission recognized the inherent tensions that
arise where SBS Dealers recommend a security-based swap or related transaction to
special entity counterparties. 1564 Given the parties’ incentive to transact in security-based
swaps, the Commission believes that the parties are likely to resolve these tensions by
providing the necessary representations and disclosures to meet the requirements of the
safe harbor under Rule 15Fh-2(a)(1)-(2), such that an SBS Dealer will not be deemed to
act as an advisor to a special entity, particularly for transactions in which the SBS Dealer
is the counterparty to the transaction.
Among swap dealers operating under the CFTC’s parallel safe harbor, 1565 parties
have generally included representations in standard swap documentation that both
counterparties are acting as principals, and that the counterparty is not relying on any
communication from the swap dealer as investment advice. We believe that SBS Dealers
and their special entity counterparties will similarly include the requisite representations
in standard security-based swap documentation. These representations will need to be
reviewed and revised to ensure that they comply with the rules the Commission adopts
today.
As stated in the Proposing Release, the Commission continues to believe that the
50 SBS Dealers will primarily rely on in-house counsel for compliance with this rule,

1563

Rule 15Fh-2(a)(1)-(2).

1564

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42424, supra note 3.

1565

See CFTC Regulation § 23.440(b)(1)-(2).

555

each of which will need approximately five internal burden hours to draft, review and
revise the representations in its standard security-based swap documentation to comply
with Rule 15Fh-2(a)(1)-(2), for an initial aggregate burden of 250 hours. 1566 The
Commission also believes that, once an SBS Dealer revises the language of the
representations to meet the requirements of Rule 15Fh-2(a)(1)-(2), such language will
become part of the SBS Dealer’s standard security-based swap documentation and,
accordingly, there will be no further ongoing burden associated with this rule. For
transactions in which an SBS Dealer is not a counterparty and chooses to act as an
advisor, the Commission estimates that an SBS Entity will require approximately 20
internal burden hours to collect the requisite information from each special entity, for an
aggregate initial burden of approximately 1,700 hours. 1567
7.

SBS Entities Acting as Counterparties to Special Entities

Where a special entity is a counterparty to a security-based swap, Rule 15Fh5(a)(1) requires an SBS Entity to have a reasonable basis for believing that the special
entity has a qualified independent representative that meets specified requirements.
Where the special entity counterparty is an ERISA plan, under Rule 15Fh-5(a)(2), the
SBS Entity must have a reasonable basis to believe that the ERISA plan is represented by
1566

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42446, supra note 3. This estimate is based on
multiplying the number of SBS Dealers (50) by the number of estimated internal
burden hours (5).

1567

This estimate is based on available market data for November 2006 – September
2014 provided by DTCC that indicates 85 unique pairs of SBS Dealers and U.S.
special entities without a third-party investment adviser. Based on 2014 single
name CDS data in DTCC-TIW, there were 2 unique trading relationships between
likely SBS Dealers and special entities without a third party investment adviser,
which entered into 272 new trades and 200 terminations, representing 0.039% of
all transactions in 2014.

556

an ERISA fiduciary. The Commission believes that written representations will likely
provide the basis for establishing an SBS Entity’s reasonable belief regarding the
qualifications of the independent representative.
As stated in the Proposing Release, the Commission continues to believe that the
burden for determining whether an independent representative is independent of the SBS
Entity will depend on the size of the independent representative, the size of the SBS
Entity, and the volume of transactions with which each is engaged. The Commission
further believes that each SBS Entity would initially require written representations
regarding the qualifications of a special entity’s independent representative, but would
only require updates to the independent representative’s qualifications in subsequent
dealings with the same independent representative throughout the duration of the swap
term, provided the volume and nature of the security-based swap transaction remain the
same.
Regarding the initial burden estimates for SBS Entities, the Commission’s
updated estimates reflect that each SBS Entity will interact with and be required to form a
reasonable basis regarding the qualifications of approximately 385 independent, thirdparty representatives and 25 in-house independent representatives, for a total of 410
independent representatives. In the Proposing Release, the Commission estimated an
average internal burden of 15 hours for each SBS Entity per independent representative.
We have increased this estimate based on changes to the representations that SBS Entities
will have to obtain and now estimate that each SBS Entity, on average, will initially
require approximately 15.5 internal burden hours from the SBS Entity’s own in-house
counsel per independent representative to collect the information necessary to comply

557

with this requirement. This will result in an aggregate initial burden of 349,525internal
hours (15.5 hours x 410 independent representatives x 55 SBS Entities). 1568 We do not
believe there will be any external burdens associated with this rule.
With regard to SBS Entities’ ongoing burden, the Commission believes that such
burden would be minimal, since, once an SBS Entity forms a reasonable basis to believe
that a given independent representative meets the qualifications of Rule 15Fh-5, the SBS
Entity will not likely need to reaffirm that independent representative’s qualifications
anew, but could instead rely on past representations regarding the representative’s
qualifications. We estimate that SBS Entities will incur an ongoing, aggregate burden of
22,500 hours (1 hour x 55 SBS Entities x 410 independent representatives) per year as a
result of this rule.
In addition to the burdens imposed on SBS Entities, Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1) will also
impose a burden on special entities’ independent representatives to collect the necessary
information regarding their relevant qualifications, and provide that information to the
SBS Entity and/or the special entity. The Commission continues to believe that the
reporting burden for the independent representative will consist of providing written
representations to the SBS Entity and/or the special entity it represents. The Commission
believes that the burden associated with an independent representative’s obligation to
assess its independence from the SBS Entity will likely depend on the size of the
independent representative, the size of the SBS Entity, the interactions between the
1568

While the Commission does not believe that every SBS Entity is likely to deal
with every independent representative, we do not have data on the average
number of independent representatives with whom each SBS Entity would deal.
Accordingly, for the purposes of these calculations, we have assumed that each
SBS Entity will deal with each independent representative.

558

independent representative and the SBS Entity, the policies and procedures of the
independent representative and depend less on the number of transactions in which the
independent representative is engaged. The policies and procedures of the independent
representative will facilitate its ability to quickly assess, disclose, manage and mitigate
any potential material conflicts of interest. We now believe the number of transactions in
which the independent representative engages is less likely to impact this assessment.
Accordingly, we have updated our estimates.
We anticipate that independent representatives will rely on in-house counsel to
collect and submit the relevant documentation and information regarding its
qualifications. The Commission also estimates that each independent representative, on
average, will initially require approximately 16 internal burden hours from its in-house
counsel per SBS Entity to collect the information necessary to comply with this
requirement. 1569 This will result in an aggregate initial burden of 360,800 internal hours
(16 hours x 410 independent representatives x 55 SBS Entities).
As with SBS Entities’ ongoing burden associated with this rule, the Commission
believes that the ongoing burden imposed on independent representatives would be
minimal, since, once the independent representative has provided information regarding
its qualifications to the SBS Entity, the independent representative will not likely need to
collect or provide that information again, but could instead rely on a bring down
certificate that reflects past representations regarding its qualifications. We estimate that
1569

While the Commission does not believe that every independent representative is
likely to deal with every SBS Entity, we do not have data on the average number
of SBS Entities with whom each independent representative would deal.
Accordingly, for the purposes of these calculations, we have assumed that each
SBS Entity will deal with each independent representative.

559

independent representatives will incur an ongoing, aggregate burden of 22,500 hours (1
hour x 55 SBS Entities x 410 independent representatives) per year as a result of this
rule. 1570 We do not believe there will be external burdens associated with this rule.
8.

Political Contributions

As noted above, the Commission believes that there will be approximately 50
SBS Dealers subject to these rules, and estimates that all of them will provide, or will
seek to provide, security-based swap services to municipal entities. SBS Dealers, in
order to supervise and assess internal compliance with the pay to play rules, will need to
collect information regarding the political contributions of SBS Dealers and their covered
associates. In addition, SBS Dealers’ covered associates will also need to collect and
provide the information required by these rules to SBS Dealers.
The Commission’s estimates in this paragraph take into account the burden of the
covered associates and the SBS Dealers. These estimates also reflect the Commission’s
experience with and burden estimates for similar requirements, as well as our discussions
with market participants. 1571 Based on the foregoing, the Commission estimates that it
will take, on average, approximately 185 hours per SBS Dealer – resulting in a total
1570

We note that, in the Proposing Release, we based our burden estimates for
evaluating an independent representative’s qualifications on the underlying
assumption that representations regarding an independent representative’s
qualifications must be provided prior to every transaction, and therefore the
associated burden calculations were transaction-specific. See Proposing Release,
76 FR 42446-7, supra note 3. However, based on the observed practices of swap
market participants, we now believe that representations regarding an independent
representative’s qualifications need only be provided in the context of each
relationship with an SBS Entity. Our revised calculations, which are now
relationship-specific, reflect this shift in our underlying assumption.

1571

See Advisers Act Pay-to-Play Release, 75 FR 41018, 41061- 65, supra note 1100.
See also supra note 19 regarding a list of Commission staff meetings with
interested parties.

560

initial burden of 9,250 hours 1572 to collect the information regarding the political
contributions of SBS Dealers and their covered associates to assist SBS Dealer in their
compliance with the rule. The Commission believes that many SBS Dealers will
primarily rely on in-house counsel for the collection of information required under this
rule.
Additionally, we expect some SBS Dealers to incur one-time costs to establish or
enhance current systems to assist in their compliance with the rule. These costs will vary
widely among firms. Similar to the estimates made by the Commission in connection
with the Advisers Act pay to play rule, we have also estimated that some small and
medium firms will incur start-up costs, on average, of $10,000, and larger firms will
incur, on average, $100,000. Assuming all SBS Dealers will be larger firms, the initial
cost to establish or enhance current systems to assist in their compliance with the rule is
estimated at $5,000,000 for all SBS Dealers. 1573 Nevertheless, we note that some SBS
Dealers may not incur any system costs if they determine a system is unnecessary due to
their limited number of employees, or their limited number of municipal entity
counterparties. Furthermore, like other large firms, SBS Dealers have likely devoted
significant resources to automating compliance and reporting with respect to regulations
concerning certain political contributions. This rule could, therefore, cause them to
enhance the existing systems that had originally been designed to comply with MSRB
Rules G-37 and G-38 and Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-5.
1572

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (185 hours x 50 SBS Dealers).

1573

The initial cost is estimated at: 50 SBS Dealers x $100,000 = $5,000,000. See
Advisers Act Pay-to-Play Release, 75 FR at 41061, supra note 1100 (estimating
that larger firms will incur, on average, $100,000, in start-up costs).

561

The final rules also allow SBS Dealers to file applications for exemptive relief,
and outline a list of items to be addressed, including, whether the SBS Dealer has
developed policies and procedures to monitor political contributions; the steps taken after
discovery of the contribution; and the apparent intent in making the contribution based on
the facts and circumstances of each case. The incidence of exemptive relief related to
MSRB Rule G-37 and the number of applications the Commission has received under
the Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-5 may be indicative of the possible applications for
exemptive relief under these final rules. Consistent with the Commission’s estimates in
connection with Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-5, we also estimate that a firm that applies for
an exemption will hire outside counsel to prepare an exemptive request, and estimate that
the number of hours counsel will spend preparing and submitting an application between
16 hours to 32 hours, at a rate of $400 per hour. Recognizing that this is an estimate, we
conservatively estimate that the Commission may receive up to two applications for
exemptive relief per year with respect to pay to play rules. 1574 at a total ongoing cost of
$25,600 per year, assuming conservatively 32 hours for outside counsel to prepare an
exemptive request. 1575

Chief Compliance Officer

Under Rule 15Fk-1, an SBS Entity’s CCO is responsible for, among other things,
taking reasonable steps to ensure that the SBS Entity establishes and maintains policies
1574

FINRA has granted 17 exemptive letters related to Rule G-37 between 1/05 and
12/15 (11 years) http://www.finra.org/industry/exemptive-letters. In addition, the
Commission has received 13 applications under the Adviser’s act (since the
compliance date, approximately 4 years).

1575

Ongoing: (Outside counsel at $400 per hour x 32 hours per application x 2) =
$25,600. See Advisers Act Pay-to-Play Release, 75 FR at 41065, supra note 1100
(making similar estimates in connection with Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-5).

562

and procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance by the SBS Entity with the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder relating to its business as an SBS
Entity. The Commission continues to estimate that, on average, the establishment and
administration of the policies and procedures required under Rule 15Fk-1 (e.g., preparing
an annual compliance report and the SBS Entity’s annual assessment of its written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Section 15F and
the rules and regulations thereunder) will require 630 hours to create and 180 hours to
administer per year per respondent, for a total burden of 34,650 initial hours, and 9,900
hours per year on average, on an ongoing basis. 1576 The Commission also continues to
estimate that a total of $60,000 in outside legal costs will be incurred to, among other
things, assist in the preparation of the annual compliance report and the SBS Entity’s
annual assessment of its written policies and procedures, as a result of this burden per
respondent, for a total initial outside cost burden of $3,300,000. 1577
A CCO will also be required to prepare and submit annual compliance reports to
the Commission and the SBS Entity’s board of directors. In the Proposing Release, the
Commission estimated that these reports would require on average 92 hours per
respondent per year for an ongoing annual burden of 5,060 hours. As a result of
additional descriptions that some CCOs will have to include in their annual compliance
reports, we now estimate that these reports will require on average 93 hours per

1576

respondent per year for an ongoing annual burden of 5,115. 1578 Because the report will
be submitted by an internal CCO, the Commission does not expect any external costs
associated therewith.
10.

Foreign Branch Exception

The Commission estimates the one-time paperwork burden associated with
developing representations under this collection of information would be, for each U.S.
bank counterparty that may make such representations to its registered Major SBS
Participant or registered SBS Dealer counterparty, no more than five hours, and up to
$2,000 for the services of outside professionals, for an estimate of approximately 250
hours and $100,000 across all security-based swap counterparties that may make such
representations. 1579 This estimate assumes little or no reliance on standardized disclosure
language.
However, as the Commission has previously noted in connection with this
collection of information, in most cases, the representations associated with the definition
of “transaction conducted through a foreign branch” are likely to be made through
amendments to the parties’ existing trading documentation (e.g., the schedule to a master
agreement). 1580 Because these representations relate to new regulatory requirements, the
1578

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (93 hours) x (55 SBS Dealers).

1579

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31108, supra note 6 (explaining
that the Commission estimated that 50 entities may include a representation that
security-based swap is a “transaction conducted through a foreign branch” in their
trading relationship documentation).

1580

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47366, supra note 193. See also
Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31108, supra note 6 (noting that
entities may include the representation in their trading relationship
documentation). The Commission believes that because trading relationship
documentation is established between two counterparties, the question of whether

564

Commission anticipates that U.S. bank counterparties may elect to develop and
incorporate these representations in trading documentation soon after the effective date of
the Commission’s security-based swap regulations, rather than incorporating specific
language on a transactional basis. The Commission believes that parties would be able to
adopt, where appropriate, standardized language across all of their security-based swap
trading relationships.
The Commission expects that the majority of the burden associated with the new
disclosure requirements will be experienced during the first year as language is developed
and trading documentation is amended. After the new representations are developed and
incorporated into trading documentation, the Commission continues to believe that the
on-going paperwork burden associated with this requirement will be 10 hours per U.S.
bank counterparty for verifying representations with existing counterparties, for a total of
approximately 500 hours across all applicable U.S. bank counterparties. 1581
11.

Substituted Compliance Rule

Rule 3a71–6 under the Exchange Act would require submission of certain
information to the Commission to the extent that foreign financial authorities or securitybased swap dealers or major security-based swap participants elect to request a

one of those counterparties is able to represent that it is entering into a
“transaction conducted through a foreign branch” would not change on a
transaction-by-transaction basis and, therefore, such representations would
generally be made in the schedule to a master agreement, rather than in individual
confirmations.
1581

The Commission staff estimates that this burden would consist of 10 hours of inhouse counsel time for each security-based swap market participant that may
make such representations. See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47367
(estimating 10 hours per counterparty for verification), supra note 193; CrossBorder Proposing Release, 78 FR 31108 (same), supra note 6.

565

substituted compliance determination with respect to the Title VII business conduct
requirements. Consistent with Exchange Act Rule 0-13, such applications must be
accompanied by supporting documentation necessary for the Commission to evaluate the
request, including information regarding applicable foreign requirements, and the
methods used by foreign authorities to monitor and enforce compliance.
The Commission expects that registered security-based swap dealers and major
security-based swap participants will seek to rely on substituted compliance upon
registration, and that it is likely that the majority of such requests will be made during the
first year following the effective date of this substituted compliance rule. Requests would
not be necessary with regard to applicable rules and regulations of a foreign jurisdiction
that have previously been the subject of a substituted compliance determination in
connection with the applicable rules.
In light of the provisions of the final rule and rule 0-13, permitting substituted
compliance applications to be made by foreign regulatory authorities, the Commission
expects that the great majority of substituted compliance applications will be submitted
by foreign authorities, and that very few substituted compliance requests will come from
SBS Entities. For purposes of this assessment, the Commission estimates that three such
SBS Entities will submit such applications. 1582 The Commission estimates that the total
one-time paperwork burden incurred by such entities associated with preparing and

1582

This estimate differs from the Cross-Border Proposing Release estimate, that
there would be no more than 50 requests for substituted compliance
determinations pursuant to proposed Rule 3a71-5. See Cross-Border Proposing
Release, 78 FR at 31110, supra note 6. The revised estimate reflects our
expectation that the large majority of substituted compliance requests will be
made by foreign regulatory authorities, rather than by market participants.

566

submitting a request for a substituted compliance determination in connection with the
business conduct requirements will be approximately 240 hours, plus $240,000 for the
services of outside professionals for all three requests. 1583
E.

Collections of Information are Mandatory

With the exception of the collection of information related to the foreign branch
exception, compliance with collection of information requirements under these rules is
mandatory for all SBS Dealers and SBS Entities. An agency may not conduct or
sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it
displays a currently valid OMB control number.
Compliance with the collection of information requirements associated with rule
3a71-6, regarding the availability of substituted compliance, is mandatory for all foreign
financial authorities or non-U.S. SBS Entities that seek a substituted compliance
determination.
F.

Confidentiality

The forms that the Commission has adopted for use by applicants for registration
as security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap participants provide for
applicants to notify the Commission regarding intended reliance on substituted
1583

Consistent with the per-request estimates in the Cross-Border Proposing Release,
the Commission estimates that the paperwork burden associated with making each
such substituted compliance request would be approximately 80 hours of in-house
counsel time, plus $80,000 for the services of outside professionals (based on 200
hours of outside time * 400). See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at
31110, supra note 6.
In practice, those amounts may overestimate the costs of requests pursuant to
Rule 3a71-6 as adopted, as such requests would solely address business conduct
requirements, rather than the broader proposed scope of substituted compliance
set forth in that proposal.

567

compliance. 1584 Also, the Commission generally will make requests for substituted
compliance determination public, subject to requests for confidential treatment being
submitted pursuant to any applicable provisions governing confidentiality under the
Exchange Act. 1585
The representations provided in connection with the foreign branch exception
would be provided voluntarily by certain U.S. bank counterparties to their registered
SBS Dealer counterparties; therefore, the Commission would not typically receive
confidential information as a result of this collection of information. However, to the
extent that the Commission receives confidential information contained in a
representation document through our examination and oversight program, an
investigation, or some other means, such information would be kept confidential, subject
to the provisions of applicable law.

Retention Period of Recordkeeping Requirements

SBS Dealers will be required to retain records and information relating to these
rules for the required retention periods specified in Exchange Act Rule 17a-4.

Economic Analysis
A.

Introduction and Broad Economic Considerations

The Commission is sensitive to the costs and benefits imposed by its rules. This
section presents an analysis of the particular economic effects – including costs, benefits
1584

3A, B and C of Form SBSE-A, addressing potential reliance on substituted
compliance determinations)

(discussing confidentiality provisions under the Exchange Act in connection with
adopting Rule 0-13, governing applications for substituted compliance).

568

and impact on efficiency, competition, and capital formation – that may result from our
final rules. Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission, when engaging in
rulemaking that requires the Commission to consider or determine whether an action is
necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection
of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital
formation. Further, Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission,
when adopting rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact that any new rule
would have on competition and to not adopt any rule that would impose a burden on
competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the
Exchange Act. In the Proposing Release, the Commission solicited comments on all
aspects of the costs and benefits associated with the proposed rules, including any effect
the proposed business conduct rules may have on efficiency, competition, and capital
formation. 1586 The Commission has considered these comments and has modified some
of the rules being adopted as discussed in sections I, II and III, supra.
The business conduct rules as adopted implement the requirements under Sections
15F(h) and 15F(k) of the Exchange Act as added by Section 764(a) of the Dodd-Frank
Act. As discussed in Section VI.C, infra, the final rules include both requirements
expressly addressed by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as discretionary rules
designed to further the principles which underlie the statutory requirements. These
discretionary rules include requirements to make certain additional disclosures; certain
“know your counterparty” obligations; suitability obligations for SBS Dealers;

1586

See Proposing Release, supra note 3.

569

prohibitions against certain “pay to play” activities; and a requirement of board approval
for decisions related to the compensation or removal of the CCO.
SBS Entities play a central role in intermediating transactions in complex and
opaque security-based swaps, and enjoy significant informational advantages compared
to their less sophisticated counterparties. For instance, SBS Dealers observe quote
solicitations and order flow. SBS Dealers may also act as lenders, placement agents,
underwriters, structurers or securitizers of the securities underlying security-based
swaps. As a result of operating in such additional capacities, SBS Dealers may have
superior information about the quality of security-based swaps and of securities
underlying security-based swaps. Major SBS Participants may have lower volumes of
dealing activity than SBS Dealers, but may hold large concentrated positions in securitybased swaps, 1587 and may have specialized expertise in pricing and trading securitybased swaps. At the same time, less informed and less sophisticated counterparties do
not observe order flow, may have less information concerning the risks and expected
returns of security-based swaps and reference securities, and may have less expertise in
valuing complex security-based swaps.
In addition, SBS Dealers are for-profit entities with business incentives that may
be competing with those of their counterparties. Due to the nature of their market
making and intermediation roles, SBS Dealers purchase security-based swaps from
counterparties seeking to sell them, and sell security-based swaps to counterparties
seeking to buy them. When SBS Dealers transact as principal risk holders and do not
hedge their exposures, they benefit from directional market moves that result in losses
1587

See Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30751-30756, supra note 115.

570

for their counterparties. When SBS Dealers hedge their exposures and do not carry
balance sheet risk, they may be indifferent to directional price moves of the securitybased swap, but profit from charging high fees to their counterparties, whereas their
counterparties benefit from low fees and transaction costs. If SBS Dealers recommend
security-based swaps to counterparties, such recommendations may be influenced by the
above business incentives. Counterparties of SBS Dealers may be aware of these
competing incentives, and SBS Dealers generally benefit from intermediating a greater
volume of trades, potentially mitigating these effects. However, informational
asymmetries between SBS Dealers and their counterparties outlined above may limit the
ability of counterparties to decouple the potential biases and information components of
SBS Dealer recommendations, and to evaluate the merits of each security-based swap.
Broadly, these external business conduct rules as adopted may decrease
informational asymmetries between SBS Entities and their less sophisticated
counterparties and strengthen counterparty protections. This may enable market
participants to make better informed investment decisions, and enhance allocative
efficiency in security-based swap markets.
The baseline for our economic analysis reflects rules adopted as part of the SBS
Entity Definitions Adopting Release, the Cross-Border Adopting Release, Regulation
SBSR and SDR Rules, 1588 as well as SBS Entity registration rules. We also recognize
that final U.S. Activity rules have been adopted, and affect the scope of cross-border
transactions that will become subject to various substantive Title VII requirements,

1588

17 CFR 232.11, 232.101, 232.305, and 232.407; 17 CFR 240.13n-1 to 240.13n-12
(“SDR Rules”). See SDR Registration Release, supra note 1202.

571

including those related to business conduct standards. While these rules are not yet in
effect, to perform a meaningful analysis of the business conduct requirements being
adopted and their cross-border application, our baseline includes the final U.S. Activity
rules. 1589
Title VII provides a statutory framework for the OTC derivatives market and
divides authority to regulate that market between the CFTC (which regulates swaps) and
the Commission (which regulates security-based swaps). We note that many entities
expected to register with the Commission as SBS Entities are currently intermediating
large volumes of transactions across swap, security-based swap and reference security
markets. The Commission has previously estimated that of the total 55 entities expected
to register with the Commission as SBS Entities, up to 35 entities are registered with the
CFTC as Swap Entities, and up to 16 entities are registered with the Commission as
broker-dealers. 1590 Since broker-dealers registered with the Commission and Swap
Entities registered with the CFTC are required to join an SRO, the majority of SBS
Entities may already be subject to CFTC and SRO oversight. Therefore, we anticipate
that many of the entities expected to register as SBS Entities and become subject to the
Commission’s final business conduct rules may have already brought their business into
compliance with CFTC business conduct requirements and SRO rules, among others.
The Commission has sought to harmonize, to the extent practicable, the final business
conduct requirements with existing requirements applicable to SBS Dealers and brokerdealers. Obligations imposed on SBS Entities in this rulemaking are modeled on, and
1589

U.S. Activity Proposing Release, 80 FR at 27458, supra note 9.

572

largely similar to, obligations applicable to Swap Entities and registered broker-dealers.
These obligations include disclosure, know-your-customer, suitability, pay-to-play,
supervision, and compliance responsibilities. The Commission has also considered the
implications of certain business conduct rules regarding special entities subject to
ERISA. DOL staff has stated that the final business conduct standards neither conflict
with DOL regulations nor compel SBS Entities to engage in fiduciary conduct, as
discussed in Section II.D supra.
As discussed in the economic baseline, extensive cross-market participation of
dealers and non-dealer counterparties in swap, security-based swap and reference
security markets points to a high degree of market integration. The Commission has
sought to harmonize, to the extent practicable, final business conduct requirements with
other existing rules, which may result in efficiencies and lower incremental economic
costs for cross-registered SBS Entities and their counterparties than might have
otherwise resulted. 1591
Nonetheless, the Commission recognizes – as reflected in the economic analysis –
that the final rules establish new requirements applicable to SBS Entities, and that
complying with these requirements will entail costs to SBS Entities. In considering the
economic consequences of these final rules we have been mindful of the direct and
indirect costs these rules will impose on market participants, as well as the effect of

1591

A number of commenters recommended the Commission to harmonize external
business conduct rules with those of the CFTC. See, e.g., Barnard, supra note 5;
Levin, supra note 5; APPA, supra note 5; BlackRock, supra note 5; NABL, supra
note 5; Nomura, supra note 5; AFGI (July 2013), supra note 5; ISDA (July 2013),
supra note 5; Barnard (July 2015), supra note 10; and SIFMA (August 2015),
supra note 5.

573

various business conduct requirements on the ability of counterparties to transact with
SBS Entities. We have considered the likely costs and benefits of the final business
conduct requirements for SBS Entities, counterparties in security-based swap markets,
investors in reference security markets, as well as stakeholders in special entities, such
as taxpayers, pension holders, endowment beneficiaries, and investors in municipal
securities. We have also considered how various types of market participants may
respond to the obligations and safe harbors in these final rules.
Some of these final rules impose requirements on SBS Dealers only, whereas
others apply to transactions by both SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants. These
final rules have considered potential differences between the roles SBS Dealers and
Major SBS Participants in security-based swap markets. As discussed in the sections
that follow, registered SBS Dealers are expected to intermediate large volumes of
security-based swaps and to transact with many hundreds or thousands of counterparties,
whereas Major SBS Participants will be holding significant positions in SBS without
intermediating significant volumes of deals. 1592 As discussed in Regulation SBSR, SBS
Dealers manage large changes in exposure to reference entities (inventory risk). 1593
Large CDS transactions on a particular reference entity create large inventory positions
that affect SBS Dealers’ exposure to the credit risk of reference assets. SBS Dealers
may actively manage inventory risks that they do not want to bear by entering into
offsetting contracts that diversify or hedge new risk exposures. Doing so requires
finding market participants, typically in the interdealer market, who are willing to act as
1592

See Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30751-30756, supra note 115.

1593

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR at 14617, infra note 1602.

574

counterparties to these offsetting contracts. 1594 Further, as discussed above, SBS
Dealers observe order flow and may be involved in arranging or structuring securitybased swaps, enjoying informational advantages relative to their non-dealer
counterparties. In contrast, participants required to register as Major SBS Participants
will have accumulated large positions in security-based swaps but have dealing activity
below the de minimis threshold. As a result of their substantial positions, Major SBS
Participants may be susceptible to market risks. We have considered these differences
in risks arising from the security-based swap activity of the two types of SBS Entities.
We have also taken into account comments regarding the different application of
various business conduct requirements to SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants, 1595
including one comment that imposition of “dealer-like” obligations on Major SBS
Participants may undermine market development, and reduce competition and
counterparty choice. 1596 The Commission recognizes that SBS Dealers serve as the
points of connection in security-based swap markets, whereas Major SBS Participants
may have greater market impacts and risks associated with holding larger security-based
swap positions. As discussed in Section II, these final rules are intended to provide
counterparty protections and reduce information asymmetries. The Commission is

market” (October 17, 2014) at 5, available at http://www.sec.gov/comments/s734-10/s73410-184.pdf. The analysis uses DTCC-TIW data to describe how SBS
Dealers manage inventory risk by hedging. Also see FN14 citing to Hansch,
Oliver, Narayan Y. Naik, and S. Viswanathan. “Do inventories matter in
dealership markets? Evidence from the London Stock Exchange.” The Journal of
Finance 53, no. 5 (1998): 1623-1656

575

imposing counterparty status verification, disclosure, fair and balanced communications,
supervision, antifraud, CCO rules and rules related to counterparties of special entities
on both SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants. The final rules limit the scope of
“know your counterparty”, suitability, pay to play and certain special entity rules to SBS
Dealers. Therefore, counterparties of Major SBS Participants, as well as counterparties
of SBS Dealers, may benefit from counterparty protections and information benefits of
these final rules. At the same time, Major SBS Participants will not be subject to the full
range of business conduct obligations where business conduct requirements are not
expressly addressed by the Dodd-Frank Act or the statute applies a requirement only to
SBS Dealers. We further discuss these considerations in the sections that follow.
We recognize that costs of rules imposed on Major SBS Participants may be
passed on to counterparties in the form of transaction costs or a decreased willingness to
intermediate transactions with non-SBS or Swap Entity counterparties. As reflected in
the economic baseline, the Commission estimates that of the 55 SBS Entities that may
register with the Commission, between zero and five entities may be Major SBS
Participants. The Commission also estimates that non-SBS Entity counterparties may
transact with a median of three and an average of four SBS Dealers per year. Should
Major SBS Participants become less willing to transact with non-SBS or Swap Entity
counterparties, SBS Dealers are likely to step in to intermediate OTC trades. As
articulated in prior sections, the Commission believes that imposing certain final
business conduct rules on both SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants may reduce
information asymmetries and enhance counterparty protections in security-based swap
markets.

576

Final business conduct rules reflect the informational advantage of SBS Entities
relative to other market participants. SBS Dealers enjoy informational advantages over
their non-SBS Entity counterparties. As we quantify in the economic baseline, interdealer transactions play a significant role in security-based swap markets, and securitybased swap activity is highly concentrated among a small number of dealers. SBS
Dealers observe deal flow, and may act in other capacities, such as in the capacity of
underwriters or arrangers, in relation to reference securities underlying security-based
swaps. Major SBS Participants may also be better informed about the risks and
valuations of security-based swaps due to their large positions in security-based swaps.
Therefore, compared to other counterparties, both SBS Dealers and Major SBS
Participants may be better informed and better able to assess material risks and
characteristics of security-based swaps. Final disclosure and suitability rules are limited
to security-based swap activities between SBS Entities and counterparties that are not
themselves SBS or Swap Entities. Other external business conduct rules explicitly
address conduct of SBS Entities when they act as counterparties or advisors to special
entities, such as employee benefit plans, municipalities and endowments.
The Commission has considered counterparty protections, information
asymmetries and risks arising from arm’s length and inter-affiliate transactions. Interaffiliate transactions may be conducted for the purposes of internal risk management
within a commonly controlled corporate group with generally aligned incentives and
few informational asymmetries, and may involve the same personnel acting in or on
behalf of both parties. Imposing business conduct requirements on transactions among
various control affiliates of the same SBS Entity is less likely to result in counterparty

577

protections, informational benefits or improvements in allocative efficiency, but would
result in additional costs and execution delays for SBS Entities. 1597 Similar to the
CFTC’s adopted approach, the final business conduct rules 240.15Fh-3(a)-(f), 240.15Fh4(b), and 240.15F-5 will apply to arm’s length transactions and exclude transactions that
SBS Entities enter into with their majority-owned affiliates.
The Commission notes that, where possible, it has attempted to quantify the costs,
benefits, and effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation expected to result
from adopting these rules. In many cases, however, the Commission is unable to
quantify the economic effects. Crucially, many of the relevant economic effects, such as
counterparty protections, information asymmetry, the ability of less informed market
participants to overcome information asymmetries, and the value of Commission
enforcement and oversight, are inherently difficult to quantify. In other cases, we lack
the information necessary to provide reasonable estimates. For example, we lack data
on business conduct practices of U.S. SBS Entities’ foreign branches; profitability of
SBS Dealer and Major SBS Participant transactions at various volume levels, by type
(SEF execution versus OTC/bespoke) and by counterparty (other SBS and Swap
Entities, special entities, all other counterparties); the magnitude of the conflicts of
interest related to the “pay to play” practices by SBS Entities with respect to special
entities and the degree of reliance of dually registered SBS Entities on covered
associates already subject to similar prohibitions; and how SBS Entities, new entrants,

As discussed in Section II.A, supra, all commenters recommended not applying
these final rules to inter-affiliate transactions. See ABA Securities Association,

5.

578

and counterparties, including those currently not transacting in security-based swap
markets, may react to specific business conduct rules. To the best of our knowledge, no
such data are publicly available and commenters have not provided data to allow such
quantification.
B.

Baseline

To assess the economic impact of the final rules described in this release, we are
using as our baseline the security-based swap market as it exists at the time of this
release, including applicable rules we have already adopted but excluding rules that we
have proposed but not yet finalized. 1598 The analysis includes the statutory provisions
that currently govern the security-based swap market pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act,
and rules adopted in the Definitions Adopting Release, the Cross-Border Adopting
Release, 1599 the SDR Registration Release, 1600 the SBS Entity Registration Adopting
Release, 1601 and the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 1602 along with U.S. Activity
rules, 1603 as these final rules—even if compliance is not yet required —are part of the
existing regulatory landscape that market participants expect to govern their securitybased swap activity.

1598

We also considered, where appropriate, the impact of rules and technical
standards promulgated by other regulators, such as the CFTC and the European
Securities and Markets Authority, on practices in the security-based swap market.

The business conduct rules include a variety of standards for conduct by SBS
Entities when they transact with counterparties. While certain requirements apply to SBS
Entity transactions with all counterparties, some requirements will affect only SBS Entity
transactions with non-SBS or Swap Entities, others distinguish between SBS Dealers and
Major SBS Participants, and yet others offer relief for anonymous transactions. The
following sections describe current security-based swap market activity, participants,
common dealing structures, counterparties, and patterns of cross-border and cross-market
participation.
1.

Available Data Regarding Security-Based Swap Activity

Our understanding of the market is informed in part by available data on securitybased swap transactions, though we acknowledge that limitations in the data limit the
extent to which we can quantitatively characterize the market. 1604 Because these data do
not cover the entire market, we have developed an understanding of market activity using
a sample of transactions data that includes only certain portions of the market. We
believe, however, that the data underlying our analysis here provide reasonably
comprehensive information regarding single-name CDS transactions and the composition
of participants in the single-name CDS market.
Specifically, our analysis of the state of the current security-based swap market is
based on data obtained from the DTCC Derivatives Repository Limited Trade
Information Warehouse (“TIW”), especially data regarding the activity of market

1604

We also rely on qualitative information regarding market structure and evolving
market practices provided by commenters, both in letters and in meetings with
Commission staff, and knowledge and expertise of Commission staff.

580

participants in the single-name CDS market during the period from 2008 to 2014.
According to data published by the Bank for International Settlements (“BIS”), the global
notional amount outstanding in single-name CDS was approximately $9.04 trillion, 1605 in
multi-name index CDS was approximately $6.75 trillion, and in multi-name, non-index
CDS was approximately $611 billion. The total gross market value outstanding in singlename CDS was approximately $366 billion, and in multi-name CDS instruments was
approximately $227 billion. 1606 The global notional amount outstanding in equity
forwards and swaps as of December 2014 was $2.50 trillion, with total gross market
value of $177 billion. 1607 As these figures show (and as we have previously noted),
although the definition of security-based swaps is not limited to single-name CDS,
single-name CDS contracts make up a majority of security-based swaps, and we believe
that the single-name CDS data are sufficiently representative of the market to inform our
analysis of the state of the current security-based swap market. 1608

1605

The global notional amount outstanding represents the total face amount used to
calculate payments under outstanding contracts. The gross market value is the
cost of replacing all open contracts at current market prices.

1606

See semi-annual OTC derivatives statistics at December 2014, Table 19, available
at http://www.bis.org/statistics/dt1920a.pdf (accessed Jul. 29, 2015).

1607

These totals include both swaps and security-based swaps, as well as products that
are excluded from the definition of “swap,” such as certain equity forwards.

1608

While other repositories may collect data on transactions in total return swaps on
equity and debt, we do not currently have access to such data for these products
(or other products that are security-based swaps). Consistent with the CrossBorder Proposing Release, we believe that data related to single-name CDS
provide reasonably comprehensive information for purposes of this analysis, as
such transactions appear to constitute roughly 74 percent of the security-based
swap market as measured on the basis of gross notional outstanding. See CrossBorder Proposing Release, 78 FR 31120 n.1301.
Also consistent with our approach in that release, with the exception of the
analysis regarding the degree of overlap between participation in the single-name

581

We note that the data available to us from TIW do not encompass those CDS
transactions that both: (i) do not involve U.S. counterparties; 1609 and (ii) are based on
non-U.S. reference entities. Notwithstanding this limitation, the TIW data should provide
sufficient information to permit us to identify the types of market participants active in
the security-based swap market and the general pattern of dealing within that market. 1610
2.

Security-Based Swap Market: Market Participants and
Dealing Structures
a.

Security-Based Swap Market Participants

Activity in the security-based swap market is concentrated among a relatively
small number of entities that act as dealers in this market. In addition to these entities,

CDS market and the index CDS market (cross-market activity), our analysis
below does not include data regarding index CDS as we do not currently have
sufficient information to classify index CDS as swaps or security-based swaps.
1609

Following publication of the Warehouse Trust Guidance on CDS data access,
TIW surveyed market participants, asking for the physical address associated with
each of their accounts (i.e., where the account is organized as a legal entity). This
physical address is designated the registered office location by TIW. When an
account reports a registered office location, we have assumed that the registered
office location reflects the place of domicile for the fund or account. When an
account does not report a registered office location, we have assumed that the
settlement country reported by the investment adviser or parent entity to the fund
or account is the place of domicile. Thus, for purposes of this analysis, we have
classified accounts as “U.S. counterparties” when they have reported a registered
office location in the United States. We note, however, that this classification is
not necessarily identical in all cases to the definition of “U.S. person” under
Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4).

1610

The challenges we face in estimating measures of current market activity stem, in
part, from the absence of comprehensive reporting requirements for securitybased swap market participants. The Commission has adopted rules regarding
trade reporting, data elements, and public reporting for security-based swaps that
are designed to, when fully implemented, provide the Commission with additional
measures of market activity that will allow us to better understand and monitor
activity in the security-based swap market. See Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release, 80 FR at 14699-14700, supra note 1602.

582

thousands of other participants appear as counterparties to security-based swap contracts
in our sample, and include, but are not limited to, investment companies, pension funds,
private (hedge) funds, sovereign entities, and industrial companies. We observe that
most non-dealer users of security-based swaps do not engage directly in the trading of
swaps, but trade through banks, investment advisers, or other types of firms acting as
dealers or agents. Based on an analysis of the counterparties to trades reported to the
TIW, there are 1,875 entities that engaged directly in trading between November 2006
and December 2014. 1611
As shown in Table 1, below, close to three-quarters of these entities (DTCCdefined “firms” shown in TIW, which we refer to here as “transacting agents”) were
identified as investment advisers, of which approximately 40 percent (about 30 percent of
all transacting agents) were registered as investment advisers under the Advisers Act. 1612
Although investment advisers comprise the vast majority of transacting agents, the
transactions they executed account for only 11.5 percent of all single-name CDS trading
1611

These 1,875 entities, which are presented in more detail in Table 1, below,
include all DTCC-defined “firms” shown in TIW as transaction counterparties
that report at least one transaction to TIW as of December 2014. The staff in the
Division of Economic and Risk Analysis classified these firms, which are shown
as transaction counterparties, by machine matching names to known third-party
databases and by manual classification. See, e.g., Cross-Border Proposing
Release, 78 FR 31120, n. 1304, supra note 6. Manual classification was based in
part on searches of the EDGAR and Bloomberg databases, the SEC’s Investment
Adviser Public Disclosure database, and a firm’s public website or the public
website of the account represented by a firm. The staff also referred to ISDA
protocol adherence letters available on the ISDA website.

1612

See 15 U.S.C. 80b1–80b21. Transacting agents participate directly in the
security-based swap market, without relying on an intermediary, on behalf of
principals. For example, a university endowment may hold a position in a
security-based swap that is established by an investment adviser that transacts on
the endowment’s behalf. In this case, the university endowment is a principal that
uses the investment adviser as its transacting agent.

583

activity reported to the TIW, measured by number of transaction-sides (each transaction
has two transaction sides, i.e., two transaction counterparties). The vast majority of
transactions (83.7 percent) measured by number of transaction-sides were executed by
ISDA-recognized dealers.

Principal holders of CDS risk exposure are represented by “accounts” in the
TIW. 1615 The staff’s analysis of these accounts in TIW shows that the 1,875 transacting
agents classified in Table 1 represent 10,900 principal risk holders. Table 2, below,

Adjustments to these statistics reflect updated classifications of counterparties and
transactions classification resulting from further analysis of the TIW data.

1614

For the purpose of this analysis, the ISDA-recognized dealers are those identified
by ISDA as belonging to the G14 or G16 dealer group during the period: JP
Morgan Chase NA (and Bear Stearns), Morgan Stanley, Bank of America NA
(and Merrill Lynch), Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank AG, Barclays Capital,
Citigroup, UBS, Credit Suisse AG, RBS Group, BNP Paribas, HSBC Bank,
Lehman Brothers, Société Générale, Credit Agricole, Wells Fargo and Nomura.
See, e.g., http://www.isda.org/c_and_a/pdf/ISDA-Operations-Survey-2010.pdf.

1615

“Accounts” as defined in the TIW context are not equivalent to “accounts” in the
definition of “U.S. person” provided by Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i)(C).
They also do not necessarily represent separate legal persons. One entity or legal
person may have multiple accounts. For example, a bank may have one DTCC
account for its U.S. headquarters and one DTCC account for one of its foreign
branches.

classifies these principal risk holders by their counterparty type and whether they are
represented by a registered or unregistered investment adviser. 1616 For instance, banks in
Table 1 allocated transactions across 327 accounts, of which 23 were represented by
investment advisers. In the remaining 304 instances, banks traded for their own accounts.
Meanwhile, ISDA-recognized dealers in Table 1 allocated transactions across 75
accounts.

1616

Unregistered investment advisers include all investment advisers not registered
under the Investment Advisers Act and may include investment advisers
registered with a state or a foreign authority.

includes both groups of entities. Therefore, our analysis includes entities that may
opt out of the special entity status under these final rules. If many such entities

business conduct standards with regards to special entities. See Section VI.C.4.

insurance company, or a bank.

unregistered pooled investment vehicles, including hedge funds, private equity
funds, and venture capital funds.

Participant Domiciles

As depicted in Figure 1 above, domiciles of new accounts participating in the
market have shifted over time. It is unclear whether these shifts represent changes in the
types of participants active in this market, changes in reporting or changes in transaction
volumes in particular underliers. For example, the increased percentage of new entrants
that are foreign accounts may reflect an increase in participation by foreign account

See Section VI.B.1, supra (explaining how domiciles for firms were identified for
purposes of this analysis).

588

holders in the security-based swap market, and the increased percentage of the subset of
new entrants that are foreign accounts managed by U.S. persons also may reflect more
specifically the flexibility with which market participants can restructure their market
participation in response to regulatory intervention, competitive pressures, and other
stimuli. 1623 On the other hand, apparent changes in the percentage of new accounts with
foreign domiciles may reflect improvements in reporting by market participants to TIW,
an increase in the percentage of transactions between U.S. and non-U.S. counterparties,
and/or increased transactions in single-name CDS on U.S. reference entities by foreign
persons. 1624
c.

Market Centers

A market participant’s domicile, however, does not necessarily correspond to
where it engages in security-based swap activity. In particular, financial groups engaged
in security-based swap dealing activity operate in multiple market centers and carry out
such activity with counterparties around the world. 1625 Several commenters noted that
many market participants that are engaged in dealing activity prefer to use traders and
manage risk for security-based swaps in the jurisdiction where the underlier is traded.
Thus, although a significant amount of the dealing activity in security-based swaps on

1624

As noted above, the available data do not include all security-based swap
transactions but only transactions in single name CDS that involve either (1) at
least one account domiciled in the United States (regardless of the reference
entity) or (2) single-name CDS on a U.S. reference entity (regardless of the U.S.person status of the counterparties).

589

U.S. reference entities involves non-U.S. dealers, we understand that these dealers tend to
carry out much of the security-based swap trading and related risk-management activities
in these security-based swaps within the United States. 1626 Some dealers have explained
that being able to centralize their trading, sales, risk management and other activities
related to U.S. reference entities in U.S. operations (even when the resulting transaction
is booked in a foreign entity) improves the efficiency of their dealing business.
Consistent with these operational concerns and the global nature of the securitybased swap market, the available data appear to confirm that participants in this market
are in fact active in market centers around the globe. Although, as noted above, the
available data do not permit us to identify the location of personnel in a transaction, TIW
transaction records indicate that firms that are likely to be security-based swap dealers
operate out of branch locations in key market centers around the world, including New
York, London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Chicago, Sydney, Toronto, Frankfurt, Singapore and
the Cayman Islands. 1627
Given these market characteristics and practices, participants in the securitybased swap market may bear the financial risk of a security-based swap transaction in a
location different from the location where the transaction is arranged, negotiated, or
executed, or where economic decisions are made by managers on behalf of beneficial
owners. Market activity may also occur in a jurisdiction other than where the market
participant or its counterparty books the transaction. Similarly, a participant in the
1626

See id.

1627

TIW transaction records contain a proxy for the domicile of an entity, which may
differ from branch locations, which are separately identified in the transaction
records.

590

security-based swap market may be exposed to counterparty risk from a counterparty
located in a jurisdiction that is different from the market center or centers in which it
participates.

Common Business Structures for Firms Engaged in
Security-Based Swap Dealing Activity

A financial group that engages in a global security-based swap dealing business in
multiple market centers may choose to structure its dealing business in a number of
different ways. This structure, including where it books the transactions that constitute
that business and how it carries out market-facing activities that generate those
transactions, reflects a range of business and regulatory considerations, which each
financial group may weigh differently.
A financial group may choose to book all of its security-based swap transactions,
regardless of where the transaction originated, in a single, central booking entity. That
entity generally retains the risk associated with that transaction, but it also may lay off
that risk to another affiliate via a back-to-back transaction or an assignment of the
security-based swap. 1628 Alternatively, a financial group may book security-based swaps
arising from its dealing business in separate affiliates, which may be located in the
jurisdiction where it originates the risk associated with the security-based swap, or,
alternatively, the jurisdiction where it manages that risk. Some financial groups may

1628

See U.S. Activity Proposing Release, 80 FR 27463, supra note 9; Cross-Border
Proposing Release, 78 FR 30977-78, supra note 6.

591

book transactions originating in a particular region to an affiliate established in a
jurisdiction located in that region. 1629
Regardless of where a financial group determines to book its security-based
swaps arising out of its dealing activity, it is likely to operate offices that perform sales or
trading functions in one or more market centers in other jurisdictions. Maintaining sales
and trading desks in global market centers permits the financial group to deal with
counterparties in that jurisdiction or in a specific geographic region, or to ensure that it is
able to provide liquidity to counterparties in other jurisdictions, 1630 for example, when a
counterparty’s home financial markets are closed. A financial group engaged in a
security-based swap dealing business also may choose to manage its trading book in
particular reference entities or securities primarily from a trading desk that can take
advantage of local expertise in such products or that can gain access to better liquidity,
which may permit it to more efficiently price such products or to otherwise compete more
effectively in the security-based swap market. Some financial groups prefer to centralize
risk management, pricing, and hedging for specific products with the personnel
responsible for carrying out the trading of such products to mitigate operational risk
associated with transactions in those products.

1629

There is some indication that this booking structure is becoming increasingly
common in the market. See, e.g., “Regional swaps booking replacing global
hubs,” Risk.net (Sep. 4, 2015), available at: http://www.risk.net/riskmagazine/feature/2423975/regional-swaps-booking-replacing-global-hubs. Such
a development may be reflected in the increasing percentage of new entrants that
have a foreign domicile, as described above.

1630

These offices may be branches or offices of the booking entity itself, or branches
or offices of an affiliated agent, such as, in the United States, a registered brokerdealer.

592

The financial group affiliate that books these transactions may carry out related
market-facing activities, whether in its home jurisdiction or in a foreign jurisdiction,
using either its own personnel or the personnel of an affiliated or unaffiliated agent. For
example, the financial group may determine that another affiliate in the financial group
employs personnel who possess expertise in relevant products or who have established
sales relationships with key counterparties in a foreign jurisdiction, making it more
efficient to use the personnel of the affiliate to engage in security-based swap dealing
activity on its behalf in that jurisdiction. In these cases, the affiliate that books these
transactions and its affiliated agent may operate as an integrated dealing business, each
performing distinct core functions in carrying out that business.
Alternatively, the financial group affiliate that books these transactions may in
some circumstances, determine to engage the services of an unaffiliated agent through
which it can engage in dealing activity. For example, a financial group may determine
that using an interdealer broker may provide an efficient means of participating in the
interdealer market in its own, or in another, jurisdiction, particularly if it is seeking to do
so anonymously or to take a position in products that trade relatively infrequently. 1631 A
financial group may also use unaffiliated agents that operate at its direction. Such an
arrangement may be particularly valuable in enabling a financial group to service clients
or access liquidity in jurisdictions in which it has no security-based swap operations of its
own.
1631

We understand that interdealer brokers may provide voice or electronic trading
services that, among other things, permit dealers to take positions or hedge risks
in a manner that preserves their anonymity until the trade is executed. These
interdealer brokers also may play a particularly important role in facilitating
transactions in less-liquid security-based swaps.

593

We understand that financial group affiliates (whether affiliated with U.S.-based
financial groups or not) that are established in foreign jurisdictions may use any of these
structures to engage in dealing activity in the United States, and that they may seek to
engage in dealing activity in the United States to transact with both U.S.-person and nonU.S.-person counterparties. In transactions with non-U.S.-person counterparties, these
foreign affiliates may affirmatively seek to engage in dealing activity in the United States
because the sales personnel of the non-U.S.-person dealer (or of its agent) in the United
States have existing relationships with counterparties in other locations (such as Canada
or Latin America) or because the trading personnel of the non-U.S.-person dealer (or of
its agent) in the United States have the expertise to manage the trading books for
security-based swaps on U.S. reference securities or entities. We understand that some of
these foreign affiliates engage in dealing activity in the United States through their
personnel (or personnel of their affiliates) in part to ensure that they are able to provide
their own counterparties, or those of financial group affiliates in other jurisdictions, with
access to liquidity (often in non-U.S. reference entities) during U.S. business hours,
permitting them to meet client demand even when the home markets are closed. In some
cases, such as when seeking to transact with other dealers through an interdealer broker,
these foreign affiliates may act, in a dealing capacity, in the United States through an
unaffiliated, third-party agent.
e.

Current Estimates of Number of SBS Dealers and
Major SBS Participants

As discussed above, security-based swap activity is concentrated in a relatively
small number of dealers, which already represent a small percentage of all market
participants active in the security-based swap market. Based on analysis of 2014 data,

594

our earlier estimates of the number of entities likely to register as security-based swap
dealers remain largely unchanged. 1632 Of the approximately 50 entities that we estimate
may potentially register as security-based swap dealers, we believe it is reasonable to
expect 22 to be non-U.S. persons. 1633 Under the rules as they currently exist, we
identified approximately 170 entities engaged in single-name CDS activity, with all
counterparties, of $2 billion or more. Of those entities, 155 would be expected to incur
assessment costs to determine whether they meet the “security-based swap dealer”
definition. Approximately 57 of these entities are non-U.S. persons.
Many of these dealers are already subject to other regulatory frameworks under
U.S. law based on their role as intermediaries or on the volume of their positions in other
products, such as swaps. Available data supports our prior estimates, based on our
experience and understanding of the swap and security-based swap market that of the 55
firms that might register as SBS Dealers or Major SBS Participants, approximately 35
would also be registered with the CFTC as Swap Dealers or Major Swap Participants. 1634

1632

See Registration Adopting Release, 80 FR 49000, supra note 989.

1633

These estimates are based on the number of accounts in TIW data with total
notional volume in excess of de minimis thresholds, increased by a factor of two,
to account for any potential growth in the security-based swap market, to account
for the fact that we are limited in observing transaction records for activity
between non-U.S. persons to those that reference U.S. underliers, and to account
for the fact that we do not observe security-based swap transactions other than in
single-name CDS. See U.S. Activity Proposing Release, 80 FR 27452, supra note
9. See also Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR 30725, n.1457, supra note 115.

1634

Based on our analysis of 2014 TIW data and the list of swap dealers provisionally
registered with the CFTC, and applying the methodology used in the Definitions
Adopting Release, we estimate that substantially all registered security-based
swap dealers would also be registered as swap dealers with the CFTC. See U.S.
Activity Proposing Release, 80 FR 27458, supra note 9; Registration Adopting
Release, 80 FR 49000, supra note 989. See also CFTC list of provisionally

595

Based on our analysis of TIW data and filings with the Commission, we estimate that 16
market participants expected to register as SBS Dealers have already registered with the
Commission as broker-dealers and are thus subject to Exchange Act and FINRA
requirements applicable to such entities. Finally, as we discuss below, some dealers may
be subject to similar requirements in one or more foreign jurisdictions.
3.

Security-Based Swap Market: Levels of Security-Based Swap
Trading Activity

As already noted, firms that act as dealers play a central role in the security-based
swap market. Based on an analysis of 2014 single name CDS data in TIW, accounts of
those firms that are likely to exceed the SBS Dealer de minimis thresholds and trigger
registration requirements intermediated transactions with a gross notional amount of
approximately $8.5 trillion, over 60 percent of which was intermediated by top 5 dealer
accounts. 1635
These dealers transact with hundreds or thousands of counterparties.
Approximately 35 percent of accounts of firms expected to register as SBS Dealers and
observable in TIW have entered into security-based swaps with over 1,000 unique
counterparty accounts as of year-end 2014. 1636 Approximately 9 percent of these

registered swap dealers, available at:
http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/registerswapdealer.
1635

1636

Commission staff analysis of TIW transaction records indicates that
approximately 99 percent of single name CDS price-forming transactions in 2014
involved an ISDA-recognized dealer.
Many dealer entities and financial groups transact through numerous accounts.
Given that individual accounts may transact with hundreds of counterparties, we
may infer that entities and financial groups, which may have multiple accounts,
transact with at least as many counterparties as the largest of their accounts in
terms of number of counterparties.

596

accounts transacted with 500-1,000 unique counterparty accounts; another 35 percent
transacted with 100-500 unique accounts, and only 22 percent of these accounts
intermediated swaps with fewer than 100 unique counterparties in 2014. The median
dealer account transacted with 453 unique accounts (with an average of approximately
759 unique accounts). Non-dealer counterparties transact almost exclusively with these
dealers. The median non-dealer counterparty transacted with 3 dealer accounts (with an
average of approximately 4 dealer accounts) in 2014.
Figure 2 below describes the percentage of global, notional transaction volume in
North American corporate single-name CDS reported to the TIW between January 2008
and December 2014, separated by whether transactions are between two ISDArecognized dealers (interdealer transactions) or whether a transaction has at least one nondealer counterparty.
Figure 2 also shows that the portion of the notional volume of North American
corporate single-name CDS represented by interdealer transactions has remained fairly
constant and that interdealer transactions continue to represent a significant majority of
trading activity even as notional volume has declined over the past six years, 1637 from
more than $6 trillion in 2008 to less than $3 trillion in 2014. 1638 The high level of
interdealer trading activity reflects the central position of a small number of dealers, each
of which intermediates trades with many hundreds of counterparties. While we are
1637

The start of this decline predates the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and the
proposal of rules thereunder, which is important to note for the purpose of
understanding the economic baseline for this rulemaking.

1638

This estimate is lower than the gross notional amount of $8.5 trillion noted above
as it includes only the subset of single-name CDS referencing North American
corporate documentation, as discussed above.

597

unable to quantify the current level of trading costs for single-name CDS, those dealers
appear to enjoy market power as a result of their small number and the large proportion
of order flow they privately observe.

Against this backdrop of declining North American corporate single-name CDS
activity, about half of the trading activity in North American corporate single-name CDS
reflected in the set of data we analyzed was between counterparties domiciled in the
United States and counterparties domiciled abroad, as shown in Figure 3 below. Using
the self-reported registered office location of the TIW accounts as a proxy for domicile,

1639

Adjustments to these statistics from the proposal reflect additional analysis of
TIW data. Cf. Registration Adopting Release, 80 FR 49001, supra note 989
(showing slightly different values for 2012 through 2014). For the purposes of
this analysis, we assume that same-day cleared transactions reflect inter-dealer
activity.

598

we estimate that only 12 percent of the global transaction volume by notional volume
between 2008 and 2014 was between two U.S.-domiciled counterparties, compared to 48
percent entered into between one U.S.-domiciled counterparty and a foreign-domiciled
counterparty and 40 percent entered into between two foreign-domiciled
counterparties. 1640
If we consider the number of cross-border transactions instead from the
perspective of the domicile of the corporate group (e.g., by classifying a foreign bank
branch or foreign subsidiary of a U.S. entity as domiciled in the United States), the
percentages shift significantly. Under this approach, the fraction of transactions entered
into between two U.S.-domiciled counterparties increases to 32 percent, and to 51 percent
for transactions entered into between a U.S.-domiciled counterparty and a foreigndomiciled counterparty.
By contrast, the proportion of activity between two foreign-domiciled
counterparties drops from 40 percent to 17 percent. This change in respective shares
based on different classifications suggests that the activity of foreign subsidiaries of U.S.
firms and foreign branches of U.S. banks accounts for a higher percentage of securitybased swap activity than U.S. subsidiaries of foreign firms and U.S. branches of foreign
banks. It also demonstrates that financial groups based in the United States are involved
in an overwhelming majority (approximately 83 percent) of all reported transactions in
North American corporate single-name CDS.

1640

For purposes of this discussion, we have assumed that the registered office
location reflects the place of domicile for the fund or account, but we note that
this domicile does not necessarily correspond to the location of an entity’s sales or
trading desk. See U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR 8607

599

Financial groups based in the United States are also involved in a majority of
interdealer transactions in North American corporate single-name CDS. Of transactions
on North American corporate single-name CDS between two ISDA-recognized dealers
and their branches or affiliates, 65 percent of transaction notional volume involved at
least one account of an entity with a U.S. parent.
In addition, we note that a significant majority of North American corporate
single-name CDS transactions occur in the interdealer market or between dealers and
non-U.S.-person non-dealers, with the remaining (and much smaller) portion of the
market consisting of transactions between dealers and U.S.-person non-dealers.
Specifically, 79.5 percent of North American corporate single-name CDS transactions
involved either two ISDA-recognized dealers or an ISDA-recognized dealer and a nonU.S.-person non-dealer. Approximately 20 percent of such transactions involved an
ISDA-recognized dealer and a U.S.-person non-dealer.

computed from January 2008 through December 2014.

Global Regulatory Efforts

In 2009, leaders of the G20—whose membership includes the United States, 18
other countries, and the European Union (“EU”)—addressed global improvements in the
OTC derivatives markets. They expressed their view on a variety of issues relating to
OTC derivatives contracts. In subsequent summits, the G20 leaders have returned to
OTC derivatives regulatory reform and encouraged international consultation in
developing standards for these markets. 1641
Many SBS Dealers likely will be subject to foreign regulation of their securitybased swap activities that are similar to regulations that may apply to them pursuant to
1641

See, e.g., G20 Leaders’ Final Declaration, November 2011, para. 24 available at:
https://g20.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Declaration_eng_Cannes.pdf.

601

Title VII, even if the relevant foreign jurisdictions do not classify certain market
participants as “dealers” for regulatory purposes. Some of these regulations may
duplicate, and in some cases conflict with, certain elements of the Title VII regulatory
framework.
Foreign legislative and regulatory efforts have focused on five general areas:
moving OTC derivatives onto organized trading platforms, requiring central clearing of
OTC derivatives, requiring post-trade reporting of transaction data for regulatory
purposes and public dissemination of anonymized versions of such data, establishing or
enhancing capital requirements for non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives transactions,
and establishing or enhancing margin and other risk mitigation requirements for noncentrally cleared OTC derivatives transactions. Foreign jurisdictions have been actively
implementing regulations in connection with each of these categories of requirements.
Regulatory transaction reporting requirements are in force in a number of jurisdictions
including the EU, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India,
Indonesia, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore; other jurisdictions
are in the process of proposing legislation and rules to implement these requirements. 1642
In addition, a number of major foreign jurisdictions have initiated the process of
implementing margin and other risk mitigation requirements for non-centrally cleared

OTC derivatives transactions. 1643 Several jurisdictions have also taken steps to
implement the Basel III recommendations governing capital requirements for financial
entities, which include enhanced capital charges for non-centrally cleared OTC
derivatives transactions. 1644
5.

Dually Registered Entities

We expect the magnitude of the above economic costs, benefits, and effects on
efficiency, competition and capital formation to depend on the extent to which SBS
Entities are already complying with similar business conduct rules. As discussed
extensively in the baseline and in the sections that follow, most entities expected to
register with the Commission and become subject to these final business conduct
standards have registered with the CFTC as Swap Entities or with the Commission as
1643

In November 2015, the Financial Stability Board reported that 12 member
jurisdictions participating in its tenth progress report on OTC derivatives market
reforms had in force a legislative framework or other authority to require
exchange of margin for non-centrally cleared transactions and had published
implementing standards or requirements for consultation or proposal. A further
11 member jurisdictions had a legislative framework or other authority in force or
published for consultation or proposal. See Financial Stability Board, OTC
Derivatives Market Reforms Tenth Progress Report on Implementation
(November 2015), available at http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/wpcontent/uploads/OTC-Derivatives-10th-Progress-Report.pdf.

1644

In November 2015, the Financial Stability Board reported that 18 member
jurisdictions participating in its tenth progress report on OTC derivatives market
reforms had in force standards or requirements covering more than 90% of
transactions that require enhanced capital charges for non-centrally cleared
transactions. A further three member jurisdictions had a legislative framework or
other authority in force and had adopted implementing standards or requirements
that were not yet in force. An additional three member jurisdictions had a
legislative framework or other authority in force or published for consultation or
proposal. See Financial Stability Board, OTC Derivatives Market Reforms Tenth

broker-dealers. Therefore, they have already become subject to CFTC’s adopted external
business conduct rules and/or FINRA rules related to, among others, suitability,
communications with the public, supervision, and compliance. The Commission has
sought to harmonize the regulatory regimes in recognition of swap and security-based
swap market integration and extensive cross-market participation. As a result, some SBS
Entities may have already restructured their activities to comply with many of the
substantive business conduct standards being adopted. Dually registered SBS Entities
that have already restructured their systems and activities to comply with parallel CFTC
and FINRA rules may incur lower costs relative to non-dually registered SBS Entities.
The specific economic costs, benefits, and effects on efficiency, competition, and capital
formation of various business conduct rules and requirements are discussed in further
detail in the sections that follow. Wherever practicable, we also evaluate the economic
effects of the various rules being adopted against these parallel rules, and other
reasonable alternatives.
6.

Cross-Market Participation

As noted above, persons registered as SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants
are likely also to engage in swap activity, which is subject to regulation by the CFTC. 1645
This overlap reflects the relationship between single-name CDS contracts, which are
security-based swaps, and index CDS contracts, which may be swaps or security-based
swaps. A single-name CDS contract covers default events for a single reference entity or
reference security. Index CDS contracts and related products make payouts that are

1645

See U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR 8609; Registration Adopting Release,
80 FR 49000, supra note 989.

604

contingent on the default of index components and allow participants in these instruments
to gain exposure to the credit risk of the basket of reference entities that comprise the
index, which is a function of the credit risk of the index components. A default event for
a reference entity that is an index component will result in payoffs on both single-name
CDS written on the reference entity and index CDS written on indices that contain the
reference entity. Because of this relationship between the payoffs of single-name CDS
and index CDS products, prices of these products depend upon one another, 1646 creating
hedging opportunities across these markets.
These hedging opportunities mean that participants that are active in one market
are likely to be active in the other. Commission staff analysis of approximately 4,500
TIW accounts that participated in the market for single-name CDS in 2014 revealed that
approximately 3,000 of those accounts, or 67 percent, also participated in the market for
index CDS. Of the accounts that participated in both markets, data regarding transactions
in 2014 suggest that, conditional on an account transacting in notional volume of index
CDS in the top third of accounts, the probability of the same account landing in the top
third of accounts in terms of single-name CDS notional volume is approximately 64
percent; by contrast, the probability of the same account landing in the bottom third of
accounts in terms of single-name CDS notional volume is only 10 percent. 1647
1646

“Correlation” typically refers to linear relationships between variables;
“dependence” captures a broader set of relationships that may be more
appropriate for certain swaps and security-based swaps. See, e.g., Casella,
George and Roger L. Berger, “Statistical Inference” (2002), at 171.

1647

The Commission recently revised its methodology for estimating cross-market
participation of TIW accounts. This has resulted in an increase in the reported
number of accounts that participated in both markets relative to previous
Commission releases.

605

Similarly, since the payoffs of security-based swaps are dependent upon the value
of underlying securities, activity in the security-based swap market can be correlated with
activity in underlying securities markets. Security-based swaps may be used in order to
hedge or speculate on price movements of reference securities or the credit risk of
reference securities. For instance, prices of both CDS and corporate bonds are sensitive
to the credit risk of underlying reference securities. As a result, trading across markets
may sometimes result in information and risk spillovers between these markets, with
informational efficiency, pricing and liquidity in the security-based swap market
affecting informational efficiency, pricing, and liquidity in markets for related assets,
such as equities and corporate bonds. 1648

The baseline against which we are assessing the potential effects of the pay to
play prohibitions in these final business conduct rules reflects MSRB Rules G-37 and G38, SEC Rule 206(4)-5 under the Advisers Act, as well as CFTC Regulation 23.451.
First, we note that MSRB rules G-37 and G-38 are currently effective and are part of the
economic baseline. Second, Rule 206(4)-5 prohibits an adviser and its covered associates
from providing or agreeing to provide, directly or indirectly, payment to any third party
for solicitation of advisory business from any government entity on such adviser’s behalf
unless such third party is a “regulated person,” defined in Rule 206(4)-5 as (i) an SECregistered investment adviser, (ii) a registered broker or dealer subject to pay-to-play
rules adopted by a registered national securities association, or (iii) a registered municipal
advisor that is subject to pay-to-play rules adopted by the MSRB (“third-party solicitor
ban”). Although the compliance date for the third-party solicitor ban was July 31, 2015,
the Division of Investment Management stated that it will not recommend enforcement
action to the Commission with respect to the third-party solicitor ban until the later of (1)
the effective date of a FINRA pay-to-play rule or (2) the effective date of an MSRB payto-play rule for registered municipal advisors. 1649 Therefore, certain parts of Rule
206(4)-5—the prohibition from receiving compensation for advising government entities
for two years after certain contributions are made, and the prohibition from coordinating
and soliciting contributions to government officials and parties--enter into our economic
baseline.

Third, Commodity Exchange Act Rule 23.451 prohibits Swap Dealers from
offering to enter or entering into a swap with governmental special entities within two
years of any contribution to an official of such entity by the Swap Dealer or any covered
associate. The CFTC has similarly stated that the rule is intended to deter fraud and
undue influence that harms the public, and to promote consistency in the business
conduct standards that apply to financial market professionals dealing with municipal
entities. However, CFTC Letter No. 12-33 provided no-action relief from Regulation
23.451 to Swap Dealers and their covered associates with respect to “governmental
plans” defined in Section 3 of ERISA, to the extent that such plans are not otherwise
covered by SEC and/or MSRB rules. The CFTC has also clarified that the two year
“look-back” period does not include any time period that precedes the date on which an
entity is required to register as a Swap Dealer. 1650
As indicated above, we estimate that up to 35 of 55 entities seeking to register as
SBS Entities may be registered with the CFTC as Swap Entities. Additionally, based on
an analysis of 2014 TIW data on accounts likely to trigger SBS Dealer registration
requirements, we have identified 18 entities belonging to a corporate group with at least
one MSRB registered broker-dealer or bank-dealer. 1651 Finally, as discussed in section V,
the Commission continues to estimate that the overwhelming majority of independent
representatives of special entities subject to these final rules are likely already registered

as municipal advisors. 1652 As a result of the pay to play rules currently in effect, some
SBS Entities and third-party independent advisers of special entities may have
restructured their business practices in various markets to comply with certain restrictions
imposed by pay to play rules on investment advisers, municipal advisors, and SBS
Entities discussed above.
C.

Costs and Benefits of Business Conduct Rules
1.

Verification of Status and Know Your Counterparty Rules

Rule 15Fh-3(a)(1) requires an SBS Entity to verify that a counterparty meets the
standards for an eligible contract participant before entering into a security-based swap
with the counterparty, except for transactions executed on a registered national securities
exchange. Rule 15Fh-3(a)(2) requires SBS Entities to verify whether a known
counterparty is a special entity before entering into a security-based swap with that
counterparty, except for transactions executed on a registered or exempt SEF or
registered national securities exchange, where the SBS Entity does not know the identity
of the counterparty at a reasonably sufficient time prior to execution of the transaction to
permit compliance with obligations of the rule. Rule 15Fh-3(a)(3) requires SBS Entities
to verify whether a counterparty is eligible to elect not to be a special entity under Rule

1652

As of January 1, 2016 there were 665 municipal advisors registered with the
Commission (http://www.sec.gov/help/foia-docs-muniadvisorshtm.html). Of
those, 381 indicated that they expect to provide advice concerning the use of
municipal derivatives or advice or recommendations concerning the selection of
other municipal advisors or underwriters with respect to municipal financial
products or the issuance of municipal securities. We expect that many of these
municipal advisors will also act as independent representatives for other special
entities. As discussed in Section V, the Commission estimates that approximately
385 municipal advisors will act as independent representatives to special entities
with respect to security-based swaps.

609

15Fh-2(d)(4) and, if so, notify such counterparty of its right to make such an election. 1653
Finally, Rule 15Fh-3(e) requires that SBS Dealers establish, maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to obtain and retain records of the essential
facts concerning each known counterparty necessary for conducting business with such
counterparties. The scope of such essential facts includes facts required to comply with
applicable laws, regulations and rules; facts required to implement the SBS Dealer’s
credit and operational risk management policies; and information regarding the authority
of persons acting for such counterparties. 1654
We recognize that many SBS Entities, in the course of business, already may be
conducting due diligence and fact gathering concerning their security-based swap
counterparties, which may reduce the economic effects of this rule.
The scope of the “know your counterparty” rule reflects differences in the roles of
entities likely to register as SBS Dealers and entities that may register as Major SBS
Participants. The Commission believes that entities that will register as SBS Dealers will
intermediate a large volume of security-based swap transactions as both principal risk
holders and agents transacting on behalf of principal risk holders, such as special entities.
As discussed in the economic baseline, we understand that entities currently operating as
dealers in security-based swap markets play a central intermediation role, transacting
with hundreds and thousands of non-dealer counterparties and accounting for large
activity volumes. At the same time, the Commission expects that Major SBS Participants
will hold large positions in security-based swaps, but have low volumes of security-based
1653

See Section II.H supra.

1654

The ability of SBS Entities to rely on representations to comply with these and
other business conduct rules is discussed in detail in the section VI.C.4 below.

610

swap activity. Hence, we expect Major SBS Participants may not play the central
intermediation role fulfilled by SBS Dealers.
These rules limit the scope of application of the “know your counterparty”
requirement to SBS Dealers, and exclude Major SBS Participants. As a result, entities
that may register as Major SBS Participants will not bear the costs of compliance with
this rule. At the same time, SBS Dealers will be required to comply and bear related
compliance costs. We note that this approach is substantially similar to the CFTC’s final
external business conduct rules, which limit the scope of “know your counterparty”
requirements to Swap Dealers. This results in a consistent treatment of entities that may
trigger both Major Swap Participant and Major SBS Participant registration requirements,
and will enable Major Swap Participants to enter into security-based swap positions
without bearing additional compliance costs to comply with our “know your
counterparty” requirement.
To the extent that SBS Dealers do not already collect and retain essential facts
about their counterparties as a part of their normal course of business, this requirement
will increase the cost to SBS Dealers of entering into security-based swaps. Specifically,
SBS dealers will incur costs of complying with the verification requirements and costs of
establishing, maintaining, and enforcing policies and procedures reasonably designed to
obtain and retain essential facts about each known counterparty that are necessary for
conducting business with such counterparty. We note that the ability to rely on
counterparty representations to fulfill the SBS Dealer diligence requirement partly lowers
compliance burdens, as reflected in our estimates. Further, to the extent that the majority
of SBS Entities have already cross-registered with the CFTC as Swap Entities and have

611

become subject to substantially similar verification and “know your counterparty”
requirements, and to the extent the majority of their counterparties transact across swap
and security-based swap markets and have already benefited from existing CFTC rules,
the economic effects of these final rules may be partly mitigated.
Direct costs of compliance with verification of status requirements related to
adherence to standardized protocols by SBS Entities that are not dually registered as
Swap Entities are estimated at, approximately, $17,600. 1655 As discussed in Section V,
these estimates include costs related to verification of counterparty’s eligibility to elect
not to be a special entity and notification of counterparties of their right to make such an
election. In addition, SBS Dealers will also be required to comply with “know your
counterparty” obligations, which will require a review of existing policies and procedures
and related documentation, involving an estimated initial cost of $95,000 for all SBS
Dealers. 1656 Further, direct ongoing costs of ”know your counterparty” obligations are
estimated at approximately $4,370,000 per year for all SBS Dealers. 1657
Increases in SBS Entity costs due to these obligations may be reflected in the
terms offered to counterparties, and increases in counterparty costs may affect their
willingness to transact in security-based swaps. Further, counterparties of SBS Entities
that are not also participating in swap markets and relying on the above protocols may
incur costs associated with the verification of status requirement and related adherence

1655

Initial outside counsel cost: $500 * (20 non-CFTC registered SBS Entities) =
$10,000. Initial adherence letter burden: (In-house attorney at $380 per hour) x 20
hours = $7,600

1656

Initial cost: (In-house attorney at $380 per hour) x 250 hours = $95,000.

1657

(In-house attorney at $380 per hour) x 11,500 hours = $4,370,000.

612

letters, estimated at approximately $3,051,840. 1658 As estimated in Section V,
counterparties or their agents will also be required to collect and provide essential facts to
the SBS Dealer to comply with the “know your counterparty” obligations for an initial
total cost estimate of approximately $41,420,000. 1659
We note that the eligible contract participant status verification requirement does
not apply to transactions executed on a registered national securities exchange. In
addition, the special entity status verification requirement does not apply to transactions
where the SBS Entity does not know the identity of the counterparty at a reasonably
sufficient time prior to execution of the transaction to permit compliance. This limits the
scope of the transactions covered by final rules, therefore potentially reducing the
expected benefits. However, since anonymous transactions will not be subject to these
requirements, the rule imposes lower costs, delays and implementation challenges with
respect to anonymous trades. This approach to anonymous transactions executed on
registered exchanges or SEFs may incentivize SBS Entities to trade through these venues,
to avoid imposition of these obligations under final business conduct rules. The
compliance costs imposed on SBS Entities by these and other business conduct
requirements (excluding anonymous transactions executed on a registered exchange or
SEF) may lead to a decrease in the volume of OTC bilateral security-based swap trades,
and an increase in the volume of transactions executed on exchanges or SEFs. This may
facilitate liquidity, price discovery and risk mitigation in these transparent venues, which
1658

Initial costs of disclosure of essential facts: $500 x (3,468 counterparties) =
$1,734,000. Initial costs of adherence letters: (In-house attorney at $380 per
hour) x 3,468 counterparties= $1,317,840. Total initial costs: $1,734,000 +
$1,317,840 = $3,051,840

1659

Initial cost: (In-house attorney at $380 per hour) x 109,000 hours = $41,420,000

613

may attract greater market participation. The overall effects will depend on the value of
disclosure and suitability requirements, customization and bilateral relationships in OTC
transactions, compared with the standardization, liquidity and execution quality of
contracts in SEFs and exchanges, among others.
As an alternative to the approach taken in the final rules, the Commission has
considered imposing specific requirements as to the form and manner of documentation.
Specific documentation requirements could result in greater information gathering and
documentation by SBS Entities fulfilling their status verification and “know your
counterparty” obligations, which may further strengthen counterparty protections and
reduce evasion. However, we recognize commenter concerns regarding costs and loss of
flexibility from imposing specific documentation requirements, and the importance of
private contractual negotiation, as well as the need to impose effective verification and
documentation requirements to facilitate enforcement. 1660 We therefore declined to adopt
this approach.
The Commission is adopting a “know your counterparty” requirement based on a
policies and procedures approach. However, the final rules explicitly delineate certain
items that the Commission believes are essential facts concerning the counterparty that
are necessary for conducting business with such counterparty. The CFTC has adopted a
substantially similar requirement for swap dealers to implement policies and procedures
reasonably designed to obtain and retain a record of the essential facts about each known
counterparty that are necessary for conducting business with such counterparty. As noted
earlier, in light of extensive cross-market participation between swap and security-based
1660

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5; CFA, supra note 5.

614

swap markets, and expected cross-registration of SBS Entities already complying with
CFTC’s business conduct rules, harmonization with the CFTC regime may facilitate
continued integration between these markets and may potentially reduce duplicative
compliance costs for some dual registrants.
2.

Disclosures and Communications

The Commission is adopting rules concerning SBS Entity disclosures of material
risks, characteristics, incentives, conflicts of interest and daily mark of security-based
swaps to their counterparties. The final rules also require SBS Entities to make a written
record of the non-written disclosures and provide a written version of these disclosures to
counterparties no later than the delivery of the trade acknowledgement for a particular
transaction. We note that the scope of the final disclosure requirements is limited to
counterparties that are not themselves SBS or Swap Entities, the economic effects of
which are discussed below.
Broadly, these disclosure rules may mitigate information asymmetries between
more informed SBS Entities and less informed counterparties, and may allow them to
make more informed decisions about capital allocation and counterparty selection. At the
same time, SBS Entities profit from information rents 1661 and, to the extent that

1661

Rents refer to profits that SBS Entities earn by trading with counterparties who
are less informed. In a market with competitive access to information, there is no
informational premium; SBS Entities only earn a liquidity premium. The
difference between the competitive liquidity premium and the actual profits that
SBS Entities earn is the economic rent. See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79
FR 47283.
As the Commission articulated in other releases, transparency stemming from the
SDR Rules and Regulation SBSR should reduce the informational advantage of
SBS dealers and promote competition among SBS dealers and other market

615

disclosures will inform their counterparties, SBS Entities may forgo profits on securitybased swaps with counterparties as a result of these requirements. In addition, SBS
Entities will incur direct compliance costs. As discussed in Section V and consistent with
our analysis in the Proposing Release, compliance with disclosure rules will involve an
initial cost burden of which has been estimated at approximately $25,080,000, with the
ongoing burden estimated at $2,508,000 for all SBS Entities. 1662 Similarly, the
Commission estimates that information technology infrastructure required to comply with
final disclosure rules will require will cost approximately $124,520,000 initially, and an
additional $62,260,000 per year for all SBS Entities. 1663 In addition, the Commission
estimates that SBS Entities will incur costs of evaluating whether more particularized
disclosures are necessary for each transaction and of developing the additional
disclosures for an ongoing aggregate estimated cost of $121,124,000. 1664 These and other
costs less amenable to quantification and discussed below may be passed on to
counterparties.
These rules may enhance transparency and protect counterparties, but may also
adversely affect the willingness of SBS Entities to intermediate OTC security-based
swaps with non-SBS or Swap Entity counterparties, and the costs of entering OTC

participants. See SDR Registration Release 80 FR at 14528, supra note 1202;
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 1602.
1662

Initial cost: (In-house attorney at $380 per hour) x 66,000 hours = $25,080,000.
Ongoing cost: (In-house attorney at $380 per hour) x 6,600 hours = $2,508,000.

1663

Initial cost: (Compliance manager at $283 per hour) x 440,000 hours =
$124,520,000. Ongoing cost: (Compliance manager at $283 per hour) x 220,000
hours = $62,260,000.

1664

Ongoing cost: (Compliance manager at $283 per hour) x 428,000 hours =
$121,124,000

616

security-based swaps for non-SBS or Swap Entity counterparties may increase. This
fundamental tradeoff is discussed in more detail in the sections below with respect to
individual disclosure requirements, their scope and implementation. The overall
economic effects of the final disclosure requirements will depend on the severity of
informational asymmetries and conflicts of interest in security-based swap markets, the
ability of some counterparties of SBS Entities to obtain similar information
independently without the required disclosures and the costs of doing so, 1665 and the
information content of the required disclosures, and the extent to which market
participants have already learned from similar disclosures pertaining to swap
transactions.
We note that the SBS Entities will not be required to comply with pre-transaction
disclosure requirements if the identity of the counterparty is not known to the SBS Entity
at a reasonably sufficient time prior to execution of the transaction to permit the SBS
Entity to comply with these obligations.
a.

Risks, Characteristics, and Conflicts of Interest

Rule 15Fh-3(b) requires SBS Entities to make disclosures concerning a security
based swap’s material risks and characteristics, and the SBS Entity’s material incentives
or conflicts of interest before entering into a security-based swap. In addition to
implementing the statutory requirements, the rule also requires SBS Entities to make a
written record of the non-written disclosures and provide a written version of these

1665

See Table 2 of the economic baseline, which shows the overwhelming majority of
most groups of non-dealer market participants are represented by investment
advisers in security-based swap transactions. See also, e.g., MFA, supra note 5.

617

disclosures to counterparties in a timely manner, but no later than the delivery of the trade
acknowledgement for a particular transaction.
In evaluating the economic effects of this rule, we note that security-based swaps
are complex products, and security-based swap markets are more opaque than markets
for regular equity or fixed income products. Security-based swap markets are
characterized by a high degree of informational asymmetry among various groups of
counterparties. As described in the economic baseline, dealers intermediate large
volumes of security-based swaps, observe quote solicitations and order flow. In addition,
SBS Dealers may serve in a variety of capacities such as placement agents, underwriters,
structurers, securitizers, and lenders in relation to security-based swaps and the securities
underlying them. Further, as outlined above, SBS Dealers generally have business
incentives that may be competing with those of their counterparties as a result of taking
on the opposite side of the transactions, and may have specific conflicts of interest due to
their advisory, market making, trader and other roles. As discussed in Section VI.A,
Major SBS Participants may also be better informed about the risks and valuations of
security-based swaps due to their large positions in security-based swaps, compared with
their non-SBS Entity counterparties.
At the same time, counterparties that are not SBS or Swap Entities do not observe
quote solicitations or order flow, and are less likely to arrange or structure security-based
swaps and their underlying securities. Such counterparties may also be generally less
informed about the nature and risks of security-based swaps due to their low volume of
activity, as indicated by the low transaction share of non-dealers in Table 1 of the
economic baseline. Many non-dealer counterparties transact in security-based swaps

618

through investment advisers; however approximately 7% transact in security-based swaps
directly. If the required disclosures are informative to non-SBS Entities, these final rules
may help less informed market participants make more informed counterparty and capital
allocation choices. The records requirement may facilitate the implementation of the
disclosure requirement, enabling counterparties to reference the non-written disclosures
made prior to entering into the swap during the life of the security-based swap.
As we have recognized, 1666 informational asymmetry can negatively affect market
participation and decrease the amount of trading—a problem commonly known as
adverse selection. 1667 When information about security-based swap risks, liquidity,
pricing and counterparty incentives is scarce, market participants may be less willing to
enter into transactions and the overall level of trading may fall. To the extent that adverse
selection costs are currently present in security-based swap markets, if market
participants become better informed as a result of these final rules, they may increase
their activity in security-based swaps, which may facilitate greater informational
efficiency and liquidity in security-based swap markets. Disclosures may inform
counterparties of SBS Entities about security-based swap markets, and counterparties
may learn from repeatedly accessing these markets. Hence, most of the benefits are
expected to be incurred by existing participants when the first disclosures are made, and
by new market participants when they first enter the market. However, to the extent that
disclosures will contain transaction-specific information concerning risks, incentives,

1666

See, e.g., Registration Adopting Release 80 FR at 49004, supra note 989

1667

See George A. Akerlof, The Market For “Lemons”: Quality Uncertainty and the
Market Mechanism, 84 Q.J. Econ. 488 (1970).

619

pricing and clearing of individual security-based swaps, the informational benefits
described above may persist.
At the same time, disclosures required under these proposed rules will involve
costs to SBS Entities and their counterparties. As discussed in Section V, SBS Entities
will bear direct compliance burdens related to the disclosures, which are reflected in our
compliance cost estimates above. In addition, since SBS Entities are more informed
about security-based swaps, they are able to extract information rents in the form of
higher markups and fees charged to non-dealer counterparties. If SBS Entity disclosures
better inform counterparties concerning characteristics and risks of security-based swaps,
these rules may reduce the informational advantage of SBS Entities relative to their
counterparties and decrease profitability of transactions with non-SBS Entity
counterparties, which may reduce incentives for dealers to provide liquidity to these
counterparties. 1668
We recognize that the above costs may be passed on to counterparties through
more adverse price and non-price terms of security-based swaps. To the extent that SBS
Entities may be unable to recover these costs, they may become less likely to
intermediate transactions with non-SBS or Swap Entity counterparties and decrease
participation in U.S. security-based swap markets. Further, since final business conduct

1668

For instance, Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) showed that because information is
costly, prices cannot perfectly reflect the information which is available, since if it
did, those who spent resources to obtain it would receive no compensation. In
other words, informational efficiency reduces incentives of economic agents to
expend resources to acquire information, and there is an equilibrium amount of
“disequilibrium”. See Sanford J. Grossman and Joseph E. Stiglitz, On the
Impossibility of Informationally Efficient Markets, 70 American Economic
Review 393-408 (1980).

620

rules require these disclosures to be made prior to entering into the security-based swap,
the disclosure requirements may involve some delays in execution and may affect
liquidity in security-based swaps, to the extent that these disclosures are not already being
made in master agreements or post trade acknowledgements. We have considered how
the timing, manner and content of disclosures may affect these competing considerations.
First, we recognize that the ability to rely on master agreements, standardized disclosures
and ex post trade acknowledgements of oral disclosures may significantly reduce ongoing
transaction specific costs and potential execution delays, as recognized by a
commenter, 1669 but may reduce the specificity and information content of disclosures. As
the Commission discussed in the Proposing Release, 1670 security-based swaps are
executed under master agreements and SBS Entities may elect to make required
disclosures in a master agreement or accompanying standardized document. However, as
stated in the Proposing Release and discussed in Section II, supra, standardized
disclosures will not be sufficient in all circumstances and certain provisions may need to
be tailored to the particular transaction, most notably pricing and other transactionspecific commercial terms.
We have considered commenter concerns that oral disclosures may not satisfy the
goal of pre-trade transparency, may make enforcement more difficult, and may allow
SBS Entities to obscure conflicts of interest and misrepresent risks until after trade
confirmation. 1671 However, we are sensitive to the fact that alternative requirements to

1669

621

provide extensive written disclosures of risks, characteristics, incentives and conflicts of
interest before an SBS Entity enters into a transaction with a counterparty may increase
transaction costs or impose execution delays, which may be particularly significant in
periods of high market volatility. We have received comments that a requirement to
provide these disclosures “at a reasonably sufficient time” prior to entering the securitybased swap transaction, in writing may better inform unsophisticated counterparties, 1672
however it may further raise the risks discussed above. These could result in potentially
significant execution delays, decreases in liquidity and SBS Entity willingness to
intermediate transactions with non-SBS or Swap Entity counterparties. We also note
that, as proposed, under the final rules, standardized disclosure will not be sufficient in all
circumstances: some forms of disclosure may be highly standardized, but certain
provisions will need to be tailored to reflect material characteristics of individual
transactions, most notably pricing and other transaction-specific commercial terms. The
CFTC’s approach to manner and form of disclosures is substantially similar to the
proposed requirements and to the rule being adopted. In the Proposing Release, the
Commission interpreted the statutory requirement to disclose material risks and
characteristics of the security-based swap itself, and not of the underlying reference
security or index. 1673 As an alternative, the Commission could include underliers in the
scope of required disclosures. Compared to the approach being adopted, the alternative
may help better inform less sophisticated investors and enable them to make better
tailored investment decisions. However, it may increase transactional costs and
1672

1673

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42407, supra note 3.

622

execution delays, which are particularly costly during times of high market volatility.
Further, information about many underliers, such as corporate, municipal and sovereign
bonds, is more likely to be publicly available.
We have received mixed comments on the relative balance of these competing
considerations with respect to underlier disclosures. 1674 Under the CFTC’s approach,
disclosures regarding underlying assets are not generally required, but to the extent that
payments or cash-flows of the swap are materially affected by the performance of an
underlying asset for which publicly available information is not available, the Swap
Entity is required to provide disclosure about the material risks and characteristics of the
underlying asset to enable the counterparty to assess the material risks of the swap. As
described in Section II, our final rules require disclosure regarding the referenced
security, index, asset or issuer if it would be considered material to investors in
evaluating the security-based swap, including any related payments.
Finally, we have considered the alternatives of adopting more prescriptive
requirements of characteristics to be disclosed, an explicit risk taxonomy, requirements
concerning volatility and liquidity metrics, and scenario analysis regarding political,
economic events and underlying market factors. These approaches also present a tradeoff
between informing investors and protecting counterparties, and costs and willingness of
SBS Entities to intermediate trades with non-SBS or Swap Entity counterparties, similar
to the effects described above.

CFA, supra note 5. Also see Section II.G.2 supra.

For instance, disclosure of a scenario analysis may inform counterparties, but may
be particularly costly since such analysis may depend on the specific terms of the
agreement. To the extent that the provision of scenario analysis will impose costs on SBS
Entities, a requirement to include scenario analysis as part of mandated disclosures may
result in bundling research and advice, with SBS intermediation functions for all affected
transactions. This would increase costs to SBS Entities, and these costs are likely to be
passed on to counterparties. Further, one commenter suggested that the requirement to
produce and disclose scenario analysis for each transaction may delay execution and
expose counterparties to market risk in times of market volatility. 1675
As an alternative, the CFTC’s approach allows counterparties to opt in to receive
the scenario analysis for swaps that are not available for trading on a SEF, and requires
Swap Dealers to disclose to counterparties their right to receive the scenario analysis.
The CFTC’s external business conduct rules do not prescribe whether and how swap
dealers may be able to charge for such analysis and we do not have data regarding
whether any counterparties are taking advantage of the rule provision. We understand
that counterparties already privately negotiate terms of over-the-counter derivatives with
SBS Dealers, which may also serve in advisory and other capacities. As discussed in the
economic baseline, non-dealer market participants are typically institutional investors, the
overwhelming majority of which rely on investment advisers in their security-based swap
activities. It is unclear that a requirement to disclose the right to receive a scenario
analysis would affect the demand for such analyses or inform counterparties.

1675

See SIFMA (August 2011), supra note 5.

624

The Commission has also considered an alternative of adopting prescriptive risk
taxonomies, and requiring disclosure of volatility and liquidity metrics. While these
requirements may reveal additional information to counterparties, they may be less
informative for customized over-the counter security-based swaps, may fail to capture
risks of new products, and would increase costs. To the extent that these requirements
would increase SBS Entity costs of transacting with non-SBS or Swap Entity
counterparties, these costs would also adversely affect terms of security-based swaps for
non-SBS or Swap Entity counterparties. Rule 15Fh-3(b)(2) also requires SBS Entities to
disclose any material incentives or conflicts of interest that an SBS Entity may have in
connection with the security swap, including any compensation or other incentives from
any source other than the counterparty. As articulated in Section II, this rule will not
require SBS Entities to report all profits or expected returns from the swap or related
hedging or trading activities, but will require reporting of incentives, such as revenue
sharing arrangements, from any source other than the counterparty in connection with the
swap. To the extent that disclosure informs counterparties regarding SBS Entity conflicts
of interest, counterparties of SBS Entities may become better able to make informed
decisions about security-based swaps and the SBS Entities they transact with. When SBS
Entity conflicts of interest are severe, disclosure of such conflicts may lead counterparties
to renegotiate the terms of a transaction or select another counterparty with fewer
conflicts of interest, contributing to more efficient capital allocation by non-dealer
counterparties. Importantly, this requirement does not prohibit material conflicts of
interest. Instead, the rule focuses on disclosure of material incentives and conflicts of
interest, which may help counterparties better evaluate the terms and risks of transacting

625

with an SBS Entity. The severity of these conflicts of interest in security-based swaps,
the awareness of non-SBS or Swap Entity counterparties about these conflicts, the
similarity between disclosures of conflicts already made by SBS Entities cross-registered
as Swap Entities under CFTC rules with disclosures that will be made under these final
rules, and the informativeness of the newly required disclosures will influence the
magnitude of the benefits described above.
We recognize that final external business conduct rules for Swap Entities are
already in place and include a similar set of conflict of interest disclosure rules. Swap
Entities are already disclosing incentives and conflicts of interest in swap transactions,
which enters into our economic baseline and is reflected in current market activity. NonSBS or Swap Entity counterparties that are transacting with the same dealers in both
swap and security-based swap markets have benefited from such disclosures in swap
markets, and may have already become familiar with standardized disclosures by Swap
Dealer counterparties. To the extent that disclosures by the same dealers related to, for
instance, index CDS and single name CDS may be similar, such counterparties may
enjoy fewer benefits of these final rules. However, we note that the rules being adopted
require disclosures specific to security-based swap transactions, and certain disclosures
will need to be tailored to a particular security-based swap.
In addition to direct costs of compliance born by SBS Entities, to the extent that
disclosures will provide new and relevant information about SBS Entity conflicts of
interest, SBS Entities with significant conflicts of interest may lose business to SBS
Entities that do not have such conflicts. While this requirement may impose costs on
those SBS Entities with the most acute conflicts, such disclosures may benefit less

626

conflicted SBS Entities, enhance protections of counterparties, and improve the ability of
market participants to make informed counterparty decisions.
We have considered the costs and benefits of an alternative requiring a disclosure
of the difference in compensation between selling a security-based swap versus another
product with similar economic terms, or expected profit of the SBS Entity from the
transaction, as suggested by some commenters. 1676 We do not believe that disclosure of
SBS Entity profits to counterparties would protect counterparties or improve their ability
to make suitable investment decisions, relative to the approach being adopted, and are not
adopting this alternative. SBS Entities compete for business on price, execution quality,
underlier and counterparty risks, among others. We understand that counterparties need
information about price, non-price terms and risks of the security-based swap and
conflicts of interest of the SBS Entity to be able to assess the relative merits of a
particular transaction. The final business conduct rules being adopted will require SBS
Entities to disclose to their non SBS Entity counterparties material characteristics and
risks of the transaction, as well as any compensation or incentives from any source other
than the counterparty in connection with the security-based swap. Rules 15Fh-3(c) and
15Fh-3(d), the economic effects of which are discussed below, will also require
disclosure of the daily mark and clearing rights. We also note that SDR Rules and
Regulation SBSR adopted by the Commission will introduce post-trade transparency to
security-based markets, and counterparties will have access to more extensive and more
accurate information upon which to make trading and valuation determinations when
compliance with these rules is required.
1676

See CFA, supra note 5; Levin, supra note 5.

627

SBS Entities are for-profit entities, buying security-based swaps from
counterparties seeking to sell them; and selling swaps to counterparties seeking to
purchase them. When SBS Entities carry balance sheet risk, they profit from directional
price moves that result in losses for their counterparties and so, they may have an
incentive to offload security-based swaps in their inventory on less informed non-dealer
counterparties, even where such security-based swaps are unsuitable. When SBS Entities
hedge their inventory risk and do not carry balance sheet exposure, they benefit from
charging higher costs and fees to their counterparties. SBS Entity business incentives
may, therefore, be generally competing with the interests or positions of their
counterparties. However, SBS Entities have reputational incentives and benefit from
intermediating a greater volume of trade which, all else given, mitigates this conflict.
Further, it is unclear that market participants are generally unaware of these competing
incentives.
SBS Entities act as principal risk holders and transacting agents effecting
security-based swaps on behalf of their customers. An SBS Entity’s expected return on a
security-based swap depends on, among others, price terms of the swap, cost of funds,
shorting constraints, balance sheet exposures, costs of underlying elements of the
security-based swap, and costs of structuring the security-based swap. It is unclear that
disclosure of expected profits of an SBS Entity has any bearing on a counterparty’s
expected cost of the transaction, quality of execution or assessment of the risks of a
security-based swap given the counterparty’s investment objectives, horizons, hedging

628

needs, financial condition etc. 1677 As a practical consideration, the SBS Entity’s expected
profit would depend on potentially proprietary data and valuation models, and numerous
assumptions about future market factors. At the same time, such a requirement would
impose direct costs of producing disclosures and potential reputational costs on SBS
Entities; if the costs become significant, some SBS Entities may reduce security-based
swap market activity with non-SBS or Swap Entity counterparties. We note that the rules
being adopted not only require disclosure of material characteristics, risks, conflicts of
interest or incentives, daily mark and clearing rights, but also include fair and balanced
communications, antifraud, supervision, compliance, and conduct requirements.
b.

Daily Mark

Rule 15Fh-3(c) requires SBS Entities to disclose the daily mark to counterparties
other than SBS or Swap Entities upon request. For cleared security-based swaps, the
rules require an SBS Entity to disclose, upon request of the counterparty, the daily mark
that the SBS Entity receives from the appropriate clearing agency. For uncleared swaps,
Rule 15Fh-3(c) implements the statutory provision and requires the SBS Entity make this
disclosure on a daily basis for any uncleared security-based swap by providing the
midpoint between the bid and offer, or the calculated equivalent thereof, as of the close of
business unless the parties agree in writing otherwise. The method for computing the
daily mark is not provided in the statute. For uncleared swaps, the SBS Entity would also
be able to use market quotations for comparable security-based swaps and model implied
valuations. The SBS Entity is also required to disclose data sources, methodologies and
1677

For instance, one commenter asserted that the best protection for a counterparty is
reviewing and selecting the best available pricing. See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra
note 5;

629

assumptions used to prepare the daily mark, and promptly disclose any material changes
to the above during the term of the security-based swap.
Similar to the economic effects of disclosures concerning material risks and
characteristics of security-based swaps, the overall impact of the daily mark disclosure
depends on the severity of the informational asymmetries between SBS Entities and
counterparties regarding market prices of security-based swaps; the amount of disclosure
unsophisticated counterparties require to become better informed; the informativeness of
the disclosures; and the direct and indirect costs of producing such disclosures by SBS
Entities. For cleared security-based swaps, the requirement to disclose the daily mark
from clearing agencies is an explicit statutory requirement, and provides a standardized
and comparable reference point for counterparties. 1678 As described above, based on the
current model for clearing security-based swaps, the security-based swap between the
SBS Entity and counterparty is terminated upon novation by the clearing agency. The
SBS Entity would no longer have any obligation to provide a daily mark to the original
counterparty because a security-based swap no longer exists between them. Therefore,
there would not be any ongoing burden on the SBS Entity.
The ability of SBS Entities to rely on quotes, model imputed prices or prices of
comparable security-based swaps to calculate the daily mark for uncleared swaps may
1678

We have received comment that SBS Entities may have direct or indirect
affiliations or relationships with clearing agencies and market data providers,
which may pose conflicts of interest. See Levin, supra note 5. Should such
conflicts exist, they may be partly mitigated by other substantive business conduct
requirements being adopted, such as the antifraud provision, requirement to
engage in fair and balanced communications, and other statutory obligations.
Further, counterparties will be able to select the venue in which security-based
swaps will be cleared and will benefit from SBS Entities’ disclosures of
incentives and conflicts of interest under these final rules.

630

produce valuations that are potentially superior to stale market prices on illiquid
contracts. However, we continue to recognize that SBS Entities may influence the daily
mark disclosed to their less sophisticated counterparties by varying modeling
assumptions, data sources and methodology which produce the daily mark, as supported
by some commenters. 1679 This tradeoff is partially mitigated by the requirement to
disclose data sources and a description of the methodology and assumptions used to
prepare the daily mark, and promptly disclose any material changes during the term of
the swap.
As we recognized in the Proposing Release, 1680 we anticipate significant
variability in the models and data sources, methodology and assumptions used by
different SBS Entities, leading to different daily marks being established for similar
security-based swaps. As a result, security-based swap market participants that consider
the daily mark as an indicator in the reporting of their positions may report different
valuations of similar security-based swap positions. However, we continue to believe
that since, as quantified in the economic baseline, non-dealer counterparties typically
transact with multiple dealers, counterparties may be able to observe and analyze
differences in security-based swap valuations across SBS Entities. We recognize that the
daily mark may not be a reliable reference point for estimating fair values, potential net
asset values or prices at which the security-based swap could be executed as suggested by

1679

See, e.g., Levin, supra note 5; IDC, supra note 5.

1680

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42449, supra note 3. Also see, e.g.,
FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

631

a commenter, 1681 however, we continue to believe that it may inform counterparty
understanding of their financial relationship with SBS Entities. 1682
We are sensitive to cost considerations, and recognize that costs borne by SBS
Entities as a result of the final business conduct rules may be passed on to counterparties
in the form of higher transaction costs. Further, if these costs are significant, SBS
Entities may reduce their security-based swap activity or become less willing to
intermediate swaps with certain groups of counterparties. As a result, liquidity, price
discovery and market access of certain groups of counterparties may be adversely
affected. As articulated in the Proposing Release, we understand that SBS Entities
routinely assess end-of-day values in the course of their business as an integral
component of risk management. We continue to believe that SBS Entities may already
be estimating values that may be used to fulfil the daily mark disclosure requirement,
and, therefore, to the extent this is the case, direct compliance costs of this requirement to
costs of producing disclosures may be less than estimated above.
One commenter indicated that requiring Major SBS Participants to comply with
the daily mark requirement for uncleared swaps would result in “significant, unnecessary
increased costs without any meaningful benefit.” 1683 We recognize that the broader
scope of this requirement will impose costs on Major SBS Participants, as reflected in our
compliance cost estimates. To the extent that Major SBS Participants may be better
informed about the risks and valuations of security-based swaps and more sensitive to

1681

1683

632

market risk due to their significant positions, disclosures of the daily mark may help their
non SBS Entity counterparties make more informed counterparty and valuation
determinations. We note that the rules being adopted provide all SBS Entities significant
flexibility with respect to how they may estimate the daily mark for uncleared swaps.
Specifically, similar to SBS Dealers, Major SBS Participants will be able to rely on
market quotes for similar swaps, model based prices or some combination thereof under
Rule 15Fh-3(c). The Commission continues to believe that informing counterparties’
understanding of their financial relationship with SBS Entities is an important benefit of
these final rules.
As discussed in Section II, supra, SBS Entities will not necessarily be able to use
the same mark for collateral purposes and for meeting the disclosure requirement. We
recognize commenter concern that this approach may impose additional costs of
estimating and disclosing a daily mark valuation on SBS Entities with respect to
transactions where both counterparties have agreed on a basis for margining uncleared
swaps. 1684 As discussed above, the Commission continues to believe that the daily mark
disclosure, as being adopted for the purposes of this rule, would provide a useful and
meaningful reference point for counterparties holding positions in uncleared securitybased swaps.
Currently, entities that are likely to trigger SBS Entity registration requirements
due to their volume of dealing activity are not required to disclose daily marks of
security-based swaps, or data sources, assumptions and methodologies used to calculate
them. While this requirement is currently effective in swap markets and some SBS
1684

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

633

Entities may be making such security-based swap specific disclosures voluntarily, these
final rules impose mandatory disclosure requirements on all SBS Entities in their
security-based swap transactions with counterparties that are not themselves SBS Entities
or Swap Entities. The requirement to disclose data sources, assumptions and
methodology used to calculate the value of security-based swaps may reduce the
informational advantage SBS Entities enjoy as a result of developing superior valuation
models or information, as supported by public comments. 1685 However, these costs are
partly mitigated by the ability to rely on standardized disclosures and a description of the
models, as opposed to disclosures of the models themselves.
c.

Clearing Rights

Finally, Rule 15Fh-3(d) requires SBS Entities to make disclosures regarding
clearing rights to counterparties that are not SBS Entities or Swap Entities before entering
into the security-based swap. For security-based swaps not subject to mandatory
clearing, the SBS Entity would be required to determine whether the security-based swap
is accepted for clearing by one or more clearing agencies, to disclose the names of
clearing agencies that accept the security-based swap for clearing, and to notify the
counterparty of their right to elect clearing and the agency used to clear the transaction.
For security-based swaps subject to mandatory clearing, the final rules require SBS
Entities to disclose clearing agency names to the counterparty, and to notify the
counterparty of their right to select the clearing agency subject to Section 3C(g)(5) of the
Act. The rule also requires SBS Entities to make a written record of the non-written

1685

See, e.g., MFA, supra note 5; IDC, supra note 5.

634

disclosures and provide counterparties with a written version of these disclosures no later
than the delivery of the trade acknowledgement of the transaction.
The required disclosure of clearing rights may increase how informed a
counterparty is concerning the availability of clearing in general, the ability to require
clearing of security-based swaps, as well as the names of clearing agencies that may
accept a given security-based swap for clearing. The reliance on standardized disclosures
may lead to more general and less transaction specific information being communicated,
reflecting information that has already been absorbed by market participants and
potentially reducing these benefits. To the extent that the rule results in greater
transparency concerning clearing rights, the volume of cleared security-based swaps may
increase.
We note that clearing is currently voluntary and available for CDS only. 1686
Disclosure of the clearing agencies that accept a security-based swap for clearing may
inform counterparties of the right to clear and of various clearing agencies that are able to
clear a given security-based swap, particularly clearing agencies that have just started
accepting a given security-based swap or group of security-based swaps for clearing.
This may enhance potential competition among clearing agencies in the future, which
may lower clearing costs or improve quality of clearing services. The above effect may
1686

Mandatory clearing is not currently in effect and we currently do not have
sufficient information to estimate the number and volume of security-based swap
transactions executed across different trading venues and using these various
execution practices. However, the Commission staff has performed an analysis of
voluntary clearing activity in single name CDS markets, which generally informs
our analysis. See SEC Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, Single-Name
Corporate Credit Default Swaps: Background Data Analysis on Voluntary
Clearing Activity, 15 (Apr. 2015), available at http://www.sec.gov/dera/staffpapers/white-papers/voluntary-clearing-activity.pdf.

635

be more significant if more clearing agencies register to clear security-based swaps and
clearing becomes available for security-based swaps other than CDS, which are currently
being cleared voluntarily.
Currently, SBS Entities are not yet required to register and are not subject to
substantive Title VII requirements, including business conduct rules. Therefore, SBS
Entities currently are not required to produce disclosures concerning clearing rights and a
list of clearing agencies accepting a security-based swap for clearing. Entities that are
currently registered with the CFTC as Swap Entities are required to make clearing rights
disclosures for swap transactions. Under these final rules, all SBS Entities will bear costs
of producing the clearing rights disclosures pertaining to security-based swap
transactions, and communicating them to their counterparties other than SBS Entities and
Swap Entities, as estimated in Sections V and VI.C above. However, we recognize that
these costs may be lower for dually registered SBS Entities that may have already
adjusted their systems and practices to comply with parallel CFTC rules. We also
recognize that if, as a result of the disclosure, some counterparties begin choosing to clear
as well as choosing the agency used to clear the transaction, SBS Entities may lose
potentially beneficial flexibility related to clearing, which may affect the price of
security-based swaps. In addition, if clearing rights disclosures lead to a greater volume
of transactions cleared through registered clearing agencies, increases in clearing costs
borne by SBS Entities may be passed on to counterparties.
3.

Suitability

SBS Dealers intermediate large volumes of security-based swaps, buying products
from counterparties seeking to sell them; and selling swaps to counterparties seeking to

636

purchase them. When SBS Dealer exposure is not hedged by offsetting transactions with
other dealers, SBS Dealers act as principal risk holders, benefiting from directional price
moves that result in losses for their counterparties, and vice versa. SBS Dealers carrying
inventory may have an incentive to recommend security-based swaps from their
inventory that may be unsuitable to their counterparties, but help to manage dealer
inventory risk. When SBS Dealers hedge the underlying risk of a transaction, dealer
profits stem from commissions and fees charged to their counterparties in relation to the
security-based swap. As a result, SBS Dealer incentives may be generally inconsistent
with, or may be contrary to the economic interests of their counterparties.
As discussed in earlier sections, SBS Dealers are more informed than their nondealer counterparties as they can directly observe pre-trade requests for quotes and order
flow. Where SBS Dealers have previously acted in other capacities, such as in the
capacity of an underwriter, arranger or structurer of a security-based swap, they may have
superior information about the quality and risk of a specific security-based swap and its
underlying assets. As a result, SBS Dealers may have superior information about the
inherent value and risk of security-based swaps, including information concerning
whether a given security-based swap is unsuitable for a particular non-dealer
counterparty given the counterparty’s horizon and ability to absorb losses, among other
things.
When SBS Dealers advise their counterparties regarding security-based swaps,
the above conflicts of interest may result in recommendations of security-based swaps
that may be unsuitable for a given counterparty. For instance, more complex securitybased swaps are more opaque and difficult to price for less informed counterparties; they

637

may also be unsuitable for a greater number of non-dealer counterparties. 1687 At the
same time, such transactions may be profitable for the dealer. To the extent that SBS
Dealers may be recommending unsuitable security-based swaps, and to the extent
counterparties may be relying on such advice and are unable to observe and decouple bias
from the information component of the recommendation, counterparties may be entering
into security-based transactions inconsistent with their investment objectives and risk
tolerance. The central role and high market share of a small number of SBS Dealers
described in the economic baseline may reduce the effectiveness of reputational
considerations in mitigating these effects.
Under Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1), SBS Dealers recommending security-based swaps or
trading strategies involving a security-based swap to counterparties other than an SBS
Entity or a Swap Entity are required to (i) undertake reasonable diligence to understand
potential risks and rewards associated with the recommendation; and, (ii) have a
reasonable basis to believe that the recommended swap or strategy is suitable for the
counterparty, taking into account, among other things, the counterparty’s investment
profile, trading objectives and ability to absorb potential losses. Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2)
includes an alternative for institutional counterparties (defined as a counterparty that is an
eligible contract participant as defined in clauses (A)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (viii), (ix) or (x),
or clause (B)(ii) of Section 1a(18) of the Commodity Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, or any person (whether a natural person, corporation, partnership,
trust or otherwise) with total assets of at least $50 million) that allows an SBS Dealer to
1687

The Commission recognizes that complex over-the-counter security-based swaps
may benefit some market participants due to the ability to tailor economic terms
to counterparties’ hedging needs or market views.

638

satisfy its customer-specific suitability obligations in Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(ii) if (i) the SBS
Dealer reasonably determines that the counterparty or agent with delegated authority is
capable of independently evaluating investment risks with respect to a given securitybased swap or strategy; (ii) the counterparty or agent represents in writing that they are
exercising independent judgment in evaluating the dealer’s recommendations; and (iii)
the SBS Dealer discloses that it is acting as a counterparty and not assessing suitability.
Under Rule 15Fh-3(f)(3), an SBS Dealer will be deemed to have satisfied the
requirements of the first prong of the institutional suitability alternative in Rule 15Fh3(f)(2)(i) if it receives written representations that: (i) in the case of a counterparty that is
not a special entity, the counterparty has complied in good faith with written policies and
procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the persons responsible for
evaluating the recommendation and making trading decisions on behalf of the
counterparty are capable of doing so; and (ii) in the case of a counterparty that is a special
entity, satisfy the terms of the safe harbor in Rule 15Fh-5(b).
a.

Costs and Benefits

Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1) may benefit counterparties by requiring that SBS Dealers
undertake reasonable diligence to understand the potential risk and rewards associated
with recommended security-based swaps or trading strategies involving security-based
swaps and that these recommendations are suitable for the counterparty given the
counterparty’s investment profile, trading objectives, and ability to absorb potential
losses. As a result, counterparties of SBS Dealers may become more likely to allocate
capital to suitable security-based swaps, potentially enhancing counterparty protections

639

and allocative efficiency. 1688 These benefits are expected to accrue only to the extent that
some SBS Dealers otherwise may be making unsuitable recommendations, and to the
extent that non-SBS or Swap Entity counterparties rely on such SBS Dealer
recommendations in their capital allocation decisions. If incentive conflicts or
governance failures within counterparties, or other factors unrelated to SBS Dealer
recommendations, for instance, reaching for yield in low interest rate environments,
contribute to potentially unsuitable security-based swap choices, the benefits of these
rules may be muted. The suitability standard does not require dealers to disclose whether
another suitable security-based swap or underlier has superior material characteristics.
Therefore, some of the above counterparty protection and allocative efficiency benefits of
the suitability standard may be less. Further, this benefit is likely to be highest for those
counterparties of SBS Dealers which do not already rely on professional asset managers
or independent advisers in security-based swap transactions.
The suitability requirement will impose costs on SBS Dealers. First, the rule
requires SBS Dealers to undertake reasonable diligence to understand the potential risks
and rewards of the security-based swaps or trading strategy involving a security-based
swap they recommend. Second, the rule will involve direct costs required to make an
assessment of suitability of a security-based swap or asset class for each counterparty. 1689
As estimated in Section V, we expect that SBS Dealers may seek to obtain

1688

See, e.g., CFA, supra note 5; Levin, supra note 5.

1689

See, e.g., FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

640

representations at an estimated cost of up to $11,393,160. 1690 Further, the Commission
recognizes that suitability assessments under these final rules may give rise to potential
liability and litigation costs of SBS Dealers.
In considering the economic effects of this final rule, we note that the suitability
requirement does not apply to recommendations made to SBS Dealers, Major SBS
Participants, Swap Dealers, or Major Swap Participants. Therefore, the rule may result in
higher costs to SBS Dealers in transacting with non-SBS or Swap Entity counterparties.
Additionally, costs of suitability assessments may be higher for counterparties with which
an SBS Dealer has had no prior transactions.
The rule may adversely affect counterparties of SBS Dealers that are not
themselves SBS Dealers, Major SBS Participants, Swap Dealers, or Major Swap
Participants. In addition, SBS Dealer cost increases due to suitability assessments
discussed above may be passed on to counterparties, and, if a significant percentage of
the costs cannot be recovered, the willingness of SBS Dealers to make recommendations
to non-dealer counterparties may decrease. Further, SBS Dealers may have superior
information about the quality of security-based swaps they intermediate, but have
significantly less information about their counterparty. This informational asymmetry
may result in SBS Dealers not recommending security-based swaps that may be
potentially suitable to the counterparty. Moreover, to the extent that customer suitability
evaluations take time and require additional due diligence, the rule may result in
execution delays, particularly during times of high market volatility when the value of
1690

Initial cost: (In-house attorney at $380 per hour) x (6,271x2 hours for participants
active in both swaps and SBS markets + 3,488x5 hours for participants active in
SBS markets only) =380 x29,982 = $11,393,160.

641

risk mitigation may be higher. We note, however, that suitability requirements apply
only with respect to swaps being recommended by SBS Dealers, and counterparties may
continue to have access to security-based swaps intermediated without bundled SBS
Dealer advice, as well as swaps executed on SEFs or registered exchanges.
The above benefits and costs of the suitability rule are likely to be limited by the
scope of these final rules and the institutional suitability alternative. The suitability
requirement is limited to transactions between SBS Dealers and counterparties that are
not themselves SBS or Swap Entities. We believe that SBS Entities are likely to be able
to independently evaluate material risks, pricing, and overall suitability of a securitybased swap given, among others, their investment objectives and risk tolerance. As
shown in Figure 3, the majority of trades and trade notional involved trades among
dealers, which substantially reduces the scope of application of the suitability
requirement. Further, as discussed below, the scope of application of the suitability rule
may be reduced if SBS Dealers are able to take advantage of the institutional suitability
alternative for customer-specific suitability with respect to a significant fraction of
transactions.
As noted in the proposing release, 1691 many SBS Dealers may already have an
obligation to make suitable recommendations in other contexts. FINRA imposes a
suitability requirement on recommendations by broker-dealers and we have elsewhere
estimated that up to 16 entities registering with the Commission as SBS Entities may be
already operating as registered broker-dealers subject to Commission and FINRA

1691

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42450, supra note 3.

642

oversight. 1692 As discussed in Section II, Swap Dealers registered with the CFTC are
also subject to reasonable basis and customer-specific suitability requirements with
respect to swap transactions under Rule 23.434, and we have elsewhere estimated that up
to 35 SBS Entities may be cross-registered with the CFTC as Swap Entities. Some of
these cross-registered entities may have adjusted their compliance infrastructure and
recommendation practices. These considerations may mitigate both the costs and the
benefits of these final rules.
b.

Institutional Suitability Alternative

Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2) includes an institutional suitability alternative for customerspecific suitability assessments. SBS Dealers will be deemed to have fulfilled their
customer-specific suitability obligations if they reasonably determine that the
counterparty or its agent is capable of independently evaluating the investment risks; the
counterparty or agent affirmatively represents in writing that they are evaluating the
investment independently; and the SBS Dealer discloses that it is not undertaking to
assess suitability for the counterparty. The institutional suitability alternative for
customer-specific suitability requirements will not be available with respect to
counterparties that are not institutional counterparties (defined as a counterparty that is an
eligible contract participant as defined in clauses (A)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (viii), (ix) or (x),
or clause (B)(ii) of Section 1a(18) of the Commodity Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, or any person (whether a natural person, corporation, partnership,
trust or otherwise) with total assets of at least $50 million. Recommendations of any
potentially unsuitable products could involve losses and lead to inefficient capital

allocation by non-dealer counterparties when such counterparties lack the ability to
independently assess suitability of security-based swap transactions they enter into.
Sophisticated institutions or entities that rely on independent advisors in their decision
making may be better able to independently assess the merits and suitability of a given
security-based swap. Therefore, more sophisticated counterparties and counterparties
that rely on independent advisers to assess disclosures and analyze the relative merits of
individual swaps are less likely to benefit from the suitability rule. The institutional
suitability alternative reflects these considerations.
As a result of the institutional suitability alternative, SBS Dealers will not be
required to undertake customer-specific suitability evaluations for counterparties that the
rule presumes are capable of independently evaluating investment risks with regard to the
relevant security-based swap or trading strategy involving a security-based swap. As
shown in Table 2 of the economic baseline, between November 2006 and December
2014, 99% of private funds, 100% of registered investment companies, 72% of insurance
companies, 75% of non-financial firms and 98% of special entities were represented by
investment advisers. Hence, non-dealer counterparties generally have third-party
representation and may be able to evaluate security-based swaps independently of SBS
Dealers. Many SBS Dealers may be able to rely on the institutional suitability alternative
to fulfill their customer-specific suitability obligations. Therefore, a large fraction of
transactions may qualify for the institutional suitability alternative, and the economic
effects of the suitability requirement above may accrue to a small share of security-based
swap market activity.

644

In addition, the institutional suitability alternative for customer-specific suitability
will not be available for SBS Dealers making recommendations to counterparties that are
not institutional counterparties. The $50 million asset threshold in the institutional
counterparty definition narrows the scope of the alternative and increases the potential
counterparty protection and allocative efficiency benefits of the final suitability rule. Our
data do not allow us to estimate how many counterparties that would not meet the
institutional counterparty definition are currently transacting in security-based swap
markets and relying on recommendations by SBS Dealers, asset size thresholds for
counterparties at which the intended information and counterparty protection benefits of
these final rules become significant, or the extent to which asset size and counterparty
sophistication may be correlated in security-based swap markets. We also recognize that
the $50 million asset size threshold may increase costs and diverges from the suitability
safe harbor adopted by the CFTC as part of business conduct standards for Swap Entities.
As a result, all SBS Dealers that are dually registered with the CFTC as Swap Dealers
will face a bifurcated suitability standard in swaps and security-based swaps, such as
index CDS and single name CDS, with respect to counterparties that do not meet the
institutional counterparty definition. In response to these final rules, dually registered
SBS Dealers may choose not to rely on the institutional suitability alternative when
making recommendations to counterparties that do not meet the institutional counterparty
definition in both swap and security-based swap markets.
Direct burdens and costs of suitability assessments have been estimated above.
The Commission also recognizes that this aspect of the institutional suitability alternative
may increase system complexity, liability and other costs less amenable to quantification

645

that SBS Dealers will incur as a result of advising and transacting with small
counterparties in security-based swaps. These costs may be passed on to counterparties of
SBS Dealers, which may experience an increase in transaction costs, decreased access to
SBS Dealer advice, or decreased willingness of SBS Dealers to intermediate over-thecounter security-based swaps.
However, affected counterparties may continue to retain access to anonymous
SEF or exchange executed security-based swaps, which are not subject to the suitability
requirements of these final rules. Further, while the asset threshold in the institutional
suitability alternative diverges from the CFTC’s approach to suitability for Swap Dealers,
it aligns with FINRA’s asset threshold for the institutional account definition. SBS
Dealers cross-registered as broker-dealers are currently unable to rely on institutional
suitability when recommending less complex products, such as vanilla equity or fixed
income instruments, to the same group of counterparties, and may be less affected by the
institutional counterparty asset threshold for the suitability alternative. We note that SBS
Dealers will be able to avail themselves of the institutional suitability alternative when
making recommendations to certain financial institutions, insurance companies,
registered investment companies, commodity pools with at least $5 million in assets,
broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, floor brokers, investment advisers and
commodity trading advisors with less than $50 million in assets. As discussed above, the
Commission believes that the $50 million asset threshold may enhance counterparty
protection and allocative efficiency benefits of the final suitability rule relative to the
alternative of not including an asset threshold as part of institutional suitability.

646

We note that the institutional suitability alternative is not applicable to the
suitability requirement to undertake reasonable diligence to understand the potential risks
and rewards associated with the recommended security-based swap or trading strategy
involving a security-based swap. However, when SBS Dealers rely on the alternative,
they will not be required to make customer-specific suitability assessments with respect
to individual counterparties’ investment profile, trading objectives and ability to absorb
losses.
As clarified in Section II, the Commission believes that parties should be able to
make the disclosures and representations required by Rules 15Fh-3(f)(2) and (3) on a
transaction-by-transaction basis, on an asset-class-by-asset-class basis, or in terms of all
potential transactions between the parties. As a result, SBS Dealers will not be required
to assess customer-specific suitability of whole asset classes or all security-based swaps,
if the counterparty makes appropriate representations and other institutional suitability
requirements are met.
To the extent that security-based swaps are heterogeneous in their risk and
expected return characteristics, and since the degree of counterparty sophistication and
familiarity with various types of security-based swaps may vary over time, such an
approach to institutional suitability may lower the benefits of the rule. However, the
ability to take advantage of the institutional suitability alternative for groups of securitybased swaps, asset classes or counterparties as a whole mitigates the burdens imposed on
SBS Dealers, 1693 particularly when such dealers intermediate multiple homogeneous
transactions with the same counterparty over a limited time period. For instance, as we
1693

See, e.g., Barnard, supra note 5.

647

have noted in the economic baseline, based on an analysis of DTCC-TIW data, an
average unique dealer–nondealer pair entered into approximately 32 transactions in 2014.
The ability of dealers to rely on the institutional suitability alternative for some or all of
the trades with a given counterparty would be less costly, and may also limit execution
delays facilitating market access to security-based swaps.
In addition to the above considerations concerning institutional suitability, we
note that the final suitability requirements will not apply if an SBS Dealer does not
recommend a security-based swap or trading strategy involving a security-based swap to
counterparties. As estimated above, the suitability requirement imposes costs on SBS
Dealers, and may decrease their willingness to recommend security-based swaps to nonSBS or Swap Entity counterparties. However, as discussed throughout the release, we
believe that the overwhelming majority of market participants already have access to
third party advice concerning security-based swaps.
Finally, suitability obligations will also apply to transactions with special entities,
and the institutional suitability alternative described above will be available for special
entity counterparties that meet the institutional counterparty definition (i.e., have total
assets of at least $50 million).
4.

Special Entities

The business conduct rules being adopted include a number of requirements for
SBS Entities specific to their dealings with special entities governing, among other
things: a) the scope of entities that will be subject to the substantive special entity
standards; b) the duty to verify and inform entities when they are eligible to elect not to
be considered a special entity for the purposes of these rules; c) the definition of qualified

648

independent representative for such purposes; d) the conduct of SBS Entities when they
act as counterparties to special entities; e) the conduct of SBS Dealers when they act as
advisors to special entities.
a.

Scope and Verification

First, as part of verification of status requirement under Rule 15Fh-3(a)(2) , SBS
Entities will be required to verify whether a counterparty is a special entity before
entering into a security-based swap, unless the transaction is executed on a registered or
exempt SEF or registered national securities exchange, and the SBS Entity does not know
the identity of the counterparty at a reasonably sufficient time prior to execution of the
transaction to permit the SBS Entity to comply with the rule. Under Rule 15Fh-3(a)(3),
an SBS Entity shall also verify whether a counterparty is eligible to elect not to be a
special entity, and, if so, notify such counterparty of its right to make such an election.
Rule 15Fh-2(e) defines the scope of special entities to include, among other things,
federal and state agencies, States, cities, counties, municipalities, and other political
subdivisions of a State, instrumentalities, departments or corporations of or established
by a State or political subdivision of a State, employee benefit plans subject to Title I of
ERISA, governmental plans as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA, and endowments.
Rule 15Fh-2(e) also provides that employee benefit plans defined in Section 3 of ERISA,
that are not otherwise defined as special entities, may elect not to be treated as special
entities by notifying an SBS Entity prior to entering into a security-based swap.
These final rules define the set of special entities that will be able to avail
themselves of the protections in these final rules. The inclusion of entities defined in, but
not subject to, ERISA into the special entity category, subject to an opt out provision,

649

increases the set of market participants afforded the counterparty protections under the
final business conduct standards, relative to the exclusive application of these rules to
entities subject to ERISA. 1694 At the same time, as discussed below, compliance with
these final rules concerning special entities will entail direct and indirect costs for SBS
Entities. Increased costs to SBS Entities may be passed on to special entity counterparties
in the form of more adverse terms of available security-based swaps or a decreased
willingness of SBS Entities to intermediate such swaps with special entities, which may
reduce special entities’ access to such security-based swaps. 1695 The ability of special
entities defined in, but not subject to, ERISA to opt out of the special entity status may
give such entities greater flexibility in structuring their relationships with SBS Entities,
and allow them to trade off the benefits of counterparty protections in these final rules
against potentially greater costs and lower liquidity in SBS Entity intermediated OTC
security-based swaps.
We note that the opt out approach for special entities defined in, but not subject
to, ERISA differs from parallel CFTC business conduct rules, which allow such entities
to opt into the special entity status instead. As discussed in the economic baseline, the
1694

See Church Alliance (August 2011), supra note 5 and Church Alliance (October
2011), supra note 5, suggesting that church plans may benefit from enhanced
conduct by SBS Entities in their advisory or intermediation roles, and requesting
clarification of status of church plans for purposes of regulations under Dodd
Frank.

1695

As we discuss in Section VI.C.4.f, special entity rules will not apply to securitybased swaps executed on registered or exempt SEFs or registered national
security exchanges, where SBS Entities do not know the identity of the
counterparty at a reasonably sufficient time prior to execution of the transaction to
permit the SBS Entity to comply with these final obligations. Therefore, special
entities and entities defined in, but not subject to ERISA, regardless of their opt
out decision, will continue to have access to anonymous SEF or exchange
executed security-based swaps.

650

Commission expects extensive cross-registration of SBS Entities as Swap Entities, and
understands most market participants transact in both swap and security-based swap
markets. To the extent that SBS Entities have significant bargaining power in transactions
with special entities, special entities that have selected not to opt into the special entity
status in swap markets are likely to opt out of similar protections under these final rules.
Therefore, it is unclear whether the ability of special entities defined in, but not subject to
ERISA to opt out of special entity protections would lead to a greater number of special
entities benefiting from counterparty protections in these final rules, relative to the opt in
approach. We also recognize that under the final rules, if a special entity chooses to opt
out of the special entity status, it would be required to provide a written notice to the SBS
Entity and would bear related costs. The overall economic effects of this rule will,
therefore, depend on the number of entities defined in, but not subject to, ERISA that will
choose to opt out of the special entity status, the costs of producing notices, and
magnitude of the transaction cost increases in OTC security-based swaps resulting from
compliance with these final special entity rules.
Estimates of special entity market participants in our economic baseline are based
on manual account classifications, and our data is not sufficiently granular to estimate the
number of special entities defined in but not subject to ERISA currently active in
security-based swap markets that may be scoped in by these rules. Special entities
represent approximately 8% of market participants in swap markets. 1696 Out of 3,635

1696

This estimate is based upon data provided by ISDA as of December 31, 2015 on
the number and type of market participants adhering to the ISDA August 2012 DF
Protocol. See Memorandum from Lindsay Kidwell to File (Feb. 18, 2016)

651

special entities subscribed to the ISDA August 2012 DF Protocol, 1,453 market
participants (approximately 40%) elected to be a special entity under the protocol. This
may indicate that a substantial number of market participants in swap markets may have
opted into the special entity treatment. However, we note that using hand classifications
of accounts in TIW data on 2006-2014, we estimate that special entities represent
approximately 10.5% of single name CDS market participants by count (see Table 2
above). This estimate is comparable to the 8% of all special entities adhering to the
ISDA August 2012 DF Protocol, and our hand classifications of accounts do not
distinguish between special entities subject to ERISA, and those defined in but not
subject to ERISA. Therefore, our analysis of special entity transaction activity
throughout the release likely includes both special entities subject to ERISA, and entities
defined in but not subject to ERISA that may opt out of the special entity protections of
these final rules.
Special entity requirements and related costs will not apply to security-based
swaps transacted on registered national securities exchanges and registered or exempt
SEFs, if the SBS Entity does not know the identity of the counterparty at a reasonably
sufficient time prior to execution of the transaction to permit the SBS Entity to comply
with the obligations of the rules. We recognize that some security-based swaps executed
on a SEF or exchange may be bilaterally negotiated, which may point to potential
counterparty and information benefits of applying the business conduct rules to SEF and
exchange traded security-based swaps. However, bilateral negotiations are likely to

available on the Commission’s website at http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-2511/s72511.shtml under “Meetings with SEC Officials.” See also Section VI.B.

652

require an SBS Entity to know the identity of the counterparty at a reasonably sufficient
time prior to execution to permit compliance. We also recognize that conflicts of interest
may affect SBS Dealer recommendations of security-based swaps regardless of the venue
in which these transactions are executed. It is not clear whether an SBS Dealer would be
able to make a recommendation to a counterparty whose identity is not known at a
reasonably sufficient time prior to execution. Finally, as we discuss throughout the
release, while business conduct rules, including rules concerning special entities, may
result in significant benefits, they will impose direct and indirect costs on SBS Entities.
In the context of SEF transactions, the application of these rules may increase transaction
costs, add complexity and delays, or require negotiation with counterparties. To the
extent that security-based swaps executed through SEFs may represent exclusively armslength transactions, the terms of which are not negotiated, the imposition of the final
business conduct rules on such trades could increase costs without corresponding benefits
anticipated by these final rules. For instance, if clearing reduces credit risk of
counterparties, SBS Entities may compete on transaction costs and quality of execution,
as opposed to credit risks of the transaction, as suggested by commenters. 1697 These final
rules recognize these competing considerations and provide explicit relief for transactions
executed on a registered or exempt SEF or registered national exchange, if the SBS
Entity does not know the identity of the special entity counterparty at a reasonably
sufficient time prior to execution of the transaction to permit compliance with the
obligations of the rule. Finally, the Commission continues to recognize that the benefits
of these final special entity rules are expected to primarily accrue to entities that are less
1697

See SIFMA (August 2011), supra note 5 and BlackRock, supra note 5.

653

informed about security-based swap markets. While special entities will not be able to
opt out of the protections of these final rules as discussed in section VI.C.8, SBS Entities
will be able to rely on an independent representative safe harbor, the economic effects of
which are considered in detail in the sections that follow.
As discussed in Section II, the special entity definition does not include collective
investment vehicles, and the final rules do not require SBS Dealers to determine whether
any of the investors in the collective investment vehicle counterparty qualify as special
entities. Such an approach limits the scope of application of these final rules, reducing
potential counterparty protection and allocative efficiency benefits, but also potential
costs and risks of loss of access by special entities and entities defined in, but not subject
to ERISA, to security-based swaps.
b.

SBS Entities as Counterparties to Special Entities

Under final Rule 15Fh-5(a) an SBS Entity that offers to enter or enters into a
security-based swap with a special entity must have a reasonable basis to believe that the
special entity has a qualified independent representative. Under Rule 15Fh-5(c), before
initiating a swap, an SBS Dealer will also be required to disclose in writing the capacity
in which the dealer is acting in connection with the security-based swap. Additionally, if
the SBS Dealer or its associated persons engage or have engaged in business with the
special entity in more than one capacity, the dealer would be required to disclose the
material differences between such capacities and any other financial transactions or
service involving the special entity. As discussed in section II.H.7 supra, the SBS Dealer
may use generalized disclosures regarding the capacities in which the SBS Dealer and its
associated persons have acted or may act with respect to the special entity, along with a

654

statement distinguishing those capacities from the capacity in which the SBS Dealer is
acting with respect to the present security-based swap. The requirements in Rule 15Fh-5
do not apply to a security-based swap if the transaction is being executed on a registered
or exempt SEF or registered national securities exchange, and the SBS Entity does not
know the identity of the counterparty at a reasonably sufficient time prior to execution of
the transaction to permit compliance with these obligations.
Qualified independent representatives must have sufficient knowledge to evaluate
the transaction and risks; may not be subject to statutory disqualification; undertake a
duty to act in the best interests of the special entity; appropriately and timely disclose
material information concerning the security-based swap to the special entity; evaluate,
consistent with any guidelines provided by the special entity, the fairness of pricing and
appropriateness of the security-based swap; and for certain types of special entities the
representative must be subject to rules for the Commission, the CFTC, or a SRO
prohibiting it from engaging in specified activities if certain political contributions have
been made, unless the representative is an employee of the special entity. Independence
requires that a representative does not have a relationship with the SBS Entity, whether
compensatory or otherwise, that reasonably could affect the independent judgment or
decision-making of the representative. A representative will be deemed to be
independent of an SBS Entity if, within one year of representing the special entity in
connection with the security-based swap, the representative was not an associated person
of an SBS Entity; provides timely disclosures to the special entity of all material conflicts
of interest that could reasonably affect the judgment or decision making of the
representative with respect to its obligations to the special entity; complies with policies

655

and procedures reasonably designed to manage and mitigate such material conflicts of
interest; and the SBS Entity did not refer, recommend, or introduce it to the special entity
within one year of the representative’s representation of the special entity in connection
with the security-based swap. As proposed by some commenters, ERISA plans will be
able to comply with these requirements by relying on an ERISA fiduciary. 1698 Further, as
we discuss in more detail below, the independence requirement refers to the
representative’s independence of the SBS Entity and not of the special entity and so,
qualified investment representatives that are employees or associates of the special entity
may qualify as independent representatives for the purposes of these rules.
In contrast with the final rule, the proposed rule defined independence based on a
two-prong test of 1) associated person status within the preceding year; and 2) ten percent
or greater revenue reliance on a given SBS Entity. We are sensitive to commenter
concerns that this definition may impose undue restrictions and cost burdens on SBS
Entities, and may be difficult to implement. 1699 Further, the CFTC’s independence
formulation applicable to Swap Entities does not include a ten percent revenue prong in
the independent test with special entities. In light of active cross-market participation and
expected SBS Entity cross-registration, adopting a substantively different independence
requirement from that required by Swap Entities may impose costs of compliance with
two different independent representation standards. At the same time, it is unclear that

1698

See ABC, supra note 5 and SIFMA (August 2011), supra note 5.

1699

See, e.g., SIFMA (August 2011), supra note 5; APPA; BlackRock, supra note 5;
SIFMA (August 2011), supra note 5; ABA Committees, supra note 5;
FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5; Blackrock, supra note 5.

656

such an approach would be more beneficial to counterparty protections, Commission
oversight or enforcement in security-based swaps relative to the approach being adopted.
Under this rule, special entities transacting with more informed and sophisticated
SBS Entities will have the benefit of representation by a qualified independent
representative that has a duty to act in the best interests of the entity. To the extent that
some special entities are less informed about security-based swaps and less able to
unwind biases that may exist in potentially conflicted recommendations than other
counterparties, this requirement may appropriately facilitate stronger protections and
superior capital allocation decisions by special entities. Better informed special entities,
such as large well-informed pension funds that regularly transact in security-based swaps,
are likely to enjoy fewer benefits of this requirement. However, they may also be more
likely to use investment advisers in their current security-based swap transactions, in
which case they would need to make that representation to an SBS Dealer under Rule
15Fh-5(b). In addition, similar to our earlier discussion of suitability rules, to the extent
that special entities may be entering security-based swap transactions with inferior riskreturn characteristics as a result of internal incentive conflicts or macro factors, such as
reaching for yield in a low interest rate environment, the benefits of these protections
may be muted.
Further, special entities that transact with the SBS Dealer in a variety of roles,
such as investment adviser or underwriter, will benefit from greater transparency about
the capacity in which the dealer is entering the security-based swap. For instance, if an
SBS Dealer currently engages in business with a special entity in the capacity of an
investment adviser, the SBS Dealer would be required to disclose that it is not acting in

657

such capacity if it is seeking to enter into a security-based swap with the special entity.
This may help counterparties better understand the nature of the incentives of an SBS
Dealer in relation to a given security-based swap transaction.
This rule will involve direct and indirect costs. SBS Entity counterparties will
incur costs of obtaining a reasonable basis to believe that the special entity has a qualified
independent representative. Based on our estimates in Section V, all SBS Entities acting
as counterparties to special entities will incur an aggregate initial cost of, approximately,
$132,819,500. 1700 Ongoing costs of compliance with rules for counterparties of special
entities will involve updating representations and verifications for transactions with thirdparty non-employee independent representatives, estimated at $8,569,000. 1701 In-house
independent representatives will bear costs of making representations to SBS Entities,
which will involve an aggregate initial compliance burden of, approximately,
$137,104,000 with an ongoing cost of $8,569,000. 1702
In addition, some special entities may be entering security-based swaps with SBS
Entities that are not in their best interest, and advice from qualified independent
representatives may help inform special entities and enable them to make better
investment decisions. Therefore, this rule may improve allocative efficiency of security1700

Initial cost: (In-house attorney at $380 per hour) x 360,800 hours = $137,104,000.
We believe that in-house investment advisers may be compensated similarly to inhouse attorneys. To the extent that the rate of compensation for independent
representatives may be lower, these figures may overestimate the aggregate initial
burden related to these final rules.
Ongoing: (In-house attorney at $380 per hour) x 22,500 hours = $8,569,000

658

based swap investments. However, as noted earlier, SBS Entities are for-profit entities,
and, to the extent that SBS Entities are currently intermediating security-based swaps that
are not in the best interests of some of their special entity counterparties, the rule may
lower an SBS Entity’s profitability of intermediating security-based swaps with special
entities. SBS Entities may attempt to recoup these costs in the form of less attractive
security-based swap terms, or become less willing to transact with special entities. As an
additional consideration, entities with activity levels below de minimis triggering SBS
Dealer registration, but with positions large enough to require Major SBS Participant
registration will bear these costs of intermediating transactions with special entities. If
the costs of intermediated security-based swaps with special entities are substantial, some
Major SBS Participants may reduce or stop transacting with special entity counterparties.
These costs may be lower if SBS Entities’ special entity counterparties provide
representations that allow SBS Entities to take advantage of the safe harbor in Rule 15Fh5(b). Our data do not allow us to estimate the number of special entities currently relying
on qualified independent representatives since we cannot observe whether they have
conflicts of interest with SBS Entities that would preclude them from meeting
independence requirements of these final rules. However, we note that, as reflected in
the economic baseline, special entities represent approximately 10.5% of account holders
in DTCC TIW between 2006 and 2014. Only approximately 2% of special entities did
not rely on investment advisers in their single name CDS trades, with 85 unique pairs of
SBS Dealers and U.S. special entities transacting in single name CDS. In 2014, there
were 2 unique trading relationships between likely SBS Dealers and special entities
without a third party investment adviser, representing approximately 0.039% of all

659

transactions in 2014. Therefore, the overwhelming majority of special entities may
already be relying on investment advisers in their security-based swap transactions.
However, we do not observe whether advisors in TIW data meet the independence and
qualification requirements being adopted in these final rules. If a significant fraction of
third party representatives does not meet the qualified independent representative
requirements in these final rules, special entity counterparties of SBS Entities may choose
to replace third party representatives with those that do have requisite qualifications and
independence, enabling continued transaction activity with SBS Entities, or may lose
access to SBS Entity intermediated OTC security-based swaps.
As estimated above, all special entity counterparties of SBS Entities will face
costs of making representations to SBS Entities concerning their reliance on independent
advisors acting in their best interests. To the extent SBS Entities transact with special
entities that are not already relying on representatives, or are relying on representatives
that would not meet the qualification and independence criteria in these final rules, such
special entities would incur costs of obtaining a new representative and making necessary
representations, if they wish to facilitate the SBS Entities’ reliance on the safe harbor.
This may increase demand for the services of qualified independent representatives, and
independent representatives may require higher compensation to reflect such higher
demand. Such costs will depend on the number of third-party representatives of special
entities that do not currently meet the independence and qualification requirements of
these final rules; the resulting increase in the demand for new representation; and the
supply of investment advisers not currently representing special entities in security-based
swaps that would be considered qualified and independent under these final rules. We

660

lack data to quantify these effects and commenters did not provide information that
would enable such quantification. We are, therefore, unable to estimate these costs.
Under the final rules, SBS Entities may become counterparties of special entities
only if they have a reasonable basis to believe that the special entity has a qualified
independent representative. We note that Rule 15Fh-1(b) allows SBS Entities to rely on
written representations of a counterparty to satisfy its due diligence requirements. As a
result, SBS Entities that can rely on representations will not be required to conduct
independent assessments of the qualifications or independence of special entity
representatives, as proposed by some commenters. 1703 These issues are discussed in
further detail in Section VI.C.4.iv below.
c.

SBS Dealers as Advisors to Special Entities

Rule 15Fh-2(a) introduces in a default presumption that an SBS Dealer acts as an
advisor to a special entity when it recommends a security-based swap or a trading
strategy that involves the use of a security-based swap to the special entity. The rule
provides a safe harbor, where an SBS Dealer will not be acting as advisor when a special
entity represents that it acknowledges that the SBS Dealer is not acting as an advisor, that
the special entity will rely on advice from a qualified independent representative, and the
SBS Dealer discloses to the special entity that it is not undertaking to act in the best
interest of the special entity. The rule also provides a safe harbor for SBS Dealers
transacting with ERISA special entities, where the SBS Dealer will not be acting as an
advisor if the special entity represents that it has an ERISA fiduciary; the fiduciary
represents in writing that it acknowledges that the SBS Dealer is not acting as an advisor;
1703

See, e.g., SIFMA (August 2011), supra note 5.

661

and the special entity represents either that it will comply in good faith with written
policies and procedures designed to ensure that any recommendation received from the
SBS Dealer involving a security-based swap transaction is evaluated by a fiduciary, or
that any recommendation received from the SBS Dealer involving a security-based swap
transaction will be evaluated by a fiduciary.
Rule 15Fh-4(b) establishes requirements for an SBS Dealer acting as an advisor to
special entities. Rule 15Fh-4(b)(1) provides that an SBS Dealer acting as an advisor to a
special entity shall have a duty to make a reasonable determination that any securitybased swap or trading strategy involving a security-based swap recommended by the SBS
Dealer is in the best interests of the special entity. Rule 15Fh-4(b)(2) requires an SBS
Dealer acting as an advisor to a special entity to make reasonable efforts to obtain such
information that the SBS Dealer considers necessary to make such a determination.
The final rules except transactions executed on registered or exempt SEFs or
registered national securities exchanges if an SBS Dealer does not know the identity of
the counterparty at a reasonably sufficient time prior to execution to permit compliance
with these final obligations.
As discussed in detail in earlier sections, SBS Dealers enjoy informational
advantages relative to their nondealer counterparties, and are for profit entities with
business interests that may conflict with those of their counterparties in principal and/or
agency transactions. Hence, SBS Dealers may have conflicts of interest related to the

662

security-based swaps and the securities underlying them. 1704 Such conflicts of interest
may influence SBS Dealer recommendations to their counterparties. The final business
conduct rules may lessen the reliance of special entities on SBS Dealer recommendations,
but, they may also limit special entities’ access to security-based swap related investment
advice and OTC security-based swaps.
Special entity counterparties may be aware of these fundamental incentives of
SBS Dealers and of the complexity and opacity of security-based swaps, and may be able
to recognize and parse out the potential bias in dealer recommendations. As discussed
above, special entities represent a small fraction of market participants and almost
exclusively rely on investment advisers. We also note that, to the extent special entities
are currently allocating capital inefficiently in security-based swaps, they may be doing
so for reasons unrelated to SBS Dealer recommendations, such as reaching for yield in a
low interest rate environment, or as a result of fund manager incentive conflicts. If
special entity participation in security-based swap markets is driven by these other factors
and is not a result of reliance on SBS Dealer recommendations, the benefits of these rules
may be reduced.
As we have noted in prior sections, based on TIW data for 2006 through 2014,
approximately 98% of special entities transacting in single name CDS trades in TIW rely
on advisors. We lack data to estimate how many of these advisors may be considered
qualified independent representatives for the purposes of the safe harbor. However, we
recognize that the economic effects of this rule may be significantly reduced if many SBS
1704

See Sections VI.A and VI.C.2 for a more detailed discussion of informational
asymmetries and conflicts of interest related to security-based swap dealing
activity.

663

Dealers avail themselves of the safe harbor in their transactions with and
recommendations to special entities.
We note that under the final rules, when an SBS Dealer makes a recommendation
to a special entity, and obtains the representations and makes the disclosures required by
the safe harbor, the SBS Dealer will not be required to comply with the best interest
standard in Rule 15Fh-4(b). However, if, in such cases the special entity counterparty has
less than $50 million in assets (and therefore, does not meet the institutional counterparty
definition), the SBS Dealer will still be required to comply with its customer-specific
suitability obligations in Rule 15Fh-3(f)(1)(ii). This provision imposes customer-specific
suitability obligations on SBS Dealers who cannot take advantage of the institutional
suitability alternative in Rule 15Fh-3(f)(2). This may enhance potential counterparty
protection and allocative efficiency benefits of the final special entity rules relative to the
alternative of not imposing customer-specific suitability obligations with respect to
special entities under the safe harbor with less than $50 million in assets. Our data do not
allow us to estimate how many special entities would fall under the $50 million asset size
threshold; asset size thresholds for special entities at which the intended information and
counterparty protection benefits of these final rules become significant; or the extent to
which asset size and special entity sophistication may be correlated in security-based
swap markets.
We also recognize that this approach diverges from the institutional suitability
alternative adopted by the CFTC as part of business conduct standards for Swap Entities.
As a result, all SBS Dealers that are dually registered with the CFTC as Swap Dealers
will face two different standards of care in swaps and security-based swaps when making

664

recommendations to special entities with less than $50 million in assets. As a result,
dually registered SBS Dealers may choose not to rely on the institutional suitability
alternative when making recommendations to special entities with less than $50 million
in both swap and security-based swap markets. This aspect of the alternative may
increase costs that SBS Dealers will incur as a result of advising and transacting with
small special entities in security-based swaps. SBS Dealers may reduce their provision of
advice to small special entities or pass on such costs to counterparties in the form of
higher transaction costs or a decreased willingness to intermediate over-the-counter
security-based swaps. Further, as discussed above, the Commission believes that
suitability obligations for special entities with less than $50 million in assets may
increase the potential counterparty protection and allocative efficiency benefits of the
final special entity rules. Therefore, the primary economic effects of these rules depend
on the degree to which special entities rely on conflicted SBS Dealer recommendations in
their security-based swap decisions, the value of biased security-based swap
recommendations by SBS Dealers, the relative cost of outside investment advice
concerning security-based swaps, and the fraction of SBS Dealers that will be able to take
advantage of the qualified independent representative safe harbor.
Therefore, the primary economic effects of these rules depend on the degree to
which special entities rely on conflicted SBS Dealer recommendations in their securitybased swap decisions, the value of biased security-based swap recommendations by SBS
Dealers, the relative cost of outside investment advice concerning security-based swaps,
and the fraction of SBS Dealers that will be able to take advantage of the qualified
independent representative safe harbor.

665

SBS Dealers will be unable to recommend security-based swaps that are not in
special entities’ best interests, and will therefore forego potential incremental profits from
such transactions. SBS Dealer “best interest” determinations concerning recommended
security-based swaps may potentially give rise to dealer liability or litigation risk if there
are differences of opinion concerning the relative merits of different security-based swaps
and counterparties incur losses. SBS Dealer registration is not currently required,
disclosure of litigation reserves by SBS Dealers is not mandatory, and the economic
magnitude of such costs will depend on how special entities, their representatives and
SBS Dealers will respond to these final rules. Therefore, we are unable to estimate these
costs. However, we recognize that some SBS Dealers may incur such costs. In addition,
the aggregate initial costs of revising representations and collecting requisite information
from special entities related to the requirements for SBS Dealers serving as advisors to
special entities are estimated at $741,000. 1705
SBS Dealers that are most affected by these costs may respond to the final rules
by ceasing to provide security-based swap recommendations to special entities, limiting
special entities’ access to such investment advice, or by decreasing their willingness to
intermediate OTC security-based swaps with special entities. However, we note that SBS
Dealers that lose the most profit as a result of the requirement to provide advice in their
counterparties’ best interests may have been issuing more conflicted recommendations
that were not in the special entities’ best interests. Therefore, special entities may lose

1705

Initial cost: (In-house attorney at $380 per hour) x ((250 hours to draft, review
and revise the representations in standard SBS documentation) + (1,700 hours to
collect information from each special entity) = $741,000

666

access to such conflicted advice, but the remaining advice by SBS Dealers should be
consistent with special entities’ best interest.
d.

Independent Representation: Alternatives

We have considered alternatives that result in tightening of the independence
requirements for representatives, for instance, through the imposition of a longer look
back period in the associated person prong of the independence definition. More
stringent independence requirements may mitigate potential conflicts of interest and
biases in security-based swap recommendations registered representatives make to
special entities. However, as tabulated in Table 2, the majority of market participants
rely on investment advisers for their security-based swap transactions, and more stringent
definitions will limit the number of representatives qualified to advise special entities in
security-based swaps. A decrease in the supply of independent representatives may
increase the cost of retaining independent representation and limit access by smaller, less
sophisticated counterparties that benefit from independent advice and representation in
opaque and complex security-based swap transactions. Further, more stringent
independence requirements may decrease the level of specialized expertise of
representatives. We have received mixed comments on the relative merits of various
definitions of independence, commenters did not quantify the economic costs or benefits
of the alternatives 1706 and no such data is available at present time. As indicated earlier,
the independence definition being adopted is consistent with the CFTC’s approach in
swap markets.
1706

See, e.g., Better Markets (August 2011), supra note 5; NAIPFA, supra note 5;
CFA, supra note 5; FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5; APPA; BlackRock, supra
note 5; SIFMA (August 2011), supra note 5; and Blackrock, supra note 5.

667

Finally, we have considered eliminating the independent representative safe
harbor from the special entity requirements, as suggested by some commenters. 1707 To
the extent that unsophisticated counterparties rely on independent outside advisors or
professional portfolio managers acting in their best interest, the economic effects of
potential biases in SBS Dealer recommendations may be mitigated. Sophisticated entities
and entities relying on independent advice from qualified fiduciaries are less likely to
benefit from SBS Dealer best interest recommendations, particularly in light of the
disclosures being adopted as part of these final rules. At the same time, the costs of SBS
Entity advice under the best interest standard would be passed on to special entities,
increasing costs of security-based swaps and potentially limiting market access for
special entities. Further, SBS Entities may have superior information about securitybased swaps, but face information asymmetries concerning the nature of financial and
business risks of their counterparties. Special entities may be better able to assess the
relative merits of a given security-based swap transaction when relying on independent
qualified representatives, as opposed to engaging SBS Entities to make such
recommendations under a best interest standard.
Similarly, prohibiting SBS Dealers from selling derivatives when the special
entity would be better served by more traditional debt instruments, as suggested by one
commenter, 1708 will impede market access by special entities to a potentially valuable
vehicle for risk mitigation. For some special entities, particularly for sophisticated
entities, entities relying on independent advice from qualified advisors, and entities with
1707

supra note 5.

1708

See CFA, supra note 5.

668

risk management needs best addressed by OTC security-based swaps, such costs are
likely to be significant. Further, this alternative would preclude special entities from
accessing one of the vehicles for trading on negative information about risks of the
underlying securities. Excluding informed and sophisticated special entities from
security-based swaps markets may decrease price efficiency and liquidity, and fragment
swap, security-based swap and underlying reference security markets. However, if such
special entities are prohibited from accessing OTC security-based swaps, these entities
would be able to access standardized security-based swaps traded on registered national
exchanges or SEFs. This may increase the volume of security-based swap trades
transacted on these platforms.
e.

Reliance on Representations

Rule 15Fh-1(b) allows SBS Entities to rely on the written representations of a
counterparty to satisfy its due diligence requirements, unless they have information that
would cause a reasonable person to question the accuracy of the representation. While
these final rules impose new costs on SBS Entities, Rule 15Fh-1(b) will enable SBS
Entities to rely on representations in lieu of independent due diligence, under certain
circumstances. Since SBS Entities may be able to rely on representations to fulfil the
requirements in these final rules, we expect they will do so when the costs of reliance on
representations are lower than those of independent due diligence, to the extent that
special entities are willing and able to provide representations that meet the requirements
of the rule. This may, therefore, provide potentially beneficial flexibility to SBS Entities
in managing their compliance obligations under these final rules.

669

Relying on special entities’ representations concerning the qualifications, and
independence of investment representatives should be less costly for SBS Entities than
conducting independent substantive evaluations of qualifications and independence of
their counterparties’ representatives. To the extent that the best interest standard
introduces costs for SBS Entities, and to the extent that the qualified independent
representative safe harbor may mitigate these costs as discussed in prior sections, Rule
15Fh-1(b) may enable SBS Entities to make recommendations and serve as
counterparties to special entities at lower costs under reliance on counterparty
representations than under independent due diligence. However, if an SBS Entity has
information that would lead a reasonable person to question the accuracy of the
representation, SBS Entities will be required to perform independent due diligence.
We have considered an “actual knowledge” standard as an alternative to the
reliance on representation standard. Under an “actual knowledge” standard, an SBS
Entity can rely on a representation unless it knows that the representation is inaccurate.
The alternative could allow SBS Entities to rely on questionable representations insofar
as they do not have actual knowledge that the representation is inaccurate, even if they
have information that would cause reasonable persons to question their accuracy. As a
result, this alternative would reduce the benefits of the verification of status, know your
counterparty, suitability and special entity requirements and result in weaker protections
for counterparties to SBS Entities. However, SBS Entities would be able to rely on
counterparty representations with respect to a potentially greater set of transactions and
counterparties. To the extent that reliance on representations may lower SBS Entity costs

670

from these final business conduct rules, this actual knowledge standard alternative for
reliance on representations has the potential to further reduce costs.
We have received mixed comments on the relative merits of these standards, with
some commenters supporting the actual knowledge standard, 1709 others supporting the
reasonable person reliance standard, 1710 and others opposing both standards as too
low. 1711 None of the commenters quantified the potential economic costs or benefits of
the proposed standards, and we lack information or data to quantify the above economic
effects. For instance, we lack information about the number of transactions between
special entities and SBS Entities conducted in reliance on representations, the accuracy of
which reasonable persons would question but where SBS Entities lack actual knowledge
of falsehood, and the costs of independently evaluating a representative’s qualifications
and independence which will depend on an individual SBS Entity’s choice to perform
due diligence in house and the efficiency of related internal business processes, or to
retain a third party due diligence provider and the related choice of service provider. In
addition, we have received comment that, where SBS Dealers are required to conduct
independent due diligence, they may face potential litigation risk if they approve a
representative who is subsequently determined to be lacking expertise, as well as
potential litigation from representatives whom they have chosen to disqualify, which may
discourage SBS Dealers from intermediating OTC security-based swaps with certain

1709

See, e.g., SIFMA (August 2011), supra note 5; FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5;
CCMR, supra note 5; APPA, supra note 5; BlackRock, supra note 5); ABC
(2011); ABA Committees, supra note 5.

1710

671

groups of counterparties. 1712 Commenters have not provided any information to enable
us to quantify these costs and we have no data to enable such quantification.
We note that under CFTC rules, Swap Entities are subject to the reasonable
person reliance standard being adopted in these final rules. We also note that swap and
security-based swap markets are interconnected, market participants transact across these
markets, and many SBS Entities are expected to be dually-registered as Swap Entities. If
the same dealers face differential compliance costs of transacting over the counter with
the same special entities in, for instance, single name and index CDS, dealing activity
may flow to the market with lower compliance costs, potentially fragmenting price
discovery and liquidity. Further, the standard being adopted is likely more timely and
cost effective than an approach permitting no reliance on representations.
We have also considered alternative approaches involving a higher standard for
reliance on representations or requiring SBS Entities to conduct an independent analysis
of conflicts and qualifications of each independent representative of a special entity, with
which they may be negotiating swaps. This approach may enhance SBS Entities’ due
diligence with respect to representatives of special entity counterparties, but may
decrease the willingness or ability of SBS Entities to provide special entities with access
to security-based swaps. 1713 As an additional consideration, we understand that most
market participants in swap markets and Swap Entities have adopted a multilateral
protocol as a means of complying with the CFTC external business conduct rules. While
we understand that the representations contained in the protocol only expressly address
1712

See ABC, supra note 5.

1713

See, e.g., NAIPFA, supra note 5.

672

swap transactions, we have received comment that factual matters addressed by those
representations typically do not vary between swap and security-based swap transactions.
To the extent that cross-market participation of dealers and non-dealer counterparties is a
significant feature of security-based swap markets, requiring dually-registered SBS
Entities to obtain separate representations or conduct independent due diligence
specifically addressing security-based swaps may impose additional costs, which may be
passed on to counterparties and limit their access to OTC security-based swaps. 1714 In
addition, as discussed above, we have received comment that requiring SBS Dealers to
conduct independent due diligence may lead to potential litigation risk from approving
representatives subsequently determined to be lacking expertise or representatives that
are disapproved. According to the comment letter, this may discourage SBS Dealers from
intermediating OTC security-based swaps with certain groups of counterparties. 1715 The
commenter did not provide any estimate of such potential costs and the Commission has
no data to enable such quantification. However, we recognize that these costs may be
significant, and it is unclear that the independent due diligence alternative is superior to
the reliance on representation approach being adopted.
f.

Magnitude of the Economic Effects

When considering the likely magnitude of the economic effects of special entity
rules discussed above, we note that, based on data for November 2006 through December
2014, approximately 98% of special entities relied on investment advisors for their single
name CDS trades in DTCC-TIW, and only approximately 2% of special entities acted as
1714

See SIFMA (November 2015), supra note 5

1715

See ABC, supra note 5.

673

a transacting agents. 1716 We lack data or other information to estimate how many
investment advisers currently representing special entities in security-based swap markets
will be considered qualified and independent for the purposes of compliance with these
final rules, or how many SBS Entities would be able to rely on the independent
representative safe harbor in their transactions with special entities. Commenters did not
provide data that would enable such quantification. In addition, we lack data on the
associations of investment advisers with SBS Entities in the past year, the extent of their
advisory roles in relationships with special entities, the existence of conflicts of interest,
and other information. Therefore, we cannot quantify how many special entities may be
able to rely on representations. However, in light of special entities’ heavy reliance on
investment advisers in security-based swap transactions, it is unclear whether a
substantial portion of special entities rely on SBS Entity recommendations in their
security-based swap transactions.
We also recognize similarities between the CFTC’s business conduct standards,
FINRA rules, and the rules being adopted, as well as extensive cross-market participation
-- all of which may reduce both the economic costs (if dually registered entities have
already restructured their compliance infrastructure to comply with similar rules) and the
benefits of these rules (if, for instance, special entities have learned about potential biases
in recommendations from new market practices of the same dealers in other financial
markets). We note that our final business conduct standards include transaction level
requirements. Therefore, as we discuss and estimate above, some benefits and costs
1716

Approximately 95% of special entities relied on SEC registered investment
advisers, and another 3% of special entities used unregistered investment advisers.
See Table 2 of the economic baseline, Section VI.B supra.

674

related to individual security-based transactions are still likely to accrue to special
entities, their qualified independent representatives, and SBS Entities; even those already
subject to similar rules in other markets. Further, some SBS Entities and potential new
entrants may not be cross-registered with the CFTC or with FINRA, and may, therefore,
not already be subject to similar rules in other markets.
Finally, the rules relating to transactions with special entities will not apply to
security-based swaps executed on registered or exempt SEFs or registered national
security exchanges, where SBS Entities do not know the identity of the counterparty at a
reasonably sufficient time prior to execution of the transaction to permit the SBS Entity
to comply with the obligations of the rules. Therefore, special entities would not receive
the benefits of additional counterparty protections of these rules when transacting
anonymously through SEFs or registered national securities exchanges. However, as
noted earlier these final rules may increase the costs of SBS Entities and reduce their
information rents, which may lead SBS Entities to seek to recover lost profits through
more adverse terms of OTC swaps sold to special entities, or reduced willingness to
transact with special entities. Since anonymous SEF or exchange traded security-based
swaps will not be subject to these final requirements, the risk that special entities will lose
access to security-based swaps may be reduced.
5.

Fraud, Fair and Balanced Communications, Supervision
a.

Antifraud

The final business conduct rules include a set of antifraud provisions covering
SBS Entity transactions with all counterparties, and with special entities. With respect to
special entities, rules 15Fh-4(a)(1) and 15Fh-4(a)(2) prohibit SBS Entities from

675

employing any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud special entities, and from engaging
in any transaction, practice or course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit. Rule
15Fh-4(a)(3) imposes a general ban on SBS Entities engaging in any act, practice, or
course of business that is fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative.
To the extent fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative conduct may affect the choice
of the SBS Entity’s counterparty and the decision to enter into a given swap, antifraud
protections may lead to an increased flow of transactions to SBS Entities not engaging in
fraudulent practices. To the extent that the risk of fraud may affect the willingness of
market participants to transact in security-based swap markets, antifraud protections may
increase the willingness of non-SBS or Swap Entity counterparties to participate in
security-based swap markets. We recognize that, as indicated by a commenter, general
antifraud and anti-manipulation provisions of existing federal securities laws and
Commission rules offer similar protections. 1717 Therefore, the magnitude of these
economic benefits relative to the economic baseline is expected to be de minimis.
Further, in light of SBS Entities’ ongoing statutory antifraud obligations, we anticipate
that entities likely to trigger SBS Entity registration requirements have already developed
policies and procedures necessary for compliance with these final rules. Therefore, the
magnitude of the economic costs to SBS Entities from these final rules is expected to be
de minimis as well.
The Commission is not establishing a policies and procedures safe harbor for nonscienter violations, or provisions regarding the protection for counterparty confidential
information. As an alternative to these final rules, the Commission could adopt such a
1717

See Barnard, supra note 5.

676

safe harbor. For instance, the Commission could adopt a rule where an SBS Entity would
be able to establish an affirmative defense by demonstrating that it did not act
intentionally or recklessly, and complied in good faith with written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to meet this particular requirement. The adoption of
such a safe harbor may reduce compliance and litigation costs related to nonscienter
fraudulent, deceptive or abusive practices or conduct that may occur despite SBS Entities
having developed and implemented all relevant policies and procedures, acting in good
faith. However, a safe harbor against fraud may weaken counterparty protections in a
market for complex and opaque securities.
b.

Fair and Balanced Communications

Under rule 15Fh-3(g), SBS Entities are required to communicate with
counterparties in a fair and balanced manner based on principles of fair dealing and good
faith. As discussed in Sections I and II, this rule is harmonized with FINRA’s
communications with the public rule. To the extent that up to 16 likely SBS Entities may
be cross-registered as broker-dealers, some SBS Entities are already complying with
these requirements with respect to securities transactions. Specifically, all
communications must provide a sound basis for evaluating a given security-based swap
or trading strategy, communications may not imply that past performance will recur, or
make exaggerated and unwarranted claims. Rule 15Fh-3(g) clarifies the kinds of
communications that would be consistent with fair dealing or good faith communications.
In conjunction with the antifraud rules and enhanced disclosure requirements, the fair and
balanced communications rule aims to provide transparency to market participants
transacting with SBS Entities. To the extent to which counterparties of SBS Entities may

677

have asymmetric information or are less sophisticated, this requirement may help protect
counterparties and improve their ability to select the most appropriate security-based
swap and counterparty.
We recognize that the requirement may impose costs on SBS Entities. As
indicated in Section V, the related initial aggregate costs are estimated at $917,400 for the
industry, with ongoing costs of approximately $125,400. 1718
c.

Supervision

Rule 15Fh-3(h) requires SBS Entities to establish and maintain a supervision
system and diligently supervise their business and the activities of their associated
persons. At a minimum the supervisory system must (1) designate at least one person
with supervisory authority for each type of a business in which the SBS Entity engages
that requires registration as an SBS Entity; (2) use reasonable efforts to determine that all
supervisors are qualified; and (3) establish, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures addressing the supervision of the types of security-based swap business an
SBS Entity is engaged in and the activities of its associated persons, that are reasonably
designed to prevent violations of applicable securities laws, and rules and regulations
thereunder. The rule lists specific types of policies and procedures that must be included.
In addition, SBS Entities and their associated persons will not be deemed to have
failed to diligently supervise if (1) the SBS Entity has certain written policies and
procedures and a documented system for applying them that would reasonably be
1718

Initial internal cost: (In-house attorney $380 per hour) x 330 =$125,400. Initial
external legal counsel costs: $330,000 + $462,000 = 792,000. Ongoing costs: (Inhouse attorney $380 per hour) x 330 = $125,400.

678

expected to prevent and detect, insofar as practicable, any violation of the federal
securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder relating to security-based swaps;
and (2) the SBS Entity or its associated person has reasonably discharged the duties and
obligations required by such written policies and procedures and system, and did not have
a reasonable basis to believe they were not being followed.
Lastly, SBS Entities have an obligation to promptly amend written supervisory
policies and procedures when there are material changes to applicable securities laws,
rules and regulations, or when there are material changes to the SBS Entity’s business or
supervisory system. SBS Entities are also required to promptly communicate any
material amendments to their supervisory procedures to all associated persons to whom
such amendments are relevant based on their activities and responsibilities.
The Commission recognizes that these final supervision rules may impose certain
burdens and costs on SBS Entities. Specifically, SBS Entities will be required to
establish and maintain a supervision system consistent with the minimum requirements
articulated in Rule 15Fh-3(h); to diligently supervise their business and the activities of
their associated persons; and to amend their written supervisory policies and procedures
when material changes occur to applicable laws, rules or regulations or to their business
or supervisory systems, and promptly communicate such amendments to all associated
persons to whom such amendments are relevant. 1719 Based on estimates in Section V,
compliance with the supervision rules may involve an aggregate initial cost of

1719

See Section V for an estimate of burdens and costs related to the diligent
supervision rules.

679

$39,317,850 and an ongoing cost of $8,405,100 for all SBS Entities. 1720 In addition,
these final rules impose new supervision requirements on SBS Entities, which may
increase the probability and related costs of responding to legal actions. However, to the
extent that these supervision rules may enhance compliance with federal securities laws
and Commission rules and regulations thereunder, the probability and costs of responding
to regulatory inquiries and private actions may actually decrease.
We have considered the alternative of excluding Major SBS Participants from the
scope of the supervision rules and have received mixed comment on the issue, as
discussed in Section II. One commenter indicated that the rule may impose burdensome
and costly supervisory procedures on Major SBS Participants that are not appropriate
given their non-dealer role in the marketplace, and the potential costs of compliance
“would be without any meaningful offsetting benefit for other market participants or the
financial markets as a whole.” 1721 The commenter did not provide any data to quantify
potential costs or benefits for Major SBS Participants. We recognize that these rules
impose requirements and costs on Major SBS Participants they are not currently required
to bear, as reflected in our estimates. We also note that the Commission elsewhere
estimated that only between zero and five entities may seek to register with the
Commission as Major SBS Participants. The Commission continues to believe that due
to their large positions in security-based swaps, activities of Major SBS Participants may
pose significant risks, such as market and counterparty risks, in security-based swap
1720

Initial internal cost: (Compliance manager $283 per hour) x
103,950=$29,417,850. Initial external legal counsel costs: $9,900,000. Ongoing
costs: (Compliance manager $283 per hour) x 29,700 = $8,405,100.

1721

See MFA, supra note 5.

680

markets, as discussed in Section II above, the Commission believes the application of the
rules is thus appropriate.
6.

CCO Rules

Rule 15Fk-1 requires an SBS Entity to designate a CCO, and imposes certain
duties and responsibilities on that CCO, including the preparation of an annual
compliance report. In addition, under Rule 15Fk-1(d), the compensation and removal of
the CCO require the approval of a majority of the board of directors of the SBS Entity.
We note that the adopted SBS Entity registration forms already require SBS Entities to
designate an individual to serve as a CCO, which enters into an economic baseline
against which we are assessing the effects of these final rules. Therefore, the primary
economic effects of these final CCO rules stem from the annual compliance report
requirement, other duties of the CCO, and CCO compensation and removal requirements.
a.

Annual Compliance Report, Conflicts of Interest,
Policies and Procedures

Rule 15Fk-1(c) requires each SBS Entity’s CCO to prepare and sign an annual
compliance report containing a description of the SBS Entity’s written policies and
procedures described in paragraph (b) of the rule, including the code of ethics and
conflict of interest policies. The report must also contain a description of: the SBS
Entity’s assessment of the effectiveness of its policies and procedures relating to its
business as an SBS Entity; any material changes to the SBS Entity’s policies and
procedures; any areas for improvement, and recommended potential or prospective
changes or improvements to the SBS Entity’s compliance program and resources devoted
to compliance; any material non-compliance matters; and the financial, managerial,
operational, and staffing resources set aside for compliance with the Exchange Act and

681

the rules and regulations thereunder relating to its business as an SBS Entity, including
any material deficiencies in such resources. Further, SBS Entities must promptly submit
an amended compliance report if material errors or omissions in the report are identified.
The submission of the annual compliance report as required by the final rules may help
the Commission assess the compliance activities of SBS Entities.
In addition, Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2) requires the CCO to take reasonable steps to
ensure that the SBS Entity establishes, maintains and reviews policies and procedures
reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder relating to its business as an SBS Entity by: reviewing the compliance of the
SBS Entity; and taking reasonable steps to ensure that the SBS Entity establishes policies
and procedures for the remediation and handling of non-compliance issues. Rule 15Fk1(b)(3) requires the CCO, in consultation with the board of directors or senior officer, to
take reasonable steps to resolve any material conflicts of interest that may arise; and Rule
15Fk-1(b)(4) requires the CCO to administer each policy and procedure required to be
established under Section 15F of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.
Our final rules impose a set of duties and responsibilities on CCOs of SBS
Entities. As described in the economic baseline and discussed in earlier sections, the
Commission believes that a number of entities that will seek to register as SBS Entities
may be dually registered, and may already be required to comply with some of these rules
in swap or reference security markets. However, we note that SBS Entity registration is
currently not required, and entities intermediating security-based swaps, including dually
registered entities, are not required to comply with business conduct or CCO rules

682

relating to their business as an SBS Entity. Therefore, these rules impose a new set of
requirements on a population of SBS Entity registrants as they pertain to security-based
swap business. To the extent that CCO oversight may facilitate compliance, the above
rules may enhance compliance of SBS Entities with federal securities laws and other
Commission rules. 1722
Based on our analysis in Section V, the establishment and administration of the
policies and procedures required under Rule 15Fk-1 will involve a total initial cost of
approximately $13,105,950, and an ongoing cost of approximately $2,801,700 per year
for all SBS Entities. 1723 Ongoing costs of preparation of an annual compliance report by
the CCO is estimated at approximately $2,480,775 for all SBS Entities. 1724
In addition, these rules impose new requirements concerning CCO duties. These
final rules also require the annual compliance report to include a certification by the CCO
or senior officer, and may increase CCO or senior officer liability when the CCO or
senior officer executes the required certification. If SBS Entity CCOs or senior officers
are risk averse, they may require additional liability insurance, higher compensation or
lower incentive pay as a fraction of overall compensation. To the extent that liability

lower the likelihood of non-compliance with securities rules and regulations. See
SDR Registration Release, 80 FR at 14543, supra note 1202.

1723

Initial cost of policies and procedures: (Compliance manager at $283 per hour) x
34,650 hours = $9,805,950. Initial cost of outside counsel: $3,300,000. Total
initial cost: $9,805,950 + $3,300,000 = $13,105,950. Ongoing cost: (Compliance
manager at $283 per hour) x 9,900 hours = $2,801,700.

Ongoing cost of compliance reporting: (CCO at $485 per hour) x 5,115 hours =
$2,480,775.

may be a significant consideration for some SBS Entities, this may lower the labor supply
of senior officers or CCOs in security-based swap markets.
b.

CCO Removal and Compensation

CCOs play a central role in monitoring compliance with federal securities laws
and regulations. These final rules elevate approval of decisions regarding the
compensation or removal of the CCO to the board. As indicated in the proposing release,
the Commission believes that the approach being adopted may reduce inherent conflicts
of interest that arise when CCO compensation and removal decisions are made by
individuals whose compliance with applicable law and regulations the CCO is
responsible for monitoring. 1725 The rule, therefore, may mitigate CCO conflicts of
interest within SBS Entities, and may strengthen SBS Entity compliance with federal
securities laws and Commission rules, including these final business conduct rules.
SBS Entities are expected to be primarily large institutions and may be part of
organizational structures that include hundreds of entities, with varying levels of business
complexity. Many SBS Entities may also be active in swap markets, while others may
also perform broker-dealer functions or have banking operations; yet others may focus
their primary business on security-based swaps. As a result, different governance and
oversight structures may be suitable for different SBS Entities depending on their internal
operations, business complexity, and the role security-based swap transactions play in
their overall operations, among others. Therefore, the rule limits the ability to delegate
CCO compensation and removal decisions to a senior officer, which may be optimal for
some SBS Entities.
1725

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42451, supra note 3.

684

CCO compensation and removal decisions require an understanding of securitybased swap markets and the SBS Entities’ business opportunities in such markets,
compliance risks related to various SBS Entity activities and transactions, the labor
market for CCOs of SBS Entities, and an ability to infer the quality of skills and effort
exerted by the CCO from performance. To the extent SBS Entity boards lack specific
expertise necessary to approve compensation and removal decisions, such boards may
currently delegate these functions to other officers, such as head of compliance, chief risk
officer, or other persons. As a result of the final rules, such delegation will not be
permitted, and boards of some SBS Entities may be required to gather additional
information or gain expertise necessary to approve compensation and removal decisions.
SBS Entities that currently delegate these functions to other officers may need to
refocus board resources on the area of compliance. As a result, SBS Entity boards may
need to replace existing directors, hire new directors, or retain the services of independent
executive search and compensation consultants that are familiar with security-based
swaps. This may detract from the time and resources SBS Entity boards are able to
invest in overseeing activities in other markets, which may represent a larger fraction of
the business and shareholder profits for some SBS Entities. To the extent that SBS Entity
boards face time and resource constraints, they may also become less effective at
monitoring and advising SBS Entities in areas outside of compliance. Further, the
requirement that SBS Entity boards approve CCO compensation and removal decisions,
may increase the liability of SBS Entity’s directors, which may increase the costs of
director liability insurance and director compensation. Nevertheless, as discussed above,
the Commission continues to believe that these final rules may reduce certain conflicts of

685

interest related to CCO compensation and removal decisions, which may strengthen SBS
Entity compliance with federal securities laws and Commission rules.
The final rules do not address the appointment of the CCO. However, the rules
require the CCO to report directly to the board or senior officer, and require decisions
regarding the compensation and removal of the CCO to be approved by the board. As a
result, some SBS Entities may separate reporting to and appointment by the senior
officer, from compensation and removal decisions by the board. The Commission
recognizes that appointment, compensation and removal decisions may be inextricably
intertwined, requiring an informed assessment of the CCO’s talent, abilities, expertise
and performance when compared against external candidates, as well as an understanding
of the CCO labor market. Further, a senior officer may have conflicts of interest in CCO
appointment decisions similar to those present in CCO compensation or removal
decisions. A potential separation of the CCO reporting line and appointment decisions
from compensation and removal decisions may decrease the quality of these decisions.
However, the ability of some SBS Entity boards to continue to rely on senior officers for
the CCO to report to and for appointment decisions may mitigate some of the resource
drain on boards of SBS Entities discussed above.
We have considered an alternative approach under which only independent
members of the board can approve decisions regarding the compensation, appointment
and removal of CCOs, as proposed by some commenters, 1726 as well as requiring certain
minimum CCO qualifications and governance practices. Independent directors may have
fewer conflicts of interest and may be less likely to be influenced by CCOs, strengthening
1726

See, e.g., Barnard, supra note 5 and Better Markets (August 2011), supra note 5.

686

their oversight role, which may enhance SBS Entity compliance with security laws, and
rules and regulations thereunder. At the same time, outside directors face an
informational asymmetry with respect to the SBS Entity’s risks and investment
opportunities, and may lack an intimate understanding of the SBS Entity’s business. We
understand that SBS Entities may trade off the value of specific expertise in securitybased swaps on the one hand, with the value of independence in the face of potential
conflicts of interest on the other hand, in the context of each SBS Entity’s operations.
Requiring specific CCO qualifications and other governance practices of all SBS Entities
may enhance compliance for some SBS Entities, but may also involve potentially costly
restructuring of internal governance structures and operations while offering few benefits
for other SBS Entities as recognized by one commenter. 1727
Additionally, appropriate CCO qualifications may depend on the CCO’s
functional roles and expertise, and business activities that the SBS Entity engage in,
particularly for SBS Entities that operate within larger consolidated financial institutions
with the same CCO. One-size-fits-all qualification requirements or competency exams
would restrict the level and type of expertise of CCOs that SBS Entities are able to retain,
and would require some SBS Entities to remove the current CCOs and search for new
CCOs meeting the imposed qualification requirements. Crucially, it is not clear how
many SBS Entities currently hire and retain underqualified CCOs. The Commission is
not requiring any particular level or type of competency or business experience for a
CCO as part of these final rules. However, as discussed in Section II, the Commission
believes that an SBS Entity’s CCO generally should be competent and knowledgeable
1727

See FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

687

regarding the federal securities laws, empowered with full responsibility and authority to
develop appropriate policies and procedures for the SBS Entity, as necessary, and
responsible for monitoring compliance with the SBS Entity’s policies and procedures
adopted pursuant to rules under the Exchange Act. Similarly, mandatory quarterly or
annual meetings with the board or certain committees of SBS Entities, proposed by one
commenter, 1728may not mitigate potential conflicts of interest involving CCOs, or
facilitate compliance where such conflicts or deficiencies stem from board or committee
collective action problems, weak monitoring or misaligned incentives, instead of a lack of
communication or information. .
As discussed in Section II, commenters disagreed on the relative merits of the
approach being adopted and the alternatives above. 1729 The above economic effects are
not readily amenable to quantification. Commenters did not provide data or other
information that would facilitate quantification of these effects; no such data is publicly
available. The overall effects of these competing considerations regarding the CCO rules
being adopted depend on internal governance structures of SBS Entities, their
organizational complexity, severity of the conflicts of interest between SBS Entity CCOs
and other officers, reliance of existing SBS Entity boards on external executive search
and compensation consultants, importance of security-based swap performance and
compliance for SBS Entity profitability and counterparty protections, optimal delegation
of oversight, and the ways in which SBS Entities may restructure their business in
response to these and other pending substantive Title VII rules.

Pay to Play

Rules 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vi) and 15Fh-6 impose a two-year time out period after
certain political contributions by security-swap dealers and certain independent
representatives. Rule 15Fh-6(b) generally prohibits SBS Dealers from offering to enter
into, or entering into, a security-based swap or trading strategy involving a security-based
swap with a municipal entity within two years following any contribution to an official of
such municipal entity made by the SBS Dealer or any of its covered associates. The rule
also prohibits SBS Dealers and any covered associates from providing or agreeing to
provide payment to any person to solicit a municipal entity to offer to enter into, or to
enter into, security-based swaps, unless such person is a regulated person. The rule
prohibits SBS Dealers and any covered associates from coordinating or soliciting any
person or political action committee to make contributions to officials of a municipal
entity, or to a political party of a state or locality, with which the SBS Dealer is offering
to enter into, or has entered into, a security-based swap or a trading strategy involving a
security-based swap.
Under Rule 15Fh-6(a)(2) covered associates will include general partners,
managing members, executive officers or other persons of similar status or function;
employees who solicit municipal entities to enter security-based swaps with an SBS
dealer, and all persons directly or indirectly supervising such employees; and political
action committees controlled by such persons or SBS Dealers.
These final rules also limit political contributions by independent representatives
in security-based swaps. Under Rule 15Fh-5(a) SBS Entities who offer to enter into or
enter into a security-based swap with a special entity must have a reasonable basis to

689

believe that the special entity has a qualified independent representative. Rule 15Fh5(a)(1)(vi) provides that in the case of a special entity, a qualified independent
representative is a person that is subject to rules of the Commission, the CFTC or an SRO
prohibiting it from engaging in specified activities if certain political contributions have
been made, except where the independent representative is an employee of the special
entity.
As discussed in more detail below, our economic analysis of these final rules
reflects the fact that a large majority of entities expected to seek registration as SBS
Entities are expected to be dually registered and required to comply with similar pay to
play rules in other markets.
These final rules are intended to address pay to play relationships that may
interfere with the process by which municipal entities allocate capital to security-based
swaps to enhance returns or manage risk on behalf of their stakeholders. 1730 To the
extent that these final rules reduce the incidence of pay to play practices, municipal
entities may become less subject to conflicts of interest related to political contributions
by SBS Dealers. To the extent that conflicts of interest related to political contributions
may currently be affecting capital allocation by municipal entities, resulting in
inefficiencies from conflicted counterparty or product selection, these rules may benefit
municipal entities and their stakeholders. Consistent with the expected benefits
articulated in the proposing release, these rules may deter undue influence from SBS
dealers and advisors. Therefore, these rules may enhance counterparty protections of
municipal entities and increase allocative efficiency. In addition, these rules may also
1730

See Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42450, supra note 3.

690

encourage SBS Dealers to compete on the merits of the transaction. Similarly, under
Rule 15Fh-5 qualified independent representatives of special entities in security-based
swaps will be employees and representatives subject to pay to play rules of the
Commission, the CFTC or an SRO, such as registered municipal advisors or registered
investment advisers. To the extent that some special entities may currently rely on
advisors that are not employees or registered investment or municipal advisors, special
entities may become less affected by potential conflicts of interest of representatives, and
independent representatives may be encouraged to compete on their qualifications,
service quality, and cost. These benefits may flow through to stakeholders of municipal
entities, such as participants in public pension plans and taxpayers.
To the extent that SBS Dealers are currently recovering the costs from pay to play
practices in the form of higher prices of security-based swaps, these final rules may
decrease transaction costs. We have no data or other information on the prevalence of
political contributions of SBS Dealers, the number and contributions of their covered
associates, and transaction costs and non-price terms of security-based swaps offered for
sale to special entities. Such data is not publicly available and commenters have not
provided data to enable such quantification. However, a study by Butler, Fauver and
Mortal (2009) found that negotiated bid deals had underwriter gross spreads of 12–14
basis points (about one-seventh of the mean gross spread) higher during the pay-to-play
era. 1731 The study concluded that, when underwriting firms were routinely able to make

1731

See Alexander W. Butler, Larry Fauver, and Sandra Mortal, Corruption, Political
Connections, and Municipal Finance, 22 The Review of Financial Studies 28-73
(2009).

691

political campaign contributions to win underwriting business, gross spreads were
significantly higher, but only for those deals that were negotiated that enable conflicted
underwriter selection. This may indicate that, absent pay to play rules, offerings subject
to conflicts of interest related to political contributions may not always be negotiated at
market rates. Pay to play rules may decrease certain costs to municipal entities and their
stakeholders, but may increase costs to dealers from greater quality based competition.
Several caveats apply. While the pay to play regime considered in the study
above examines the effects of the contribution limits in the 1994 pay to play reforms, and
the contribution thresholds in these final rules are comparable in magnitude, we cannot
quantify the levels at which certain political contributions by SBS Dealers and their
covered associates may give rise to conflicts of interest. However, we note that de
minimis thresholds in the final rules have been harmonized with existing rules to which
Swap Entities and investment advisers are subject. We also note that the effect on
spreads quantified above has been estimated around the adoption of the MSRB pay to
play rule. These final rules follow pay to play rules adopted by the MSRB, the CFTC
and the Commission. In light of extensive cross-market participation and expected dual
registration of some entities, the economic effects of these final rules may be smaller than
those discussed above, if some SBS Dealers and other market participants have already
restructured their business practices in security-based swap markets as a result of existing
pay to play rules in other markets.
In a theoretical model by Cotton (2012), contributions may increase access but
not necessarily improve outcomes for some agents, while contribution limits
decrease rent extraction and may encourage more evidence disclosure. See C.
Cotton, Pay-to-play Politics: Informational Lobbying and Contribution Limits
When Money Buys Access, 96 Journal of Public Economics 369-386 (2012).

692

Finally, the two-year time out may disincentivize direct political contributions to
certain officials by SBS Dealers and their covered associates. To the extent that SBS
Dealers and covered associates may increase contributions to other entities, such as
501(c) organizations 1732 or independent expenditure committees, which are not subject to
these final rules, and to the extent these other expenditures may facilitate ongoing pay to
play practices, the above benefits may be reduced.
As a result of the pay to play rule, SBS Dealers will incur costs, including costs of
establishing and implementing policies and procedures to monitor the political
contributions made by the SBS Dealer and its covered associates. As indicated in Section
V, pay to play rules will require collection of information regarding political
contributions of SBS Dealers and their covered associates, which may cost up to
$3,515,000 for all dealers. 1733 Additionally, as discussed in Section V above, SBS
Dealers may incur one-time initial costs to establish or enhance current systems to assist
in their compliance with the rule, estimated at up to $5,000,000 for all SBS Dealers. 1734
Compliance costs imposed by the rule are expected to vary significantly among SBS
Dealers, depending on, among other things, the number of covered associates and the

1732

See, e.g., McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, 134 S.Ct. 1434, 1460
(2014).

1733

Initial cost: (In-house attorney at $380 per hour) x 9,250 hours = $3,515,000. This
figure may overestimate the initial cost burden on some SBS Dealers if some of
the functions are performed by in-house compliance managers instead of in-house
attorneys.

1734

In the Advisers Act pay to play rule, the Commission estimated that firms with
over 15 covered associates incur, on average, $100,000 startup costs. Assuming
all SBS Dealers will have over 15 covered associates, the initial cost is estimated
at: 50 SBS Dealers x $100,000 = $5,000,000. See Advisers Act Pay-to-Play
Release, supra note 1100 (adopting Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-5)).

693

supervisory structure of the SBS Dealer; the degree to which compliance procedures are
automated (such as policies and procedures requiring pre-clearance); and the extent to
which the SBS Dealer may already have policies and procedures guiding political
contributions under ethics or compliance programs. Smaller SBS Dealers, for example,
would likely have a small number of covered associates, and thus expend fewer resources
to comply with the proposed rule. However, to the extent that the cost of developing
policies and procedures may have a high fixed cost component, smaller SBS dealers may
incur costs that represent a higher percentage of net income. Lastly, these costs will be
greater for SBS Dealers with multiple layers of supervision and a higher number of
covered associates with shorter tenures.
Under the final rules, the two-year time out on SBS dealing with municipal
entities is triggered when any of the covered associates has contributed in excess of the
de minimis thresholds. While developing and implementing policies and procedures
related to political contributions and training covered associates may mitigate this risk,
some SBS Dealers may still trigger the time out despite these measures due to
contributions by one of their covered associates.
Such SBS Dealers will incur costs from the loss of business with municipal
entities. We note that the final rules contain a safe harbor for contributions by natural
persons that predate the date of becoming a covered associate by more than 6 months, if
such associates do not solicit municipal entities on behalf of the SBS Dealer. Further, if
the SBS Dealer discovers the triggering contribution under $350 within 4 months and
secures a return of funds within 60 days, the prohibition will not apply. In response to

694

commenter concerns, 1735 and consistent with Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-5, the final rules
provide up to two such exemptions per year for dealers with 50 or fewer covered
associates, and up to three such exemptions for dealers with over 50 covered associates.
We do not have data or other information concerning the number of general partners,
managing members, executive officers or other persons of similar status and function in
SBS Entities; the number of employees that solicit municipal entities to enter securitybased swaps with SBS Dealers; SBS Dealer supervisory structures for such employees; or
political action committees controlled by such persons or SBS Dealers. However, the
Commission has previously estimated that as many as 423 natural persons may associate
with each SBS Dealer. 1736 Therefore, we believe that many SBS Entities are likely to be
able to take advantage of up to 3 annual exemptions against inadvertent violations
described above.
The final rules also allow SBS Dealers to file applications for exemptive relief,
and outline a list of items to be addressed, including, whether the SBS Dealer has
developed policies and procedures to monitor political contributions; the steps taken after
discovery of the contribution; and the apparent intent in making the contribution based on
the facts and circumstances of each case. These safe harbors, combined with the ability
to apply for exemptive relief, may partly mitigate the direct and indirect costs of SBS
Dealers triggering the timeout and being precluded from dealing with municipal entities.
As discussed in Section V, the incidence of exemptive relief related to MSRB
Rule G-37 and the number of applications the Commission has received under the
1735

FIA/ISDA/SIFMA, supra note 5.

1736

See Rule of Practice 194 Proposing Release, 80 FR at 51710.

695

Adviser’s act pay to play rules may be indicative of possible applications for exemptive
relief under these final rules. Recognizing that this is an estimate, we conservatively
estimate that the Commission may receive up to two applications for exemptive relief per
year with respect to pay to play rules, 1737 at a total ongoing cost of $25,600 per year. 1738
Costs of compliance with the final pay to play rules may be recovered by SBS
Dealers in the form of higher costs of security-based swaps offered to municipal entities.
If the costs are significant and cannot be fully recovered from counterparties some SBS
Dealers may limit their security-based swap transactions with municipal entities and
reduce their access to OTC security-based swaps. However, the pay-to-play rules do not
apply to security-based swaps executed on national registered exchanges or SEFs, where
the security-based swap dealer does not know the identity of the counterparty to the
transaction at a reasonably sufficient time prior to execution to permit the security-based
swap dealer to comply. Therefore, municipal entities will retain access to more liquid
and standardized security-based swaps executed on SEFs or registered national
exchanges, and will continue to be able to rely on security-based swaps as a tool for risk
mitigation.
1737

FINRA has granted 17 exemptive letters related to Rule G-37 between 1/2005 and
12/2015 (11 years) http://www.finra.org/industry/exemptive-letters . As of 1/2016
there were 665 SEC registered muni advisers http://www.sec.gov/help/foia-docsmuniadvisorshtm.html. Using these figures, we obtain an estimate of (17
applications/11 years) x (50 SBS Dealers/ 665) = 0.117 applications per year.
In addition, the Commission has received 13 applications under the Adviser’s act
(since the compliance date, approximately 4 years). As of 2/2016 there were
11,959 registered investment advisers filing form ADV
https://www.sec.gov/foia/docs/invafoia.htm. Using these figures, (13
applications/4 years) x (50 SBS Dealers/ 11,959)= 0.014 applications per year

1738

Ongoing cost: (Outside counsel at $400 per hour x 32 hours per application x 2) =
$25,600

696

Once SBS Dealers have to comply with the rule, to the extent that SBS Dealers
currently engaging in pay to play practices enjoy a competitive advantage over SBS
Dealers that are not, they may lose some of their business with municipal entities and
related profits. However, other SBS Dealers that do not currently engage in pay to play
practices may win business, and SBS Dealers may begin to seek competitive advantages
through lower transaction costs, more customized security-based swaps, or superior
execution, benefitting municipal entity counterparties.
If some SBS Dealers currently intermediating a significant volume of transactions
with municipal entities trigger the two-year time out, it could limit the number of SBS
Dealers able to offer to enter into or enter into security-based swaps with municipal
entities. However, the lost market share is likely to be picked up by other SBS Dealers.
The presence and direction of any economic effects would depend on the number of SBS
Dealers that trigger the time outs; the market power of the prohibited SBS Dealers; the
market power of SBS Dealers that may be able to step in; and the importance of bilateral
relationships. Further, municipal entities will continue to have unconstrained access to
security-based swaps transacted through SEFs or registered national security exchanges.
The Commission recognizes that these rules impose restrictions on persons that
can represent special entities in security-based swap transactions of special entities with
SBS Entities. As discussed in Section II.H.6.f, under Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vi), qualified
independent representatives of special entities must be subject to pay to play rules of the
Commission, the CFTC or an SRO, except where the independent representative is an
employee of the special entity. If special entities currently rely on advisors not subject to
pay to play rules, or do not rely on independent advisors in their transactions with SBS

697

Entities in security-based swaps, they will incur costs related to retaining qualified
independent representatives. These costs will depend on the type of advisor search the
special entity would choose to perform, the special entity’s ability to delegate such
functions to current employees, and labor market conditions for qualified independent
representatives. Table 2 of the economic baseline shows that the overwhelming majority
of special entities transact through SEC registered investment advisers already subject to
similar pay to play rules under the Adviser’s Act. Special entities that do not transact
through SEC registered investment advisers likely rely on municipal advisors subject to
MSRB rules or employees in their transactions with SBS Entities. While we have no data
or other information to enable us to identify what fraction of advisors representing special
entities would meet the qualified independent representative requirements of these final
rules, the above considerations indicate that costs of pay to play rules for independent
representatives of special entities may be mitigated.
However, the Commission recognizes that, to the extent that some representatives
currently intermediating special entity transactions with SBS Entities would be prohibited
from advising special entities under these final rules, some representatives may incur
costs related to loss of business, and competition among qualified independent
representatives of special entities may decrease. At the same time, representatives
prohibited from such activities under these final rules may seek to register as SEC
registered investment advisers, MSRB registered municipal advisors or special entity
employees, becoming subject to pay to play rules referenced in Rule 15Fh-5(a)(1)(vi) and
continuing to represent special entities in compliance with these final rules. Therefore,

698

the overall effect of pay to play rules on competition among qualified independent
representatives of special entities is unclear.
As a result of the two-year time out and other pay to play requirements, SBS
Dealers transacting with municipal entities, as well as covered associates of SBS Dealers,
may be less likely to make certain political contributions and payments to political parties
at or above de minimis thresholds. This may result in a decrease in funding by SBS
Dealers and their covered associates for such campaigns through direct contributions and
political action committees. However, to the extent that the two-year time out may
disincentivize direct contributions, SBS Dealers and covered associates may turn to other
avenues of political speech, such as contributing unlimited amounts to 501(c)
organizations or independent expenditure committees, which are not required to disclose
donors and are not prohibited under these final rules. 1739 Therefore, the overall effect of
these final rules on the aggregate volume of political contributions by SBS Dealers and
their covered associates to campaigns is unclear.
As clarified in Section II, the Commission is adopting an approach, under which
these prohibitions will not be triggered for an SBS Dealer or any of its covered associates
by contributions made before the SBS Dealer registered with the Commission as such.
We also note that these prohibitions will not apply to contributions made before the
compliance date of the rule by newly covered associates to which the look back applies.
At the same time, if individuals who later become covered associates make a triggering
contribution on or after the compliance date of this rule, the contribution would trigger

1739

See, e.g., McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, 134 S.Ct. 1434, 1460
(2014).

699

the two-year time out if it were made less than, as applicable, six months or two years
before the individual became a newly covered associate.
We have also considered the alternative, under which dealers would enjoy a safe
harbor where the municipal entity is represented by a qualified independent
representative, as proposed by one commenter. 1740 Such an alternative would lower the
scope of entities and transactions affected by the pay to play prohibitions. As discussed
in earlier sections and discussed in the economic baseline, approximately 98% of special
entities rely on investment advisers in their CDS transactions. While we do not have data
or information allowing us to conclude whether these investment advisers would be
considered independent qualified representatives under our final rules, this alternative has
the potential to substantially reduce the scope of application of the pay to play rules.
While this may reduce direct and indirect costs of pay to play rules for SBS Dealers, this
may also reduce their benefits, if qualified independent advisor representation does not
fully resolve conflicts of interest related to prohibited political contributions by SBS
Dealers and covered associates.
Finally, we have considered the alternative of increasing or decreasing the number
of exemptions for inadvertent violations. The ability of SBS Dealers to cure reduces the
risk that some SBS Dealers may trigger a two-year timeout as a result of inadvertent
violations due to prohibited contributions by covered associates, related losses, and
potential adverse effects on competition and market liquidity. At the same time,
increasing the number of automatic exceptions available to SBS Dealers decreases their
incentives to monitor their and their covered associates’ political contributions, and may
1740

See SIFMA(August 2011), supra note 5.

700

facilitate ongoing pay to play practices. We also note that, under the rules being adopted,
in addition to such automatic exceptions, SBS Dealers would be able to apply with the
Commission for exemptive relief.
We do not have data or any other information concerning the sizes, donors and
recipients of political contributions of entities that may trigger SBS Dealer registration
and covered associates. No such information is publicly available, and commenters did
not provide data enabling such quantification. Therefore, we cannot quantify the
magnitude of the above effects.
8.

Scope
a.

Inter-Affiliate Transactions

The final business conduct rules are designed to facilitate counterparty
protections, reduce information asymmetries, and enable Commission oversight.
However, as discussed in Sections V and VI above, these final rules impose direct and
indirect compliance costs, and may erode SBS Entities’ profitability of dealing in
security-based swaps, which may reduce the incentive for dealers to intermediate SBS
transactions and provide liquidity to end users. We recognize, however, that some
market participants, such as complex and diversified corporations or institutions, may in
the regular course of business enter into inter-affiliate security-based swaps to manage
risk inside a corporate group or to transfer risk to a treasury department or central
affiliate.
When the economic interests of those affiliates are aligned adequately, as would
be found in the case of majority-ownership, such security-based swaps serve to allocate
or transfer risks within an affiliated group, rather than to move those risks out of the

701

group to an unaffiliated third party. Therefore, the application of these final business
conduct rules to security-based swaps that SBS Entities enter into with majority-owned
affiliates is unlikely to yield enhanced counterparty protections as discussed above. At
the same time, SBS Entities would incur costs related to compliance with these final rules
for such transactions. Therefore, the exclusion of such transactions may avoid costs that
are less likely to be offset by the economic benefits considered above. Further, the CFTC
excludes such swaps from substantive business conduct requirements for Swap Entities.
Imposing these rules with respect to such security-based swaps would increase the
relative costs of transacting in security-based swap markets, including single-name CDS,
and swap markets, including index CDS. Such an approach may fragment an otherwise
integrated market and could lead to a flight of liquidity to swap markets, with follow on
effects on market liquidity and price discovery. As indicated earlier, Rule 15Fh-1(a)
specifies that security-based swaps that SBS Entities enter into with the majority-owned
affiliates will be excluded from Rules 15Fh-3(a) through 15Fh-3(f), 240.15Fh-4(b) and
240.15Fh-5. We note that CCO and supervision rules will continue to apply to dealers
engaging in such swaps.
b.

Opt Out

These final rules are intended to strengthen counterparty protections, reduce
informational asymmetries between SBS Entities and their counterparties, and enhance
Commission oversight over security-based swap markets. We recognize the inherent
heterogeneity in the level of general sophistication and informedness specific to securitybased swaps of various counterparties of SBS Entities, as suggested by some

702

commenters. 1741 The final rules do not allow counterparties of SBS Entities to opt out
from some or all of the substantive business conduct requirements, such as disclosures of
material characteristics, risks, conflicts of interest, incentives and clearing rights;
suitability assessments or pay to play rules. As a result, more sophisticated and better
informed counterparties of SBS Entities may enjoy few benefits, but may incur costs
from these final rules.
The final rules reflect these competing considerations through a reliance on
representations approach, and in safe harbors and alternatives, such as the institutional
suitability alternative for customer-specific suitability and the independent advisor safe
harbor for SBS Entities advising special entities. Further, some of the requirements, such
as pre-trade disclosures of material incentives, risks and characteristics, will not apply to
counterparties that are themselves SBS or Swap Entities. Yet other rules impose
requirements on SBS Dealers, but not on Major SBS Participants, recognizing the central
role of dealers as intermediaries in security-based swap markets. Finally, as discussed
throughout the release, many of these final business conduct requirements are
harmonized with CFTC and FINRA conduct rules, which do not allow counterparties to
opt out of these or similar protections.
We also note that if counterparties are able to opt-out of some or all of the
substantive requirements, SBS Entities may have an incentive to require opt-out of these
final rules prior to transacting with their counterparties, or cease business with such
counterparties. This effect is more likely to be present for SBS Entity – counterparty
relationships, in which counterparties have the least bargaining power, such as less
1741

See, e.g., CalSTRS, supra note 5.

703

sophisticated counterparties that do not regularly access security-based swap markets, do
not have established relationships with multiple dealers, and engage in low volumes of
security-based swap activity. This may result in smaller, less sophisticated and less
informed counterparties, which are ex ante most likely to benefit from the disclosures and
protections in these final rules, opting out of business conduct rules or risking the loss of
access to OTC security-based swaps if opt out was permitted. However, we recognize
that the ability of counterparties to opt out of these final rules would give such entities
greater flexibility in structuring their relationships with SBS Entities relative to the
approach being adopted, and allow them to trade off the benefits of counterparty
protections and information benefits of these final rules against potentially greater costs
and lower liquidity in SBS Entity intermediated OTC security-based swaps under these
final business conduct standards.
Finally, these economic considerations are attenuated by the fact that many of the
final rules are not applicable to if the SBS Entity does not know the identity of the
counterparty at a reasonably sufficient time prior to the execution of the transaction to
permit the SBS Entity to comply with the obligations of the rule and, in certain instances,
the transaction is executed on a registered national exchange or a registered or exempt
SEF.

Cross-Border Application

As the Commission has indicated in other releases, 1742 security-based swap
markets are global, and market data presented in the economic baseline demonstrates

1742

See, e.g., Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47280, supra note 684; U.S.
Activity Proposing Release, 80 FR at 27454

704

extensive cross-border participation in security-based swap markets. For instance, Figure
1 shows that, based on DTCC-TIW data for 2014, approximately half of all new accounts
participating in the market are accounts with a domicile outside the U.S. Viewed from the
perspective of the domiciles of the counterparties booking credit default swap (“CDS”)
transactions, approximately 48 percent of price forming North American corporate
single-name CDS transactions from January 2008 to December 2014 were cross-border
transactions between a U.S.-domiciled counterparty and a foreign-domiciled
counterparty, and an additional 40 percent of such CDS transactions were between two
foreign-domiciled counterparties (see Figure 3). Thus, only 12 percent of the global
transaction volume by notional volume between 2008 and 2014 was between two U.S.domiciled counterparties, using registered office location of the TIW accounts to identify
domiciles. Together, these data indicate that cross-border transactions are a common
feature of dealing activity in the security-based swap market.
Further, SBS Dealers and other counterparties are highly interconnected, with
most dealers transacting with hundreds of counterparties, and most non-dealers
transacting with several dealers. 1743 The global scale of the security-based swap market
allows counterparties to access liquidity across jurisdictional boundaries, providing
market participants with opportunities to share these risks with counterparties around the
world. Because dealers facilitate the great majority of security-based swap transactions,
with bilateral relationships that extend to potentially thousands of counterparties,
1743

Based on an analysis of 2014 DTCC-TIW transaction data, accounts likely to
register with the Commission as SBS Dealers have on average 759 unique
counterparties (a median of 453 unique counterparties). All other accounts (i.e.,
those more likely to belong to non-dealers) averaged four unique counterparties (a
median of three counterparties).

705

deficiencies in SBS Dealer disclosures, recommendations of unsuitable security-based
swaps, and informational asymmetries may affect a large number of counterparties and
have potentially significant cross-border implications.
a.

Scope of Application to SBS Entities

As discussed in Section III, business conduct requirements fall into two
categories: entity-level business conduct requirements, such as CCO rules and
supervision, and transaction-level requirements, such as disclosure and suitability. The
final rules create certain exceptions from application of the transaction-level business
conduct requirements to registered SBS Dealers and Major SBS Participants in certain
transactions. With respect to SBS Dealers, these transaction-level requirements will
apply to any transaction that constitutes an SBS Dealer’s U.S. business but not to any
transaction that constitutes its foreign business. For U.S. SBS Dealers, U.S. business
includes all of their transactions, except for certain transactions conducted through a
foreign branch. For foreign SBS Dealers, U.S. business includes all of their transactions
with U.S. persons (except for certain transactions conducted through a foreign branch of
a U.S.-person counterparty) and transactions captured by the U.S. Activity Test (i.e.,
transactions with another non-U.S. person that the foreign SBS Dealer arranges,
negotiates, or executes using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office).
The final rule creates a slightly different exception for Major SBS Participants.
U.S. Major SBS Participants must comply with the business conduct requirements in all
their transactions, except for certain transactions conducted through a foreign branch, and
foreign Major SBS Participants must comply with the requirements in their transactions
with U.S. persons, except for certain transactions conducted through a foreign branch.

706

Under the final rule, the exception for foreign Major SBS Participants does not
incorporate a U.S. Activity Test.
In considering the economic effects of this cross-border approach, we recognize
that the economic baseline reflects markets as they exist today, in which compliance with
business conduct standards for security-based swaps is not required. Therefore, these
final business conduct rules will apply with respect to security-based swap transactions
intermediated by SBS Entities where they currently do not. Under Exchange Act Section
15F, these requirements apply to registered SBS Entities by virtue of their registration
with the Commission and, in the absence of any exceptions to the requirements, would
apply to all business of a registered SBS Entity. However, final Exchange Act rules
3a71-3(c) and 3a67-10(d) create certain exceptions, as described above, that limit the
application of these requirements to a subset of the transactions of a registered SBS
Entity. For example, a foreign SBS Dealer transacting with a foreign counterparty will
not be subject to Title VII transaction-level business conduct requirements if the foreign
SBS Dealer does not rely on personnel located in the United States to arrange, negotiate
or execute the swap, including with respect to transactions in which the foreign SBS
Dealer’s counterparty may have relied on personnel located in the United States.
However, we recognize that the inclusion of the U.S. Activity Test in the
definition of “U.S. business” for foreign dealers may increase the set of transactions that
will be required to comply with these final business conduct rules, relative to the
alternative under which foreign dealers transacting with foreign counterparties are not
subject to these final rules. We also recognize that capturing transactions of foreign SBS

707

Entities with U.S. persons may increase the set of transactions subject to the final
business conduct rules as compared to the alternative of not capturing such transactions.
The final cross-border approach to the scope of the final business conduct
requirements may produce several benefits. First, classifying certain rules, such as
diligent supervision and CCO rules, as entity-level requirements that apply to the entire
security-based swap business of the registered SBS Entity may facilitate Commission
oversight of registered SBS Entities and enhance compliance with federal securities laws
and Commission rules. For example, as discussed in Section III and in the Cross-Border
Proposing Release, supervision and CCO rules are aimed at mitigating conflicts of
interest and enhancing compliance with securities laws, rules and regulations thereunder
by the entire registered SBS Entity. The Commission continues to recognize that relevant
conflicts of interest and non-compliance may arise as a result of transactions comprising
an SBS Entity’s foreign business. Further, we note that CCO duties include establishing,
maintaining, and reviewing policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
compliance with applicable Exchange Act requirements that apply to the SBS Entity as a
whole. As discussed in Section III, the Commission is applying diligent supervision and
CCO duties rules at the entity level.
Second, by imposing transaction-level requirements on transactions of SBS
Entities with U.S.-person counterparties, subject to a tailored foreign branch exception,
these final rules result in disclosure, suitability, fair and balanced communications and
special entity requirements, among others, applying to transactions that are particularly
likely to raise the types of counterparty protection and other concerns addressed by Title
VII business conduct requirements, whether carried out by U.S. or foreign SBS Entities.

708

Specifically, this approach to security-based swap transactions between registered SBS
Entities and U.S. persons may potentially enhance the expected counterparty protection,
reduce information asymmetry, and facilitate Commission oversight benefits of these
final rules to the U.S. security-based swap market.
Third, requiring registered foreign SBS Dealers (but not Major SBS Participants)
to comply with business conduct requirements with respect to any transaction with
another non-U.S.-person counterparty that the foreign SBS Dealer arranges, negotiates, or
executes using personnel located in the United States will facilitate more uniform
regulatory treatment of the security-based swap activity of registered SBS Dealers
operating in the United States, mitigating potential competitive distortions. 1744 Although
applying other business conduct frameworks (such as broker-dealer regulation) to this
activity may achieve similar regulatory goals, the availability of exceptions, exclusions
and safe harbors may mean that alternative frameworks may not apply to certain business
structures used by registered SBS Dealers to carry out their business in the United

1744

We recognize that, depending on the business structure that a registered U.S. or
foreign SBS Dealer employs, an intermediary (such as an agent that is a registered
broker-dealer) may already be subject to certain business conduct requirements
with respect to the SBS Dealer’s counterparty in the transaction. However, we
continue to believe that it may be important that registered SBS Dealers
themselves are subject to these final business conduct requirements with respect
to security-based swap transactions that are part of their U.S. business. Because
SBS Dealers and their agents may allocate between themselves specific
responsibilities in connection with these business conduct requirements, to the
extent that these requirements overlap with requirements applicable directly to the
agent (for example, in its capacity as a broker), and the SBS Dealer allocates
responsibility for complying with relevant requirements to its agent, we expect
any increase in costs arising from the proposed rules may be mitigated.

709

States. 1745 Moreover, these alternative frameworks may apply only to the U.S.
intermediary of the foreign SBS Dealer and not to the SBS Dealer itself. These final
rules will avoid these differences in application, along with the potential competitive
disparities they may create, by subjecting all registered SBS Dealers engaged in
transactions captured by the U.S. Activity test to the same business conduct framework,
including, among others, disclosure, suitability, and fair and balanced communication
rules. Applying business conduct rules to all security-based swap trades arranged,
negotiated or executed by personnel located in the U.S. also may reduce disparities
between U.S. and foreign SBS Dealers competing for business with the same foreign
counterparties.
We recognize that foreign SBS Dealers transacting with foreign counterparties
may be subject to foreign regulations in addition to these final rules, giving rise to
potentially duplicative compliance costs, pointed out by commenters. 1746 However, as
discussed in Section III above, the Commission believes that requiring registered foreign
SBS Dealers to comply with the transaction-level business conduct requirements with
respect to these transactions may enhance transparency, strengthen counterparty
protections, and integrity of the U.S. security-based swap market.
Moreover, the Commission is adopting a framework that would potentially permit
foreign SBS Dealers to satisfy their requirements with respect to certain of the business
conduct requirements by complying with comparable requirements of a foreign
1745

For example, Exchange Act section 3(a)(4)(B) excepts banks from the definition
of “broker” with respect to certain activity.

1746

See, e.g., IIB (July 2015), supra note 10; ISDA (July 2015), supra note 10;
SIFMA-AMG (July 2015), supra note 10; SIFMA/FSR (July 2015), supra note
10, commenting on the U.S. Activity Proposing Release.

710

jurisdiction. Therefore, foreign SBS Dealers engaged in U.S. Activity may be able to
comply with these final rules by complying with foreign jurisdictions’ rules and
regulations, to the extent that the Commission makes substituted compliance
determinations and the other prerequisites to substituted compliance have been satisfied.
This may mitigate the potential for conflicting requirements and duplication in
compliance costs. We recognize that there will be limits to the availability of substituted
compliance, including the possibility that substituted compliance may be permitted with
regard to some requirements and not others, or that, in certain circumstances, substituted
compliance may not be permitted with respect to any requirements with regard to a
particular jurisdiction depending on our assessment of the comparability of the relevant
foreign requirements and the availability of supervisory and enforcement arrangements
among the Commission and relevant foreign financial regulatory authorities. However,
the Commission does not believe it would be appropriate to permit foreign security-based
swap dealers to satisfy these final business conduct requirements by complying with
foreign requirements when the prerequisites to substituted compliance have not been
satisfied. 1747
As we noted earlier, these rules limit the scope of application of these final
business conduct requirements by excluding certain transactions of registered foreign and
U.S. SBS Entities from the requirements. However, as we have also noted, relative to the
baseline, final Exchange Act rules 3a71-3(c) and 3a67-10(d), together with the
substantive rules being adopted in this release, should result in an increase in costs and
benefits from the baseline. Specifically, the final approach to cross-border application of
1747

See Section III, supra.

711

the final business conduct rules may increase assessment and programmatic costs of
registered SBS Dealers, but may also increase related counterparty protections, reduce
informational asymmetries and enhance Commission oversight.
With respect to assessment costs, registered SBS Entities likely will establish
systems to identify transactions that are subject to the business conduct requirements.
Foreign SBS Entities will need to establish systems to identify transactions with U.S.
persons (including whether the transaction is conducted through a foreign branch of that
person), and foreign SBS Dealers will need to establish systems to identify transactions
falling within the U.S. Activity Test. Similarly, U.S. SBS Entities will incur additional
assessment costs related to identifying their own transactions conducted through a foreign
branch, including such transactions with U.S.-person counterparties that constitute
transactions conducted through a foreign branch of those U.S.-person counterparties.
Most of the assessment costs with respect to analysis and systems to track transactions
have been evaluated in connection with other Commission rules; therefore, our economic
baseline includes all registered SBS Entities have those systems in place. For instance, in
the Cross-Border Adopting Release, the Commission estimated foreign SBS Entity
assessment costs with respect to systems tracking transactions with U.S. persons for
purposes of counting transactions toward the major security-based swap participant
position thresholds and the security-based swap dealer de minimis thresholds. 1748

1748

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47332-34 (evaluating foreign SBS
Dealer assessment costs with respect to systems tracking transactions with U.S.
persons); id. at 47353-54 (evaluating foreign Major SBS Participant assessment
costs with respect to systems tracking transactions with U.S. persons). In that
release, the foreign branch exception applied only to U.S. banks that were
themselves registered SBS Dealers, and our evaluation of analysis costs borne by

712

Similarly, in the U.S. Activity Adopting Release, the Commission evaluated the
assessment costs to SBS Dealers related to including transactions falling within the U.S.
Activity Test in a non-U.S. person’s dealer de minimis requirements. 1749 Once registered,
these SBS Entities will be able to use these systems in connection with identifying
whether a transaction is subject to the transaction-level business conduct requirements.`
However, in addition to these previously evaluated costs, U.S. SBS Entities
conducting business through a foreign branch will need to classify their counterparties
and transactions to determine whether business conduct transaction-level requirements
apply. We believe that the costs to a U.S. SBS Entity of creating systems to identify
transactions it conducts through a foreign branch with U.S.-person counterparties and to
determine whether any such transactions are conducted through the foreign branch of its
U.S.-person counterparties may be similar to costs associated with the systems that
foreign persons are likely to establish to perform the dealer de minimis or major
participant threshold calculations. In both cases such systems would have to flag a person’s
security-based swaps against the specific criteria embedded in the final rules. Based on the

methodology set out in the Cross-Border Adopting Release for estimating costs of
such persons were based on a system that would evaluate whether a counterparty
was a U.S. person, whether that counterparty was transacting through a foreign
branch, and whether that counterparty was a registered SBS Dealer, among other
things. See, e.g., Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47353. Because the
analysis to determine whether the transaction-level business conduct requirements
apply in a transaction by a foreign SBS Entity with a U.S. person involve only a
determination whether the counterparty is a U.S. person and whether it is
transacting through a foreign branch, we believe that the system whose costs were
estimated in these prior releases should be sufficient for the analysis required by
foreign SBS Entities under these rules.
1749

See U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR 8627 (evaluating assessment costs to
SBS Dealers with respect to systems for tracking transactions arising from U.S.
activity).

713

systems designed to identify similar criteria, 1750 we estimate these assessment costs may
include one-time programming costs of $14,904 and ongoing annual costs of $16,612 per
SBS Entity. 1751 Based on a review of DTCC–TIW data relating to single-name CDS
activity in 2014, we estimate that up to 5 U.S. SBS Dealers conducted dealing activity

1750

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47332, note 681. See also Definitions
Adopting Release, 77 FR 30734–35, note 107.

1751

In the Definitions Adopting Release, we estimated that the one-time programming
costs of $13,692 per entity and annual ongoing assessment costs of $15,268. See
Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR 30734–35, and accompanying text
(providing an explanation of the methodology used to estimate these costs). The
hourly cost figures in the Definitions Adopting Release for the positions of
Compliance Attorney, Compliance Manager, Programmer Analyst, and Senior
Internal Auditor were based on data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional
Earnings in the Securities Industry 2010.
For purposes of the cost estimates in this release, we have updated these figures
with more recent data as follows: the figure for a Compliance Attorney is
$334/hour, the figure for a Compliance Manager is $283/hour, the figure for a
Programmer Analyst is $220/hour, and the figure for a Senior Internal Auditor is
$209/hour, each from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the
Securities Industry 2013, modified by SEC staff to account for an 1800-hour
work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee
benefits, and overhead. We also have updated the Definitions Adopting Release’s
$464/ hour figure for a Chief Financial Officer, which was based on 2011 data,
with a revised figure of $500/ hour, for a Chief Financial Officer with five years
of experience in New York, that is from http://www.payscale.com, modified by
Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35
to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead. See
http://www.payscale.com (last visited Apr. 16, 2014).
Incorporating these new cost figures, the updated one-time programming costs
based upon our assumptions regarding the number of hours required in the
Definitions Adopting Release would be $14,904per entity, i.e., (Compliance
Attorney at $334 per hour for 2 hours) + (Compliance Manager at $283 per hour
for 8 hours) + (Programmer Analyst at $220 per hour for 40 hours) + (Senior
Internal Auditor at $209 per hour for 8 hours) + (Chief Financial Officer at $500
per hour for 3 hours) = $14,904, and the annual ongoing costs would be $16,612
per entity, i.e., ((Senior Internal Auditor at $209 per hour for 16 hours) +
Compliance Attorney at $334 per hour for 4 hours) + (Compliance Manager at
$283 per hour for 4 hours) + (Chief Financial Officer at $500 per hour for 4
hours) + (Programmer Analyst at $220 per hour for 40 hours) = $16,612).

714

through foreign branches, and we conservatively estimate that there may be as many as 5
U.S. Major SBS Participants. Assuming that all ten of these U.S. SBS Entities elected to
establish a system to identify transactions conducted through a foreign branch or
conducted through the foreign branch of their U.S. counterparties, the total assessment
costs associated with our final business conduct rules would be approximately $149,040
in one-time annual programming costs and $166,120 in ongoing annual costs. 1752
As recognized in Section III above, SBS Entities would be permitted to rely on
certain representations provided to them by their U.S. bank counterparties regarding
whether a transaction is conducted through a foreign branch. Initial costs to the U.S.
bank counterparties of developing related representations are estimated at $195,000. 1753
Aggregate ongoing costs to the U.S. bank counterparties of representations are estimated
at approximately $190,000 per year. 1754
This scope of transactions subject to business conduct requirements may also
affect the programmatic costs incurred by participants in security-based swap markets.
For entities already required to register as SBS Entities under current rules, this rule may
increase the set of transactions and counterparties to which they must apply business
conduct requirements, relative to the baseline under which no business conduct
requirements apply. We continue to recognize that requiring compliance of foreign SBS
Dealers transacting with foreign counterparties where transactions were arranged,

1752

One-time annual programming cost: $14,904 x 10 U.S. SBS Entities = $149,040.
Ongoing annual cost: $16,612 x 10 U.S. SBS Entities= $166,120.

1753

Initial cost: Outside counsel $100,000 + ((Attorney at $380 per hour) x 250 hours
= $95,000) = $195,000.

1754

Ongoing cost: (In-house attorney at $380 per hour) x 500 hours = $190,000.

715

negotiated or executed by personnel located in the United States may discourage reliance
by foreign SBS Entities on personnel located in the United States. Some foreign SBS
Dealers transacting with foreign counterparties may choose to relocate their personnel
outside of the United States, or replace personnel located in the United States with
personnel not located in the United States to avoid compliance with these final rules. To
the extent that these final rules may increase the costs of foreign SBS Entities, or
influence competition between U.S. and foreign SBS Dealers, the terms of security-based
swaps intermediated by foreign SBS Dealers may deteriorate and foreign SBS Dealers
may become less willing to intermediate security-based swap transactions. The approach
taken in this rule may mitigate some of the commenter concerns with the initial proposal
by focusing only on the location of the foreign dealer’s or its agent’s market-facing
personnel, and not the location of its counterparties’ activity. 1755 Further, these final rules
allow for the possibility of substituted compliance for foreign SBS Dealers, including in
connection with their security-based swap activity with foreign counterparties.
Therefore, as discussed above, these costs may be incurred primarily by foreign SBS
Entities subject to less stringent business conduct rules in their foreign jurisdictions,
where the ex-ante benefits of these final rules may be greater. 1756
The Commission has received comment that this approach to the application of
business conduct requirements may impose costs of additional disclosures and
representations on asset managers servicing foreign clients. 1757 As we noted in Section
1755

See U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR 8634.

1756

See, e.g., SIFMA-AMG (July 2015) supra note 10 and ISDA (July 2015), supra
note 10, on the U.S. Activity Proposing Release.

1757

See SIFMA-AMG (July 2015), supra note 10, at 4.

716

III, these final rules do not apply directly to asset managers, and asset managers will
incur no liability under these rules. However, we recognize that SBS Entities may have
certain expectations of asset managers in connection with the transactions involving
funds. Depending on how SBS Entities and asset managers choose to allocate these
responsibilities, asset managers may incur some fraction of the costs estimated above.
The commenter also argued that the final rules may result in asset managers separating
block trades for U.S. and non-U.S. persons, for whom business conduct eligibility has not
been verified, and obtaining assurances that the dealer’s personnel arranging, negotiating
or executing block trades for non-U.S. persons is not based in the U.S. We recognize that,
to the extent this affects the ability of asset managers to find counterparties to block
trades with non-U.S. persons or the costs of doing so, liquidity may become fragmented
and execution price of certain block trades may be adversely affected. We note that some
asset managers may be complying with similar requirements, such as those under the
Exchange Act and FINRA rules applicable to U.S. broker-dealers related to transactions
in cash securities that these broker-dealers intermediate on behalf of foreign brokers.
We have considered the alternative of applying business conduct rules to all
security-based swap transactions of all registered SBS Entities. This approach would
increase the scope of transactions subject to these substantive rules, increasing
programmatic costs of compliance by registered SBS Entities – costs that are likely to be
passed on to counterparties. Under the rules being adopted, the U.S. business of foreign
SBS Dealers excludes transactions conducted through a foreign branch. Further, the final
rule provides for an exception from the transaction-level business conduct requirements
when a foreign Major SBS Participant (or a U.S. Major SBS Participant in a transaction

717

conducted through its foreign branch) enters into a transaction with a foreign branch of a
U.S. person.
To the extent that potential losses on security-based swap transactions may flow
from foreign branches of U.S. persons to the U.S. business of U.S. persons, excluding
transactions of foreign SBS Dealers with foreign branches of U.S. persons from the
definition of U.S. business may increase risks to U.S. persons and impact the integrity of
U.S. markets. However, compliance with business conduct requirements with respect to
security-based swap transactions between foreign SBS Entities and foreign branches of
U.S. persons would further increase costs of foreign SBS Entities. Such costs may be
passed along to foreign branches of U.S. persons in the form of higher transaction costs
or reduced access to security-based swap transactions with foreign SBS Entities. 1758 We
lack data regarding the reliance of U.S. persons on foreign branches for their securitybased swap activity with foreign SBS Dealers, current business conduct practices of
foreign SBS Dealers in their relationships with foreign branches of U.S. persons, and the
value of bilateral relationships for this group of market participants. Therefore, we are
unable to quantify these effects. However, the approach being adopted recognizes these
competing risk and access considerations.
The Commission has also considered the alternative of applying these final
business conduct rules to all transactions that a U.S. SBS Entity enters into, including any
transaction conducted through its foreign branch. Importantly, the definition of
“transactions conducted through a foreign branch” requires the transaction to be arranged,

1758

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47343, supra note 684.

718

negotiated or executed in the foreign branch. 1759 The activities of foreign branches of
U.S. SBS Dealers relying on foreign personnel transacting with foreign counterparties
may not pose the same compliance and counterparty risks in U.S. markets as those
addressed by these final business conduct requirements. As a result, this alternative may
produce fewer intended benefits associated with these final rules, but would increase
costs of U.S. SBS Dealers transacting with foreign counterparties.
The Commission has also considered the alternative of excepting all transactions
of a foreign SBS Dealer with non-U.S. persons, including transactions that involve U.S.
activity. We recognize that the alternative would decrease the set of transactions subject
to the final business conduct rules, reducing both assessment and programmatic costs to
foreign SBS Dealers, and expected programmatic benefits of these final rules discussed
above. Data on North American corporate single name CDS market in Figure 3 of the
economic baseline suggest that activity among non-U.S. domiciled accounts represents as
much as 17% (if we use the domicile of a corporate group) to 40% (if we use registered
office location) of global notional volume, and potentially a larger percentage if firms
restructure their business in response to such an exception. We do not currently have
data on which of those trades are arranged, negotiated or executed by U.S. personnel of
foreign SBS Dealers. However, we note that the U.S. Activity Test in these final rules
will subject some foreign SBS Dealer transactions with foreign counterparties to these
business conduct rules. Therefore, this alternative would reduce the scope of activity
subject to the transaction-level requirements of these final rules, and their resulting costs
and benefits, relative to the approach being adopted.
1759

See Exchange Act Rule 3a71-3(a)(3).

719

In addition, this alternative could put U.S. SBS Entities at a competitive
disadvantage due to higher direct and indirect costs related to these final business conduct
rules when dealing with foreign counterparties. This approach may also incentivize U.S.
SBS Dealers to restructure to be considered a non-U.S. person, while continuing to rely
on personnel located in the United States to negotiate, arrange or execute security-based
swap transactions with their foreign counterparties. As recognized above, we understand
security-based swap markets to be global, and we expect registered SBS Dealers transact
across multiple jurisdictions. This alternative may involve potentially significant
frictions to cross-border transaction activity and may lead to fractioned liquidity and
participation in otherwise globally integrated markets. The approach being adopted may
reduce incentives to engage in such restructuring by requiring that foreign SBS Dealers
comply with transactional business conduct requirements even when transacting with
another non-U.S. person where such security-based swap transactions are arranged,
negotiated or executed by personnel located in the United States.
Finally, we have considered an alternative approach that would limit the scope of
application of these final business conduct rules to transactions between registered SBS
Entities and U.S. person counterparties. This alternative would exclude transactions
between U.S. as well as non-U.S. SBS Dealers and their foreign counterparties, which
may significantly decrease the scope of application and potential economic effects of
these final rules.
First, excluding transactions between U.S. SBS Dealers and their foreign
counterparties from the scope of these requirements may reduce direct and indirect
compliance costs of U.S. SBS Dealers, potentially reducing transaction costs or

720

improving liquidity; however, it may reduce potential information benefits of these final
rules. Second, similar to the discussion above, excluding transactions between foreign
SBS Dealers and their foreign counterparties may mitigate incentives for inefficient
relocation by financial groups that use a non-U.S. dealer to carry out their dealing activity
in the United States.
However, to the extent compliance with these business conduct requirements is
costly and these costs are passed along to counterparties in, for instance, more adverse
pricing and lower liquidity of available OTC security-based swaps, this alternative may
give rise to competitive disparities between U.S. and non-U.S. counterparties of
registered SBS Dealers. U.S. counterparties that are members of financial groups may
respond by restructuring their security-based swap activity so that it is carried out by a
non-U.S. person, in which case none of its transactions with SBS Dealers would be
required to comply with transaction level business conduct requirements and incur related
costs. To the extent that counterparties restructure their security-based swap activity in
response to the incentives created by the competitive disparities and market
fragmentation, a significant portion of that activity may occur outside the scope of these
final business conduct requirements. U.S. persons that currently transact with SBS
Dealers may have an incentive to migrate that business to affiliated non-U.S. persons to
stay competitive with their non-U.S. competitors. The fraction of U.S. counterparties
able to perform such restructuring and related costs are unclear. In contrast, the approach
being adopted recognizes the importance of SBS Entity conduct for counterparty
protections, may decrease incentives for such evasion, and enhance Commission
oversight of registered SBS Entities.

721

b.

Substituted Compliance

As discussed in Section III, the final rules contemplate a substituted compliance
regime for substantive business conduct requirements. Substituted compliance may
permit the counterparty protection, information and Commission oversight benefits of
these final business conduct rules to be achieved while avoiding potential duplication of
compliance costs that foreign SBS Entities may otherwise incur. As indicated in the
Cross-Border release, 1760 to the extent that our business conduct rules conflict with
regulations in foreign jurisdictions that also govern the activity of foreign SBS Entities
that are subject to Title VII business conduct requirements, these final rules could act as a
barrier to entry for foreign SBS Entities into the U.S. security-based swap market.
Allowing market participants to comply with these final business conduct rules via
substituted compliance could facilitate participation of non-resident SBS Entities in U.S.
security-based swap markets. If foreign regulatory regimes are comparable to these final
rules requirements, 1761 and to the extent that such foreign regimes have adequate
compliance and enforcement capabilities, allowing substituted compliance for
nonresident SBS Entities may help promote market efficiency and enhance competition
in U.S. markets, potentially benefiting non-dealer counterparties.
At the same time, the process of making substituted compliance requests may
cause nonresident SBS Entities to incur additional costs of applying for a substituted
compliance determination. In Section V the Commission has estimated that three
security-based swap dealers will submit substituted compliance applications, noting that
1760

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47359, supra note 684.

1761

See ISDA (August 2013), supra note 7.

722

the majority of substituted compliance requests may be made by foreign authorities.
Based on our analysis of domiciles of likely SBS Entity registrants and our understanding
of the market, we believe that there may be between four and nine substituted compliance
applications with respect to these final rules. The total cost associated with SBS Entities
preparing and submitting requests for substituted compliance determinations in
connection with the business conduct requirements are estimated at, approximately,
$406,770 1762 for up to three requests. We also estimate that up to six foreign
jurisdictions may make substituted compliance requests in connection with these final
business conduct standards at an estimated cost of up to $524,790. 1763

1762

Initial internal cost of substituted compliance applications for SBS Entity
applicants: (In-house attorney at $380 per hour) x (80 hours) x3 = $91,200.
External: (External counsel at 400$ per hour) x 200x3 = $240,000.
Consistent with the Registration Adopting release, certification and opinion of
counsel is estimated at: a) (In-house attorney at $380 per hour) x 0.5 hours x 3 =
$570. b) External: (External counsel at 400$ per hour) x 62.5x3 = $75,000. See
Registration Adopting Release, 80 FR at 48994
Total cost for SBS Entities: $240,000+$75,000+$91,200+$570=$406,770
As noted in Section V, those amounts may overestimate the costs of requests
pursuant to Rule 3a71-6 as adopted, as such requests would solely address
business conduct requirements, rather than the broader proposed scope of
substituted compliance set forth in that proposal. In addition, some SBS Entities
may receive a positive substituted compliance determination and use the same
certification and opinion of counsel when filing for registration, the costs of
which were assessed in the Registration Adopting Release.

1763

We believe that foreign jurisdictions are less likely to rely on outside counsel in
preparing substituted compliance determinations and adequate assurances
concerning Rule 15Fb2-4(c). In lieu of outside counsel we believe they will rely
on internal government attorneys, estimated using SEC hourly cost for
management and professional staff of $255.
Initial cost of substituted compliance applications for up to 6 foreign jurisdiction:
(Government management and professional staff at $255) x (80 + 200) x 6=
$428,400.

723

We note that substituted compliance requests will be made on a voluntary basis,
and nonresident SBS Entities would only make such requests when the anticipated costs
of relying on substituted compliance are lower than the costs of complying directly with
these final rules. Further, after a substituted compliance determination is made, SBS
Entities would choose substituted compliance only if their expected private benefits from
participating in U.S. security-based swap markets exceed expected private costs,
including any conditions the Commission may attach to the substituted compliance
determination.
We also recognize that these costs and the overall economic effects of allowing
substituted compliance for these final business conduct rules will depend on, among
others, whether (and to what extent) substituted compliance requests will be granted for
jurisdictions in which some of the most active nonresident SBS Entities are currently
residing; the costs of potential relocation, business restructuring, or direct compliance by
nonresident SBS Entities in jurisdictions for which substituted compliance is not granted;
the relevant information required to demonstrate consistency between the foreign
regulatory requirements and the Commission’s business conduct rules; the relevant
information required to demonstrate the adequacy of the foreign regime’s compliance and
enforcement mechanisms; and the fraction of SBS Entities in a given jurisdiction that
may rely on substituted compliance if available.

Initial cost of certifications and assurances concerning Rule 15Fb2-4(c):
(Government management and professional staff at $255) x (0.5+62.5) x 6=
$96,390
Total cost for foreign jurisdictions: $428,400 +$96,390=$524,790

724

We note that substituted compliance determinations will be made on a
jurisdiction-wide basis. As a result, after the first applicant from a given jurisdiction
receives an affirmative substituted compliance determination, all SBS Entities from the
same jurisdiction will be able to comply with these final rules by complying with
requirements of that foreign jurisdiction without bearing the related substituted
compliance application costs. Such an approach eliminates duplication in application
costs for SBS Entities from the same jurisdictions. However, foreign SBS Entities that
are the first to make a substituted compliance application from a given jurisdiction will
also bear greater costs, which disadvantages first movers. SBS Entities that intermediate
greater volume or hold larger positions of security-based swaps in the United States, and
SBS Entities that face greater costs of direct compliance with these final rules compared
to costs of compliance with rules of a foreign jurisdiction may be the first SBS Entities to
make substituted compliance applications and bear application costs.
SBS Entities in foreign jurisdictions with blocking laws, privacy laws, secrecy
laws and other legal barriers inconsistent with the Commission’s authority over registered
entities will be unable to take advantage of substituted compliance. As part of these final
rules, the Commission is adopting a requirement that, in order to make a request for
substituted compliance, each party must provide the certification and opinion of counsel
that the entity can as a matter of law, and will, provide the Commission with prompt
access to the entity’s books and records and submit to onsite inspection and examination
by the Commission. Similarly, foreign financial regulatory authorities may make
substituted compliance requests only if they can provide adequate assurances that no law
or policy of any relevant foreign jurisdiction would impede the ability of any entity that is

725

directly supervised by the authority and that may register as an SBS Entity to provide
prompt access to the Commission to books and records or to submit to onsite inspection
or examination. As a result of these requirements, the scope of SBS Entities and
jurisdictions able to take advantage of substituted compliance may be reduced. However,
as we have stated elsewhere, 1764 the Commission believes that significant elements of an
effective regulatory regime are the Commission’s abilities to access registered SBS
Entities’ books and records and to inspect and examine the operations of registered SBS
Entities.
We note that U.S. SBS Entities will not be able to rely on substituted compliance
with respect to any transactions, including transactions with foreign counterparties.
Alternatively, the Commission could allow substituted compliance for U.S. SBS Entities.
Under the alternative, U.S. SBS Entities would be able to comply with these substantive
transaction-level requirements by complying with business conduct requirements of a
comparable regulatory regime when dealing with counterparties domiciled in foreign
countries. We recognize that U.S. SBS Entities may be competing for foreign
counterparty business with foreign SBS Entities, and substituted compliance may reduce
costs of complying with these final business conduct requirements. Under the alternative,
the ability of U.S. SBS Entities to rely on substituted compliance may increase the
profitability of U.S. SBS Entities transactions with foreign counterparties or may increase
business for U.S. SBS Entities seeking to intermediate security-based swaps with foreign
market participants. However, such an approach may adversely impact counterparty
protection, informational asymmetry and Commission oversight benefits of these
1764

See Registration Adopting Release, 80 FR at 48981

726

substantive requirements enjoyed by all counterparties of U.S. SBS Entities as a result of
potential differences among global regulatory regimes. Since any potential costs of
compliance with these substantive requirements may be passed on to counterparties, such
an alternative may result in differential access and security-based swap terms of U.S. and
foreign counterparties of U.S. SBS Entities.
Under the approach being adopted, foreign SBS Entities will be able to comply
with these final business conduct requirements by complying with comparable foreign
requirements. We have considered an alternative approach, under which the availability
of substituted compliance is predicated on a finding of a direct conflict between Title VII
and foreign regulatory requirements. Under this alternative, foreign SBS Entities that are
currently complying with comparable (though not identical) requirements, would be
required to bring their activities into compliance with these final rules, absent a direct
conflict between Title VII requirements and their foreign regulatory regime. If the scope
of comparable regulatory regimes is broader than the scope of regimes that are in direct
conflict with the requirements of Title VII, this alternative may enable SBS Entities from
fewer jurisdictions to take advantage of substituted compliance. As a result, the
economic benefits of substituted compliance discussed above may be reduced.
Fewer foreign SBS Entities being eligible for substituted compliance may also
reduce direct application costs to the industry. However, the burden of establishing a
direct conflict may be greater than the burden related to establishing comparability,
which may increase direct substituted compliance costs per application.
Crucially, if fewer SBS Entities are able to take advantage of substituted
compliance under this alternative, a greater number of foreign SBS Entities would be

727

required to incur costs of restructuring their systems and processes to comply with these
final rules. Alternatively, foreign SBS Entities may choose relocate to another
jurisdiction, or decrease their participation in U.S. security-based swap markets below
thresholds triggering SBS Entity registration requirements and compliance with these
final rules. To the extent that these costs may be passed on to counterparties of foreign
SBS Entities or affect liquidity provision by foreign SBS Entities, transaction costs may
increase and liquidity may be reduced. Further these costs may create a barrier to entry
for foreign SBS Entities into U.S. security-based swap markets, and facilitate market
segmentation.
Under this alternative, counterparties of foreign SBS Entities unable to rely on
substituted compliance may benefit to a greater extent from the transparency and
counterparty protections of these final rules. Further, U.S. SBS Entities and foreign SBS
Entities from jurisdictions that are able to rely on substituted compliance may step in to
intermediate trades with counterparties impacted by foreign SBS Entities unable to rely
on substituted compliance. The Commission’s future substituted compliance
determinations with respect to individual foreign regimes will affect the scope of affected
foreign SBS Entities. Therefore, we are unable to estimate and compare the number,
market share and scope of counterparties of foreign SBS Entities that may be able to rely
on substituted compliance under the approach being adopted, and under the alternative.
However, we note that, using DTCC-TIW data as of year-end 2014, all foreign SBS
Dealers likely to trigger registration requirements were responsible for 35% of the
notional volume of all likely SBS Entities. In addition, as we have noted earlier in the

728

economic analysis, in 2014 non-dealer counterparties transacted with a median of three
and an average of four SBS Dealers.
We have also considered an alternative approach under which foreign SBS
Entities would be able to rely on substituted compliance only in their transactions with
non-U.S. counterparties. This alternative would effectively limit the scope of substituted
compliance to non-U.S. SBS Entities that are transacting with non-U.S. counterparties,
but are subject to these final rules as a result of their reliance on U.S. personnel discussed
above. Such an approach could ensure that U.S. counterparties of all SBS Entities benefit
from the same transparency and counterparty protection benefits of these final rules,
regardless of the degree of comparability of foreign regimes. However, some foreign
SBS Entities already complying with comparable regimes would incur additional costs of
restructuring to comply with these final rules without being able to rely on substituted
compliance in their transactions with U.S. counterparties. If such costs are significant,
non-U.S. SBS Entities may become less willing to intermediate transactions with U.S.
counterparties and transaction costs borne by U.S. counterparties may increase. While
other U.S. SBS Entities are likely to step in and provide the necessary liquidity, this
approach may adversely impact competition and facilitate market segmentation.
D.

Effects on Efficiency, Competition and Capital Formation

In adopting these final rules, we are required to consider their effects on
efficiency, competition and capital formation. As we discuss below, these final rules may
enhance transparency, and improve informational and allocative efficiency in securitybased swap markets. Greater transparency and allocative efficiency may incentivize
quality based competition among market participants in general, and SBS Dealers in

729

particular. In the discussion below, we address the potential effects of final disclosure,
suitability and special entity rules on informational and allocative efficiency, and their
effects on capital formation in security-based swap and reference security markets. We
also consider how harmonization with the CFTC external business conduct rules
facilitates ongoing market integration between swap and security-based swap markets,
and lowers informational inefficiencies. Finally, we discuss the competitive burdens of
compliance costs, their effects on the willingness of SBS Dealers to intermediate
transactions with certain groups of counterparties, as well as competitive effects of the
cross-border approach being adopted.
The business conduct standards for SBS Entities, including requirements to
disclose material risks, characteristics, incentives and conflicts of interest related to
security-based swaps, as well as the fair and balanced communications rule, may reduce
information asymmetries between SBS Entities and their less sophisticated
counterparties. To the extent that adverse selection costs described in Section VI.C.2 are
present in security-based swap markets, market participants may become more informed
and may increase their activity in security-based swaps, which may improve market
quality. To the extent that security-based swap market participants consider disclosures
under these final rules informative in selecting security-based swaps and SBS Entity
counterparties, these final rules may help market participants make more informed
counterparty choices. The increased disclosure of information regarding material risks
and characteristics, incentives and conflicts of interest may lead to improved
informational efficiency and quality-based competition among SBS Entities to the extent

730

that market participants rely on this information in selecting security-based swaps and
counterparties.
However, as more informed counterparties, SBS Entities are able to extract
information rents from non-dealer counterparties. To the extent that the business conduct
rules help inform counterparties, these rules may reduce the informational advantage of
SBS Entities, and may decrease profitability of their transactions with non-dealer
counterparties. As a result of disclosures of material risks, daily mark, conflicts of
interest and other information regarding security-based swaps, some private information
of SBS Dealers about the quality of security-based swaps and underlying reference
securities may become public. As a result, security-based swap prices and dealer profit
margins may decrease. These rules may reduce the incentives of SBS Dealers to gather
private information that is impounded into prices, and SBS Dealer willingness to
intermediate security-based swap transactions with non-dealer counterparties.
Enhanced disclosures and counterparty protections of these Business Conduct
Standards may improve access to information, and may attract non-dealer market
participants into security-based swap markets. These rules may, therefore, protect end
users and other non-dealers that are effecting security-based swaps to manage risk or
trade on negative information, which may improve their ability to make appropriate and
informed portfolio decisions. However, if these rules result in less informed market
participants playing an increasingly larger role in security-based swap markets,
informational efficiency in security-based swap markets may decrease. This
consideration is attenuated by the fact that uninformed participants bring valuable
liquidity enabling informed traders, such as SBS Dealers, to execute informed trades with

731

less price impact. The overall effects of these final rules on price discovery and
informational efficiency in security-based swap markets are, therefore, difficult to assess.
The final suitability and special entity rules would require SBS Dealers to
evaluate the suitability of trades for non-dealer counterparties and special entities when
making recommendations to such counterparties, unless the SBS Dealer can rely on the
institutional suitability alternative to fulfill its customer-specific suitability obligations.
SBS Dealers may have superior information about security-based swaps, but may face an
informational asymmetry when analyzing the hedging needs, risk tolerance and horizons
of their counterparties. This requirement may preclude SBS Dealers from recommending
some security-based swaps that may be truly suitable for a given counterparty, while
recommending other security-based swaps that may be less suitable. The presence and
magnitude of this economic effect depends on the tradeoff between the severity of
information asymmetry concerning the nature of the swap and asymmetry concerning the
counterparty, and potential losses and risks of investing in unsuitable security-based
swaps relative to foregone profits from not investing in suitable security-based swaps.
Suitability requirements and resulting costs could further increase the costs to
SBS Dealers of recommending security-based swaps to non-dealer counterparties,
particularly counterparties with which the SBS Dealer has had no prior transactions, and
counterparties that do not meet institutional suitability requirements. We also recognize
that these rules may limit the ability of SBS Dealers to recommend some security-based
swaps to certain counterparties, which may decrease the potential range of counterparties
and products that some SBS Dealers may intermediate. If these effects result in SBS
Dealers refraining from advising or transacting with some counterparties, and these

732

counterparties are otherwise unable to receive advice or enter into security-based swaps,
the suitability requirement may come at a net cost to these counterparties and would place
them at a disadvantage relative to larger, more sophisticated competitors. To the extent
that these counterparties do not participate in the security-based swap market as a result
of these costs, adverse effects on market participation and liquidity may follow.
However, as we noted previously, market data available to us reveal that relatively few
counterparties enter into security-based swap agreements with an SBS Dealer without
third-party representation, particularly among special entities. As a result of this thirdparty representation and the SBS Dealer’s ability to fulfill its customer-specific suitability
obligations by, among other things, making the determination that a counterparty’s agent
is capable of independently evaluating investment risk, as well as the exception of
anonymous SEF executed security-based swaps, we do not believe that market access is
likely to be restricted.
The final pay to play rules may reduce pay to play practices among SBS Dealers.
To the extent that political contributions may currently be influencing counterparty and
security-based swap selection, these rules may mitigate these influences and enhance
allocative efficiency of municipal entities and facilitate greater quality-based competition
of SBS Dealers. However, if some SBS Dealers become subject to a two-year time out
due to inadvertent violations of the de minimis thresholds by themselves or their covered
associates, and are unable to secure exemptive relief, fewer SBS Dealers may be able to
transact with municipal entities in security-based swaps, which may increase the pricing
power and decrease quality of execution of swaps offered to municipal entities by the
remaining SBS Dealers. We note that SBS Dealers will have to keep updated records of

733

political contributions of their covered associates, ensure their accuracy, promptly
discover triggering contributions and seek their return. The costs of implementing such
policies and procedures related to political contributions of covered associates will be
greater for larger SBS Dealers with multiple layers of supervision and a higher number of
covered associates with shorter tenures. While other business conduct rules tend to
impose fixed burdens, which represent a higher fraction of net income for smaller SBS
Dealers, this particular requirement may be significantly more costly for larger SBS
Dealers.
Further, under these final rules, representatives of special entities transacting with
SBS Entities are likely to be employees or independent representatives subject to
Commission, CFTC or SRO pay to play rules. To the extent that some special entity
representatives currently intermediating transactions with SBS Entities are not registered
investment advisers, municipal advisors, other fiduciaries or employees, they may be
unable to represent special entities in security-based swap transactions with SBS Entities
unless they register as such. This may decrease competition among qualified investment
representatives of special entities, or incentivize unregistered representatives to register,
for instance, as investment advisers with the Commission or as municipal advisors with
the MSRB.
The direct and indirect costs of compliance with these final business conduct rules
may be recovered by SBS Entities in the form of higher transaction costs or more adverse
non-price terms of security-based swaps offered to counterparties. To the extent that
these costs cannot be recovered, incentives for some entities to operate as registered U.S.

734

SBS Entities may be reduced, 1765 which may adversely affect competition in securitybased swap markets. In addition, some counterparties may lose access to the market for
OTC swaps. However, we note that, as discussed above, anonymous SEF transactions
are exempt from some of the substantive requirements of these final rules, which may
allow such counterparties to retain access to security-based swaps. Further, to the extent
that these rules impose costs and restrictions on non-SEF trades that are not born by SBS
Entities related to SEF trades, the volume of transactions executed on SEFs may increase.
We recognize that, as a result, these final rules may increase the programmatic costs and
benefits of pending SEF and clearing rules, with their follow on effects on efficiency,
competition and capital formation, which will be evaluated in pending SEF and clearing
rules. We recognize similarities between CFTC external business conduct standards for
Swap Entities, FINRA rules for broker dealers and the rules being adopted. Due to
extensive cross-market participation, many of the entities expected to register as SBS
Entities will have already registered with the CFTC as Swap Entities or with the
Commission as broker dealers, yet others may already be subject to similar MSRB rules.
To the extent that these final rules involve initial compliance costs, dually registered SBS
entities may experience significantly lower initial compliance costs. At the same time,
new entrants and SBS Entities that are not dually registered may face higher costs.
Competitive effects of these final business conduct rules primarily stem from differences
in burdens incurred by dual registrants on the one hand, and non-dually registered SBS
Entities and new entrants on the other.

1765

See U.S. Activity Adopting Release, 81 FR at 8629.

735

In addition to the competitive effects of compliance burdens above, the crossborder approach adopted in these final rules may impact competition between U.S. and
non-U.S. SBS Entities and their U.S. and non-U.S. personnel. A substituted compliance
regime for business conduct requirements and their application to non-U.S. persons’
dealing transactions that are arranged, negotiated, or executed using personnel located in
the United States may mitigate competitive frictions between U.S. and non-U.S. SBS
Dealers that transact with foreign counterparties, and may promote market efficiency.
The final cross-border approach to business conduct requirements will result in a uniform
application of these requirements to U.S. and non-U.S. SBS Dealers and their agents. If
only U.S. SBS Dealers and their agents were subject to disclosure, suitability and other
requirements in these final rules when transacting with foreign counterparties, the costs
of such disclosures would primarily be incurred by U.S. SBS Dealers, their agents, and
their counterparties. In contrast, non-U.S. SBS Dealers and their agents, including
personnel located in the United States, would potentially have a competitive advantage
over U.S. SBS Dealers in serving non-U.S. person counterparties using personnel located
in a U.S. branch or office, were their activities not subject to the same requirements. 1766
Therefore, the cross-border application of these final business conduct rules may enhance
competition among these SBS Dealers.
Access to SEC-regulated security-based swap markets increases hedging
opportunities for financial market intermediaries; such hedging opportunities reduce risks
and allow intermediaries to facilitate a greater volume of financing activities, including
1766

Distortions in a Competitive Financial Services Industry,” Journal of Financial
Services Research, Vol. 17, No. 1 (2000).

736

issuance of equity and debt securities, and therefore contribute to capital formation. As
we have stated in other releases, 1767 this may be particularly true in underlying securities
markets, where potential pricing and liquidity effects in security-based swap markets may
feedback and impact the market for reference entity securities. Security-based swap
markets may enable better risk mitigation by investors in underlying reference securities,
such as CDS hedging of the credit risk of corporate bond investments. The possible
contraction in security-based swap market participation by SBS Entities due to costs of
compliance with these final rules may adversely impact underlying reference security
markets, including pricing and liquidity in corporate bond and equity markets. This may
have a negative effect on the ability of firms to raise debt and equity capital to finance
real investment. However, the spillover from potential deterioration in security-based
swap markets into underlying reference security markets may also be positive.
Sophisticated institutional investors transact across CDS and bond markets to trade on
information pertaining to the credit risk of underlying reference debt. A potential
negative shock to security-based swap market liquidity and dealing by SBS Entities with
non-SBS Entity counterparties as a result of required compliance with these final rules
may, in fact, drive sophisticated institutions to search for liquidity pools and lower price
impact of informed trades to reference security markets. If institutions begin to trade
more actively in underlying reference security markets, such as corporate bond markets
as a result, there may be positive effects on liquidity and informational efficiency of

1767

See Registration Adopting Release, 80 FR 49008, supra note 989.

737

corporate bond and equity markets. 1768 This may enable firms to raise more debt and
equity at potentially lower costs to finance real investment.
VII.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) 1769 requires Federal agencies, in

promulgating rules, to consider the impact of those rules on small entities. The
Commission certified in the Proposing Release, pursuant to Section 605(b) of the
RFA, 1770 that proposed Rules 15Fh-1 through 15Fh-6 and Rule 15Fk-1 would not, if
adopted, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of “small
entities.” 1771 The Commission received no comments on this certification.
For purposes of Commission rulemaking in connection with the RFA, a small
entity includes: (i) when used with reference to an “issuer” or a “person,” other than an
investment company, an “issuer” or “person” that, on the last day of its most recent fiscal
year, had total assets of $5 million or less; 1772 or (ii) a broker-dealer with total capital (net
worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the prior fiscal
year as of which its audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to Rule 17a-5(d)

1768

See Section VI.B.5.

1770

5 U.S.C. 605(b).

1771

Although Section 601(b) of the RFA defines the term “small entity,” the statute
permits agencies to formulate their own definitions. The Commission has
adopted definitions for the term small entity for the purposes of Commission
rulemaking in accordance with the RFA. Those definitions, as relevant to this
proposed rulemaking, are set forth in Rule 0-10, 17 CFR 240.0-10. See Statement
of Management on Internal Control, Exchange Act Release No. 18451 (Jan. 28,
1982), 47 FR 5215 (Feb. 4, 1982).

See 17 CFR 240.0-10(a).

under the Exchange Act, 1773 or, if not required to file such statements, a broker-dealer
with total capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last
day of the preceding fiscal year (or in the time that it has been in business, if shorter); and
is not affiliated with any person (other than a natural person) that is not a small business
or small organization. 1774 With respect to investment companies in connection with the
RFA, the term “small business” or “small organization” means an investment company
that, together with other investment companies in the same group of related investment
companies, has net assets of $50 million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal
year. Under the standards adopted by the Small Business Administration, small entities

With respect to SBS Entities, based on feedback from market participants and our
information about the security-based swap markets, the Commission continues to believe
that (1) the types of entities that would engage in more than a de minimis amount of
dealing activity involving security-based swaps—which generally would be large
financial institutions—would not be “small entities” for purposes of the RFA; and (2) the
types of entities that may have security-based swap positions above the level required to
be “major security-based swap participants” would not be “small entities” for purposes of
the RFA. 1781

carriers, direct property and casualty insurance carriers, direct title insurance
carriers, other direct insurance (except life, health and medical) carriers,

(a) Determinations—(1) In general. Subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the
Commission may, conditionally or unconditionally, by order, make a determination with
respect to a foreign financial regulatory system that compliance with specified
requirements under such foreign financial regulatory system by a registered securitybased swap dealer and/or by a registered major security-based swap participant (each a
“security-based swap entity”), or class thereof, may satisfy the corresponding
requirements identified in paragraph (d) of this section that would otherwise apply to
such security-based swap entity (or class thereof).
(2) Standard. The Commission shall not make a substituted compliance
determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section unless the Commission:

745

(i) Determines that the requirements of such foreign financial regulatory system
applicable to such security-based swap entity (or class thereof) or to the activities of such
security-based swap entity (or class thereof) are comparable to otherwise applicable
requirements, after taking into account such factors as the Commission determines are
appropriate, such as the scope and objectives of the relevant foreign regulatory
requirements (taking into account the applicable criteria set forth in paragraph (d) of this
section), as well as the effectiveness of the supervisory compliance program
administered, and the enforcement authority exercised, by a foreign financial regulatory
authority or authorities in such system to support its oversight of such security-based
swap entity (or class thereof) or of the activities of such security-based swap entity (or
class thereof); and
(ii) Has entered into a supervisory and enforcement memorandum of
understanding and/or other arrangement with the relevant foreign financial regulatory
authority or authorities under such foreign financial regulatory system addressing
supervisory and enforcement cooperation and other matters arising under the substituted
compliance determination.
(3) Withdrawal or modification. The Commission may, on its own initiative, by
order, modify or withdraw a substituted compliance determination under paragraph (a)(1)
of this section, after appropriate notice and opportunity for comment.
(b) Reliance by security-based swap entities. A registered security-based swap
entity may satisfy the requirements described in paragraph (d) of this section by
complying with corresponding law, rules and regulations under a foreign financial
regulatory system, provided:

746

(1) The Commission has made a substituted compliance determination pursuant to
paragraph (a)(1) of this section regarding such foreign financial regulatory system
providing that compliance with specified requirements under such foreign financial
regulatory system by such registered security-based swap entity (or class thereof) may
satisfy the corresponding requirements described in paragraph (d) of this section; and
(2) Such registered security-based swap entity satisfies any conditions set forth in
a substituted compliance determination made by the Commission pursuant to paragraph
(a)(1) of this section.
(c) Requests for determinations. (1) A party or group of parties that potentially
would comply with specified requirements pursuant to paragraph (a)(1), or any foreign
financial regulatory authority or authorities supervising such a party or its security-based
swap activities, may file an application, pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 240.0–
13, requesting that the Commission make a substituted compliance determination
pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, with respect to one or more requirements
described in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) Such a party or group of parties may make a request under paragraph (c)(1) of
this section only if:
(i) Each such party, or the party’s activities, is directly supervised by the foreign
financial regulatory authority or authorities with respect to the foreign regulatory
requirements relating to the applicable requirements described in paragraph (d) of this
section; and

747

(ii) Each such party provides the certification and opinion of counsel as described
in § 240.15Fb2-4(c), as if the party were subject to that requirement at the time of the
request.
(3) Such foreign financial authority or authorities may make a request under
paragraph (c)(1) of this section only if each such authority provides adequate assurances
that no law or policy of any relevant foreign jurisdiction would impede the ability of any
entity that is directly supervised by the foreign financial regulatory authority and that
may register with the Commission as a security-based swap dealer or major securitybased swap participant to provide prompt access to the Commission to such entity’s
books and records or to submit to onsite inspection or examination by the Commission.
(d) Eligible requirements. The Commission may make a substituted compliance
determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to permit security-based swap
entities that are not U.S. persons (as defined in § 240.3a71-3(a)(4)), but not securitybased swap entities that are U.S. persons, to satisfy the following requirements by
complying with comparable foreign requirements:
(1) Business conduct and supervision. The business conduct and supervision
requirements of sections 15F(h) and (j) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h) and (j)) and §§
240.15Fh-3 through 15Fh-6, other than the antifraud provisions of section 15F(h)(4)(A)
of the Act and § 240.15Fh-4(a), and other than the provisions of sections 15F(j)(3) and
15F(j)(4)(B) of the Act; provided, however, that prior to making such a substituted
compliance determination the Commission intends to consider whether the information
that is required to be provided to counterparties pursuant to the requirements of the
foreign financial regulatory system, the counterparty protections under the requirements

748

of the foreign financial regulatory system, the mandates for supervisory systems under
the requirements of the foreign financial regulatory system, and the duties imposed by the
foreign financial regulatory system, are comparable to those associated with the
applicable provisions arising under the Act and its rules and regulations.
(2) Chief compliance officer. The chief compliance officer requirements of
section 15F(k) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-10(k)) and § 240.15Fk-1; provided, however,
that prior to making such a substituted compliance determination the Commission intends
to consider whether the requirements of the foreign financial regulatory system regarding
chief compliance officer obligations are comparable to those required pursuant to the
applicable provisions arising under the Act and its rules and regulations.
5. Add §§240.15Fh-1 through 240.15Fh-6, and §240.15Fk-1 to read as follows:
§240.15Fh-1 Scope and reliance on representations.
(a) Scope. Sections 240.15Fh-1 through 240.15Fh-6, and 240.15Fk-1 are not intended to
limit, or restrict, the applicability of other provisions of the federal securities laws,
including but not limited to section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and sections 9
and 10(b) of the Act, and rules and regulations thereunder, or other applicable laws
and rules and regulations. Sections 240.15Fh-1 through 240.15Fh-6, and 240.15Fk-1
apply, as relevant, in connection with entering into security-based swaps and continue
to apply, as appropriate, over the term of executed security-based swaps. Sections
240.15Fh-3(a) through 240.15Fh-3(f), 240.15Fh-4(b) and 240.15Fh-5 are not
applicable to security-based swaps that security-based swap dealers or major securitybased swap participants enter into with their majority-owned affiliates. For these
purposes the counterparties to a security-based swap are majority-owned affiliates if

749

one counterparty directly or indirectly owns a majority interest in the other, or if a
third party directly or indirectly owns a majority interest in both counterparties to the
security-based swap, where ‘‘majority interest’’ is the right to vote or direct the vote
of a majority of a class of voting securities of an entity, the power to sell or direct the
sale of a majority of a class of voting securities of an entity, or the right to receive
upon dissolution or the contribution of a majority of the capital of a partnership.
(b) Reliance on representations. A security-based swap dealer or major security-based
swap participant may rely on written representations from the counterparty or its
representative to satisfy its due diligence requirements under §240.15Fh, unless it has
information that would cause a reasonable person to question the accuracy of the
representation.

Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1002);
(4) Any employee benefit plan defined in section 3 of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1002) and not otherwise defined as a
special entity, unless such employee benefit plan elects not to be a special entity
by notifying a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap
participant of its election prior to entering into a security-based swap with the
particular security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant;
(5) Any governmental plan, as defined in section 3(32) of the Employee Retirement

counterparty.

(3) Record. The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant
shall make a written record of the non-written disclosures made pursuant to this
paragraph (b), and provide a written version of these disclosures to its

754

counterparties in a timely manner, but in any case no later than the delivery of the
trade acknowledgement of the particular transaction pursuant to §240.15Fi-1.

participant shall:

756

(i) Determine whether the security-based swap is accepted for clearing by one or
more clearing agencies;
(ii) Disclose to the counterparty the names of the clearing agencies that accept

(iii)Notify the counterparty that it may elect to require clearing of the securitybased swap and shall have the sole right to select the clearing agency at which

to clear the security-based swap.
(3) Record. The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant
shall make a written record of the non-written disclosures made pursuant to this

trade acknowledgement of the particular transaction pursuant to §240.15Fi-1.
(e) Know your counterparty. Each security-based swap dealer shall establish, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to obtain and retain
a record of the essential facts concerning each counterparty whose identity is known

counterparty. For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, the essential facts
concerning a counterparty are:

must:
(i) Undertake reasonable diligence to understand the potential risks and rewards
associated with the recommended security-based swap or trading strategy
involving a security-based swap; and
(ii) Have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommended security-based swap
or trading strategy involving a security-based swap is suitable for the
counterparty. To establish a reasonable basis for a recommendation, a
security-based swap dealer must have or obtain relevant information regarding
the counterparty, including the counterparty’s investment profile, trading
objectives, and its ability to absorb potential losses associated with the
recommended security-based swap or trading strategy involving a securitybased swap.

758

(2) A security-based swap dealer may also fulfill its obligations under paragraph
(f)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to an institutional counterparty, if:
(i) The security-based swap dealer reasonably determines that the counterparty,
or an agent to which the counterparty has delegated decision-making
authority, is capable of independently evaluating investment risks with regard
to the relevant security-based swap or trading strategy involving a securitybased swap;
(ii) The counterparty or its agent affirmatively represents in writing that it is
exercising independent judgment in evaluating the recommendations of the
security-based swap dealer with regard to the relevant security-based swap or
trading strategy involving a security-based swap; and
(iii)The security-based swap dealer discloses that it is acting in its capacity as a
counterparty, and is not undertaking to assess the suitability of the securitybased swap or trading strategy for the counterparty.
(3) A security-based swap dealer will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations
under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section if it receives written representations, as
provided in §240.15Fh-1(b), that:
(i) In the case of a counterparty that is not a special entity, the
counterparty has complied in good faith with written policies and
procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the persons
responsible for evaluating the recommendation and making trading
decisions on behalf of the counterparty are capable of doing so; or

759

(ii) In the case of a counterparty that is a special entity, satisfy the terms of
the safe harbor in §240.15Fh-5(b).
(4) For purposes of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, an institutional counterparty is a
counterparty that is an eligible contract participant as defined in clauses (A)(i),
(ii), (iii), (iv), (viii), (ix) or (x), or clause (B)(ii) (other than a person described in
clause (A)(v)) of section 1a(18) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C.
1(a)(18)) and the rules and regulations thereunder, or any person (whether a
natural person, corporation, partnership, trust or otherwise) with total assets of at
least $50 million.
(g) Fair and balanced communications. A security-based swap dealer or major securitybased swap participant shall communicate with counterparties in a fair and balanced
manner based on principles of fair dealing and good faith. In particular:
(1) Communications must provide a sound basis for evaluating the facts with regard
to any particular security-based swap or trading strategy involving a securitybased swap;
(2) Communications may not imply that past performance will recur or make any
exaggerated or unwarranted claim, opinion or forecast; and
(3) Any statement referring to the potential opportunities or advantages presented by
a security-based swap shall be balanced by an equally detailed statement of the
corresponding risks.
(h) Supervision—(1) In general. A security-based swap dealer or major security-based
swap participant shall establish and maintain a system to supervise, and shall

applicable federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder relating to
its business as a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant,
respectively.
(2) Minimum requirements. The system required by paragraph (h)(1) of this section
shall, at a minimum, provide for:

registration as a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap
participant is required;

determines, with respect to any of its supervisory personnel, that
compliance with this requirement is not possible because of the firm’s size
or a supervisory person’s position within the firm, the security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant must document the factors
used to reach such determination and how the supervisory arrangement
with respect to such supervisory personnel otherwise complies with
paragraph (h)(1) of this section, and include a summary of such
determination in the annual compliance report prepared by the securitybased swap dealer’s or major security-based swap participant’s chief
compliance officer pursuant to §240.15Fk-1(c);

participant or an associated person of a security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant shall not be deemed to have failed to diligently
supervise any other person, if such other person is not subject to his or her
supervision, or if:
(i) The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant has
established and maintained written policies and procedures as required in
§240.15Fh-3(h)(2)(iii), and a documented system for applying those policies
