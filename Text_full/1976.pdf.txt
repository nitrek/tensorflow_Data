MARKET REGULATION
Introduction
Shortly before the 1976 fiscal year began,
Congress enacted the most far-reaching
amendments to the Federal secunnes laws
Since 1940, the Securities Acts Amendments
of 1975. 1 These amendments substantially
revise the regulation of securities exchanges
and securities assocranons, and create a
regulatory scheme for rnurucipal securities
professionals, transfer agents, clearing agencies and securities information processors In
addition, the Commission IS directed to facilitate the establishment of a national market
system for securities and a national system
for the prompt and accurate clearance and
settlement of securities transactions. The
new provrsrons substantially strengthen the
Commission's regulatory and oversight responatnhnes With respect to those markets
and constitute a major tumlng POintIn securities regulation.
At the same time, the securities Industry,
with the assistance and oversight of the Commission, made SIgnificant strides toward the
realization of a national market system Such
essential components of a central market as
consolidated and nationwide limit order protecnon mechanisms, quotation systems, and
transaction reporting systems steadily continue to evolve. The National AdVISOryBoard,
appointed by the Commission pursuant to the
1975 Amendments, provided substantial
guidance on key policy questions relating to
the establishment of a national market system.
During the fiscal year, the Commission

adopted and Implemented uniform nnanoat
responsibility requirements, applicable for the
first time to substantially all brokers and dealers. And a uniform financial and operational
reporting form was adopted for all registered
brokers and dealers, ending duplicative reporting schemes and dramatically reduonq
the compliance burdens confronting securities professionals especially smaller brokers
and dealers.
DUringthe last fiscal year, the Commission
began to discharge the broad powers conferred upon It by the 1975 Amendments. By
working toward reducing restrictions on the
ability of exchange members to trade listed
secunnes In the marketplace of their choice,
the Commission took a long step toward
strengthening competition In the sscunnes
markets and removing artifiCial hindrances to
the flow of transaction volume. The Commission's inquiry Into exchange membership and
access rules began the process of opening
the securmes markets to greater participation
by financial mtermedianes In other sectors of
the national and International economy. The
Commission also began dUring the last fiscal
year the registration and regulation of securities Information processors
In addition, the Oomrnissron, In conjunction
With the newly formed MUniCipal Securities
Rulemaklng Board, commenced development
of an integrated pattern of regulation for municipal securities protessronals. And the Commission continued working With the options
markets in developing an appropnate scheme
of regulation for this speeahzed marketplace.
In response to the directive of the 1975
Amendments, the Commission undertook to
3

register and to regulate transfer agents and
clearing agencies The Commission inaugurated ItS program for development
of the
legislatively
contemplated
system for the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions. which program came to Include initial
consideration of the proposed merger of two
major clearing entities
It may be fairly stated that the Commission
and the securities Industry together have
passed through a year of critical Importance
to the growth and the continued vitality of the
Nation's secuntres markets The events of the
past year have done much to promote truly
competitive and efficrent capital markets, capable of serving the Nation's demand for new
Investment capital while operating In the public Interest and for the protection of Investors

Development of the National
Market System
Advisory Committee on the lmpternentetion
of a Central Market System -As previously
reported," the Advisory Committee on the
Implementation of a Central Market System
Issued a Summary Report of Its final recommendations on July 15, 1975 3 The Committee completed Its work on September 12,
1975, with the delivery to the Commission of
a Supplementary Report" outlining the dellberanons leading to the Committee's
more
significant
recommendations,
noting unresolved Issues and setting forth those views
which differed significantly from the recommendations of the rnajonty
National Market AdVisory Board -The
1975 Amendments directed the Commission
to establish a National Market Advisory Board
(the "Board") comprised of fifteen members
(a majority of whom must be associated with
brokers or dealers) sitting for terms of from
two to five years 5 The Board's irutral membership was announced by the Commission
In August 1975,6 and the Board has conducted monthly pubuc meetings since September 1975 The Board IS supposed to give
the Commission ItS views on significant regulatory proposals made by the Commission or
any self-regulatory
organization concerning
the establishment, operation and regulation
of the secunnes markets The Board IS also
to recommend to the Commission the steps It
finds appropriate to facilitate the establishment of a nanonal market system and study

4

the possible need for mOdifying the Act's
scheme of self-regulation so as to adapt It to
a national market system, including the need
for the establishment of a new self-regulatory
organization (a "National Market Regulatory
Board") to administer the national market
system The Board was directed to report the
results of Its study to Congress by December
31, 1976, with whatever recommendations
the Board deems appropriate
As discussed
below, the Commission
adopted a rule under the Exchange Act (Rule
19c-1) 7 governing off-board trading by members of national securities exchanges At that
time, the Commission requested the Board to
study three specific problems
(I) In-house
agency cross transacnons (the Cornrnissron
requested the Board to advise the Commission of ItS views on thrs Issue no later than
October 1, 1976), (II) off-board pnnopal tradIng restrictions, and (III) the development of a
composite limit order book. The Board was
engaged In these studies as the fiscal year
ended

Off-Board Trading Rules
Seeton 11A(c)(4)(A) of the Exchange ActS
directs the Commission to review "any and
all" rules of national securities exchanges
which limit or condition the ability of their
members to buy or sell secunnes any place
but on such exchanges. Ttus section also
directs the Commission to report to Congress
the results of ItS review, and to commence a
proceeding under Section 19(c) of the Act to
amend any such rule Imposing a burden on
cornpennon which did not appear to the Comrrussron to be necessary or appropriate
In
furtherance of the purposes of the Act
On September 2, 1975, the Comrrussron
reported to Congress the results of ItS review,
Including a descnptlon of the effects on competition of eXisting off-board trading restrictions 9 The Commission's report found that
certain exchange off-board trading rules did
Impose burdens on cornpetmon which the
Comrrussron was not then prepared to con.
clude were necessary or appropriate In furtherance of the purposes of the Securities
Exchange Act On the same date, the Com.
rrussron Issued a release publishing ItS report
to Congress and announcing the commencement of a proceeding, pursuant to Section
19(c) of the Act, to determine.

a. the extent to which such rules engendered significant antrcornpetmve effects;
b. whether, If such rules were anncornpetmve, there were countervailing
considerations which appropriately
outweighed the need to abrogate or
amend such rules at that time; and
c. whether such rules could be appropriately modified so as to further the
purposes of the Securities Exchange
Act 10
After eight days of hearings, dunnq which
testimony from 63 individuals representing 19
institutions and organizations was received,
the Commission adopted Exchange Act Rule
19c-1, on December 19, 1975 (effective
March 31, 1976), which reflected ItS determination that certain aspects of the then existIng off-board trading rules Imposed burdens
on competition which could not be Justified In
terms of the regulatory objectives of the Exchange Act 11
Rule 19c-1 (a) provides that on and after
March 31, 1976, the rules of each national
securities exchange may not limit or condition
the ability of any member to effect agency
transactions on any other exchange or In the
over-the-counter market In any equity secunty listed or traded on that exchange. When It
adopted the rule, the Commission also announced ItS Intention
a. to consider further whether In-house
agency cross transactions In listed
secunnes should continue to be restnoted.P
b to consider (after It received the recommendations of the National Market
Advisory Board and saw the progress
made by that date toward establishment of a national market system)
fixing a firm date for the elimination of
restrictions on off-board pnncrpat
transactions; 13 and
c to sohcit comments on the characterIStiCSof a proposed central limit order
repository and the specifications of
any plan for the Implementation of
such a repository 14
Seven national sscurmes exchanges filed
revised off-board trading rules, and the Commission found (with one exception) that those
rules were In conformity WIth Rule 19c-1 and

consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act 15 The Commission commenced
a proceeding to determine whether to disapprove one of the proposed rules, the Public
Limit Order Protection Rule ("PLOPR") filed
by the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")
The PLOPR would have limited the ability of
NYSE members to effect agency transactions
on any other exchange without first c1eanng
public limit orders on the NYSE 16 As potential grounds for disapproval, the Commission
noted that the PLOPR appeared to be inconsistent with, among other things, certain sections of the Securities Exchange Act and
Rule 19c-1 Shortly after the close of the
fiscal year, the NYSE advised the Commission that It Wished to Withdraw the PLOPR,17
and, on July 28, 1976, the Commission consented to the NYSE request and terminated
ItS proceeding With respect to the PLOPR 18

Composite Limit Order Book
When the Commission adopted Rule 19c-1
governing off-board trading by exchange
members, It Indicated that It was Initiating
steps to provide comprehensive limit order
protection consistent With the public interest 19 The Commission expressed ItS belief
that pubhc limit orders and the methods by
which they are kept play Important roles In
the securities markets Under certain circumstances, displacement of protessional orders
by public limit orders IS appropnate In the
public Interest and for the protection of investors, to ensure the fairness of the markets
and to provide an opportunity for public orders to meet Without the participation of a
dealer The Commission, however, found that
by their very nature eXisting exchange mechanisms for the storage of limited pnce orders
are unable to provide full protection for those
orders, and that regUlatory devices employed
to ensure execution of such orders create
certain adverse effects which outweigh their
laudable objectives The Commission indicated that the solution to these problems
appeared to lie In the utilization of exrsnnq
advanced technology to construct a computerized central limit order repository (a "composite book") desrqned to provide comprehensive limit order protection to Investors.
The Commission announced ItS intention to
consult With the National Market AdVISOry
Board and to soucu public comment concern5

Ing the characteristics and specincatrons of a
composite book and the appropriate manner
of achieving ItS Implementation 20
After ItS staft had consulted With the National Market Advrsory Board to Identify substantive and procedural Issues associated
With the development of a composite book,
the Commission solicited public comment on
these Issues, including the policy and technical questions associated With ten specified
characteristics of any composite book 21 Extensive written comments
have been received from numerous Individuals, institutions
and self-regulatory organizations
DUring the
coming year, the Commission Will formulate
and propose an appropriate course of action
With respect to the development of a compos-

ue book

Composite Quotation System
Section 11A(c)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act
directs the Commission to assure the prompt,
reliable and fair collection, processing, distribution and publication of Information With
respect to quotations for and transactions In
secunties and the fairness and usefulness of
the form and content of such information
Previously, the Commission had indicated ItS
support for a nationwide system making quotations from all market makers universally
available (a "composite quotations system")
In both ItS 1972 Market
Structure
Statemenf22 and 1973 Polley Statement23
As previously reported, 24 the Commission
In 1972 initiated the development
of a composite quotation system by proposing Exchange Act Rule 17a-14 The rule, as Originally proposed,25 would have required all
national securities exchanges to make quotations of their specialists available to vendors
of market Information
Similarly, the NASD
would have been required to make available
to such vendors quotations
of over-thecounter market makers In securities listed or
traded on exchanges Finally, the rule would
have required all such quotations to be made
available to vendors on a current and continuing baSIS
In 1974, the Commission reproposed Rule
17a-14 In substantially revised form 26 The
major change was the mclusion of a requirement that quotations be "reported" by selfregulatory organizations (and certain brokerdealers) pursuant to a plan (similar to that

6

required by Exchange Act Rule 17a-15), filed
With and declared effective by the Cornrrussion, provrdrnq for the availability
of such
quotations to vendors of market Information
on a realtime, current and continuing baSIS
Followrnq reconsideration of proposed Rule
17a-14, the Commission determined to adopt
initially a different approach desiqned to enhance the availability of quotation Information
Without potentially burdensome Federal regulanon On March 11, 1975, the Commission
announced
that It had sent letters to all
national secuntres exchanges
formally requesting them to eliminate, on or before May
1, 1975, any of their rules or practices which
restricted access to or use of such quotation
information as they then disseminated, or In
the future might disseminate,
to quotation
vendors At the same time, the Commission
announced that It was defemng further consideranon of proposed Rule 17a-14 until It
had an opporturuty to observe the effects of
elimination of exchange restrictions on quotation dissemination
On May 7, 1975, the
Commission announced that It had received
responses to ItS March 11, 1975 request from
all national securities exchanges and that all
exchanges either had taken the action requested by the Commission or had Informed
the Commission that they had no rules or
practices restricting access to or use of such
Information In making ItS announcement, the
Comrrussion added that, In ItS View, the actions taken by the various exchanges would
tacrhtate the establishment of a central market system, as contemplated by the CornrrussIOn's 1972 Market Structure Statement and
ItS 1973 Polley Statement, by making pOSSIble the composite display of quotation information for multiply traded securities
Since May 1975, several vendors have
made major efforts to develop and market a
composite quotation service The Commission has found, however, that despite these
efforts, the quality of quotation Information
disseminated to brokers, dealers and Investors can be Improved substantially, and that
numerous problems relating to the dissemination of useful and reliable quotation Information have yet to be resolved
Exchange
markets stili do not report "firm" quotations,
and no market disseminates Information as to
quotation size In many cases, quotation information supplied to vendors IS not updated

promptly to reflect changes In actual quotations In the various markets. As the fiscal
year progressed, It became apparent that the
lack of reliable quotations from the various
markets was hampering private and self-regulatory efforts to establish a viable composite
quotation system, the absence of which In
turn was Impeding development of a national
market system.
On JUly 29, 1976, the Commission proposed for public comment Exchange Act Rule
11Ac1-1 27 Rule 11Ac1-1 would require, on
and alter November 1, 1976, national securities exchanges to collect from their specialIStS, and the NASD to collect from third
market makers, quotations In eligible securities for disserrunauon by those self-regulatory
organizations to quotation vendors. In addition, those organizations also would be obligated to provide such vendors With their
specialists'
and market makers' quotation
sizes If those specialists and market makers
elect to make such sizes available for dissemination.
Although the proposed rule neither speernes the manner In which, or the frequency
With Which the quotations are to be collected,
processed, and made available, It would require specialists and third market makers to
communicate their quotations promptly In accordance With procedures established by the
relevant exchanges or assocranon for the
timely drssernmatron to quotation vendors
And the proposed Rule would require quotations covered be "firm," subject to certain
exceptions
In particular, any specrahst or
third market maker who IS presented With an
order for the purchase or sale of any eligible
security (other than an odd-lot order) must
stand ready to execute a transaction In that
security In any amount up to (but In no case
exceeding) his published quotation size (or,
In the event
no quotation size IS disseminated, a normal Unit of trading) at a price at
least as favorable to the buyer or seller as hrs
most recently published bid or asked price
The foregOing requirement would not apply If,
alter dissemmanon of hrs published quotation
but before the specralrst or third market
maker received an order (I) a transaction In
that security IS effected either on the floor of
the particular exchange or by the third market
maker, or IS reported In the consolidated
system, or (ii) the speciahst or third market

maker has communicated
a superseding
quotation. However, If he did not communicate rus superseding quotation Within three
minutes alter a transaction or a report of a
transaction, he would be obligated to buy or
sell that security In accordance With the general rule as to firmness.

Consolidated Transaction
Reporting System
In addition

to ItS work

on developing

a

composite quotation system, the Cornrrussron
has assisted In Implementing a consolidated
transaction reporting system (the "consolidated system") As previously reported,28 the
consolidated system developed as a result of
the Comrmssron's
adoption In 1972 of Exchange Act Rule 17a-15. The consolidated
system has progressed from a pilot state to
an operational reporting system, drsserrunatIng last sale reports of transactions executed
In all reporting markets for secunties listed on
the New York Stock Exchange ("Network A")
and on the American Stock Exchange, plus
selected regional listings ("Network B") Tlus
follows the JOint Industry Plan declared effective by the Cornmrssron In accordance With
Rule 17a-15 Moreover, last sale reports In
both Network A and Network B secunnes are
now available by means of a high speed data
transrrussron
line (the "high speed line"),
which for the first time enables Investors and
market professionals to have such information available on a real-time baSIS regardless
of any delays In the low speed ticker network
dunnq penods of heavy trading
DUring the period since the enactment of
the 1975 Amendments,
the Commission's
staff has met on a regular baSIS With certain
secunnes Information processors, who drsseminate consolidated last sale reports, and
With the Consolidated Tape ASSOCiation (the
"CTA"), an assocanon of self-regulatory organizations which bears the responsibiuty of
overseeing the JOint Industry Plan for the
operation of the consolidated
system, and
which IS registered as an exclusive secunties
rntorrnatron processor. Other relevant developments include:
a The commencement on April 3D, 1976,
of Phase II of the JOint Industry Plan, making
available both the high speed line and last
sale reports In both Network A and Network B

7

securities, which activated certain revised
short sale provisions of Exchange Act Rule
10a-1 and vendor obligations under Rule
17a-1529
b. The Commission's granting of conditional exemptions to certain domestic secunties information processors from the display
requirements of Exchange Act Rule 17a-15,
which became applicable upon the commencement of Phase II.30 The staff of the
Commission IS presently studymq the requests of certain foreign vendors for conditional exemptions from these display requirements
c. The Commission's scsonancn of publiC
comment on whether those provisions of the
JOint Industry Plan which prohibit a securities
information processor from retransmitting
consolidated last sale reports on a continuous baSISshould be modified or abolished In
light of the standards now contained In Sections
11A(b)(5),
11A(c)(1)(C)
and
11A(c)(1)(D) of the Exchange Act One securities information processor had asserted that
the reasons for Initially Imposing such prohibitions no longer provide a sound baSISfor their
maintenance.31
d. After receipt of several letters from securities information processors, as well as from
registered brokers and dealers, questioning
the level of fees charged by the CTA for
consolidated last sale reports, the Oornrmssion's staff has undertaken extensive research Into the Act's requirements that securities information processors be able to obtain
information from an exctusrve processor
(such as the CTA) on "fair and reasonable"
terms, and on terms that are not "unreasonably discriminatory "
e The comrmssion has analyzed certain
proposed rule changes of the National Assocratron of Securities Dealers, Inc (the
"NASD") that would reqUire the reporting of
transactions to the CTA at the price at which
the transaction was effected Inclusive of any
cornrmssion or cornmtsston equrvalent (a reporting mode commonly referred to as "net
printing" of pnnopal transactions) These rule
changes were Originallyfiled by the NASD on
June 4, 1975, the date the 1975 Amendments became law Such changes were published for public comment and were declared
summarily effective by the Cornrrussion In
order to permit the scheduled commence8

ment of Network A of the consolidated system,32 subject to the Oommlssion's prerogative under Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange
Act either to approve the proposed rule
changes or to commence proceedings to
determine whether such rule changes should
be disapproved. On December 24, 1975, the
Oomrmssron publlshed33 an NASD amendment of ItS proposed rule changes which
modified the proposal to permit the reporting
of transactions at the price recorded on the
trade ticket, Without recogniZing any commission or comrnrssion equivalent (commonly
referred to as "gross printing" of pnncipal
transactions). The proposed modifications
eliminated the eXisting disparity between the
reporbng of pnnopat transactions effected by
NASD members and the reporting of Identical
transactions effected by members of national
secunnes exchanges. On May 12, 1976, the
Oomrrnseron approved the NASD transaction
reporting rules as modlfied.34 While finding
these reporting rules to be consistent with the
requirements of the EXchangeAct, the Comrmssron also noted that It Intends to continue
studying quesnons related to the reporting of
transactions In eligible secunnes, partrcularfy
the method of reporbng pnnopal transactions
confirmed by a dealer plus or minus a comrrusston, commission equrvalsnt or differential.

Equal RegUlation
In testimony before Congress preceding
the passage of the 1975 Amendments, Industry representatives urged that the Integration
of eXisting market centers Into a national
market system be accompanied by equal
regulation of all market components. The new
Section 11A(a) of the Exchange Act directs
the Commissron to assure fair competition
among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchange
markets and markets other than exchange
markets. Since the enactment of the 1975
Amendments, the Commission has taken
steps to assure such equal regulation in two
specmc areas: regUlation of short sales and
anti-manipulative rules.

Short Sale RegUlation
On June 12, 1975, the Commission
adopted35 amendments to ItS short sale

rules, Exchange Act Rules 10a-1 and 10a-2,
to provide for comprehensive regulation of
short sales of listed secunnes In all markets
(including the over-the-counter market) In
conjuncbon with the full Implementation of the
consolidated transaction reporting system.36
In conjunction With the adoption of those
amendments, the Commission proposed two
further amendments to RUle 10a-1 to alleviate the Impact of the short sale rules on the
market-making ability of regional exchange
mernbers.P? After revlewmg the comments
receved on these further proposals (including
the views of certain self-regulatory orqaruzanons presented at a public meeting held on
Apnl 26, 1976), the Comrmssion determined
to withdraw the proposed amendments. 38
The Commission IS connnumq to consider
whether any form of short sale regulation IS
necessary or appropnate In view of the Improvements In the reporting of transactions
by the consolidated system and the development of more sophisticated techniques for
market surveillance by the comrrusson and
the various self-regulatory organlzabons.

Anti-Manipulative

RUles

By September 1975, each of the self-regulatory organizations parnopannq In the pilot
phase of the consolidated transaction reportIng system had adopted a uniform anti-manipulative rule in substantially the form recommended by the Commission's AdvIsory
Committee on a Central Market System. In
August 1975, through idenncal letters to all
nabonal securibes exchanges participating in
the consolidated system, the Commission's
staff requested venficabon that all of the annmanipulative rules recommended by the
Commission in September 1974 had been
adopted.39 All these exchanges replied affirmatively. On June 4, 1975, the NASD
amended and refiled WIth the Commission
proposed anti-manipulative rules relating to
over-the-counter trading In eligible seeunnes,
which rules were approved by the Commission on May 12, 197640

Automated Routing Systems
Section 11A(c)(1)(E) of the Exchange Act,
added by the 1975 Amendments, directs the
Commission to assure that all exchange
members, brokers and dealers transmit and

direct orders for the purchase and sale of
qualified secunties In a manner consistent
WIth the establishment and operation of a
nabonal market system. Two related provisions, Sections 11A(a)(1)(C)(I) and (II), requtre the Oornrmssionto assure economically
effiCient executions of securities transactions
and fair competition among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between
exchange and other markets. In furtherance
of thiS obligation, the Commission has reViewed proposals (1) by several exchanges
relating to automatic order routing systems
(2) by three large broker-dealers WIshing to
commence programs for the In-house execubon of certain types of customer odd-lot differentials, and (3) by two exchanges wishing
to prohibt their members from Imposing differential charges on certain types of odd-lot
orders.
On November 11, 1975, the Paone Stock
Exchange, Inc. (the "PSE"), filed a proposed
rule change with the Commission which
would expand the capability of the PSE's
automatic
order
execution
system
("COMEX") from 199-share orders to orders
not exceeding 300 shares." Additionally, the
PSE proposed to broaden the prohibition of
the imposrnon of floor brokerage on COMEX
orders which are executed on a formula baSIS,to cover all market and limit orders. The
Commission approved the PSE's proposal on
December 23,1975.42
On January 9, 1976, the Midwest Stock
Exchange, Inc. (the "MSE"), filed WIth the
Comrmssrona proposed rule change to convert Its automatic execution program (available for orders from 100 to 199 shares in
certain Issues listed on the MSE) ("MAX")
from a pilot program to a permanent program.43 MAX orders are executed on a formula basis In a manner Similar to that of
COM EX. The Commission approved the
MSE's proposal on May 14, 197644
On February 12,1976, the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc (the "NYSE"), submitted a
proposed rule change setting forth procedures for routing and executing 1Oo-share
market orders processed through the NYSE's
Desiqnated Order Turnaround System
("DOr').45 DOT orders are executed on the
baSISof the bid/asked pnces quoted on the
floor of the NYSE at the time the orders are
received on the floor. The Commission ap9

proved the NYSE's DOT proposal on May 19,
197646
In addition, the Cornrmssron analyzed the
regulatory and competitive
Implications
of
programs by three large broker-dealers
to
Internalize executions of certarn types of customer odd-lot orders In listed sscunues without the Imposition of an odd-lot differential
This question was presented m connection
with requests by these broker-dealers
for
exemptions from Exchange Act Rules 10a-1
In order
to
and 10b-6, where applicable,
faCIlitate the operation of these odd-lot programs 47
Finally, the Commission approved rule proposals submitted by the American Stock Exchange and the Midwest Stock Exchange
which would effectively prohibit members of
those exchanges (inclUding specialists) actIng In the capacity of odd-lot dealers from
Imposing a differential In connection With the
execution of certain types of odd-lot orders 48

Access to Exchanges
General InqUiry-Section
31(b) of the 1975
Amendments authonzes the Cornrrussion to
review the rules of any national secunties
exchange or national securities associanon to
see If any of therr rules do not comply With
the Exchange Act, as amended The section
provides that at any time Within one year of
the effectIve date of any amendments to the
Act, the Commission may give written notice
to an exchange or assocranon specifying the
extent to which ItS rules fall to comply With the
provisrons of the Secuntres Exchange Act.
After SIX months have elapsed followmg receipt of the notice, the Cornrmssron may by
order suspend the registration of such exchange or associatron or Impose limitations
on the acnvrnes. functions and operations of
the exchange or assooatron If the Commission nnds, after notice and opponumty for
hearing, that the orqaruzation or rules of such
exchange or association do not comply With
the Exchange Act, as amended
Pursuant to Section 31 (b). the Commission
announced on March 2, 1976,49 that It was
undertakmg
a general inqurry of the exchanges, rules relating to membership and
assocranon With members m light of certain of
the 1975 Amendments, particularly those to
Section 6 of the Exchange Act Among other

10

thmqs, Seclion 6(b) now permits any registered broker or dealer to join a national
secunnes exchange and any person to become associated With a member orqamzanon, subject of course to statutory dlsquallflcanons and to appropriate fmancial, operational and competency
standards
Section
6(b) also embodies a prolubmon against exchange rules Imposmg unnecessary or mappropnate burdens on competition
The purpose of the comrrussion's general mquny IS
to assure that exchange regulation of access
to membership and associanon WIth member
organizations IS limited to fulfilling the purposes of the Act At the end of the fiscal year,
the ten nanonal seeunnes exchanges
had
responded With a variety of presentatrons
along With proposed amendments to rules as
to which notice had been given pursuant to
Section 31(b) m connection With the proceeding
New York Stock Exchange Rule Proposals -On
March 11, 1976, the Commission
gave notice of the filing of, and the issuance
of an order instrtutrnq proceedmgs to deterrrnne whether to disapprove, Rules 309 and
310 as proposed by the NYSE 50 Proposed
NYSE Rule 309 would prohibit an NYSE
member orqaruzation from havmq as a parent
a natural person not a Citizen of, or a company not orgamzed under the laws of, the
Umted States, unless the NYSE determined

Trading by Exchange Members
Section 11(a) -As
amended by the 1975
Amendments, Section 11(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange
Act prohibits,
with certain
specified exceptions (such as market making
activities), any member of a national secunlies exchange from effecting any transaction
on such exchange for ItS own account, the
account of an assoaated person, or an account with respect to which It or any of ItS
associated persons exercises Investment discretion. Under Section 11(a), the Commission
has broad authonty to fashion either more
flexible or more restrictive standards In light
of changing conditions. Section 11(a)(3) provides that the prohibitions In Section 11(a)(1)
do not apply before May 1, 1978, to transactions effected on an exchange by those who
were members of that exchange on May 1,
1975
On January 27, 1976,51 the Commission
began a rulernakmq proceeding to Implement
Section 11(a) and requested public comment
on a series of related questions In anticipation of May 1, 1978 (and Inasmuch as Section 11(a)(1) Immediately affected members
who JOined exchanges after May 1, 1975), the
Commission took action to Implement certain
specific exemptions envisroned by the Congress. First, the Commission
adopted Exchange Act Temporary Rule 11a-1(T) to Implement the exemption In Section 11(a)(1)(G)
for the proprietary
transactions
of certain
types of members where the transactions
yield pnonty, parity, and precedence In execution to public orders. At the same time, the
Commission
proposed Exchange Act Rule
11al-2, which would allow members to effect
transactions for the accounts of their associated persons, and also transactions for accounts earned by associated persons, only
on the same basis that such transactions
could be effected for accounts held by the
member Itself The Commission
also proposed an amendment to ItS recordkeepmq
rule. Exchange Act Rule 17a-3, which would
enable every member, broker or dealer to
demonstrate
ItS compliance
with Section
11 (a)
Rectsston of Rule 19b-2 -Exchange
Act

Rule 19b-2, adopted by the Commission In
1973, required each national sscuntres exchange to adopt rules specifymq that every
member of the exchange must have as the
principal purpose of ItS exchange membership the conduct of a public secunties bustness, In accordance with that rule Rule 19b2 had been the subject of extensive litigation 52 Since Section 11(a), as amended by
the 1975 Amendments, was Intended to displace Rule 19b-2, the rule was rescinded by
the Commission 53 Following the rescssion
of Rule 19b-2, the Commission has approved
deletions by national secunnes exchanges of
rules adopted thereunder and has Indicated
further that such rules are no longer consistent with the Act 54

Allocation of Regulatory
Responsibility Among SelfRegulatory Organizations
The 1975 Amendments transferred the responstbihty from the Securities Investor Protection Corporation
to the Cornrrussron of
designating one self-regulatory
organization
to Inspect members of two or more such
organizations
("dual members") for compliance with the applicable tmancral responsibrlIty rules 55 Section 17(d) of the Exchange Act
empowers the Cornrrussron to relieve any
self-regulator of compliance, enforcement, or
other regulatory functions with respect to dual
members, and to allocate among the selfregulators rulernakmq authority concerning
matters as to which such orqaruzanons share
such authority
Such action IS to promote
competition and coordination among the selfregulators and the development of a national
market system and a national system for the
clearance and settlement of sscuntres transactions
On April 20, 1976, the Comrmssron
adopted Exchange Act Rule 17d-1,56 which
essenlially
provides that the Commission
shall designate one of the self-regulators to
which a dual member belongs as responsible
for examining the dual member for compliance with applicable nnancral responsiburty
rules Under Rule 17d-1, written designation
of one such self-regulatory organization relieves all other Interested self-regulators
of
trus responsrbihty to the extent specified In
the designation
At the same time, the Cornrrnssron pro11

posed Rule 17<1-2,which IS Intended to establish the procedural foundation for a comprehensive allocation of regulatory responsibility among the self-regulators, and to promote cooperation among such organizations
In assessing their regulatory capabilities The
proposed rule would permit two or more selfregulatory orqaruzanons to submit to the
Commission a JOintproposed plan for allocation of specified regulatory functions as to
members or participants which they have In
common Once such a plan had been declared effective by the Commission, those
self-regulators parncipatmq In the plan and
not deSignated thereby to assume regulatory
responsibility would be relieved of such responsibility to the extent provided by the plan.
In the event that proposed plans Illed under
proposed Rule 17<1-2did not provide lor all
members or particrpants 01 parties to the
plan, or did not allocate all their sell-regulatory responsibility, the Commission would be
empowered, on ItS own motion alter due
consrderation 01 the statutory cntena, to desIgnate one or more self-regulators to assume
speehed regulatory responsibilities With respect to such members or participants. As
the fiscal year closed, the Commission was
consrdennq public comments upon the allocation program, and responses to the Commission's specrncrequest that the self-regulators submit outlines of allocation plans which
they might file In accordance With proposed
Rule 17d-2

Enforcement Obligations of SelfRegulatory Organizations
Section 19(9), which was added to the
Exchange Act by the 1975 Amendments,
requnes every sell-regulatory orqanizatron to
comply Withthe Act, the rules and regulations
thereunder and Its own rules and, absent
reasonable iustmcanon or excuse, to enforce
compliance therewith by ItS members and
persons associated With ItS members Section 19(9)(2) authonzes the Commission to
adopt rules relieVingany self-regulatory organization 01 ItS enlorcement responsibilities
With respect to specifred provisrons 01 the
Secunties Exchange Act or the rules and
regulations thereunder
On May 26, 1976, the Commission published lor comment proposed Exchange Act
Rule 1992-1 57 The proposed rule IS de12

Signed to provide a format lor developing
gUidelines as to the extent to which sellregulatory organizations should be obligated
to enlorce the Exchange Act and the rules
thereunder. II adopted In the form proposed,
Rule 1992-1 would relieve nanonal seeunnes
exchanges and assooatrons from certain enlorcement responsibilities pnmanly With respect to those persons associated With members who neither control members nor engage In secuntres acnvmes,

FOCUS Reporting System
In response to indications from the secunties Industry that the separate ftnanoal reporting and surveillance systems 01 the Comrrnssron and the vanous sell-regulatory organizations were Imposing an unnecessary burden on brokers and dealers, (especially the
smaller Ilrms), the Commission Initiated a
comprehensive program to review, consolidate and simplify the existmq reporting and
regulatory requirements applicable to the secunnes Industry The program began With the
creation 01 an AdVISOryCommittee on BrokerDealer Reports and Registration Hequrrements,58 which was SUbsequently replaced
by the Report Coordinating Group, a Federal
advisory committee lormed In May 1974 59
In ItS First Annual Report to the Commission on June 16, 1975, the Report CoordrnatIng Group recommended the adoption 01 a
Financial and Operational Combined Urulorrn
Single ("FOCUS") Report After considermq
the recommendations 01 the Report Coordinating Group and the comments received
thereon, and making some changes, the
Commission released the FOCUS Report for
puonc comment on October 16, 1975 60 Alter
making additional changes, the Commission
adopted the FOCUS Report and accompanyIng amendments to Exchange Act RUles 17a4, 17a-5, 17a-10, 17a-11 and 17a-20 on
December 17, 1975 (all of which became
effective on January 1, 1976) 61 The report
has also been adopted by over 40 state
secuntres aqencies

The FOCUS reporting system Simplifies the
reporting obligations of all brokers and dealers by superseding the eXisting and often
uncoordinated reportmg systems 01 the Comrmssion and the self-regulators With an mtegrated reporting system based upon gtmeral
purpose financial statements. The program

consolidates broker-dealer reporlJng requirements for purposes of surveillance, annual
audits, customer statements, and econorruc
data collection. The FOCUS system replaces
all Similar exisnnq reporlJng programs of the
self-regulatory
orqarnzanons.
such as the
JOint Regulatory
Report and the NASD's
of
Forms "M" and "0"
The consohdatron
these diverse reporting forms Into a single
reporting system substantially
reduces the
mulnplrcrty of forms and the frequency
of
required filings resulting In a considerable
reduction In paperwork for the broker-dealer
In addition, the FOCUS forms are desiqned
to enable a firm to present ItS financial condition dearly and effiCiently, through the periodic disclosure of key indicators of financial
condition, such as a monthly computation of
net capital, and detailed ftnanoal and operational statements and schedules prepared on
a quarterly baSIS
The structure
of the FOCUS Report IS
desiqned on a "layering" concept, that IS, the
complexity of the broker's or dealer's bUSIness determines the amount of required information and the frequency of ItS filing. Part I of
Form X-17 A-5 consists of twenty-six
key
indicators of finanaal condition and must be
filed monthly by those brokers and dealers
which clear or carry customers'
accounts.
Part II of Form X-17A-5 comprises comprehensive statements and schedules of nnanaal and operanonal information, which must
be filed on a calendar quarter baSIS by such
brokers and dealers. Part IIA of Form X-17 A5, another quarterly filing, IS an abbreviated
version of Part II available to those brokers
and dealers which Introduce their customers'
business to another broker or dealer on a
fUlly disclosed baSIS
Concurrent With the adoption of the FOCUS Report, the Commission approved and
declared effecllve plans filed by eight selfregulatory
organizations
pursuant
to Exchange Act Rule 17a-5(a)(4),
which plans
dispense With the requirement to file a separate copy of the FOCUS Report With the
Commission
Under these plans, the American Stock Exchange, Inc, the Boston Stock
Exchange, lnc., the Chicago Board Options
Exchange,
Inc, the Midwest
Stock Exchange, Inc., the National Assocration of Secunnas Dealers, Inc, the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc, the Pacrnc Stock Exchange,

Inc, and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange,
Inc. have agreed to receive FOCUS Reports
directly from those members for which each
organization IS the desiqnated examining authonty Thrs information IS reviewed and analyzed by the self-regulators and submitted to
the Commission In the form of edited computer tapes, thus providrnq the necessary
data to the Cornrrussron Without Imposing an
additronal direct filing requirement on members of these self-regulatory organizations
For the first time, Rule 17a-5(a)(2) integrates a broker-dealer's annual audit With the
quarterly surveillance reports, thus providmq
a Single coordinated framework of regulallon
Tlus provision requires that a broker or dealer
file a report on Part II or Part IIA of Form X17A-5 as of the date of the annual audit, If
such date does not corncide With a regular
calendar quarter filing of a report on Part II or
Part IIA Tlus requtrernent
provides the Comrrussron With comparable data In audited and
unaudited formats from which the accuracy of
the broker's or dealer's quarterly reports may
be verified.
The detailed audit requirements embodied
In previous
financial
questionnaires
have
been eliminated to permit the development of
flexible audit procedures SUited to the nature
and complexity of an mdivrdual broker's or
dealer's business Rule 17a-5(g) prescribes
general audit objectives to be followed In the
preparation
of annual financial statements
and thereafter permits the accountant to exerase lus protessional Judgment With respect
to the nature, extent and timing of audit
procedures. In rendering hrs opiruon, the audrtor IS required to reconcile hrs cornputanons
of the firm's net capital (pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1) and reserve requirements (pursuant to EXhibit A to Rule
15c3-3) With the corresponding computations
In the broker's or dealer's most recent filing of
the unaudited Part II or Part IIA of Form X17A-5 The auditor IS also required by Rule
17a-5(h)(2) to Inform the Commission If, durIng the course of the audit or interim work, he
determines the existence of material inadequacies which the broker or dealer has not
reported promptly or accurately to the Comrrussron
In addition to the revrsron of Form X-17 A5, the FOCUS reporting system also effects
In the Commission's
Significant
changes
13

Forms X-17A-10 and X-17A-20. The Information required by Form X-17A-1O, the annual report of revenue and expenses, is substantially reduced and modified to coordinate
WIth corresponding data on the FOCUS Report. Much of the rntormanon required by
Form X-17A-20, a report utilized by the
Commission to morutor the Impact of competItive commission rates, has been eliminated,
as Similar Information IS developed by the
FOCUS Report.
The Simplification and uruncancn of the
reporting requirements and the fleXibility of
the revised audit procedures engendered by
the FOCUS concept strengthen the regulatory structures of the Commission and the
self-regulatory organizations while reduemq
the time and effort required of brokers and
dealers In order to demonstrate compliance.
The relative benefits of nus new system accrue particularly to smaller brokers and dealers, and have resulted In substantial time and
cost savings for such firms The Oornrnission
Intends periodically to review and modify the
FOCUS Report to Insure that continued existence of a ftnancral reportrng system that
keeps pace Withan evolvrng securities Industry.

Uniform Net Capital Rule
For years pnor to 1975, brokers and dealers had operated under as many as eight
different rules prescribing hnancral responsibility standards In the form of minimum net
caprtal requirements. Seven national securities exchanges had capital rules which governed their members, and the Commission
applied EXchange Act Rule 15c3-1 to other
brokers and dealers. lJttle Initial uniformity
existed among these rules, and thiS Situation
worsened With the passage of time as years
of divergent amendatory and Interpretive development created further drssrmuantres.
Section 15(c)(3) of the Exchange Act, as
amended by the 1975 Amendments, required
the Comrrussion to establish no later than
September 1, 1975, minimum financial responsibility requirements for all brokers and
dealers. On June 26, 1975, the Cornrrussron
fulfilled thiS congressional directive by adoptIng a Uniform net capital rule Which, among
other things, superseded the capital requirements of all national securities exchanges.62
As amended, Rule 15c3-1 perpetuates the
14

Commission's traditional "aggregate indebtedness" standard of Capital sufncrency, and
Introduces a new concept In fmanoat responSibility regulation, the "alternative net capital
requirement." The aggregate Indebtedness
concept, which denves from the provisions of
former capital rules, measures a broker's or
dealer's liqUidity and nnancrat condition m
terms of a rano between substantally all of tus
liabilities and those of ms assets which are
readily convertible Into cash The alternative
net capital requirement, which IS available at
the election of qualified brokers and dealers,
prescribes net capital requirements graduatIng in direct proportion to the magnitude of a
firm's customer-related obligations, as computed In accordance With the Formula for
Determination of Reserve ReqUirements of
Brokers and Dealers, constituting EXhibit A to
Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3

RegUlation of Municipal Securities
Professionals
The 1975 Amendments sought to subject
rnuruopal secunnes professionals to essentially the same scheme of regulallOn applicable to other securities activities 63Thus, municipal secunnes were excised from the exchange Act's definition of "exempted securities" for purposes of several provisions of the
Act, Includrng Section 15(a), which sets forth
registration requirements for brokers and
dealers.64 At the same time, the 1975
Amendments added Section 15B(a) to the
Act Trus new provrsron requires rnurucipal
secunnes dealers utiliZing the [unsdicnonal
means and not otherwise registered under
Section 15 to register WIththe Commission. 65
Other provrsions of Section 15B establish and
set rulemakrng standards for the Municipal
Seeunnes Rulemaklng Board, a self-regulatory organization for the rnumcipal secunties
Industry. Since the enactment of the 1975
Amendments, approximately 310 bank murucipal seeunnes dealers, 10 other muruopal
secunnes dealers conducting an exclusively
Intrastate busmess (but utiliZing the junsdrcnonal means),66and 232 brokers and dealers
required to register under Section 15 solely
by Virtueof their murucipal securities acnvmes
have registered With the Oornrnissron. The
past fiscal year saw numerous rulemakrng
rrunanvesby the Oomrrussionand the MUniCIpal Securities Rulemaklng Board Intended to

provide for the regulation of these rnurucipal
securities protessionals
Establishment of the MUnicipal Securities
Rulemakmg
Board -Section
15B(b)(1) requrred the Commission to appoint the Initial
15 members of the MUnicipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the "MSRB"). On June 12,
1975, the Commission sohcrted recommendations of candidates for appointment to the
MSRB.67 After reviewing over 500 letters
recommending
approximately
150 mdivrduals, the Commission announced ItS selection
of the Initial membership
of the MSRB.68
DUring the fiscal year, the MSRB made nine
proposed rule filings. One of these IS drscussed below; others are discussed In Part III
of tlus Report
Definition of the Term "Separately Identifiable Department
or DIVISion" of a Bank.Section 15B(b)(2)(H) requires the MSRB to
define, by rule, the term "separately Identifiable department or drvrsion [of a bank]" for
purposes of the definition of "municipal secunnes dealer," Such a rule would determine In
what circumstances a bank murucipal secunties dealer could comply With the registration
requirements of Section 15B( a) by registering
Its "separately Identifiable" component, rather
than by reglstenng the entire bank On October 10, 1975, the MSRB filed four rules,
Including a rule defining the term "separately
Identifiable department or drvisron'' of a bank,
and, on October 15, 1976, the Commission
ordered thiS rule (and certain related definitional proposals) to be put Into effect summanly In order to permit the timely and orderly registration of the separately Identifiable
departments or dtvisrons of banks.69
Adoption of Rules Relatmg to RegIstratIon
of MUniCipal
Securities
Dealers -Under
Section 15B(a), all muructpal secunties dealers must register With the Commission
On
August 11, 1975, the Commission
(I) announced that non-bank rnuruopal secuntres
protessronats would be required to register on
the exrsnnq Form BD, (II) proposed Exchange
Act Rules 15Ba2-1 and 15Ba2-2 concerning
reglstrabon of bank muruopal secunties dealers and non-bank rnuruopal securities dealers whose business IS exdusively Intrastate,
and (IIi) proposed Form MSD for bank registrants.70
On October 15, 1975, the Commission
adopted
Exchange
Act Rules 158a2-1,

15Ba2-2, two temporary rules (15Ba2-3(T)
and 15a-1(T»), and Form MSD, With amendments permitting ItS use by separately identifiable departments or drvisrons of banks, 71
The temporary rules provided a six-month
grace period for new registrants from the
requirement
that all murucrpal securities
protessronats be effectively registered by December 1, 1975, provided that such persons
filed their applications for registration With the
Commission
not later than November 30,
1975, and complied With applicable provisions of the Act, the rules and regulations of
the Commission thereunder, and the rules of
the MSRB. The Commission also adopted
Rule 15b2B-1, which establishes a definition
of, and registration procedures for, separately
Idenbfiable departments or divrsrons of persons referred to In Section 15(b)(2)(B) of the
Act. 72
Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, the
Commission
adopted
Rules
15Ba2-4,
15Ba2-5, 15Ba2-6 and 15Bc3-1 (and related
Form MSDW), which relate to the reglstrahon
of successors to a registered municipal secunnes dealer, the registration of a fidUCiary
appointed to continue the business of a registered rnurucipal secuntres dealer, and the
Withdrawal of the registration of a muruopal
secunnes dealer. 73
Capital Requuements
for Brokers and
Dealers Effectmg Trensections m MUniCIpal
Securities -The
Cornrnrssron, aware that its
net capital requirements should provide appropnate recoqrutron of the pronounced differences between the rnurucrpal securities
markets and their corporate securities counterparts, sohcrted public comment on three
occasions dUring the summer of 1975 concerning the appropriate net capital requirements for brokers and dealers effecting
In rnurucrpal
securities 74 The
transactrons
public's response indicated that these brokers and dealers would need an extended
transitional penod to conform their operanons
to the net capital standards of Rule 15c3-1.
Accordingly, on November 20, 1975, the
75 a financial
reCommission
announced
sponsibrhty and reporting program pertaining
In rnuructpal securities,
the
to transactions
salient feature of which was a series of
temporary amendments to Rule 15c3-1, explnng In most cases on June 1, 1976, deSigned to modify the Impact of certain provl-

15

srons of the rule upon brokers and dealers
effectmg transactions rn rnurucipal secuntles.76 At the same time, the Commission
again mvited public comment concerning the
appropriate net capital requirements for these
brokers and dealers On May 26, 1976, the
Commission announced?" a second phase of
the financial responsibility and reporting program WhiCh,among other thmgs, permitted
smaller brokers and dealers effecting transactions solely m rnurucipalsecuntres to utilize
on a tnal basts the principal Innovation of the
uniform net capital rule, the alternative net
capital requirement.78Thrs second phase of
the Commission's program also extended until October 1, 1976, certam of the previously
adopted temporary amendments to Rule
15c3-1 Tlus acnon, coupled With the Commission's expkcrtsoncitanonof Impact studies
and other appropnate stanstrcal computations
from Interested members of the public, was
mtended to enable the Cornrrussron to develop solutions to technically mtncate questions
Review and Amendment of EXlstmg Antifraud Rules Appltcable to Transaction tn Mu-

Secunttes -DUring the past fiscal
year, the Commission engaged In a detailed
review of ItS existmq antifraud rules (adopted
under Sections 10(b), 15(c)(1), and 15(c)(2)
of the Exchange Act), and exisnnq SEC079
rules (adopted under provrsions renumbered
by the 1975 Amendments as Sections
15(b)(7), 15(b)(8), and 15(b)(9) of the Exchange Act) to determine the extent to which
such rules should be applicable to transacnons In municipal secunnss effected by brokers and dealers, as well as to such transactions by dealer banks or their separately
Idenbfiable departments or drvrsions.
In November 1975, the Cornrrussronsenertad public comment on proposals to extend
the application of eleven of the anllfraud rules
adopted under Section 10(b), 15(c)(1) and
15(c)(2) to bank rnurucipal secuntias dealers,
to suspend the application of Exchange Act
Rule 15c2-11 to quotations for rnurucipal
secunnes, and to suspend the application of
SECO exarrunatron rules and rules of fair
practice to municipal secunties dealers effectIng transacnons solely In such secuntles.80
In order to afford appropnate time for public
comment on these proposed rule changes,
and In order to relieve murucipal secuntias
nicipal

16

brokers and dealers from pOSSiblymappropnate regulatory requirements that would omerwise have applied to them on December 1,
1975, the Commissron, on November 26,
1975, adopted Exchange Act Temporary
Rule 23a-l(T). Trus rule preserved, With one
exception, the status quo until July 5, 1976,
the requlation of muruopal securities professionals and transactions In rnuruopal securities 81
On May 20, 1976, the Commission
adopted Without major revisron ItS proposed
amendments to the SECO rules. At the same
time, the Commission made those rules
adopted under Section 15(c)(1) of the Act, as
well as Exchange Act Rule 15c2-4, applicable to bank rnurucipal secunnes dealers. FInally, the Oomrmssion exempted transactions
m murncipal sscunnes from Rules 15c2-5,
15c2-7, and 15c2-11.82
Recordkeepmg
and Preservation Requrements for MUniCipal Secunues Brokers and
17(a) of the Exchange Act
Dealers.-Sectlon

reqcres certain enumerated classes of persons, mcludmg registered brokers and dealers, to make and keep such records for such
periods of time as the Commission may by
rule prescnbe. The 1975 Amendments added
several classes of persons, mcluding registered murucipal secunnes dealers, to the list
of entities subject to the Oornrrussion's rulemaking authonty With respect to recordkeepmg and preservation requirernents. At the
same time, the 1975 Amendments added to
the Act Section 15B(b)(2)(G), which requires
the MSRB to presence recordkeeping and
preservation requirements for municipal secunnes brokers and rnurucrpalsecunnes dealers. Taken together, Sections 17(a) and
15B(b)(2)(G) vest the Commission and the
MSRB With concurrent authonty to adopt recordkeepmg and preservallon standards for
all registered brokers and dealers effecting
transactions In muruopal securities, as well
as for those banks (or their separately Idennflable departments of diVISions)registered as
rnurncipalsecurities dealers.
The Commission's recordkeepmg and
preservation requirements, Exchange Act
Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4, apply by thelf terms
to all registered brokers and dealers. Thus,
newly registering brokers and dealers effectIng transactions solely m murncipal securibes
would come Wlthmthe ambit of these rules. It

appeared to the Commission that these brokers and dealers might be unfamiliar with the
requirements of these rules and, to the extent
their operational systems would require modification, might experience difficulty In Implementing Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4. On November 20, 1975, In order to afford these brokers
and dealers an appropriate transitional penod, and to permit the Commission and the
MSRB to develop appropriate recordkeepmq
and preservation requirements for all murucipal secunties brokers and municipal securities dealers, the Commission adopted83 and
thereafter maintained certain Interpretations
of Securities Exchange Act Rules 17a-3 and
17a-4 as applied to brokers and dealers
effecting transactions solely In municipal secunnes, These interpretations required such
brokers and dealers to make, keep current
and preserve In an easily accessible place
books and records sutticrent to demonstrate
their financial condition, to reflect the receipt
and delivery of all funds and securities, and
to reflect all customer activity
On February 3, 1976, the MSRB made
available to Interested members of the public
an exposure draft of rules establishing recordkeepinq and preservation
requirements
for all rnurncipal secunnes brokers and rnurucpal secuntres dealers Thereafter, In accordance With Section 19(b) of the Act, the
MSRB filed and the Commission pubhsheds"
these proposed rules These rules were under staff review as the fiscal year closed

RegUlation of the Options Markets
As the fiscal year began, three national
secunties exchanges listed and traded "call"
options contracts under programs approved
by the Oornrrussion In prior fiscal years. 85
The Chicago
Board Options
Exchange
("CBOE") had initiated listed options trading
In April 1973, the Amencan Stock Exchange
("Amex")
and the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange ("PH LX") began trading exchange
listed options In January and June 1975,
respectively. DUring the fiscal year, all three
exchanges expanded their options programs
amidst dramatically enlarged trading volume,
indicative of the Increasing Interest In thrs
Investment vehicle. Dunng thrs fiscal year,
the Pacrnc Stock Exchange ("PSE")
also
began an options market.
At the close of the fiscal year, CBOE had

1,319 members trading listed options on 85
underlying
stocks. CBOE's average daily
trading
volume
reached
approximately
89,000 contracts (compared to 53,000 In the
previous fiscal
year), 86 representing
8,900,000 shares of the underlying secunnes.
All 650 Amex members had options trading
pnvueqes admitting them to a market of listed
options on 57 underlying stocks 87 Average
dally volume on the Amex climbed from
17,016 to approximately
35,000 contracts.
Approximately 230 Phlx members were qualified to effect transactions In listed options for
27 undertymq stocks; nus exchange attained
an average trading volume of 2,600 contracts
dUring ItS first year of operation.

tmtieuon of Listed Options Tradmg on the
PSE -On March 30, 1976, the Commission
approved88 proposals by the PSE to Implement a program for the listing and trading of
option contracts on the PSE. Trading on the
PSE's options floor commenced on April 9,
1976
In common With other exchanges trading
listed options, PSE lists options on underlying
sscunues characterized by Wide distribution
and active trading and ISSUed by companies
With consistent earnings records. PSE's options contracts, like those traded on other
exchanges, are made fungible through standardization of such contract variables as expiration date and striking pnce. PSE has JOined
other exchanges which trade options as a
participant In the Options Cleanng Corporation (OCC). The OCC Issues, guarantees and
registers all exchange traded options In compliance With the federal secunties laws, and
In such
clears and settles all transactions
options PSE reports transactions occurnng
on ItS option floor to the Options Price Reporting Authonty, which serves as a consolidated reporting system for all transactions In
exchange listed options.
Unlike all other options exchanges except
Phlx,89 PSE lists both a particular underlying
security and the corresponding
call option
contract. Several features of PSE's options
program are desiqned to reduce the possibnIty of trading option contracts on the baSIS of
market information concerning acnvrty in the
underlying stock not yet publicly disseminated, or vice versa For example, PSE separates ItS options floor from ItS equmes trading
floor, In order to prevent direct oral or Visual

17

communication between members on the two
floors PSE also prohibits members from effecting transactions
of their own accounts
when they have learned of large unreported
transactions In an option or Its underlying
security, the effecting transactions for their
own accounts Involving either the stock or the
option until the transaction IS disclosed on the
ticker or otherwise, and, In the case of orders
Involving the option, for two minutes thereafter 90
As the fiscal year drew to a close, other
self-regulatory
organizations
were publicly
exploring the possrbihty of JOIning PSE as
new entrants Into the options marketplace
Both the Midwest Stock Exchange and the
NASD conducted drscussrons With the Commission's staff poinunq toward the possible
submission to the Commission of proposed
options programs dunnq the coming fiscal
year
l..Jsted Put Option Contracts -A call option
contract essentially provides ItS holder With
the right to purchase for a specrfred price a
specified number of shares of a given secunty from the seller (or "writer") of the call
Conversely, the purchaser of a "put" option
acqurres the right to sell a given quantity of
the underlying security to the writer of the put,
at a price specified In the put option contract
Presently, only call options are listed on the
four national securities exchanges trading
listed options
DUring the fiscal year, the
Commission published for public comment
rule proposals from all four exchanges proViding for the commencement
of trading In
listed put opnon contracts on each such exchange 91 Shortly after the fiscal year ended,
the Cornrrnssron addressed a letter to each of
the exchanges conveying ItS intention to defer any deoision respecting the initiation of
puts trading until after January 1, 1977 92 The
Commission noted that there had not been
sutncrent opporturuty to conduct an overall
review of the pilot options trading programs In
the context of the ongoing and future development of the securities market systems The
Commission also observed that a substantial
number of regulatory, surveillance and economic questions related to options trading
remained to be resolved However, the Commission expressed ItS recoqrunon of the "economic logiC" for extending exchange options
acnvity to Include listed put contracts

Fmanc/al ResponSibility
Reqtnrements
The nnaneral structure of the options marketplace revolves around a relatively small number of firms whrch, as "clearing members" of
the Options Clearing Corporation, guarantee,
carry and clear the accounts of the substantially more numerous opnons specialists
In
thrs capacity, each clearing member assumes
a complex of credit and market risks the
magnitude of which depends upon the acnvrties of the options specialists whose trading
obligations the clearing member IS reqUlred93
to guarantee In early 1976, the Cornrnrssron
determined that It would be appropriate to
amend the provrsions of ItS net capital rule
relating to the capital treatment of such guaranteed accounts, In order to augment the
nnancial
and regulatory
incentives
upon
clearing members to monitor closely the acnvmes of the options specialists In such accounts On February 26, 1976, the Commission proposed amendments to Aule 15c3-1
Intended to achieve this purpose.e' The proposed amendments
would require clearing
members to consider each specialist's market
maker account as a separate entity for purposes of capital computations,
no clearing
member would be permitted to "cross-net" a
hquidatmq dencrt In one such account against
equity In another such account The Commission also proposed specmc capital treatment
for certain dual-posrtron
trading strategies
known as "spreads" and "hedges," Instead of
applying separate capital charges to each
component of a bona fide hedge or spread
Finally, the proposed amendments to Aule
15c3-1 would establish a system of day-today control and early warning, whereby clearIng members would be required to monitor
closely each specialist's market making acnvmes The Commission's
staff was studying
public comments as the fiscal year ended

Registration and Regulation of
Clearing Agencies
The 1975 Amendments provide for Federal
regulation of the securities handling process,
including the registration and regulation of
clearing agencies and transfer agents, In order to facihtate the establishment
of a national system for the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions Under Section 17A of the Exchange

Act, the authority and responsibility for the
reglstralton and regulalton of clearing agences and transfer agents IS shared among the
Commission and the Federal bank regulatory
agencies (r.e , the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporatron.) 95
section 17A(b) of the Act, which became
effective on December 1, 1975, requires a
c1eanng agency96 to be registered with the
Commission
If It performs
any clearing
agency functions for any secunty other than
an exempted secunty The Cornrruasron must
publish notice of the filing so that Interested
persons may comment on It. Within certain
specrned periods,
the Commrssron
must
either grant the registration by order, or institute proceedings to determine whether registratron should be demed
In November
1975, the Commission
adopted Exchange
Act Rule 17 Ab2-1 , 97
which requires each cleanng agency to apply
for registration or exemption from registration
by filing Form CA-1 with the Cornrrussion.
On November 26, 1975, the Cornrrussron
published notice that thirteen cleanng agencies had applied for registration. 98 The reqrstranons were declared effective as of December 1, 1975, after the Commission
determined that the cleanng aqenoes' operations
and rules were adequate to safeguard secunties and funds In their custody or control, and
that their rules did not fix pnces which parncrpants In the cleanng agencies must charge to
other persons.
When the thirteen cleanng agencies were
registered on December 1, 1975, the Comrrussion, In accordance with Exchange Act
Rule 17Ab2-1, did not make all the determinations called for by subparagraphs
(A)
through (I) of Section 17A(b)(3) of the Act.
Under that rule, the Commission
has nine
months from the date the registration
becomes effective either to make all the reqinred determinations or to institute proceedIngs (In accordance with Section 19(a)(1)(B)
of the Act) to determine whether registration
should be denied. Thrs approach was intended to permit cleanng agencies In operation pnor to December 1, 1975 to be registered In compliance
with the Act upon a
finding that their operations afforded adequate safeguards to funds and securmes In

their custody or control, while provrdinq the
Oornrrussron sufficient time to consider fully
the Issues Involved before making the required determinations, particularly those pertinent to the establishment of a national clearance and settlement system
Since December 1, 1975, three additional
entmes have applied to the Commission for
One of these IS the proposed
reglstrallon.99
Corporatron
National
Secuntres
Clearing
("NSCC"), a company combining the cleanng
operations currently conducted by the three
major New York registered cleanng agencies,
the Stock Cleanng Corporation ("'SCC"), the
Amencan Stock Exchange Clearing Corporation ("ASECC")
and the National Cleanng
Corporation ("NCC")
The Cornrrussron has
also received fifteen applications for exemption from reglstrallon.1OO
On May 28, 1976, the Commission
announced the Institution of proceedings,
including public heanngs, to determine whether
to grant or deny the application of NSCC for
registration as a cleanng agency. 101 Public
hearings were held on June 16-18, 1976,
dunng which representatives
of certain national secunnes exchanges, the NASD, brokers and dealers, cleanng agencies,
and
other Interested
persons presented
their
views and responded to the questions of the
Cornmrssion and ItS staff In addition, numerous letters of comment and other matenals
were received In connection With these hearmqs. At the end of the fiscal year, the Comrrussron was evaluating this mformanon to
determine whether NSCC's application for
registration as a cleanng agency should be
granted or denied.

Registration and RegUlation of
Transfer Agents
Section 17A(c) of the Exchange Act, which
became effective on December 1, 1975, requires a transfer agent to become registered
With ItS appropnate regulatory agencyl02 If It
acts as a transfer agent for any security
registered under Section 12 of the Act or for
any secunty which would be registrable but
for the exemptions from registration for secunties of registered
Investment
companies
(Section 12(g)(2)(B)), or for secunnes ISSUed
by
Insurance
companies
(Sectron
12(g)(2)(G)). A transfer agent becomes reqis-

19

tered thirty days after Its apphcaaon for registration IS received by the appropriate regulatory agency, unless the agency accelerates,
denies or postpones registration In accordance with Section 17A(c) of the Act.
In October 1975, acting In cooperation with
the Federal bank regulatory aqenctes, the
Commission adopted Exchange Act Rule
17Ac2-1 and Form TA-1 on which transfer
agents are to register with the CornrrusSlon.103 The three bank regulatory agencies
SImultaneouslyadopted a Similar rule and the
identical registration form for transfer agents
required to register with those agencies.
Thereafter, approximately 2,400 transfer
agents registered with the Commission and
the Federal bank regulatory aqencres. In order to provide the Commission and the bank
regulators with a central repository of readily
accessible information concerning registered
transfer agents, the Commission has irunated
a program to maintain In rts automated data
retneval systems the Information contained In
those registration forms.
As the fiscal year progressed, the Commission's staff Visited several bank, non-bank
and Issuer transfer agents located In various
parts of the country to review their capabilities and performance standards. On the baSIS
of Information obtained through the reglstrabon process and the staff's contacts With
transfer agents, and after consulting With the
bank regulators,I04 the Oommrssion on May
12, 1976, published for comment proposed
rules under Section 17A(d) of the Exchange
Act pertaining to certificate tumaround time,
reporting requirements related thereto, response time for confirmation requests, and
record-keeping requirements for registered
transfer agents.105 At the end of the fiscal
year, the Commission was evaluating the
comments of Interested members of the public concerning these proposals.

Street Name StUdy
Section 12(m) of the Exchange Act, added
by the 1975 Amendments, directs the Commission to conduct a study of the practice of
recording the ownership of securities In other
than the name of the benencralowner of such
secunnes (the "Street Name Study"), and to
determine whether this practice IS consistent
WIth the purposes of the Act, and whether
20

steps can be taken to facilitate communications between Issuers and the beneficial owners of their secunnes while retaining the benefits of the practice.
DUringthe fall of 1975, the staff conducted
extensive research Into both the historical
background of street name registration and
the scope of ItSuse today. Comments regardIng the effect of this practice on appropnate
disclosure of the benenoat ownership of corporate secunnes and on Issuer-shareholder
communications were solicited from the Industry and Interested members of the public
through field Interviews and by Commission
release.106 The Oornrrussion's findings were
Incorporated Into a Preliminary Reportw?
which was submitted to Congress on December 4, 1975. The preliminary report sets forth
the the Commission's findings on the tnstory
and prevalence of street name regIstration
and seven proposals about Improving Issuershareholder communications.
DUring the second phase of the Street
Name Study, the Ocmrmssron set out to
gather statistical data enabling It to construct
an empirical model of the current system of
transmitting Issuer-shareholder commurucanons through interrnedranes, and to evaluate
the efficiency, shortcomings, cost, and cost
drstnbunon of this system. To that end, the
Commission decided to conduct a survey
which would monitor the activities of Issuers,
financial intermediaries, and shareowners
during the months of March, April, May, and
June, the period commonly referred to as the
"proxy season," dunnq wruch most publicly
held companies conduct their shareholders'
meetings
The Commission considered conducting a
survey which would focus upon one or more
past proxy seasons, but numerous interviews
led the Cornmrssronto conclude that much of
the needed information would not be available on an historical baSIS.Because the survey questionnaires could not be returned and
evaluated prior to the date speofied In Section 12(m) for the subrrussronof the Commission's final report to Congress, the Commission had to request a six-month extension of
the Study's June 4, 1976 subrmssron deadline.
In furtherance of the survey, the Commission sent approximately 100,000 quesnonnaires to shareowners. Then, after clearance

by the General Accounting Office pursuant to
the Federal Reports Act, Interrelated questionnaires were sent to 140 brokers, 180
banks, and 195 Issuers. As the fiscal year
closed, the responses to the Commission's
questionnaires were being processed and
evaluated for the formulation of Its final conclusions and recommendations.
In addition to Its empirical study of the
Issuer-shareholder communications process,
the Commission's staff has continued to research and analyze other aspects of street
name registration. Upon completion, the
Oomrmssron will formulate its final conclusions and recommendations and present ItS
report to Congress.

Lost and Stolen Securities
The 1975 Amendments evidence a
congressional determination to create a centralized scheme for dealing Withthe disruptive
effects of the loss, theft or counterfeiting of
secunnss, Section 17(1)(1) of the Exchange
Act, added in 1975, directs the Commission
to formulate a program for the reporting of
missing, lost, counterfeit and stolen secunties, and to establish rules for making inquiry
With respect to securities coming into the
possession or control of certain nnaneal institutions to determine whether such secunnes
have been reported as missing, lost, counterfeit or stolen. Congress directed the Commission to balance the benefits of mandating
inquiry In any specinc Situation against the
resultant costs and Impact on efficient business practices, and to avoid affecting the
status of bona fide purchasers In a manner
unjustifiably disruptive of normal commercial
transactions. lOB
In January 1976,109the Commission published for pubhc comment proposed Secunties EXchange Act Rule 17f-1 and a proposed Lost and Stolen Secuntles Program If
adopted, Rule 17f-1 would require enumerated persons, Including national secunnes
eXchanges and their members, other brokers
and dealers, members of the Federal Reserve System and FDIC Insured banks, to
report all incidents of missing, lost, counterfeit
or stolen sscunues to an "appropnate instrumentality." The "appropnate instrumentality"
is defined by proposed Rule 17f-1(a)(2) as
any Federal Reserve Bank or Branch thereof
With respect to Government or agency IS-

sues, and the Commission With respect to all
other secunnes. Furthermore, proposed Rule
17f-1(c) would require institutions subject to
the rule to make Inquiry With respect to all
securities coming Into their possession or
keeping, unless the secunty was received
from the Issuer, from another institution subject to the rule, or from a regular customer
where the securities are registered to such
customer and the size and nature of the
transaction are not inconsistent With past
transactions With the same customer.
Dunng the public comment penod, at the
staff's request, members of the secunnes and
banking Industries conducted Impact studies
to determine the number of reports and InqUlnes which would be generated by proposed
Rule 17f-1 The Commission IS In the process of evaluating the findings of these Impact
studies and the numerous comments received, and expects to complete action on
the Lost and Stolen Secunnes Program, including the adoption of Rule 17f-1 and the
design and establishment of a system to
process reports and inquiries under the rule,
dunng the new fiscal year

Fingerprinting of Securities
Professionals
Congressional mqumes and Oornrnissron
analyses Indicated that one of the factors
contributing to the increase in securities
thefts was the Inability to Identify secunty nsk
employees
Section 17(1)(2) of the Exchange Act, enacted In 1975, provides that every partner,
director, officer, and employee of every member of a national securities exchange, as well
as broker-dealer, registered transfer agent
and registered cleanng agency shall be fingerpnnted and shall submit, or cause to be
submitted, such flngerpnnts to the Attorney
General of the United States for Identification
and appropnate processing The Commission
ISgiven authonty to exempt certain classes of
persons from these requirements In a manner
consistent With the public Interest and the
protection of Investors
In November 1975,110the Commission ISsued proposed Exchange Act Rule 17f-2 for
public comment. The rule was Intended to
Implement the congressional desire to fingerprint all persons engaged in the sale of
securities, haVing access to securities or
21

monies or onqmal books and records relating
thereto, or supervising persons engaged In
such activities and to exempt those who do
not The rule was adopted In final form on
March 16, 1976,111 to become effective JUly
1, 1976, as to persons entenng the secunnes
Industry after that date, and for persons already employed by or associated with entities
subject to the rule until January 1, 1977
The rule IS Intended to require the fingerpnnnnq of only those persons engaged In the
sale of secuntres, having access to secunlies
or monies or onqmal books and records relatIng thereto, or supervising persons engaged
In such acnvmes For Instance, In the case of
a registered transfer agent, the rule requires
the fmqerpnntmq of only those persons engaged In or having access to "transfer agent

acnvrties "
The rule requires organizations subject to
the Act to file a statement descnbmq those
classes of persons meeting the conditions for
exemption In addition, flngerpnnt record retenbon requirements are found In Rule 17f2(d), as well as In companion amendments to
Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4, the Commission's
recordkeepinq
and preservation
requirements
In order to avoid unnecessary requlatory
duplication, Rule 17f-2(b) provides that persons whose flngerpnnts are submitted to the
Attomey General for Identification and appropnate processing pursuant to other federal,
state or agency law, rule, or regulation may
satisfy the fingerprinting
requirements
by
compliance with such other requirement Thrs
provisron encompasses employees of banks
which submit fingerprints for Identification and
procsssmq to the FBI, the desiqnated agent
of the Attorney General for flngerpnnt idennfrcalion, and persons submitting fingerprints to
the FBI pursuant to state regulations In Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, the Drstrrct of Columbia, Idaho, New Jersey, and New York
To Iacihtate the transmittal of fingerprint
records, the rule provides an exemption for
persons whose fingerprints are submitted to
the Attorney General through a self-regulatory organization pursuant to a plan filed by
the self-regulatory organization and approved
by the Comrrnssron By the close of the fiscal
year, the Commission had approved plans
submitted
by SIX national
securities
exchanges and the NASD

Registration and RegUlation of
Securities Information Processors
The leglslalive history of the 1975 Amendments evidences conqressronal concern over
the mechanisms
whereby Information concerning transactions In securities IS disseminated throughout
the secunnes
markets
Congress observed that connnumq debate
over the Cornmrssron's authority to foster the
development of composite last sale and quotation systems could only delay Implementation of the communications
systems necessary for the natronal market system, and
consequently determined to make clear the
Cornrrusston's authonty over such systems
and the ennnes responsible for their maintenance 112
Trus determination was embodied In a new
Section 11A(b) to the Exchange Act Trus
provisron effectively requires "secunnes mtormatron processors" to register With the Comrrussron. and directs the Cornrrnssron to permit the registration of only those processors
found capable of assuring the prompt, accurate and reliable performance of the functions
of a secunties Information processor
SUbject to the Cornrmssron's authonty to
adopt a contrary rule, Section 11A(b) requires
only "exclusive"
securities Information processors to register The term "exclusive processor" IS defined by Section 3(a)(22)(B) of
the Act to Include any securities information
processor
or self-regulatory
organization
wrnch, on behalf of a registered
national
securities exchange or associanon (or on ItS
own behalf, If the processor IS a self-regulator), engages on an exclusive baSIS In the
processing
of Information
With respect to
transactions
or quotations
on an effected
registered national secunnes exchange, or
distributed through any electroruc system operated or conducted by the NASD
In September
1975, the Cornrrussron
adopted 113a registration procedure for exclusive processors consisnnq of Rule 11Ab2-1
and related Form SIP Completion of Form
SIP requires the subrmssron of detailed intormatron regarding the organizational structure,
operational
capability
and functions
performed by the applicant After thrs Information
has been filed WIth the Cornrrussron, a notice
of the filing IS published and Interested persons are given an opporturuty to comment

22

-.".

Finally, within ninety days of the date of
publication of such notice (or within a longer
penod to which the applicant consents), the
Commission must by order grant registration
or institute proceedings to determine whether
registration
should be denied
In granting
registration, the Commission must find, pursuant to Section 11A(b)(3), that the processor
has the orqaruzanon and capacity to perform
ItS functions In a prompt, accurate and reliable manner, to comply with the provrsions of
Section 11A(b) and any rules promulgated
thereunder, to function In a manner consistent with the purposes of Section 11A(b) and,
Insofar as the applicant acts as an exclusive
processor, to operate fairly and effrcrently
As of the close of the fiscal year, the
Commission had received four applications
for registration as secuntres information processors, and had granted registration to the
Consolidated Tape ASsociation ("CTA"), the
Options Pnce Reporting Authonty ("OPRA"),
and the Secunties Industry Automation Corporation ("SIAC"),
each of these entities
being exclusive secuntres Information processors 114The Commission also had temporarIly exempted, pursuant to ItS authonty under
Section 11A(b)( 1) of the Act, NASDAQ, Inc
from reglstratlon,115 pending a review of ItS
application for registration which IS expected
to be completed early In the new fiscal year
In addition, the Commission received applications for exemption from registration from
Bunker Ramo Corporation ("Bunker Ramo"),
PC
Service Corporation
("PCSC"),
and
Quotron Systems, Inc ("Quotron")
These
applications were granted,116 subject to certain conditions Imposed pursuant to Section
11 A(b)(1) of the Act As to Quotron and
PCSC, their exemptive orders were conditroned
on
compliance
with
Section
11A(b)(5)(A) of the Act (and any rules thereunder) regarding prohibitions
or limitations
of access to their information services Further, Quotron and PCSC were obliged to
conform to Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(b) of the
Act (and any rules thereunder), relating to the
dissemination
of panodic reports and the
maintenance of appropnate records for examination by the Commission and other regulatory bodies Finally, as to Bunker Ramo,
which previously acted as an exclusive processor on behalf of the National Association
of Secunnes Dealers, Inc ("NASD") In oper-

annq the NASDAQ system, the Commission
conditioned
exemption on Bunker Ramo's
compliance with Section 17(b) of the Act (and
any rules thereunder),
Insofar as Bunker
maintained
records relating to ItS performance as an exclusive processor for the
NASD
The Commission
has also published for
public comment
proposed
Exchange
Act
Rules 11Ab2-2, 11Ab2-3, and 11Ab5-1.117
Proposed Rule 11Ab2-2 would require an
annual subrmssron of current information by
registered secuntras mforrnanon processors
In order to update Information previously furnished on Form SIP Proposed Rule 11Ab2-3
would establish a procedure for mamtammq
continuity of registration, for a limited penod,
where an entity succeeds to or continues the
business of a registered processor Without
having first completed the registration procedure required by Rule 11Ab2-1. Finally, proposed Rule 11Ab5-1 would require that a
registered secuntres Information processor
give notice to the Commission (and any aggneved party) of any prohibition or hrrutanon
of access to the services offered by the
registrant Trus rule would Implement the notice
procedure
set
forth
In Section

publiC

Commission Rates
Section 6(e)(3) of the 1975 Amendments
obligates the Commission to keep Itself and
Congress abreast of significant events dunng
the transition
to negotiated
commission
charges The first rnorutonnq report was presented to Congress on December 1, 1975,
and covered the penod beginning May 1,
1975 (the advent of negotiated cornnussron
rates) and ending August 31, 1975118 The
report presented an analysis of the Impact of
unfixed rates on comrmssion charges by customer type Additional analyses Included capsule financial Information for various types of
New York Stock Exchange member firms and
financial summanes for all self-regulatory orgamzatlons Also Included were analyses relaling to the "quality of the market"
The first report was subsequently followed

23

by two addmonal and more refined reports to
Congress, dated March 29, 1976,119 and
August 10, 1976,120which covered the Impact of naqotrated cornmrssron charges
through March 31, 1976. In addition to the
analysis In the Commission's first report,
these reports Included a more In-depth analySISof the factors affecting secuntres oomrrussions, a detailed analysis of the financial
results for different types of broker-dealers
and for the first time, an analysis of the
financial results of Regional and Over-TheCounter Broker-Dealers
From the inception of negotiated cornmrssion charges to the end of March 31, 1976,
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) member
firms received an estimated $335 7 million
less than they would have received under the
fixed comrrnssron rate schedule applicable
Immediately pnor to May 1, 1975 (assuming
equivalent market activity) Thrs revenue foregone amounted to roughly 11.7 percent of
cornrrnssronrevenues and 5.8 percent of total
revenues received by NYSE member firms
dUringthe May 1975-through-March 1976 penod
Commission discounts neqotrated by public
customers from the pre-May fixed commission rate schedule moved from 7.0 percent In
the second quarter of 1975 to 13.0 percent In
the fourth quarter The average discount declined to 12 3 percent dunng the first quarter
of 1976 This downward dnft was attnbuted to
Increased retarl customer activity rather than
a change In competitive pressures Commission discounts received by Institutional customers were greater than those received by
Individual customers. Measured as a percent
of order value, institutional commrsslons In
March 1976 were approximately 35 percent
below the pre-May 1 comrrussion level, whrle
the same companson for mdivrdual customers revealed a two percent decline from
the pre-May level. When measured In terms
of cornrrussronsper share, commissions for
msntunons and individuals were 30 percent
and 6 percent lower In March 1976 than April
1975, respectively While mdivrduals received
reduced comrmssions on medium to large
size orders, they paid slightly higher commissions on their small orders (less than 200
shares). On the other hand, institutions received substantially reduced commissions on
all SIzesof orders
24

Not unexpectedly, the discounts granted to
institutional customers had their greatest Impact on the fmancral results of NYSE member
firms speciahzmq In mstnunonet business As
a consequence, institutional firms, as a
group, received less than 70 percent of securities comrrussronsthey would have received
under the rate schedule In effect prior to May
1, 1975 Other groups also regIstered declines In secunties commrssrons over the
eleven months follOWingMay 1, 1975, but not
to the degree experienced by institutional
firms. The introduction of competitive comrnrssrons does not appear to have seriously
Impaired the operating results of RegIonal
and Over-The-Counter Broker-Dealers. Negotiated cornmrssron charges do not appear
to have negatively Influenced the operating
results, nor have they Significantly affected
the hquidrty or volatility of securities markets.

Use of Commission Payments by
Fiduciaries
Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act was
added In 1975 to assure fiducrarres that,
under a system of competitive commission
rates, they might use reasonable busrness
Judgment In selecting brokers and causing
accounts under management to pay commissions Section 28(e) provides generally that a
money manager does not breach nducrary
duties under State or Federal law solely by
reason of hrs causing accounts under management to pay brokerage comrrussrons In
excess of the amount another broker-dealer
would have charged If the manager determines In good faith that the comrmssron IS
reasonable In relation to the value of brokerage and research services received.
In March 1976, the Commission called attention to practices that appeared to be developing In the payment of brokerage comrrnssions by frducrary money managers The
Cornrrussron noted In particular that some
frducranes appeared to be usrnq their beneficranes' commissions to obtain products and
services which are readily and customarily
available and offered to the general public on
a commercial baSIS In addition, the Commission noted, fiducranes appeared In some instances to be asking that brokers pay all their
operating expenses In return for comrmssrons
directed to those brokers It also appeared

that tlducrenes were In some cases asking
the broker, retained to effect a transaction for
the account of a beneficiary, to "give up" part
of the commission negotiated by the broker
and the fiduciary to another broker designated by the fiduciary for whom the executing
or dearing broker IS not a normal and legitimate correspondent.
The Commission stated that It did not beheve Section 28(e) would apply to those
types of arrangements. At the same time, the
Commission noted, while Section 28(e)
might, under appropnate Circumstances, be
applicable to situations where a broker provides a money manager With research produced by third parnes, the money manager
should be prepared to demonstrate the required good faith In connection Withthe transaction. The Commission cautioned, moreover, that some of the practices and arrangements that had been brought to ItS attention
might constitute fraudulent acts and practices
by fiducranes and that brokers should recognize that their compliance With any direcnon
or suggestion by a fiduciary which would
appear to Involve a Violation of the flducrary's
duty to ItS oenenoanes could Implicate them
In a course of conduct Violating the antifraud
provisions of the Federal secuntres laws. 121

Arab Boycott
Early In 1975, there were widespread reports of the Arab boycott against persons
dOing business With, or sympatheuc to, the
state of Israel. The Cornrnissrontook a number of actions to determine the extent of
Involvement In the boycott by persons subject
to ItS regulation and to uncover any possible
Violations of the Federal secunties laws.
From the outset, the Commission expressed
ItSVIewthat the Issues presented by the Arab
boycott are serious matters, and that It
strongly condemns participation In such boycotts by American citizens and enterprises
On November 20, 1975, the Ocmrrussron
published a release stating that drscnrnmatory practices engaged In by persons subject
to ItS regulation would not be tolerated. 122
The possibrhty of Violations of the Federal
securities laws was raised most prominently
In connection With reports early In 1975 of
Arab requests that American brokers and
dealers exclude boycotted brokerage firms
from underwntlng syndicates formed for the

distribution of secunnes Since such reports
surfaced, It has been the Cornrmssron's view
that the best way to safeguard against such
dlscnrmnatory practices IS for the National
ASSOCiation of Securities Dealers, Inc.
("NASD"), of which most American Investment banking firms are members, to take
Initial responstbihty for precautionary measures Under the law, the NASD has responsibility for Insunng that ItS members' conduct IS
consistent With Just and equitable pnnciples
of trade 123
The Commission requested the NASD to
rnorutor closely the composition of ItS members' underwriting syndicates for indications
of possible drscnrrunatory practices and, In
December 1975, the NASD submitted to the
Cornrmssion a report of ItS rnorntonnq program and subsequent investigation On the
baSISof the NASD's report and the Commission's own Informal Inquiries, It appears that
there have been no successful attempts to
exclude on a discnrrnnatory baSISany person
from an underwriting of securmes registered
With the Comrrussion. The NASD did, however, present evidence of two successful attempts by Arab Interests to obtain the exclusion of boycotted Investment banking firms
from parncipanon In offerings of securities
which took place outside the United States
and which were not required to be registered
Withthe Commission As a result of ItS investigation, the NASD In July 1976 took drseptnary action aqamst two of ItS member firms
on the baSISof their cooperation With Arabrelated firms In precluding boycotted firms
from offshore underwntmqs In addition, the
NASD Issued a notice cautioning all ItS members against Involvement In such discnrnmatory practices

section 31(b) Review
Section 31(b) of the 1975 Amendments
authorizes the Cornrrussron, at any time
Within one year of the effective date of any
amendment made by the 1975 Amendments
to the Exchange Act, to notify any national
secunnes exchange or national securities assooauon of the respects In which ItS organization or rules are not In comphance With the
Act as amended. The Commission IS authorized, at any time after 180 days follOWing
receipt of such notification, to suspend the
registration of any such exchange or assoo a25

non or to Impose limitations on Its activities,
functions or operations If the Comrrussron
finds, after notice and opportunity for heanng
that ItS rules or organization stili fall to conform to the Act Any such suspensron or
limitation continues In effect until the Comrrussron, by order, declares that such exchange or assocanon IS In compliance with
the Act's requirements.
Dunng the fiscal year, the Cornrmssron's
staff conducted an intensive review of the
constitutions and rules of the several selfregulatory organizations
Particular attention
was devoted to self-regulatory requirements
In those areas most affected by the 1975
Amendments, such as membership and access restncnons, trnancral responsibility reqinrernents, and rules limiting or condmorunq
the ability of brokers and dealers to ulihze the
services of registered clearing agencies or
registered secuntres mtorrnatron processors
Early In the new fiscal year, the Comrmssion
expects to be In a POSition to transmit appropriate notification to each of the self-regulators In accordance With Section 31 (b) of the
Act.

DISCLOSURE RELATED
MATTERS

Ulegal and Questionable
Corporate Payments
On May 12, 1976, the Cornrrussron submitted to the Senate Banking, HOUSing and
Urban Affairs Committee the "Report of the
Secuntres and Exchange Commission
on
Questionable and Illegal Corporate Payments
and Practices"
The report provides a detailed analysis of information about Illegal or
questionable foreign payments contained In
public documents filed With the Cornrrussion
The report Indicates that common among
almost all of the cases reviewed by the
Cornrrussron was the apparent failure of the
system of corporate accountability to assure
a proper accounting of the use of corporate
funds, and to assure that documents filed
With the Commission and Circulated to shareholders do not omit or misrepresent matenal
facts Millions of dollars of funds were Inaccurately recorded In corporate books and
records to tacihtate the making of questionable payments
Falsrncanon of records, although known to corporate employees and

26

often to top management,
was often concealed from outside auditors and counsel and
from outside directors.
The report states that the pnmary thrust of
the Commission's actions has been to restore
the ettrcrency of the system of corporate
accountability and to encourage the boards of
directors to exercise their authonty. To !hIS
end the Commission has sought Independent
review of past disclosure In ItS enforcement
acaons and In ItS voluntary disclosure program
In broad terms, the Cornrrussron's voluntary
disclosure program, Which IS administered by
the DIVISion of Corporation Finance, requires
a company which believes that It may have a
disclosure problem With respect to questionable or Illegal acnvmes promptly to take the
follOWing steps:
1 Authonze a careful In-depth mvesnqanon
of the facts by persons not Involved In the
acnvmes In question,
2 Have the board of directors Issue an
appropriate policy statement about transactions mvolvrnq Illegal or questionable acnvities, or reiterate any relevant, preexistmq
policy statement;
3 Consider whether interim public drsdosure of the results should be made pnor to
completion of the investigation; and
4 At the conclusion of the Investigation, file
a final report of matenal facts With the Comrmssron, generally on Form 8-1<. Companies
In the voluntary disclosure program can make
disclosures Without pnor consultation With the
Cornrmssron's staff and Without Jeopardizing
their parnopanon In the program They can,
however, seek the Informal views of the Commission Itself concerning the appropnate diSclosure of certain matters
In order to restore the integrity of the
disclosure system and to make corporate
to their
ottrcials
more fully accountable
boards of directors and shareholders,
the
Commission's baSIC approach has been. (1)
To Insure that Investors and shareholders
receive rnatenal facts necessary to make
Informed Investment decrsions and to assess
the quality of management; and (2) To establish a climate In which corporate management and the protessionals that advise them
become fUlly aware of these problems and
deal With them In an effective and responsible
manner

Advisory Committee on Corporate
Disclosure
On February 2, 1976, Chairman Hills announced the appomtment of an Advisory
Committee on Corporate Disclosure to be
chaired by then Commissioner, A. A Sommer, Jr. 124The function of the sixteen-member panel IS to define the purposes and
objectives of a corporate disclosure system,
to assess the present system m light of those
objectives, to assess the costs of the present
system and to weigh those costs against the
benefits It produces, and to recommend to
the Commission any changes It may consider
necessary or appropnate to bnng the operation of the disclosure system administered by
the Commission closer to those objecbves
The Committee's work mcludes Identlfymg
the users of the Information available rn the
corporate disclosure system, the users'
sources of Information, the parbcular Items of
Information which are of crucial Importance to
users, and the cost to companies of providing
this information. To answer these and related
questions, the Advisory Committee ISsurveyIng approximately 30 publicly-owned companies, 120 nnanoat analysts, 60 portfolio managers and 8,000 mdtvrdual investors The
Advisory Committee anticipates that when
the data from the survey IS analyzed the
Committee Will have the first clear and complete picture of the operation of the disclosure
system and that this new understandmg WIll
serve as a baSISfor the Committee's recommendations to the Commission
The Committee IS also sohcrtmq position
papers from over one hundred trade assooanons and the public at large on a vanety of
disclosure Issues 125The followmg specific
tOPiCSare among those on which positron
papers are being sought idennfrcanonof the
objecbves of a corporate disclosure system;
the feasibility of defining more precisely the
"matenality" standard under the federal secunues laws, Identification of any need for Increased disclosure of forward-looking and
soft mtormanon, Identification of any need for
mcreased disclosure of environmental and
SOCIally-Significantmatters and the cntena to
be applied In making such a determination,
statement of the role of the differential disdosure concept In the SEC's mandated disclosure system; and recommendations for irn-

provement of the shareholder suffrage process.
A tmal report Incorporating recommendations to the Oornrrussion IS expected on or
before July 1, 1977

Projections
On Apnl 23, 1976, the Commission published for comment proposed GUides 62 and
4, "Disclosure of Projacnons of Future Economic Performance," of the GUides for the
Preparation and Filing of Registration Statements under the Secunnes Act of 1933 and
of the GUidesfor the Preparation and Filing of
Reports and Proxy and Registration Statements under the Secunties Exchange Act of
1934, respectively 126The Commission also
announced the adopnon of an amendment to
Exchange Act Rule 14a-9, and the Withdrawal of the other rule and form proposals
relatmg to projections of future economic performance and to changes In control of a
registrant which were published for comment
on Apn128, 1975,127to Implement the "Statement by the Commission on the Disclosure of
Projections of Future Economic Performance "128
The proposed GUides set forth the views of
the Commission's DIVISionof Corporation FInance on the disclosure of projections m
Comrrussron fllmgs In particular, the GUides
address three Important considerations related to the preparation and disclosure of
projections (1) that management have a reasonable baSISfor ItS projections, (2) that the
projections be presented In an appropriate
format, and (3) that the accompanymg drsclosures tacihtate Investor understanding of the
baSISfor, and Iimltallons of projections The
proposed GUides are not rules of the Commrssion nor are they published as beanng the
Commission's offtcral approval. They represent polices and practices followed by the
DIVISionof Corporation Finance In administerIng the disclosure requirements of the federal
secunnes laws
The staff presently IS considennq the comments received on the proposed gUides.
In announcing these actions, the Commission expressed ItSgeneral views on the Inclusion of projections In Cornrrussron filings
Among other things, the Cornrmssron noted
that, at least until February of 1973, ItS long
27

standing policy generally not to permit projections In Commission filings may have served
as an Impediment to the disclosure of projections to Investors
The Commission
also
noted that Investors appear to want management's assessment of a company's future
performance and that some managements
may WIsh to furnish their projections through
Cornrrussron filings Accordingly, the Commission announced that It Will not object to
disclosure In filings with the Commission of
projections which are made In good faith and
have a reasonable basts, provided that they
are presented In an appropriate format and
accompanied by mtormatron adequate to enable Investors to make their own judgments
The Commission also expressed the view
that reasonably based and adequately presented projections should not subject Issuers
to liability under the Federal secunnes laws,
even If the projections prove to be In error.
In light of thrs change of policy, the Commission amended Exchange Act Rule 14a9129 to delete the reference to predictions of
earnings as being possibly misleading In certain Situations
Finally, the Commission indicated that It IS
not encouraging the making or filing of projecnons because of the diversity of views on
their Importance and reliability and noted that
trus Issue, together With the question of
whether a "safe-harbor" rule for projections IS
needed, may be among those appropnately
considered by ItS AdVISOry Committee on
Corporate Disclosure

Beneficial Ownership
On August 25, 1975, the Commission announced various proposals relating to the
disclosure of beneficial owners and holders of
record of voting secuntres 130 These proposals were partly the result of public heanngs
conducted by the Commission In the fall of
1974 concerning beneficial ownersrnp, takeovers, acquis.nons and other related matters 131
The August proposals Included proposed
rules and amendments
under Sections 13
and 14 of the Exchange Act which would,
among other things, (1) provrde standards for
determination of beneficial ownership for purposes of those sectrons, (2) require additional
disclosure In Schedule 13D acquisitron statements about beneficial owners and the nature

28

and extent of their ownership, (3) provide a
short form acquismon notice to be used by
certain persons acquiring secunties In the
ordinary course of their business and not for
purposes of control; and (4) provide an exemption from the filing requirements of Section 13( d)( 1) for certain underwriters
who
acqinre securities In the ordinary course of a
firm commitment underwriting
In addrtron, the proposals would amend
various registration and reporting forms requmnq disclosure of pnnopal security holders, as well as Schedule 14A, Information
Required In Proxy Statement, to require diSclosure In such forms, to the extent known by
the filing company, of (1) bsneucrat owners of
more than five percent of any class of voting
securities and the nature of their ownership;
(2) the aggregate amount and nature of benefiCial ownership by officers and directors, of
each class of voting secunties of the Issuer or
any of ItS parents or subsidranes, and (3) the
30 largest holders of record of each class of
voting securities (With an exception for persons holding less than 1/10 of 1% of the
outstanding secuntres of the class) and their
vonnq authority and underlying voting authorrty, If known
The onqinal comment penod on the proposals was to expire on November 3D, 1975,
however, upon request. the Oornrrussron extended the penod to January 2, 1976. Dunng
that time, the Commission
received more
than 225 letters of comment from Interested
persons, including,
members of Congress
and representatives of the securities Industry,
the legal protession, publicly-held companies,
and Institutional and mdivrdual Investors. DurIng May 1976, the staff of the DIVISion of
Corporation Finance completed an extensive
review and analysis of the letters of comment
and submitted ItS recommendations
on the
proposals to the Commission At the close of
the fiscal year the Commission was considerIng the DIVISion's recommendations

Communications with Beneficial
Owners
(Proposed Rule 14b-1)
On August 25, 1975, the Commission sohcited comments on a proposed new Rule 14b1 under the Exchange Act dealing With the
obligations of registered brokers to forward
certain cornrnurucatrons to benefrcral owners

of secuntles.132 If adopted, proposed Rule
14b-1 would require a registered broker (1)
to respond promptly, by means of a search
card or otherwise, to mqumes by Issuers
about how many of the broker's customers
are beneficial owners of the Issuer's secunties held of record by the broker or Its nominees, and (2) upon receipt of a sufficient
number of proxy statements and annual reports to secunty holders and assurances that
Its reasonable expenses would be paid by the
Issuer, to forward such matenals In a timely
manner to such customers As an alternative
to complying WIththe foregOing obligations, a
registered broker would be permitted to furnish an Issuer with a list of the customers
provided that the broker also furnish authonzatron to vote such secunnes In accordance
WIthInstructions of the customer.
The comment penod on the proposed rules
expired November 30, 1975. The comrrnssion's Divrsron of Market Regulation IS considennq the comments received on the proposals In connection with the Commission's
"Street Name Study" mandated by the Secunnes Act Amendments of 1975.133

Tender Offers
As a further result of the Commission's
public hearings on takeovers and acqursitlons,l34 the Cornmrssron published for comment proposed rules and schedules under
the Exchange Act, which, If adopted, would
provide specific disclosure and drsserrunanon
requirements, additional substantive regulatory protections and other regulations with
respect to certain cash tender offers and
stock-for-stock exchange offers
The rules and schedules represent the
Commission's first comprehensive rulemakIng proposals under the Williams Act with
respect to tender offers. Among other things,
all tender offers would be required to be open
for at least fifteen busmsss days after their
commencement and for at least ten business
days from the announcement of any Increase
In the offered consrderanon or the dealer's
soliCitingfee.
A proposed Tender Offer Statement,
Schedule 14D-1, would require a bidder to
disdose, among other things, edcmonel mtorrnanon regarding its source of funds and ItS
plans and proposals (regardless of whether It
IS seeking control) and, for the first time,

would speciftcally require disclosure of ItS
past relationships and negotiations With the
subject company whose secuntrss are being
sought and disclosure of nnancral statements
and other data when matenal A proposed
Recommendation Statement Schedule 1404, would require a subject company or any
other person recommending for or against a
tender offer to descnbe, among other things,
any actual or potential conflict of Interest
A proposed dissemination rule would permit a bidder to communicate ItS cash tender
offer by means of long form publication
which IS currently used In connection With
most cash tender offers, summary publication
provided that such an advertisement contains
a minimum amount of Information and Indicates how complete information might be
readily obtained, or mailings to all stockholders listed on the stockholders' list, which
would be available under the Commission's
rules If certain conditions are met
The Commission's proposals would extend
the present seven-day Withdrawal nghts to
ten business days, would provide additional,
limited Withdrawal rights In the event of a
competing tender offer, and would permit a
bidder to accept any shares deposited on a
pro-rata baSISthroughout the life of a tender
offer
Finally, the proposals would Integrate all
purchases of the subject company's secunties by the bidder Within forty business days
after a tender offer With the offer, would
require a bidder to Issue a status report
whenever It extends the tender offer, and
would require a bidder to pay the offered
consrderanon or return the secunnes deposited WIthinten busrness days after the termination of a tender offer
The penod for written views and comments
on the proposals expires September 30,
1976

Proposals to Amend Registration
Forms
Proposed Amendments
to Forms S-7 and
S-16 and Proposal to Resctna Form S-9-

On July 26, 1976, the Commission proposed
amendments to Forms S-7 and 5-16 and
announced a proposal to rescind Form 5-9
under the Securities Act 135 The proposals
would substantially relax the conditions for
usmq Forms 5-7 and 8-16,'36 thus making
29

these short registration forms available to a
larger number of Issuers which are subject to
the reporting requirements of the Exchange
Act 137 Form 8-7 also would be made available for the registration of securrnes to be
offered In exchange for other securmes, as
well as for cash In addition, certain of the
disclosure Items of Forms S-7 and S-16
would be amended to require additional disclosure If there has been a change of the
registrant
Issuers usmq Forms S-7 and S-16 are
permitted to omit from the S-7 prospectus, or
to Incorporate by reference In the S-16 prospectus, certain Information already provided
to security holders or available to Investors In
reports filed under the Exchange Act Thus,
the proposed amendments reflect recent Improvements In the nature and extent of Information required to be Included In reports and
proxy and Information statements under that
Act, and the Increased availability of such
information to the investing public
The Cornrrussron also proposed to rescind
Form S-9, a form presently available for
Secunnes Act registration of non-convertible
fixed-interest
debt secuntres by certain ISsuers, since the proposed amendments to
Form S-7 would make that form available to
the relatively small number of Issuers presently usmq Form S-9
The comment penod on these proposals
expires on September 27, 1976
Form 8-8 and Rule 457 -In July 1976, the
Commission published for comment certain
proposed amendments to Form S-8138 and
simultaneously withdrew an earlier proposal
to amend that form 139 The proposed amendments would expand the availability of the
form for secunties offered and sold pursuant
to certain employee-benefit plans and would
rescind ItS use for reolfers or resales by
persons who may be deemed underwnters
In a related matter, the Commission adopted
an amendment to Rule 457(g) concerning the
computation
of the filing fee required for
registration statements relating to stock bonus and Similar plans

Proposals to Amend and
Amendments to Certain Periodic
Reports
Proposed Amendments to Forms 8-K, 1DO and 10-K -On
July 12, 1976, the Com-

30

rrussion proposed amendments to Forms 8K, 1o-a and 10-K, which are used for current, quarterly and annual reports filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15( d) of the Exchange
Act and to the disclosure schedule for proxies
and information statements. 140 The proposed
amendments would, If adopted, provrde for
more timely filing of reports on Form 8-K, by
requmnq such reports to be filed within ten
days after the occurrence of the event reported, although registrants would be permitted an additional 60 days time within which to
file the audited financial statements required
In reports
of an acquisrtron of assets. In
addition, the proposals would decrease the
number of Items of Information required to be
Included In reports on Form 8-K by transfernng certain Items to Form 10-0 141
Present Item 9 (Options to Purchase Secuntres) would be deleted from Form 8-K, since
Similar information IS recurred to be Included
In annual reports on Form 10-K and In proxy
and information statements filed pursuant to
Section 14 of the Exchange Act
The Items remaining on Form 8-K would
be renumbered and revised to require additional information concerning changes In control of registrant and non-payment of pnncpal
or Interest on seruor secuntres A new Item,
requmnq disclosure of the appointment of a
receiver or trustee for registrant or ItS parent
In bankruptcy or receivership
proceedings,
would be added to Form 8-K
In addition, the Commission proposed to
separate the disclosure relating to matenal
Income changes of an unusual or Infrequent
nature presently reqtnred In reports on Form
8-K The proposed amendments would requrre notmcanon of such changes In reports
on Form 8-K, but the details of such events
would be disclosed In reports on Form 10-0
or Form 10-K, for fourth quarter events,
where they could be more meaningfully assessed against the financial data In such
quarterly or annual reports
In order to make It easier for users of both
Forms 10-0 and 10-K, those forms would be
revised to require that reference be made to
Items previously mentioned In 8-K reports
filed dunnq the quarter covered by the report
These proposals are Intended to provide
for more comprehensive quarterly and annual
reports, more timely reporting of events of
current Importance to Investors, reduction of

those reports filed on Form 8-K, and substantial savings to registrants and the Commission
The comment period on the proposals expires on September 15. 1976
On June 2, 1976, the Commission
proposed amendments to Forms 10-K and 100.142 to provide for a space on the cover
page of each form In which a registrant, at ItS
option, could use to Indicate ItS Intention to
file a registration statement on Form 8-7, S9 or S-16. on or before the date of ItS next
filing on either Form 10-K or Form 10-0
Receipt of such notice of Intent to file would
enable the Commission's
staff to review
promptly the annual, quarterly and current
reports filed by registrant under the Exchange
Act and, In most cases, to expedite ItS review
of the Secunnes Act registration statement,
when filed
Aaopuon of Amendments to Forms 10-0,
10-K and 12-K to Reqtnre a Statement of
Outstanding
Common Stock -On
June 8,
,1976, the Commission adopted amendments
to Forms 10-K, 12-K and 10-0 under the
Exchange Act requiring corporate Issuers to
state on the tacmq sheets to reports on those
forms the number of shares outstanding of
each class of their common stock 143 The
amendments were adopted to aid persons In
complying With the volume limitations of Rule
144 by providmq them With information upon
which those limitations frequently are based

Stockholder Proposals
Rule 14a-8 of the proxy rules sets forth the
requirements applicable to proposals submitted by secunty holders for inclusion In the
proxy sohcitmq materials of Issuers On July
7, 1976, the Comrmssion proposed to amend
that rule substantially
Among other things,
the proposed amendments would eliminate
certain shareholder
abuses that have occurred In the past, broaden the tOPiCS that
could be covered by shareholder proposals.
and formalize certain grounds for omitting
proposals that have been Implied, but not
stated, In the existmq rule 144 In a related
matter, the Comrrussron Issued a release
descnbmq and discussmq the Informal procedures employed by ItS staff With respect to
shareholder proposals which managements
have Indicated they Intend to omit from their
proxy materials 145

Stock Appreciation Rights
In connection With the reporting of msider
secuntres transactions under Section 16 of
the Exchange Act, the Cornrrussron proposed
certain amendments
to Rules 16b-3 and
16a-6(c) under the Act to Include certain
transactions
In stock apprecration
nghts
Within the transactions
which may be exempted by those rules 146The exemption for
transactions
In stock appreciation
nghts
would be available provided certain conditions are met, rncludrnq requirements relative
to the Issuer, the options and rights, and the
administration
of the plan In addition, the
proposals would Impose new conditions for
the availability of the exemption provided by
Rule 16b-3 for option, bonus, appreciation or
Similar plans

Disclosure of Environmental
Matters
On May 6, 1976, In Securities Act Release
No 5704,147 the Cornrmssron announced final action In Its rulemakinq proceeding concerning disclosure of environmental and other
soaally Significant matters That proceeding
had been Originally trutrated on February 11,
1975,148 pursuant to the order and opinion of
Judge Charles R Richey In Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc v Secunties
and Exchange Commtsston, 389 F Supp 689
(D DC, 1974) 149Judge Richey had directed
the Cornrrussron, among other things, to determine whether the Cornrmssron's exrstmq
corporate disclosure rules satisfied any applicable requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ("NEPA"), and had
recommended that the Commission compile
a "legislative-type"
record In connection With
this undertaking
After the culrnmatron of
lengthy public proceeding, the Cornrmssron,
on October 14, 1975, proposed specitrc new
rules regarding environmental disclosure 150
In Secuntres Act Release No 5704 the
Commission
announced that It had determined to adopt so much of the rule proposals
as related to the disclosure of capital expenditures for environmental
compliance
purposes The Cornrnrssron, however, concluded
that another aspect of the proposals, requirIng corporate registrants to list and make
available to shareholders environmental compliance reports filed With other agencies,
31

would not provide additional meaningful Information to Investors Interested In the environmentally significant aspects of the behavior of
registrants Moreover, the Comrrussron concluded that there was no disclosure alternative which would have provided meaningful
additional information without Imposing costs
and burdens grossly disproportionate to any
resulting benefits to Investors and the envrronment
The Natural Resources Defense Council
and the other plaintiffs In the htlgatlon which
gave nse to thrs proceeding then asserted
that the Comrrussion's rules still failed to
satisfy the requirernents of NEPA, and requested that Judge Richey order the Comrrussion to correct these alleged defrciencres
The court IS expected to rule on plaintiffs'
contentions dunng the next several months

Disclosure of Oil and Gas
Reserves
On May 12, 1976, the Commission
adopted amendments to Forms S-1 and S-7
under the Secunties Act and to Forms 10 and
10-K under the Exchange Act to require the
disclosure of all and gas reserves and to
provide definitions and classrhcatrons of the
term "reserves" 151 These amendments
make exphcrt the disclosures With respect to
all and gas reserves already required under
Forms S-1, S-7 and 10 and, for the first time,
require such disclosures to be made on an
annual basis In a report on Form 10-K In
connection with the amendment to Form 10K, GUide 2 under the Exchange Act, which
relates to disclosure of natural gas reserves,
has also been amended to make It applicable
to reserves disclosed In reports on Form 10K
The amendments adopted by the Commission are almost Identical to those which were
proposed for comment on May 30, 1975.152
They Include a requirement to dl~close reserve estimates filed With other federal or
foreign aqenoes and to explain any differences between such estimates and those
Included In flhngs With the Commission. In
response to comments received on the proposals, a requirement to disclose reserve
estimates filed With state agencies has been
deleted from the amendments, and several
32

de muumts hmltatlons have been placed on

the disclosure requirements The Commission beheves that these requirements would
have placed an unwarranted burden on registrants WIthout any corresponding benefit to
Investors Additionally, definitions or gUidance
With respect to the meaning of certain terms
(net productron, gross and net wells and
acres and undeveloped acreage) have been
Inserted for clanncauon.

Accounting Matters
Staff Accountmg
Bulletins -In November
1975, the Commission authonzed the DIVIsion of Corporation Finance and the Office of
the Chief Accountant to pubhsh a senes of
Staff Accounting Bulletms 153 to achieve a
Wider dissemination of the administrative Interpretations and practices utilized by the
Commission's staff In reviewing financial
statements The statements In the Bulletins
are not rules or interpretations of the Commissron nor do they bear the Commission's
oftrcral approval; they represent Interpretations and practices followed by the Divrsion
and the Chief Accountant In administering the
disclosure requirements of the federal seounties laws
The process of financial reporting IS dynarruc and evolutionary. Consequently, new
or revised administrative Interpretations and
practices must be Implemented In response
to changes In the reporting process. While
large accounting firms who practice before
the Commission have many opportunities to
exchange information and views With the
staff, the Commission has been concerned
about comments that small accounting firms
have fewer such opportunities and may be at
an unfair competitive disadvantage because
there has been no formal dissemination of
staff POSitions
The purpose of the Bulletms is to mitigate
these problems by making available to the
pubhc a compilation of certain existmq staff
interpretations and practices and by prOViding
a means by which new or revised Interpretations and practices can be quickly and easily
communicated to registrants and their adVISers Thus, the Bulletins should not only reduce the staff's workload by ellmlnabng repetrtrous comments and inquiries, but should

save registrants both time and money In the
registration and reporting process.
The first Bulletin (SAB No 1)154was ISsued concurrently with the announcement of
the senes and included a number of Interpretanons and practices broken down under ten
broad tOPiCheadings Eight additional SAB's
dealing with accounting matters of current
concern were ISSUedthrough June 3D, 1976.
Some of the accounting matters dealt with In
SAB's 2 through 9 were statements of pohcy
and interpretations as to disclosure and reporting practices for Real Estate Investment
Trusts, expenencmq dlfflcullJeswith loan portfollOS,155
accounting for transactions In which
Real Estate Investment Trusts transfer assets
(usually loans on real estate projects) to bank
holding cornparues In cancellation for debt
owed to them, 156amendments to Form 10-0
and Regulation S-X regarding mtenrn financial reporting,157and amendments to Regulalion S-X requmnq disclosure of Replacement
Cost data 158
Financial Reoturements for Compames In the
Development Stage-In November 1975, the

Commission amended Article 5A of Regulation S-X 159which speciftes the requuernents
for the form and content of financial statements for commercial, mdustnal and mining
companies In the promotional, exploratory or
developmental stage The amendments conformed the Commission's accounting and reporting requirernents WIth Statement No 7,
"Accounting and Reporting by Development
Stage Enterpnses," Issued by the Fmancial
Accounting Standards Board In June 1975.
The Commrssron considered that It should
revise ItSrequirements for the presentation of
hnancral statements by development stage
companressince It had previously announced
that the pronouncements of the FASB Will be
conSideredto constitute substantial authontanvs support for accounting and reporting procedures and practices used In preparrng financial statements filed WIththe Cornnussion
The proposed reVISIOnsto Regulation S-X
were Issued for public comment In July
1975 160Comments received indicated general agreement WIththe proposals.
Article 5A pnor to revision contained specIaliZed requirements for the nnancial statements of development stage cornparues, particularly for balance sheets, and stockholders'
equity Income statements were not required

of development stage companres. When
these specianzed requirernents were adopted
by the Cornrmssron, there were no authontatrve statements of the accounting protession
regarding the approprrate accounting and financial reporting directly applicable to such
companies.
The revisrons to Regulation S-X eliminated
the speoahzed financral statement requirements for companres to which Article 5A had
been applicable and for fiscal perrods beginning on or after December 26, 1975, required
that fmancral statements Issued by development stage enterprrses shall conform to generally accepted accounting pnnciples applicable to established operallng enterprrses, and
that certain additional mtormanon shall be
disclosed In the fmancial statements
Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding ComOctober 1: 1975, the Commispames-on

sion authorrzed the publication for public
comment of proposed GUides61 and 3, "Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies," of the GUides for the Preparation and
Filing of Registration Statements under the
secunties Act and of the GUides for the
Preparation and FIling of Reports and Proxy
and ReglstralJon Statements under the Exchange Act, respectively 161These GUides
are Intended to provide registrants With a
convenient reference to the statistical drsdosures sought by the staff of the DIVISionof
Corporation Finance In registration statements and other disclosure documents filed
by bank holding companres.
Durrng the comment penod, which expired
on November 3D, 1975, the Commission received comments from approximately 115
Interested parties, and the Comrrussron'sstaff
also conferred extensively With representatives of the federal bank regulatory agencies
As the fiscal year closed the staff was In the
process of making recommendations to the
Commission With respect to certain modifications In the proposed GUides, based on the
suggestions made by vanous commentators
and Intended to publish the GUides In final
form In the near future.
As the operations of bank holding companies have diversrtred, It has become increasIngly difficult for Investors to Identify the
sources of Income of such companies. And,
since various sources of Income can have a
Wide range of nsk charactenstics, Investors
33

may have difficulty assessing the future earnmqs potential of a bank holding company
wIthout detailed Information concerning the
company's sources of Income and exposure
to nsks
In prepanng the GUides, the staff has been
mindful of the Investor's need to assess uncertainties, especially through more meamngful disclosure about loan portfolios and related Items In filings by bank holding comparues In addition. many of the disclosures
suggested by the proposed GUides are intended to provide information
to tacintate
analysis and comparison of sources of Income and exposure to nsks. Thus. for example, registrants are asked to provide a breakdown of loan portfolios by type of loan Thrs
information will assist Investors to evaluate
the potential
Impact of future economic
events upon a registrant's business and earnIngs The same reasoning underlies the suggestions for disclosure of sources of funds
and sensmvtties to Interest-rate fluctuations.
Among other things. thrs information should
help Investors to evaluate the ability of a bank
holding company to move in or out of situations with favorable or unfavorable risk/return
charactensncs

Railroad Act Amendments
Pursuant to section 13(b) of the Exchange
Act, the Commission IS granted authonty to.
among other things, prescribe the appropriate
accounting methods to be used by registrants
filing reports WIth the Commission
Section
308(b) of the Railroad Revitalization
and
RegUlatory Reform Act.162 as enacted on
February 5. 1976, slgmficantly amended and
expanded thrs authonty As amended. Section 13(b) no longer specincany requires that
the Commission allow ICC regulated earners
to file reports submitted to the ICC In lieu of
the mtormauon specrned by other Commission forms In addition. Section 13(b) now
provides that Commission rules applicable to
registrants whose methods of accounting are
prescnbed by other laws or regulalions may
be inconsistent With the disclosure requirements of the other agencies to the extent that
the Commission determines that the public
Interest or the protection of Investors so re-

qurres.
At the close of the fiscal year the Oornrnrssion was consrdermq certain proposals which

34

are Intended to Implement these amendments. The Oornrrusstcn's final views and
proposals were to be announced
In early
September, 1976.

Monthly Publication of Significant
Interpretive Letters
On March 17, 1976. the Commission announced163 that It had authonzed monthly
pubhcanon in the SEC News Digest of a list
of slgmflcant no-action and interpretative letters Issued by the DIVISion of Corporation
Finance. The leiters listed are those wtuch
express certain views of the DIVISion With
respect to novel or Important questions ansIng under the Secunues Act, the Exchange
Act, and the Trust Indenture Act. The list
Indicates the name of the subject company,
the date of the leiter and the pertinent section
of the act, rule or form diSCUSSed.

INVESTMENT COMPANIES
In June 1976. the Cornrrussion approved
the re-narmnq of the Dlvision of Investment
Management
Regulation to the DIVISion of
Investment Management, and approved the
transfer of certain functions and personnel to
the DIVISion from the DIVISion of Corporalton
Finance. Both actions are designed to reflect
the Comrrussron's determination that Federal
statutes and regulatIOns affecting moneymanagement acnvrty should be adrrurustered
on a coordinated and, to the extent teasible,
urutorrn baSIS. The DIVISion of Investment
Management Will continue to be responsible
for the adrmrustratron of the regulatory provrsions of the Investment Company and the
Investment Advisers Acts of 1940, and Will
now perform certam functions relaltng to diSclosure requirements
applicable to Investment companies and certain Similar types of
Issuers
These changes have also been made to
place the DIVISion of Investment Management
In a better positron to examine the laws
applicable to various types of money-management acnvrties. For possibly the first time
since the enactment of the Investment Company Act, the DIVISion IS undertaking a comprenensive review of each of the provisrons
of thrs statute and of related legislation The
study Will seek to Idenlify Instances of overregulation, remedy legislative gaps and ex-

amine certain entities now excluded from
coverage to determine the appropriateness of
comparable regulation.
In addition, the Drvrsron continued ItSstudy
of an Integrated Investment company registration and reporting system. It IS Intended
that this system will (1) revise and Improve
information contained in prospectuses and
(2) reduce paperwork by eliminating duplication of information currently required In the
forms and reports filed by Investment companies with the Commission

private placements, mergers, acqursrtrons
and divestitures Since very httle information
concerning those services IS pubhcly available. the study entails the collection of primary
data through questionnaires and interviews
With offrcrals In both the banking and securities industries

Variable Life Insurance
Bank Study
The 1975 Amendments In adding Section
11A(e) to the Exchange Act, authorized the
Commission to study the extent' to which
banks maintain accounts on behalf of public
customers for bUying and seiling secunnes
registered under Section 12 of that Act. The
Commission was authorized to determine
whether the exclusion of banks from the
definitions of "broker" and "dealer" In the
Exchange Act are consistent With the protection of Investors and other purposes of that
Act The Commission was directed to report
to the Congress the results of ItS study by
December 31, 1976
The study's major objectives are to (I)
document the extent of bank Involvement In
activities comparable to those performed by
broker-dealers; (II) consider whether exrstmg
regulation adequately protects Investors usIng bank-sponsored securities services; (III)
analyze the economic conditions under which
banks compete with secunties firms and the
Impact, If any, of existmq differences In regulation; (IV) explore the present and potential
Impact of bank-sponsored securities services
on the nation's capital markets; and (v) evaluate the Circumstances, If any, under which
banks offering sscunues services should be
subject to regulations comparable to those
estabhshed for securities firms.
Three major categones of bank secunnes
services were considered as part of the
study: (I) brokerage services, such as diVIdend reinvestment plans, automatic investment services and the forwarding of orders to
brokers as agents for mdivrdual customers;
(II) rnvestrnent management and advisory
services, and (III) corporate nnanonq ("mer-

In December 1975, the Cornmrssron announced a proposal to adopt Rule 6e-2 under the Investment Company Act which
would exempt separate accounts formed by
life Insurance companies to fund certain variable life Insurance contracts from the registration requirements of the Act on the condition that such separate accounts comply with
all but certain designated provisrons of the
Act 164 The due date for comments was extended until March 31, 1976.165
A variable hfe Insurance contract differs
from a traditional whole hfe Insurance pohcy
pnnopatly because the death benefit under
the contract mayor may not Increase based
upon the performance of a separate account
of securities In which a portion of the fixed
premiums has been Invested. Moreover, the
Insured accepts the Investment risk that the
cash surrender value of rus policy Will be
higher or lower than It would otherwise be
under a traditional hfe Insurance pohcy, since
thrs value also reflects the performance of the
separate account
The proposal of Rule 6e-2 followed the
granting of an apphcanon In October 1975 for
an order of exemption from certain provrsrons
of the Act filed by Equitable Variable life
Insurance Company ("EVLlCO"), the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United
States, and EVLlCO's separate account
which IS registered under the Act as an openend management Investment company. 166
Currently, the DIVIsion's Office of Insurance
Product Bequlanon IS considennq the comments on the proposed Rule and IS revieWing
developments relating to the sale of variable
hfe Insurance contracts by EVLlCO, the only
Insurance company In the United States seilIng vanable life Insurance contracts to the

Status of Broker-Dealers as
Investment Advisers
As a result of the ehrnmation of fixed commission rates on exchange transactions on
May 1, 1975, some broker-dealers may elect
to charge separately for Investment advrsory
services which they had previously provided
incidentally to their busmess and without special cornpensanon Since charging separately
for Investment advice would cause such broker-dealers to become "Investment advisers"
Within the meaning of the Investment Advisers Act, the Commission adopted temporary
Rule 206A-1(T), which exempted certain broker-dealers registered under the Exchange
Act (except broker-dealers already registered
as Investment advisers on May 1, 1975) from
the provisrons of the Advisers Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder from May 1,
1975 until August 31, 1975,' 67 to provide
time for a thorough consideration of questions related to the apphcabrlrty of the Advrsers Act to brokers and dealers
This exemption, which was Intended to
enable broker-dealers
to adjust to unfixed
cornrrussron rates without the need to comply
With the provisions of the Advisers Act, was
subsequently
extended 168 until Apnl 30,
1976, to provide additional time for the Commission to determine whether and In what
form broker-dealers
are receiving special
compensation for advisory services and the
potential Impact on such broker-dealers
If
they were to become subject to the regulatory
provrsions of the Advisers Act At the same
nme, the scope of the exemption was narrowed to exclude from ItS coverage any broker-dealer who performs Investment supervisory services or Investment
management
services for spacral compensation
or In a
manner which IS not solely incidental to rus
business as a broker-dealer
In order to obtain a more meaningful pool of data on which
to base a permanent resolution of this question, the Cornrrussron, In April 1976, extended
this exemplion until April 30, 1977 '69
A result of charging separately for Investment advice was that such broker-dealers
would be subject to Section 206(3) of the
Advisers Act, which makes It unlawful for an
Investment adviser, If he IS acting as such In
relauon to a particular transaction, to effect
the transaction With or for hrs chent under
Circumstances where the adviser acts either

36

as principal, or as broker for a person other
than hrs chent, unless the adviser furnishes
tus chent With pnor written disclosure of the
capacity In which the adviser IS acting and
obtains the chant's consent to the transaction
On March 31, 1975, the Commission proposed the adoption of new Rule 206(3)-1
under the Advisers Act170 to exempt investment advisers who are also registered With
the Commission as broker-dealers from the
disclosure and consent requirements of Section 206(3) of the Advisers Act With respect to
certain Investment advisory services If such
advisers comply With the conditions set forth
In the proposed rule This rule was adopted
substantially
unchanged

SIGNIFICANT CASES INVOLVING
SECURITIES ACTS
Ernst & Ernst V Hochfelder 174_The complaint alleged that the defendant accounting
firm had aided and abetted the president of a
brokerage firm who, In a Side arrangement,
had perpetrated a fraud on the firm's customers In Violation of Section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder
In
essence, the theory of the complaint was that
the accounting firm had not exercised appropnate audinnq procedures in ItS annual audits
of the brokerage firm and that trus orrnssron
resulted In the accounting firm's failure to
discover certain practices, the discovery of
which would have led to the discovery of the
brokerage firm president's fraudulent activrties Discovery of such practices. It was further alleged, would have had to have been
reflected In certain reports filed by the broker-

age firm with the Commission and such disclosure would have led to an Investigation by
vanous regulatory authonnes
The plaintiffs
contended that such an Investigation, in turn,
would have led to discovery of the president's
fraudulent
activities.
Thus, a baste Issue
throughout the litigation was whether the accounbng firm was liable for having failed to
discover the fraud of the brokerage firm's
president.
The Commission had not participated In
this Iitigallon In the lower courts nor had It
taken any action against the accounbng firm
When the Supreme Court granted the accounting firm's pennon to review the decrsion
of the court of appeals, it requested the
Commission to give ItS view. The Commission filed an amicus cunee bnef and parncrpated In oral argument.
The Commission argued that Section 10(b)
and Rule 10b-5 were not limited to the prohibmon of mtentional misconduct, but that the
secnon and Rule proscnbed negligent as well
as mtennonal misconduct Inasmuch as VICtims of manipulative and deceptive secunues
practices may be equally Injured by both
types of conduct.
In ItS deosron, the Supreme Court (6 to 2)
rejected the Commission's
argument that
there should be some circumstances under
which cIvil damage liability may be Imposed
under Rule 10b-5 for negligent
conduct
which Injures Investors The Supreme Court
held, Instead, that a "pnvate cause of action
for damages will [not] lie under 9 10(b) and
Rule 10b-5 In the absence of an allegation of
'scienter'<mtent
to deceive, manipulate defraud." It should be noted, however, that the
Court, recognizing that "In certain areas of
the law recklessness IS considered to be a
form of intentional conduct for Imposing habilIty for some act," chose not to address the
Issue "whether, In some circumstances, reckless behavior IS sufficient for crvrl liability
under 9 10(b) and Rule 10b-5" (Ibid, n. 12)
In addition, the Court also determined not to
consider the question "whether scienter IS a
necessary element In an action for injunctive
relief under 9 10(b) and Rule 1Ob-S:' 175
In TSC tndustnes v. Northway, 176 a TSC
rrunonty shareholder had sued TSC and Nanonal Industnes, claiming that a proxy statement ISSUed by the two companies recommending shareholder
approval of the pro-

posed merger of TSC With National had been
Incomplete and matenally misleading, In VIOlation of Section 14(a) of the SecunlJes Exchange Act and Rules 14a-3 and 14a-9. The
Supreme Court agreed With the drstnct court
In denying summary Judgment for the plaintiff
shareholder
The Commission, participating as amicus
cunee, suggested that the Supreme Court, In
formulating a standard of matenality under
Rule 14a-9, be mindful that any such standard should balance the need for adequate
disclosure With the adverse consequences of
setting too low a threshold for CIvil liability.
The Court agreed With these considerauons
and stated
an omitted fact IS matenal If there is a
substantial
likelihood that a reasonable
shareholder would consider It Important In
deciding how to vote Thrs standard IS fully
consistent With Mills general descnptron of
materiality as a requirement that 'the defect
have a Significant propensity to affect the
voting process' It does not require proof of
a substantial likelihood that disclosure of
the omitted fact would have caused the
reasonable Investor to change hrs vote
What the standard does contemplate IS a
showrnq of a substantial likelihood that,
under all the Circumstances, the omitted
fact would have assumed actual significance In the dshberanons of the reasonable shareholder
Put another way, there
must be a substanlJal likelihood that the
disclosure of the omitted fact would have
been Viewed by the reasonable Investor as
havrnq Significantly altered the 'total mix' of
information made available" 177
The proxy statement
In question, while
prominently displaying the fact that National
owned 34% of TSC and that five of TSC's
directors were National apporntees, had omitted to state fUlly the degree of control already
exercised by National over TSC Specifically,
there had been no drsclosure that the National officers headed the TSC board and ItS
executive committee and that reports had
been filed With the Commission
indicating
that National could be deemed the parent of
TSC The proxy statement, while includmg
the opinion of an Investment banking firm
favorable to the proposed merger, had not
Included a letter from the same firm which the

37

court of appeals believed contained rnforrnanon unfavorable to the proposal Also the
proxy statement did not pomt out purchases
made of National common stock by National
and a mutual fund whose president was
employed by National, even though the pnce
of the National stock was relevant to the
fairness of the merger
The Court, noting that the Issue of matenalIty was a mixed questron of law and fact, held
that a summary Judgment, finding orrussrons
to be matenal as a matter of law, could only
be granted after a finding that the omissions
were" 'so obviously Important to an Investor,
that reasonable minds cannot differ on the
question of matenallty , "
In Radzanower v Touche Ross & Co, et
ai, 178the Supreme Court held that venue In
a SUit against a national banking association
charged with violating the Federal securmes
laws was governed by S 94 of the National
Bank Act,179 which provides that an action
against a national banking association may
be had only In the Federal drstnct court within
the district In which the bank has ItS pnncipal
office The Commission flied a bnef, amicus
curtee, m the Supreme Court, takrnq the
position that the venue provrsrons of the
Secunties Exchange Act, 180 as the later-enacted statute, should control when a national
bank IS alleged to have committed a violation
of that Act The Court concluded, however,
that It presented no Insurmountable burden
for Investors bnngmg an action aqainst a
bank to sue where the bank has ItS pnncipal
office, and ruled that the Federal secuntres
laws neither expressly nor Impliedly repealed
the narrow venue provisrons of the National
Bank Act
In Securtties and Exchange Commission v
Research AutomatIOn Corporetion, et ai, 18'
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
reversed, In part, a default injunction obtained
by the Cornmrssron pursuant to Rule 37(d) of
the Federal Rules of CIVil Procedure, which
provides for sanctions In the event a party
falls to appear for a deposition
The court
held that such sanctions
are unavailable
against a party who IS physicauy present at
ItS deposition but who, "In a Willful effort to
disrupt and to Impede discovery, refuses to
be sworn or to testify" The court stated that
Rule 37(d) must be limited to the case where
a defendant literally falls to show up for a

38

deposition It also stated that a party seeking
sanctions under these circumstances
must
first obtain a court order pursuant to Rule
37(a) directing the party to testify, and a
Violation of such order might result m sanctions.
Samuel H Sloan, et al v Secunues and
Exchange Commission, et al 182- The Court
of Appeals affirmed the drstnct court's dismissal of a pro se complaint whrch, among
other thmqs, purported to challenge "the legality of the entire structure of securities
regulation In the United States "'83 In the
course of ItS oprmon. the court held that
certam sections of the Exchange Act and
rules promulgated
thereunder,
which were
specifically
alleged to be unconstitutional,
were In fact "valid and reasonable exercises
of congressional power under the commerce
clause and the SEC's delegated regulatory
power, which Infringe no constitutional rights
of plaintiff "'84 These provrsions Included
Section 27 of the Act (vesting exclusive JUriSdiction of actions brought under the Act In the
Federal courts), Section 12(g) (registration of
secuntres With the Cornrrussron), Sections
15(c)(5) and 19(a)(4) (summary trading suspension power),185 Rule 15c2-11 (antrmarnpulatrvs rule respecting publication of quotanons), Rule 15c3-1 (broker-dealer net capital
rule), and Rule 17a-5 (annual report of broker-dealer financial condition) '86
In Securities and Exchange Commission v
Csapo, 187 the court addressed Rule 7(c) of
the Commission's
Rules Relatmg to Investigations, 188a rule which generally prohibits an
attorney from appearing With a witness In an
Investigation when that attorney has prevrously appeared With another witness In the
same mvesnqanon, unless the rule IS waived
by a hearing officer Because the Commission had reason to believe that certain pnnopal targets In an investigation were seeking to
present a Unified front by havmq their attorneys With many of the witnesses In the investigation, the Commission refused to waive
Rule 7(c) when these attorneys sought likewise to appear With Mr Csapo After Mr
Csapo refused to appear Without these attorneys, the Commission Instituted a subpoena
enforcement action In the United States DIStrict Court for the Drstnct of Columbia
The
drstnct court refused to enforce the subpoena
unless the Commission allowed the attomeys

to accompany Csapo The Comrmssron
appealed from this order and the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circint
affirmed. It said (533 F 2d at 11)
"We do not rrururruze the dangers inherent In counsel representing
multiple
chents In a Single proceeding.
It IS at
least plausible that as matters develop
the best Interests of Csapo may prove to
be antagonistic
to those of
[other
persons represented by the same counseL] That decisron, however, belongs to
neither the district court nor the Commission The SEC properly fulfilled ItS duty
by informing those who came before It
whether their lawyers had appeared on
behalf of others and, If so, the possible
confhcts which might arise The choice
must then be made by the witness after
a full and frank disclosure by hrs attorney
of the attendant risks See ABA Code of
Professronal
Hesponsrburty,
Drsciplmary
Rule 5-105(c)"
Unless the Oornrmssion can present "concrete evrdence" that the presence of the
attorneys would obstruct and Impede investigation, the court stated, the witness' right to
counsel of hrs own choosmq must prevail
In SEC v Geon tnoustries,
Inc, 189 the
court of appeals upheld a permanent InJuncnon, Issued upon a finding of a Violation of
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule
10b-5 by Geon's president In crsclosmq material nonpubhc information about a proposed
merger between Geon and Burmah 011 Co ,
Ltd., of Great Britain, which disclosure resulted In vanous transactions In Geon shares
The court ruled that the information disclosed
about the probability
and progress of the
merger was material, noting that facts relating
to a proposed merger could become material
at an early stage because of the Importance
of the event to the company
The court reversed the district court's dismissal of the Commission's complaint against
Geon's secretary-treasurer
who had responded In the negative to an inquiry from an
Exchange offrcral as to whether problems
With the proposed merger accounted for an
Imbalance In the amount of sell orders for
Geon stock, when, In fact, he was In possession of information which Indicated otherwise
In holding that, under the Circumstances, the

secretary-treasurer
had Violated Rule 10b-5,
the court emphasized that, while the unverified Information might have been misleading
If made pubhc, failure to disclose such Information upon mqurry of the Exchange prohibited the Exchange from reaching an Informed
decrsron on whether to suspend trading In

Abrahamson v Fleschner 190_At the request of the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circurt, the Cornrmssron filed a brief, emtcus
cunee, In ttus private htlgatlon addressinq
certain Issues raised under the Investment
Advisers Act The Cornrrussion stated ItS view
that a private CIVil action should be permitted
for Violations of the antifraud provisrons of the
Advisers Act 191Under the rationale of recent
Supreme Court cases,192 the Cornrrussron
argued that a private right of action should be
rrnphad because chents of Investment adVISers are members of the class for whose
esoecral benefit the Investment Advisers Act
was enacted, because a private right of action IS consistent With the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme of the Act
and IS Implied by ItS clear purpose, and
because the remedy provided by the antifraud provisrons IS not equivalent to any exrstIng right of action for fraud under common
law
The Commrssron noted In ItS brief that In
December 1975, It had pubhcly announced
that It had submitted leqrslatrve proposals to
the Congress which would amend the Investment Advisers Act In several ways One of
these proposals was that Congress "clarify
the existence of a pnvate nght of action
based on a Violation" of the Act 193 As the
Cornrrussion noted in ItS brief, the fact that It
IS seeking clarification of the private right of
action In order to put an end to the confusron
which exrsts With respect to thrs Issue 194
should In no way be construed as indicating
that a private right of action cannot be rrnphed
from the present statutory scheme
In ItS brief, the Cornrrussron also took the
positron that a partnership havmq as ItS pnn-

39

opal purpose to Invest and trade In secunties, and the partnership's general partners,
who had the sole power to make Investment
deosrons for the partnership, were "investment advisers" as defined In the Investment
Advisers Act 195The statutory definition, the
Comrmssronasserted, was meant to Include
persons who, like certain of the defendants In
this action, manage the funds of others for
compensation and In the process exercise
discretion over the Investments made with
those funds
In addition, the Oomrnrssronexpressed In
ItS brief ItS views as to the proper method of
cornpunnq any damages which the plaintiffs
could demonstrate they suffered as a result
of defendants' alleged vrolanons of the lnvesment Adviser Act. The Court of Appeals has
not yet ruled In the matter
In the Matter of Cavanagh Communities
Corporation 196_The District Court for the

Southern District of New York, on appeal
from an order of a bankruptcy judge, held, In
accordance with the views expressed by the
CornrrussronIn an amicus cunee brief, that
the Cornrrnssionhas pnmary junsdictron In a
question dealing with a stock exchange's
decision to dellst a security,
Cavanagh Communrlles Corporation IS a
publicly-held corporation With common stock
and debentures listed on the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE), On February 18, 1975,
Cavanagh filed a petition for an arrangement
under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act. On
the same date, the NYSE suspended trading
In Cavanagh's secuntres and announced an
intention to apply to the Comrrussronfor delIstlng Cavanagh thereafter petitioned the
bankruptcy JUdge for an Injunction against
initiation of dell sting procedures by the
NYSE
The bankruptcy Judge concluded that the
hsling was "property" Within the summary
junsdrcnon of the court. Moreover, since tradIng In the secunnes was already suspended,
the bankruptcy judge reasoned that there
would be no Injury to the public If the dshsnnq
application was temporarily eruoined AccordIngly, he entered the injunction and the NYSE
appealed
The Cornrrussronfiled an amicus brief urgIng the district court to reverse the bankruptcy
judge on the ground that the dellsting of
securities IS a matter exclustvely Within the
40

junsdicnon of the Cornrmssron The Commission pointed out that Secbon 12(d) of the
Exchange Act specifically provides that the
proper tribunal to judge the appropnateness
and necessity of dellstlng IS the Comrrussron,
and further that judrcial review was available
on a petition for review of any Comrrussron
order In the court of appeals. Thus, It was not
proper for the bankruptcy judge to Interfere
With the dellsting procedures by decrdmq
whether there would be Injury to the public In
the absence of delistlng.
In an opinion which closely parallels the
reasoning of the Cornrtussron's brief, Judge
Duffy reversed the bankruptcy judge and vacated the preliminary injunction. The court
noted that "the statutory authonty of the SEC
over listing and delisting of secunnes on an
exchange IS pervasive and comprehensive,'
and that the "existence of thrs regulatory
structure indicates congressional concern
that the skill and expenence of the SEC be
applied to delistlng procedures." In response
to Cavanagh's argument that dehstmq would
be Imprudent and unnecessary at the present
time, the court noted that the proper course
for Cavanagh was to present ItS views to the
OomrrussronIn response to NYSE's dehstlng
applicabon.
Holdsworth
v, Strong 197_ln thrs action,
the distnct court found that the defendant
Violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, by knowrnqly
making false statements regarding a corporabon's ability to pay drvidends to Induce the
plaintiffs to sell their stock In the corporation
to him and that plaintiffs had reasonably
relied upon these false statements.tw The
drstnct court further found that the defendant
concealed the true frnaneral condruon of the
corporanon from the plamnffs.
On appeal, the majority of the panel of the
United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth
CirCUitfound that the plaintiffs had failed to
exercise due diligence In connecuon With the
transaction and that their lack of due diligence precluded their recovery.
The Comrrussron filed a bnef, amicus curtee, when the court agreed to rehear the
case, en banco ArgUing that the court should
hold intentional fraudulent conduct actionable
under Rule 10b-5 even If the Victim was
negligent In falling to discover the fraud, the
Commission expressed ItS concern that a

contrary ruling would encourage persons to
chance secunnes fraud since they may be
able to retain their Ill-gollen gains simply by
showing that the victim was negligent.
Given the broad purposes underlying Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and the Supreme
Court's recoqnmon In Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder 199 of a pnvate nght of action for intentionally fraudulent conduct, the Commission
argued that under the above standards the
due diligence defense should be rejected.
The court of appeals, sittmq en banc, reversed the onqmal panel.
Tannenbaum
v Zeller200 presented the
question of whether fully Informed and truly
Independent directors of a mutual fund are
precluded, under the Investment Company
Act, from exercrsmq any discretion and good
faith business Judgment In determining
whether to use a portion of the cornrrussrons
paid by the fund on brokerage transactions to
reward broker-dealers which sold fund shares
or provided research services Instead of racaptunng such excess commissions for the
fund's direct cash benefit
The Issue arose because of the minimum
fixed-brokerage commission rate structure
that prevailed on the exchanges until May 1,
1975, when It was prohibited by the Commission. Under that system, persons were compelled to pay brokerage cornrrussionsaccordIng to a fixed rate which did not reflect
economies of scale As a result, the brokerage comrmssrons paid by mutual funds far
exceeded the actual cost to the broker. The
mutual funds had essentially two ways to use
these excessive commissions-they
could
channel the excess to brokers which provided
the fund With sales or research services or
they could, through a vanety of devices,
recapture the excess In the form of a direct
cash benefit for the funds
The fund In Tannenbaum had chosen to
use the excess to reward brokers providing
sales and research services The plaintiff
sued on the ground that the defendant investment adviser had caused the fund to take trus
course In Violation of ItS nduciary duty As a
defense, the adviser argued that the decisron
to forego recapture of the excess commissions had been made by the dismterested
members of the board of directors In the
exercise of a good faith business Judgment,
and that the adviser could not be held liable

for carrying out the mstrucnons of the board
The drstnct court agreed Withdefendant, and
plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals for
the Second Crrcurt
In an amicus cunae bnef, the Comrrussion
argued that the recapture decisron was one
that could be commilled to the discretion of
the dismterested members of the board of
directors. Crucial to thrs POSitionwas the fact
that this case arose In the context of rapidly
changing market conditions which created
substannal equities In favor of the defendants
In this case. In addition, the structure of the
Investment Company Act and two pnor decsrons by courts of appeals indicated that the
recapture question was one area where independent and drsmterested directors could exercise busmess Judgment In the context of
this case, contrary to the general expenence
of the Commrssron, the drstnct court had
found that the directors were truly independent of the Investment adviser The court had
also found that the directors were fully informed of available alternatives for usinq the
excess cornrrussrons. Under those circumstances and In view of the unique market
condrnons prevailing at the time the events
occurred, the Cornrrussroncould not conclude
that the directors' Judgment to forego recapture was not reasonable
The case IS currently awaiting decisron by
the court of appeals
Pargas, Inc v. Empue Gas 201_ The action
was brought by the target company (Pargas,
Inc) to eruom a tender offer. At the request of
the court, the Cornrrussion filed a letter With
the court expressing ItSviews on the applicability to tender offers of Regulation T, adopted
by the Board of Govemors of the Federal
Reserve System pursuant to Section 7 of the
Exchange Act The Comrrussron noted ItS
practice of refernng requests for interpretations of the Regulation to the Board In view
of ItSresponsibilities for enforcmq the Regulation, however, after consultation Withthe staff
of the Board, the Oomrmssron advised the
court that It was In agreement With the
Board's staff that the Regulation applied to
tender offers and that the arrangement of
credit Involved In the action appeared not to
be Withinany exemption provided In the Regulation.
In Ayres v. Memll Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &
Smith, Inc, 202 the Court of Appeals for the
41

Third Circutt reversed a drstnct court Judgment confirming a decisron rendered by arbitrators of the New York Stock Exchange. The
action arose when plaintiff Ayres retired from
his position as a registered representative
with Merrill Lynch, and Merrill Lynch then
exercised ItS nght to repurchase 8,000 shares
of ItS stock which Ayres, as an employee, had
been permitted to buy, At the time It repurchased the stock from Ayres, Merrill Lynch
did not disclose that It planned to make a
public offenng of ItS common stock Platntlff
brought SUIt under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act clarmmq Merrill Lynch had WIthheld matenal non-public Information wruch, If
he had known, would have caused him to
delay his voluntary retirement and thus not
tngger the repurchase of his stock
The distnct court granted Merrill Lynch's
motion for a stay of procesdmqs
pending
arbitration based on ItS contention that the
controversy was one arrsmq out of Ayres'
employment, subject to compulsory arbitration pursuant to agreement between Ayres
and Merrill Lynch. The arbitrators subsequently rendered a decision adverse to Ayres
on all claims, and the distnct court confirmed
the decision
The court of appeals concluded, In agreement With the views set forth by the Cornrmssron, amicus cunee, that the applicable
NYSE rule was "not Intended to cover a
controversy that has a causal connection to
the fact of employment as remote as that
mvolved'' or "the assertion of legal nghts
having a source wholly Independent of the
employment relatronsrup." To conclude otherWIse would be to place on the arbitrators the
responsibnrty for applying legal pnncples that
are far removed from the NYSE's Interests In
self-governance and "the specialized knowledge of Industry needs and practices that
makes arbitration appropnate when the terms
and conditions of the employment relationship are at Issue"
Moreover, even If the NYSE rule were
Intended to govern the situation, the court
held that agreements to arbitrate future federal secunnes controversies would be unenforceable because of the anti-waiver provision of Section 29(a) of the Exchange Act
and Wilko v. Swan, 346 U S 427 (1953),
which held that the anti-waiver provrsron of
the Secunties Act rendered VOid a prospec-

42

tlve agreement between a brokerage firm anc
a customer which would have required arb
tranon of the customer's claim under Secbon
12(2) of the Secunnes Act. The prospective
waiver of a nght to a judicral tnal of a cause
arising under the secunues laws IS "inconsistent WIth Congress' ovarndmq concern for the
protection of Investors," Slip op. 8
Finally, the court dismissed Merrill Lynch's
remaining claims, (1) that no cause of action
was stated because Ayres' sale was totally
Involuntary, and (2) that Section 28(b), which
preserves the validity of action taken by a
self-regulatory
organization
"to settle disputes between members or parnopants," exempts the NYSE rule from the invalidating
effect of the anti-waiver provrsion The case
was remanded to the drstnct court
One jUdge dissented on the grounds that
Since Merrill Lynch had an "unfettered" right
to repurchase Ayres' stock, he had no Investment choice to make In the matter HIs deersion was not whether to sell secunnes, but
whether to retire. Therefore, no information
was matenal to Ayres' Investment decision
and his complaint failed to state a cause of
action under Rule 10b-5.

Commission Litigation
SEC v. National
Student
Marketmg
Corp 203_As previously reported, Anthony
M Natelll, then an auditing partner of Peat,
Marwlck, Mitchell & Co., and Joseph Scansaroll, a former audit supervisor with that firm,
were convicted In the Southern Distrrct of
New York for their part In prepanng mtenrn
unaudited fmancial statements for National
Student Marketing Corp. which appeared In a
proxy statement delivered to the shareholders and filed WIth the Cornmrssron In 1969.
An appeal was taken to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second CirCUIt.
In affirming Nateill's convrcnon, the Court
enuncrated Important standards of responsrbility for an accountant faced With the opportunity to correct falsehoods In previous nnancials of which he should be aware In subsequent mterrrn, unaudited,
financral statements.204 The court concluded that "[t]he
accountant owes a duty to the public not to
assert a priVilege of Silence untIl the next
annual statement comes around In due time"
Nateill's petition for cernoran was denied The
court reversed Scansaroli's convicnon as to

one specification of the count of the Indictment under which he was tned for lack of
sufficient evrdence, and ordered a new tnal
with respect to the other count to correct a
faulty jury charge. That trial is scheduled to
begin In October.
Dunng the previous fiscal year, the Drstnct
Court granted the Commission's motion to
stnke a certain affirmative defense asserted
by a number of the defendants The defendants alleged that the Commission's Injunctive
acnon should be dismissed because the staff,
dunng the course of the Investigation, failed
to Inform prospective defendants of their status as targets of an Investigation and to solicit
their views as to why they should not be
sued. Defendants alleged that this was reqinred by the rules and requlations of the
Commission The Distnct Court, finding that
no such rule existed, struck the defense as
legally Insufficient. The rUling was certified for
Interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C.
~ 1292(b). The United States Court of Appeals for the Distnct of Columbia Crrcuit upheld the Commission's POSitionand affirmed
the District Court's ruling. A motion for reconsrderatronISpending.
Over the Commission's objections, thrs action was consolidated by the Judicial Panel
on Multldlstnct litigation With several pending
pnvate SUitS concerning National Student
Marketing. The resulting litigation caused a
substantial delay In the progress of the Commission's action. As a result of thrs type of
expenence, a request was directed to Congress for legislation to Insure the Commission's nght to avoid such Involuntary consolidation In the future. Congress responded In
1975 by adding Section 21(g) to the Exchange Act, which requires the Commission's
consent for future consolidations under 28
U S.C. ~ 1407(a).
Thrs action has been the subject of one of
the most comprehensive pretnal discovery
programs In the Cornrrussron's expenence.
The testimony of more than one hundred
thirty witnesses has consumed forty thousand
pages of transcnpt, Five thousand documents
have been marked for Identification, and
many times that number have been produced
for inspection. With thrs lengthy process
nearly complete, the Commission's action Will
proceed to a separate tnal late In 1976 or
early In 1977.

In addition, the complaint alleged that defendants Janetatos and SlOWinski, of Washmqton, 0 C , on behalf of their law firm, aided
and abetted the Geo defendants' antifraud
Violations In Issuing tax opinion letters on the
taking of the leveraged deductrons, which
opinion letters were drstnbuted by the Geo
defendants to prospective Investors or their
advisors. and In reviewing prospectuses contamed In the reglstrallon statements for certain of the dnllmq funds The complaint alleged that defendants Janetatos and SlOWInski knew or should have known facts concerning the substance of the method of operations of the Geo defendants' dnlhnq ventures, such that they should have known that
their opinion letters and the prospectuses did
not fully and fairly descnbe the proposed
method of operations
of the 011 and gas
dniling ventures In all respects matenal to the
tax consequences, and did not fUlly and fairly
describe all matenal nsks of adverse tax
treatment
The complaint noted that the Internal Revenue Service, after conducting an audit of the
1971 and 1972 dnlling programs, has decided to disallow the deductions based on the
non-recourse
"loan" transactions,
on the
grounds, among others, that such transactions are shams for tax purposes, and that
over 2,000 limited partners Will face disallowance of over $80,000,000
In deductions
based on the non-recourse "loan" transactions
Defendants Janetatos and Slowmski consented to a final order prohibiting them from

rendering any tax opinion or advice. In connscnon WIth any tax-oriented secunnes offerIng, without taking reasonable care, including
reasonable and appropriate mquiry and Investigation, to assure themselves
that the
proposed method of operations of any entity
formed as a result of the offering IS fully and
fairly descnbed In all respects material to the
tax treatment on their tax opinion letter or any
other offering document, and that all material
risks of adverse tax treatment are fully and
fairly described In their opinion letters or In
any other offering document As part of their
settlement With the Commission, these defendants agreed to obtain review by sxpenanced and knowledgeable secunnes counsel
of the adequacy of disclosures
In opinion
letters and offering documents, before rendering any opinions or advice
Defendant Katcher consented to a Judgment prohibiting him, In connection With the
offer and sale of tax-onented secuntres, from
rendering any tax or other advice or recornrnendatron, or'offennq and seiling such securities, to any chent or other persons, Without
informing such person, where applicable, that
he or any entity With which he IS associated
Will receive any comrrussron or other compensation; and from acting as an unregistered
broker-dealer.
The complaint seeks permanent injunctive
rehef against future Violations of the relevant
provisions of t!'le Federal secuntres laws by
the remaining defendants,
as well as the
dlsgorgement by the Geo defendants to the
hrrutsd partners of those portions of management fees based on the sham non-recourse
"loan" transactions, and the Issuance of an
order maintaining and preserving the assets
of defendant CRC Corporation and subsroaries pending a final deterrrunanon

engaged In a scheme whereby they made false
and misleading statements and omitted other
material facts regarding various facets of the
company's scheme to become a private corporanon Among other things, Parklane's failure of disclosure concerned the fact that
Parklane's corporate status was changed so
as to enable Parklane's president to appropriate Parklane's assets for hts own personal

47

benefit (specifically to reduce his own personal Indebtedness), the true status of negotiations regardmg cancellation of certain of
Parklane's leasehold nghts, and the fact that
the defendants had not provided their appraisers, hired to determine the true value of
Parklane stock, with adequate mtorrnauon to
make a proper evaluation.

powers, to conduct an investigation of Parklane, so as to protect and preserve Parklane's assets and the rights of Park lane's
former public shareholders

Part 2
The Disclosure
System

Part 2
The Disclosure
System

A basic purpose of the Federal securities
laws IS to provide disclosure
of material,
financial and other mtorrnauon on companies
seeking .to raise capital through the public
offenng of their secunues, as well as companies whose securities are already publicly
held. This alms at enabling Investors to evaluate the securities of these companies on an
Informed and reahsnc basis
The Securities Act of 1933 generally reqinres that before secunnes may be offered
to the public a registration statement must be
filed With the Commission
disclOSing preSCribed. categories of Information Before the
sale of secunues can begin, the registration
statement must become "effective"
In the
sales, Investors must be furnished a prospectus containing the most Significant Information
In the registration statement

must report their holdings and transactions
all eqmty secuntres of their companies

In

PUBLIC OFFERING: THE 1933
SECURITIES ACT
The baste concept underlying the Securities Act's reqrstratron requirements IS full disclosure The Commission has no authonty to
pass on the merits of the secunnes to be
offered or on the fairness of the terms of
distribution If adequate and accurate disclosure IS made, It cannot deny registration The
Act makes It unlawful to represent to Investors that the Commission has approved or
otherwise passed on the merits of registered
secuntres

Information Provided
The Secuntres Exchange Act of 1934 deals
In large part With securities already outstandIng and requires the registration of securities
listed on a national securities exchange, as
well as over-the-counter
secunnes In which
there IS a substantial public Interest Issuers
of registered secunuss must trle annual and
other penodic reports designed to provide a
public file of current material information The
Exchange Act also requires disclosure of
matenal information to holders of registered
secunnes In sohcrtatrons of proxies for the
election of directors or approval of corporate
action at a stockholders' meeting, or In attempts to acquire control of a company
through a tender offer or other planned stock
acqutsrtron It provides that insiders of companies whose equity secunties are registered

While the Secuntres Act spectres the mlormatron to be Included In registration statements. the Commission has the authority to
presence appropriate forms and to vary the
particular Items of information required to be
orsctosed To tacihtate the registration of secuntres by different types of Issuers, the
Commission has adopted specral registration
forms which vary In their disclosure requirements so as to provide maximum drsdosure
of the essential facts pertinent In a given type
of offering while at the same time minimizing
the burden and expense of compliance With
the law In recent years, It has adopted
certain short forms, notably Forms S-7 and
S-16, which do not require disclosure
of
matters already covered In reports and proxy
57

matenal filed or distributed under provisions
of the Secunties Exchange Act. Another short
form for registration under the Sscunnes Act
IS Form S-8 for the registration of securities
to be offered to employees of the Issuer and
ItS subsidiaries Recent Commission proposals for the amendment of the three forms
referred to above are discussed in Part One
of the Annual Report

companies pursuant to Section 24(e) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, wruch provides for the registration of additional securities through amendment to an effective registration statement rather than the filing of a
new registration statement For the rernarrunq
2,512 statements, the median number of calendar days between the date of the original
filing and the effective date was 29.

Reviewing Process

Financial Analysis and
Examination

RegistratIon statements filed WIththe Comrmssion are examined by ItS DIVISionof Corporation Finance for compliance With the
standards of adequate and accurate disclosure Various degrees of review procedures
are employed by the Divrsion." WhIle most
dencrenoes are corrected through an informal letter of comment procedure, where the
Commission finds that matenal representations In a regIstration statement are rrusleadIng, Inaccurate, or Incomplete, It may, after
notice and opportunity for heanng, Issue a
"stop-order" suspending the effectIveness of
the statement

Time for Registration
The Commission's staff tnes to complete
exammanon of registration statements as
qUickly as possible The Secunues Act provrdes that a regIstration statement shall become effective on the 20th day after It ISfiled
(or on the 20th day after the filing of any
amendment). Most registration statements require one or more amendments and do not
become effective until some urns after the
statutory 2D-day penod The period between
the filing and effective date ISIntended to give
investors an opportunrty to become familiar
With the proposed offering through the dissemination of the preliminary form of prospectus The Comrmssion can accelerate the
effective date to shorten the 20-day waIting
period-taking
Into account, among other
things, the adequacy of the intormauon on
the Issuer already available to the public and
the ease With which facts about the offering
can be understood
DUringthe 1976 fiscal year, 2,801 reglstralJon statements became effective. Of these,
289 were amendments filed by Investment
58

DUring the fiscal year, the Office of the
Chief Frnancral Analyst of the Divisron of
Corporation Finance began a quarterly pubjcanon for the staff about the current status of
the nanon's economy and siqruftcant trends
affecting specific industries. It provides the
staff With Interpretation of leading econorruc
Indicators, With rdennficanon and descnpnon
of new vehicles of financmq and With projections on type and volume of prospective
financmg It also comments on novel fmancmg patterns devised to obscure the true nature of reported transactrons, uncovered
through a quarterly review of investigatory
files of the DIVISionof Enforcement.
By the end of the fiscal year, the Office of
the Chief Financial Analyst mmated an mtensrve review of the real estate industry, now In
progress.

Office of Oil and Gas
The D,VISion'SOffice of all and Gas has
processing responsibility for all 011 and gas
dnlllng program fIlings, as well as filings covenng fractional undivided Interests in 011 and
gas nghts Fifty registratIon statements were
filed dUring fiscal 1976 for 011 and gas drilling
programs, totaling $530,338,420 And fifteen
reglstraIJonstatements covering fractional undiVided Interests In 011 and gas rights were
fIled aggregating $4,988,775.
In addition to the direct processing of those
fIlings, the Office of Orl and Gas IS responsible for reviewing the disclosure relalJngto the
oil and gas busmess and propernes, including
data on producnon and reserves of 011 and
gas, contained In other fllmgs directly processed by the several branches of the DIVISion
of Corporation Finance In frscal year 1976,
such other filings consisted of 208 reglstra-

non statements under the Secunnes Act and
8 offenng circulars pursuant to the Regulation
A exemption thereunder, as well as 74 registration statements and proxy statements under the Exchange Act
Additional information regarding offenngs
of fracbonal undivided Interests IS contained
under Regulation B In thrs part.

Real Estate and Other Tax
Shelters

SMALL ISSUE EXEMPTION
The Commission IS authonzed under Section 3(b) of the Securities Act to exempt
sscunnes from registration If It finds that
reglstrabon for these secunnes IS not necessary to the public Interest because of the
small offenng amount or limited character of
the public offenng. The law mposes a maximum limitation of $500,000 upon the size of
the Issues which may be exempted by the
Commission.
The Oomrmssronhas adopted the follOWing
exemptive rules and regulabons'
exemption

Regulation E'

Regulation F'

On March 17, 1976,2 the Commission
adopted a gUide to the "Preparation of Registration Statements Relating to Interests In
Real Estate Limited Partnerships" Onqmally
proposed for public comment on March 1,
1974,3 the gUide contains the comments and
suggestions developed by the DIVIsion of
Corporation Finance In processing registration statements relating to real estate limited
partnerships. The gUide generally emphasizes drsclosure relating to the nsk and the
conflict of Interest Inherent In many such
offenngs, the compensation paid to the program sponsors, the performance record of
the sponsors In pnor offenngs, and the tax
ramification of these types of offenngs.
As a result of the gUide's adoption and the
recent decline In reqrstranonstatements relatIng to real estate limited partnerships, the
Divisron IS no longer processing these filings
In one specialized branch However, registration statements relating to other non-oil and
gas types of tax shelters, such as cattle
feeding and breeding, aqnbusmess and leasIng, as well as condominium offenngs, Will
continue to be processed In a separate
branch

On December 30, 1975, the Cornnussion
amended Rule 310 under Regulation 8 under
the Secunnes Act4 and adopted a statement
regarding seiling practices under that regulation The amendment requires the furnishing
of satisfactory assurance to the Cornrrussion
that the relevant State secuntres administrators have been notified of a proposed offenng

The Cornrrussron took the opportunity In
thrs release to caution offerors regarding their
responsibility
under the Federal secuntres
laws, In view of recent allegations that certain
offerors under Regulation 8 have been engaged In high pressure sales campaigns
On December 23, 1975, the Cornrrussion
proposed an amendment to Rule 306 under
Regulation 85 to requrre Interests exempt
under that regulalion to be offered or sold
only by registered brokers or dealers. Under
the amendment, the Issuer would not have to
be a registered broker or dealer If all offers

CONTINUING DISCLOSURE: THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 contains srqruficant disclosure
provrsrons designed to provide a fund of current matenal

there IS a substantial public Interest The Act
also seeks to assure that secunty holders
who are solicited to exercise their voting

ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS

AND AUDITING

The secuntres acts reflect a recognition by
Congress that dependable
financial statements of a company are mdispensable
to
Informed Investment decisions regarding ItS
secunues A malor objective of the Comrrussion has been to Improve accounting, reportIng, and audiunq standards applicable to the
financial statements and to assure that high
standards of professional conduct are rnamtamed by the public accountants who examme the statements The primary responsibility
for tms program rests with the Chief Accountant of the Commission
Under the Commission's broad rulemakmg
power, It has adopted a oasrc accountmg
regulatIOn (RegUlation S-X) WhiCh, together
with interpretanons
and gUidelmes on accountmg and reportmg procedures published
as "Accounting
Series Releases," governs
the form and content of fmancial statements
filed In compliance with the secunnes laws
The Cornrrussron has also formulated rules
on accounting
for and auditing of brokerdealers and prescribed Uniform systems of
accounts for mutual and subsidiary service
companies related to holdmg companies subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935 The accounting rules and opinions of
the Cornrrussron, and ItS decrsrons In particular cases, have contributed to clarification
and Wider acceptance of the accounting principles and practices and auditing standards
developed by the profession and generally
followed In the preparation of financial statements
However, the accountmg and financial reporting rules and regulatlons--except
for the
Uniform systems of accounts which are regulatory reports-s-orescnbe
accounting pnnciples to be followed only In certain limited
areas In the large area of fmancial reporting
not covered by ItS rules, the Comrrussion's
principal means of protecting Investors from
Inadequate or Improper tmancial reporting IS
by requiring a report of an mdependent public
accoutant, based on an audit performed In
accordance with generally accepted auditing
64

standards,
which expresses
an opiruon
whether the financial statements
are presented fairly In conformity with accounting
pnnciptss and practices that are recognized
as sound and have attained general acceptance The requirement that the opinion be
rendered
by an Independent
accountant,
which was Initially established under the Secuntres Act, IS designed to secure for the
benefrt of public Investors the detached objectivny and the skill of a knowledgeable,
protessronal person not connected With man.
agement
The accounting staff reviews the nnancral
statements filed With the Oomrmsston to insure that the requtred standards
are observed and that the accounting and auditing
procedures do not remain static In the face of
changes and new developments In fmancral
and economic conditions, New methods of
domg busmess. new types of business, the
combmmq of old businesses, the use of more
sophisticated
secunnes, and other mnovatlons create accounting problems which require a constant reappraisal of the procedures

Relations With the Accounting
Profession
In order to keep abreast of changing conditions, and In recognition of the need for a
continuous exchange of views and Information between the Cornrrussron's accountmg
staff and outside accountants regarding appropriate accounting and auditing polrcies,
procedures and practices, the staff maintains
continuing contact With mdivrdual accountants
and various protessronat organizations
The
latter Include the American lnstitute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the FInancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB),
the pnncipat protessronal organizations concerned With the development and Improvement of accounting and audltmg standards
and practices
The Chief Accountant
also
meets regularly With his counterparts In other
regulatory agencies to Improve coordination
on pohcies and actions among the agencies
Because of ItS many foreign registrants and
the vast and Increasing foreign operations of
American companies, the Cornrmssron has
an Interest In the Improvement of accounting
and auditing pnnoples and procedures on an
mternational
baSIS To promote such irn-

provement,
the Chief Accountant
corresponds WIth foreign accountants, Interviews
many who VISit this country and, on occasion,
participates In foreign and mternanonal accounting conferences.
Professional efforts are being made to Improve and harmonize accounting standards
among countries through various international accounting conferences and committees One committee, compnsed of representatives from thirty-five countnes, was established to promulgate International accounting
standards ThiS committee has adopted three
standards, has proposed a number of other
standards and IS developing additional proposals. The Commission will continue to cooperate closely With these committees and
groups which have as their long-term objecnve the development of a coordinated worldwide accounting
protession
With uniform
standards

Accounting and AUditing
Standards
The FASB supplanted the Accounting Pnnoples Board of the AICPA In 1973 as the
professional organization which establishes
standards of financial accounting and presentation for the gUidance of Issuers of financial
statements and pubhc accountants who examine such statements
The organization
was established on the baSIS of recommendations by a committee appointed by the
AICPA to explore ways of Improving this
function. The FASB IS compnsed of seven
full-time salaried members who are appointed
by a financial accounting foundation that IS
sponsored
by the AICPA and consists of
representatives of leading professional orgaruzanons The foundation also appoints the
members of an advrsory counol to the Board
who serve on a voluntary baSIS The Commrssron endorsed" the FASB, which It believes Will provide operational effrcrenoes and
Insure an Impartial viewpomt In the development of accounllng standards on a timely
baSIS, and stated that the FASB's statements
and interpretations would be considered as
being substantrat authontative support for an
accounting practice or procedure
As of June 3D, 1976, the FASB had Issued
twelve Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards and nine Interpretations relating to

accounting opinions or standards In addition,
It had under active consrderatron a heavy
agenda of technical projects which Included
nnanoal repornnq for segments of a busrness
enterpnse, accounting for leases, cntena for
determining
matenallty,
conceptual
framework for accounting and reporting, financial
reporting
In Units of general
purcnasrnq
power, busmess
combmations
and purchased intangibles,
accounting for Interest

accounting for the cost of pension plans, fmancral accounting and reporting
In the extractive industries, mtenrn fmancia!
reporting, classmcanon of preferred stock,
and accounting

It had held public
hearings on SIX of the projects and had
Issued exposure drafts of three proposed
statements of standards
The FASB has appointed a permanent
screening committee to assist It In IdentIfying
emerging practice problems, evaluating their
magnitude and urgency, and assessing pnonties for their resolunon The Chief Accountant
and the FASB maintain liaison procedures for
consultation on projects of either the Board or
the SEC which are of mutual Interest. Specral
liaison procedures have been established regarding the financial accounting and reporting
In the extractive mdustnes, because the Energy Policy and Conservation
Act of 1975
authonzss
the Commission
to assure the
development and observation of accounting
practices by companies engaged In the production of crude 011 or natural gas by December 1977 In carrying out these responsibilities, the Cornrnrssron IS required to consult
With the Federal Energy Adrrurustranon, the
General Accounting Office, and the Federal
Power Cornrrussron. and It IS authorized to
rely on accountrnq practices developed by
the FASB, If the Cornrrusston IS assured that
such practices Will be observed to the same
extent as If the Commission had prescnbed
such practices by rule
When the FASB Issues Improved standards of accounting and financial reporting, the
Cornrrussron revises ItS rules and regulations
to conform to the Improved standards
For
example, amendments to ItS regulations were
adopted? to effect conformity With the standards established In FASB Statement Nos 2
and 7. "Accounting for Research and Devel-

65

opment Costs" and "Accounling and ReportIng by Development Stage Enterprises."
The AICPA appointed another committee
to study and refine the objectives of fmancral
statements. It considered the baste questions
of who needs nnancral statements, what information should be provided, how It should
be communicated, and how much of It can be
provided through the accounting
process
The committee's report on the objectives of
finanoal statements IS being utihzed by the
FASB as the baSIS of ItS study of t~ conceptual framework for accounting and reporting
More recently, the AICPA established an
Independent "Commission
on Auditor's Responsitnlrtres"
which IS studymg the role of
Independent auditors to Identify auditors' responsrbrhtres
In relation to the needs and
reasonable expectations of users of fmanoal
statements and to recommend acnons that
the protession should take to assure that
Independent
auditors discharge
those responsibumes adequately
This Cornrrussion has published a statement of the Issues bemg considered In this
study which are summarized
In four categOries below.

TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939
This Act requires that bonds, debentures,
notes and Similar debt secuntres offered for
pubnc sale, except as specifically exempted,
be Issued under an Indenture which meets
the requirements of the Act and has been
dUly qualified With the Commission
The provisrons of the Act are closely Integrated With the requirements of the Secuntres
Act Registration pursuant to the Securities
Act of secunnes to be Issued under a Irust
Indenture subject to the Trust Indenture Act IS
not permitted to become effective unless the
Indenture conforms 10 the requirements of the
latter Act, desiqned to safeguard the rights
and interests of the purchasers
Moreover,
specified Information about the trustee and
the Indenture must be Included In the registration statement
The Act was passed after studies by the
Commission had revealed the frequency With
which trust Indentures failed to provide minimum protections
for securrty holders and
absolved so-called trustees from minimum
obligations In the discharge of the trusts. It
requires, among other things, that the Indenture trustee be a corporation With a minimum
combined capital and surplus and be free of
conflicting Interests which might Interfere With
the fBithful exercise of ItS duties on behalf of
Ihe purchasers of the secunnes, and It Imposes high standards of conduct and responsrbrhty on the trustee DUring fiscal year 1976,
397 trust Indentures relating to sscunnes In
the aggregate amount of 25 75 billion were
filed

INFORMATION FOR PUBLIC
INSPECTION; FREEDOM OF
INFORMATION ACT
On November 21, 1974, Congress passed
over President Ford's veto amendments to
the Freedom of Information Act 37 which Significantly changed the procedures governmg
the handling oJ requests made pursuant to
the Freedom of lntorrnatron Act (5 USC.
552) as well as the scope of certain of the
exemptions from the Act's provisrons These
amendments became effective February 19,
1975 The Cornrnrssron amended ItS rules
under the Freedom of Information Act (17
CFR 200 80) 38 to reflect the amended provi-

sions of the Freedom of Information
Act,
these rules specify the categones of available
materials and those categones of records
that are generally
considered
non public
These rules establish the procedure to be
followed In requesling records or copies and
provides for a method of administrative appeal from the denial of access to any record.
They also provide for the irnposmon of duplicating fees and search fees when more than
one-half man-hour of work IS performed by
the Commission's staff to locate and make
records available In addition to the records
descnbed, the Commission makes available
for inspection and copying all requests for noaction and Interpretative letters received after
December 31, 1970, and responses thereto
(17 CFR 20080). Also made available since
November 1, 1972 are matenals filed under
Proxy Rule 14a-8(d), which deals with proposals offered by shareholders for mclusron
In management
proxy-soliciting
matenats,
and related matenals prepared by the staff
(17 CFR 20082)
FollOWing the effective date of the amendments to the Freedom of Information Act, the
Commission instituted the practice of ISSUing
a public release, In a senes desiqnated Freedom of Information Act Releases, In most
administrative appeals decided under the Act
The Commission hopes that thrs senes of
releases Will serve to Inform the public as to
ItS disclosure pohcies under the Freedom of
Information Act and of the manner In which It
has Interpreted and applied the Act to the
many types of records maintained by the
Commission
Most of the administrative appeals decided
by the Commission from the effective date of
the amendments to the close of the fiscal
year were concerned With Investigatory records The seventh exempli on of the Act, as
amended, provides that the Freedom of Information Act "does not apply" to such records
to the extent that their production would "interfere With enforcement proceedings," "depnve a person of a nght to a fair tnal or an
irnparnal aojudicanon." "constitute an unwarranted mvasron of personal
privacy,"
or
cause other types of harm spscmcauy enumerated In the exemption The Commission,
In the administrative appeals It has decided,
has determined that investigatory records Will
generally be Withheld on the ground that

production Will "Interfere With enforcement
proceedings" only If judicral or administrative
proceedings brought by the Commission or
other law enforcement authonnes are In progress or there IS a concrete prospect that law
enforcement proceedings Will be Instituted. 39
EVidentiary matenals contained In investigatory files closed after the completion of public
law enforcement proceedings Will generally
be available to any person requesting access
to them 40 In those cases where Investigations are closed by the Commission Without
the institution of public enforcement action,
the Commission has recognized that considerations of personal pnvacy often require that
such records not be disclosed to members of
the public,41 except where a demonstration of
particulanzed need for access to the records
sufftcient to outweigh consideranons of personal pnvacy has been made 42
decRegistration statements, apphcanons,
larations, and annual and pen odic reports

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
ACT LITIGATION
In The Bureau of National AffairS, Inc, et
al v SEC,43 the Commission was named In a
SUit seeking access to the evidennary materials contained In certam Commission mvesngatory files which had been closed on the
baSIS of an mformal agreement or undertakIng With the subjects of the investigation
Plarnnfts also sought access to portions of
the rnternal memoranda which formed the
baSIS of the Commission's decisron to close
the mvesnqatrons
In denying access to the
evrdennary materials In these files, the Comrrnssron claimed that they were exempt from
disclosure because disclosure would be an
unwarranted invasron of the personal privacy
of the mdrviduals named m the flles.44 The
requested portions of the Internal memoranda
were Withheld on the ground that they expressed the opinions and recommendations
of the author, and were therefore exempt
from compelled disclosure 45
In April 1976, the Uruted States Supreme
Court ISSUed ItS opinion In Department of the
Air Force v Rose, 46 interpreting the scope of
the FOIA exemptions for mvasrons of personal privacy The Court In Rose mdicated
that blanket exernptrons were not permitted
by the Act, rather, an agency's efforts to
protect against mvasions of personal privacy
should be limited to deleting names and
Identifying
details, even where there was
some risk that disclosure of the material In
that form would disclose the Identities of the
persons concerned
As a result of the Supreme Court's oecrsion
In Rose, the Commission
re-examined
ItS
posnon In the pending litigation and deterrrnned to disclose to plaintiffs the evidentiary
materials contamed In the particular group of
files In Issue, subject to the deletion of names
and IdentifYing details of persons against

whom no Informal action was taken Plaintiffs
thereupon amended their complaint to drop
their claim to the material deleted from the
mternal memoranda In question. On July 26,
1976, the district court ordered "that the case
be marked settled on the merits," and further
ordered that counsel
fees and costs of
$5,013 be awarded to the plamntts
In Anton, et al v. Secunttes and Exchange
Comtmsston.v plaintiffs, who were respondents In a public administrative
proceeding
Instituted by the Oommrssion " sought the
disclosure of all the materials contained In or
relating to the Cornrmssion's
proceeding
Certain of the requested material was made
available, but other records were Withheld on
the basis of Exemptions
5 and 7 of the
FOIA 49 After a hearing on August 26, 1975,
the United States District Court entered an
order, rUling that all of the records In Issue
were properly
Withheld
pursuant
to the
FOIA's exemptive provrsions. Plaintiffs took
an appeal from the district court's decisron, 50
but dropped their appeal after the Issues had
been briefed.
In Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,
Inc v, S E.C ,51 plaintiff, also a respondent In
a Commission
administrative
proceeding,
sued to compel release of various records
under the FOIA Plalnbff also sought a prelimmary Injunction against continuation of the
administrative proceeding pending resolution
of ItS FOIA claims. On May 27, 1976, Judge
Gasch of the District Court for the District of
Columbia declined to Issue the preliminary
injunction The court has not yet ruled on the
Issue of plaintiff's entitlement to the records In

quesnon.
The plaintiff In Bast v SEC 52 was seekIng access to various portions of Internal
memoranda WIthheld by the Comrrussron on
the ground that they reflected the opinions
and recommendations
of members of the
staff FollOWIng an In camera Inspection of
the records In question. the court ruled on
May 27, 1976, that all of the Withheld records
were properly Withheld In accordance With
Exemption 5 of the FOIA.53
In Todd & Co v Mason,54 plaintiffs are
seeking various materials from the files of the
National ASSOCiation of Securitres Dealers,
Inc. (NASD) concerning orsciphnary proceedIngs Instituted by the NASD against them.
Proceeding on the theory that the NASD IS an

"agency" of the Federal govemment as that
term IS defined In the FO/A,55 Todd & Co
materials
requested, from the Cornrnrssron,
relating to certain specmed NASD posrnons
and pohcres Which, It IS claimed, the NASD
would be required to maintain and either
publish or make publicly available
If the
NASD were a Federal agency Todd & Co
claimed that the Cornrrussron IS either required to maintain the requested records for
the NASD or to take steps to require the
NASD to do so After the Comrrussron denied
their administrative appeal of the Initial staff
determination made WIth respect to their request, 56 Todd & Co amended the complaint
In their pending SUit against the NASD to
Include the Cornmrssron as a defendant The
Cornrrussron has filed a motion to disrruss the
action or, In the alternative,
for summary
Judgment, which the court had not ruled upon
at the close of the fiscal year

REGULATION OF EXCHANGES
Registration
The Secunnes Exchange Act generally requires a secunties exchange to register With
the Commission as a national secunlies exchange unless the Commission, acting pursuant to Section 5 of the Act, exempts It from
registration because of the limited volume of
ItS transacnons 2 As of June 30, 1976, the
follOWing eleven secunnes exchanges were
registered With the Commission
Amencan Stock Exchange, Inc
Boston Stock Exchange
Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc
cmcmnan Stock Exchange
Detroit Stock Exchange
Intermountain Stock Exchange
Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc
New York Stock Exchange, Inc
Pacmc Stock Exchange, Inc.
Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc J

On October 16, 1975, the Commission,
pursuant to Section 19(a)(3) of the Act, ISsued orders withdrawmq the registrations of
the National Stock Exchange and the Board
of Trade of the City of Chicago as national
securmes exchanges The National Stock Exchange had ceased operations on January
31, 1975, while the Executive Committee of

bonds, Pacific, twenty-one stocks and two
bonds, Boston, ten stocks, Philadelphia, Midwest and Detroit, five stocks each 6
The Commission also granted the application of two Issuers to withdraw their securities
from listing and registration on the Boston
Stock Exchange

Delisting

Unlisted Trading Privileges

Pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securmes
Exchange Act, a security may be stricken
from listing and registration with a national
secunnes exchange upon the exchange's application to the Commission, or may be withdrawn from listing and registration upon the
application of ItS Issuer, In accordance with
the rules of the exchange and upon such
terms as the Commission may Impose for the
protection of Investors
Hrstoncally, It has
been the Commission's view that in evaluatIng deli sting applications, It IS not generally
the Commission's
function to substitute ItS
judgment for that of an exchange, and that
where there has been full compliance with
the rules of an exchange with respect to
dehstmq, the Commission IS required to grant
a deli sting application
The authonty of the
Commission In such cases IS limited to the
Imposition of terms deemed necessary for the
protection of Investors 5
The standards for deli sting vary among the
exchanges, but generally deli sting actions are
based on one or more of the Iollowmq factors (1) the number of pubhcly-held shares or
shareholders IS tnsuffrcient (often as a result
of an acqursmon or merger) to support a
broad-based trading market, (2) the market
value of the outstanding shares or the trading
volume IS Inadequate, (3) the company no
longer satisfies the exchange's listing criteria
with respect to earnings or financial condition;
or (4) required reports have not been filed
WIth the exchange
DUring the fiscal year, the Commission
granted exchange applications for the delistIng of 181 stock Issues and twenty-two bond
Issues In the wake of ItS decrsion to withdraw
ItS registration as a national secunues exchange, the National Stock Exchange applied
to strike eighty-five stock and three bond
Issues from "sting and registration Applications granted other exchanges totaled Amencan, twenty-seven
stocks and two bonds,
New York, twenty-three
stocks and fifteen

Prior to the 1975 Amendments,
Section
12(f) of the Secunties Exchange Act provided
that a nanonal securities exchange might,
upon application to and approval by the Comrrussron, extend unlisted trading privileges to
any security listed and registered on another
national
securities
exchange
The 1975
Amendments broadened the section to encompass secuntres not listed on any exchange, other textual changes were Intended
to express congressional
concern over the
Impact of unlisted trading on the development
of a national system, and to clanfy that such
applications may not be granted If the effect
would be to restnct competition 7 At the time
the 1975 Amendments
were enacted, the
Boston Stock Exchange ("BSE") had pending
an application for unlisted trading privileges In
the common stock of Ludlow Corporation,
which was already listed on the New York
Stock Exchange ("NYSE") 8 FollOWing notice
of BSE's application, Ludlow Corporation filed
an objection to the granting of BSE's application and requested a public heanng on the
matter On June 25, 1975, the Commission,
pursuant to Section 12(f)(2) of the Act, ordered that a public heanng be held concernIng BSE's application 9
The Ludlow matter represents the first application for unlisted trading privileges to be
contested since the adoption of the 1975
Amendments and also the first such application which has become the SUbject of an
administrative
proceeding In approximately
30 years Ludlow asserted that (I) the Act
requires BSE to show that It would establish
a trading market In Ludlow stock, (II) such a
market would not divert trading volume from
the "pnmary market" (NYSE) In a manner
disruptive to the fair and orderly market currently maintained
on the NYSE, and (III)
transactions In Ludlow stock occurring on the
BSE WIthout clearing the NYSE specialist's
book would not be inconsistent with the protection of Investors BSE and the Cornmts-

sion's staff both asserted that (I) the secnon
12(f)(2) standard requires only that the applicant demonstrate that an appropnate medium
for trading the subject secunty exrsts on Its
exchange (without necessanly demonstrating
that active trading or a particular type of
market will automatically
develop), (II) the
emphasis on competition evident In the 1975
Amendments outweighs possible concerns of
diversion of trading volume from exrstmq pnmary markets. and (III) the 1975 Amendments
and subsequent
Implementation
thereof by
the Commission have established that the
development of a national market system IS
the proper means for protection of Investors'
limit orders on specialists' books
On May 6, 1976, a Commission Administrative Law Judge Issued an Initial Decision
granting SSE's application. 10 The lrnnal DeCIsion held that Section 12(f) and Rule 121-1
thereunder require only a minimal showinq by
the applicant exchange, namely, that there
exrsts a degree of local Interest In the subject
secunty, that the applicant exchange rnamtams rules and practices which assure a fair
and orderly market In the stock should a
market develop on that exchange, and that
the subject secunty currently trades In a fair
and orderly fashion The Administrative Law
Judge noted that the 1975 Amendments create a presumption In favor of compsnnon and
thereby rrururruze the extent to which potential
diversion of trading volume should be considered, and refused to find that tradmg of
LUdlow stock on the SSE, In Circumvention of
public limit orders on the NYSE, would be
mconsrstent with the protection of Investors
The Comrrussron
subsequently
granted
Ludlow's Petition for Hevrew of the lrutral
Decisron and the matter IS currently pending
before the Cornrmssron

Exchange Disciplinary Actions
Section 19(d) of the Secunnes Exchange
Act, added by the 1975 Amendments,
requires exchanges to report to the Commission for ItS review any final disciplinary sanction Imposed by an exchange that (I) dentes
membership or parnopanon to any applicant,
(II) prohibits or limits access to services offered by an exchange or member thereof, or
(III) Imposes final drsctplmary sanctions on
any person associated with a member or bars

any person from becoming associated with a
member
Dunng the fiscal year, five exchanges reported to the Cornrrussron a total of 198
separate disciplinary actions, Including the
irnposrtron In 117 cases of fines ranging from
$100 to $20,000, the admomshment of SIXteen mdrvrduals, the suspension from membership (for periods ranging from one week to
five years) of three member orqaruzanons
and twenty-rune Individuals, the censure of
eight member firms and twenty-seven mdividuals, the bamng of twenty-eight mdrviduals
and the expulsion of two Individuals and one
member firm

Exchange Rules
As previously reported."
the 1975 Amendments added to the Secunties Exchange Act
the requirement that self-regulatory
orqaruzations file With the Cornrrussron any proposed rule or change In an exrstrnq rule
accompamed by a concise statement of the
baSIS and purpose of the proposed
rule
change 12 Thrs requirement applies to the
rules of exchanges as well as rules of the
NASD, cleanng agencies and the Municipal
Securities Rulemaklng Soard 13 In general,
the Cornrrussron IS required to publish nonce
of the proposed rule change and to give
Interested parties an opportunity to submit
their views concerning
the proposal
Proposed rule changes may not take effect unless approved by the Commission (with the
exception of certain types of rule changes,
such as interpretations
of exrstrnq rules,
which are permitted to take effect Without
Cornrrussron review, subject to the Commission's powers under Section 19(c) of the
Sacuntres Exchange Act to abrogate such
rule changes)
On August 19, 1975, the Cornrrussron
adopted 14 Rule 19b-4 and related Forms
19b-4A and 19b-4S, which provide procedures for self-regulatory orqaruzanons to file
proposed rule changes for the Cornrrussron's
approval
or to give notice of those rule
changes which may take effect Without Comrrussion approval The rule also provides the
self-regulatory orqarnzations With cntena by
which they may determine which of their
pohcres, practices and Interpretations
are
deemed to be rules for the purpose of the

79
I'

!

filing requuernent. Furthermore,
it specifies
the procedures to be followed by the Comupon proposed
rule
rrussron In passing
changes.
DUring the fiscal year, the Commission
received 196 submissions
from exchanges
Involving a variety of rules and stated policies The Iollowmp were among the more
signifIcant
rule changes approved by the
Commission.
1 The NYSE adopted two rule changes
affecting previously fixed listing and dell sting
standards. The first provided for semi-annual
downward adjustment In the listing and dehstIng cntena for publicly-held shares based on
fluctuations In the NYSE Composite Index
The second rule change provided alternative
numerical standards for listing the securities
of companies which are not organized under
the laws of the United States, these standards are significantly higher than those required of domestic Issuers
2 Three exchanges submitted rule proposals to implement or expand automated order
routing and execution systems The Midwest
Stock Exchange
("MSE")
adopted
rule
changes to convert ItS "MAX" program for
automatic execution of certain market orders
from a pilot to a permanent program The
NYSE adopted rule changes to Implement ItS
Desiqnated Order Turnaround ("DOT") System to expedite automated routing of 100share market orders to NYSE specialists, and
the Pacmc Stock Exchange
("PSE")
expanded ItS automated order routing and execution system ("COMEX") to handle orders
up to 300 shares
3. The NYSE amended various rules to
permit NYSE specialists to become odd-lot
dealers In their respective assigned Issues
4 Pursuant to the requirements of Section
6(e) of the Securities
Exchange
Act, as
amended, all of the national securities exchanges amended their rules to abolish fixed
odd-lot differentials as well as those provrsions requiring the Imposition of a differential
on all odd-lot orders In addition, these exchanges have amended their rules to provide
for competitive commission
rates on Intramember transactions
5 The Chicago Board Options Exchange
("CBOE"), the Philadelphia Stock Exchange
("Phlx") and the Cincinnati Stock Exchange
("CSE") amended their organizational
rules

80

to provide for the participation of at least one
public director (or governor) on their respec
nve boards.
6 The PSE amended ItS rules to institute a
pilot program for competitive market making
In one Issue which IS dually listed and traded
on the PSE and two other national securities
exchanges
7. All national
securities
exchanges
amended their trading rules to conform to
Securities Exchange Act Rule 19c-1, which
decrees the phased elimination of exchange
restncuons on off-board transactions In exchange secunnes 15
8. The Commission did not object to Initiation of trading In the same class 16 of options
by more than one exchange (dual trading). 17
Presently, options which are the subject of
dual trading must have the same expiration
dates and exercise pnces on one exchange
• as those of the same class which are traded
on another exchange. Thus, members of the
public are able to "shop markets" to place
orders for Identical option contracts In the
market where they receive best execution 18

EXCHANGE INSPECTIONS
NYSE Specialist Surveillance
Inspection
From JUly 30 through August 1, 1975,
members of the Commission staff conducted
an inspection of the NYSE's Market Surveillance DIVISion The purpose of the inspection
was to determine the extent, If any, to which
NYSE specialists were engaged In the practices of "print splitting"
and "narrowing
spreads "'9 As the fiscal year closed, the
staff was currently reviewing documents and
data compiled dUring the course of the inspection to determine the effectiveness of the
NYSE's rules and surveillance
program In
thrs area

American Stock Exchange
Arbitration Inspection
On January 26-28, 1976, members of the
Commission staff conducted an inspection of
the Amencan Stock Exchange ("Amex") Department of Arbitration
The purpose of the
Inspection was to review and evaluate the
Amex arbitration
program
to determine
whether It provrdes a fair procedure through

which the Interests of the public and Investors
are protected. The inspection Included review
of the administration of such matters by the
Amex staff, the selection and composition of
arbitration panels, types of cases and Issues
Involved, and the appropriateness of awards.
Subsequently, the staff made the follOWing
recommendations
to the Director of the Department of Arbitration:
1 That the Amex delete that portion of ItS
Rule 602 wrnch, In cases where the amount
In controversy exceeds $1,000, permits the
Director to appoint a five person arbitration
panel, four of whom would be connected With
the secunnes Industry. In addition, the staff
suggested that public claimants be entitled to
a panel composed entirely of persons haVing
no affiliation WIth the secunnes Industry.
2 That the Amex resume ItS past practice
of making a record of arbitration proceedings,
to assist any party Wishing to appeal the
decision to the courts and to aid the Commission In the performance of ItS oversight responsibilities.
3 That the Amex resume ItS past practice
of requiring ItS Conduct Divrsion to review
arbitration proceedings to determine whether
disophnary action against the member may
be warranted, parncularty where the decisron
IS rendered against the member firm.
4 That the exchange's
advertismq and
pubhc relations programs be expanded to
Inform the public more adequately
of the
availability of ItS arbitration facilities.

On February 17-19,1976, members of the
Cornmrssron staff conducted an Inspection of
the Boston Stock Exchange ("BSE"), focusIng on the BSE's market surveillance program, floor procedures and performance of
the BSE's specialists In securities traded on
the BSE pursuant to unlisted trading pnvrleges In addinon, the staff examined BSE's
Internal operating and disciplinary procedures
and reviewed disciplinary and arbitration proceedings conducted by the BSE In recent
years. Issues raised by the Inspection were
under analysis at the end of the fiscal year

staff Informed the NYSE of findings after ItS
Inspection of the NYSE Department of Enforcement
The Inspection was Intended to
evaluate the Department's
effectiveness
In
Investigating and prosecuting rule Violations
by members, member firms and registered
employees.
In ItS letter, the staff requested the Department's views as to what factors (Including
working conditions and salaries) may account
for the turnover20 of enforcement attorneys
and what steps the Department believes can
be taken to Improve the srtuation The staff
recommended that consideratron be given to
filling an enforcement attorney vacancy and a
vacant special counsel POSition In order to
enable the Department to maintain the resources required to Investigate and prosecute
a relatively large number of cases. It was
further suggested that the Department develop procedures for utihzinq the examining
staff of the Member Surveillance DIVISion to
gather evidence pertinent to a case under
mvesnqanon and to determine whether rule
Violations are Widespread Within a firm
The staff also recommended the maintenance of flow charts or other appropriate
records tracking the progress of Investigations through their final drsposmon, In order to
assure that investigations are handled expeditiously and formal charges, where necessary, are filed timely In order to assist the
Cornrrussion In the exercise of ItS oversiqht
responsibrsnes, the staff recommended that
the Department make more detailed closmq
records of cases In which no drsciphnary
aclJon IS taken. The staff suggested further
that after the Department had become reasonably current In the handling of ItS present
"major cornplamt'V" caseload, the gUidelines
applicable to NYSE Rule 351, which requires
the prompt reporting by member firms of rule
VIolations, lawsurts and vanous other matters
mvolvmq member firms and their registered
employees,
be amended downward to increase the number of Significant claims reported. Finally, It was recommended that the
Department resume ItS review of arbitration
cases, Inasmuch as such proceedings are a
valuable source of possible rule Violations

of the Commission's staff Inspected certain
aspects of the Amex's options pilot program,
with special attention given to activities of
option traders and to Amex's surveillance of
such acnvmes The staff sought to determine,
among other things, the extent to which option traders were discharging the affirmative
obligations Imposed by Amex rules to maintain fair and orderly markets. 22
The Inspection revealed that Amex needed
a procedure for ascertaining whether one or
more opnon traders were present In a trading
crowd and thereby subject to affirmative tradIng obligations. In consuitanon with the Commission staff, Amex adopted a rule and related surveillance procedures requmnq that at
least one option trader be present In the
crowd when a customer's order IS executed
by a floor broker 23 The rule gives Amex a
more effective means of determining whether
unsatisfactory
market conditions exist and
whether such conditions are attnbutable to
the failure of option traders to discharge their
affirmative responsronrtres.

Philadelphia Stock Exchange
Options Program InSPeCtion
On August 27, 1975, members of the Commission's staff conducted an inspection of the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange ("Phlx") to determine whether the Exchange's faCilities and
surveillance programs were adequate to accommodate the expansion of ItS recently establlshed24 option trading program 25 Speciat
attention was given to an examination
of
Phlx's floor taouues and the ability of floor
personnel to keep quotations current, report
trades, and conduct orderly options trading.
The staff team concluded that the operational aspects of the Phlx option pilot program
were satisfactory and that the organizational
framework of the Exchange's regulatory and
surveillance programs appeared adequate to
accommodate expansion It was noted, however, that more comprehensive
assessment
of the Phlx's regulatory and surveillance systems could not be made until ItS options pilot
program achieved higher trading volume and
a larger number of opnon classes.

staff conducted an inspection of the Chicago
Board Options Exchange ("CBOE")
which
focused pnmanly on CBOE's regUlatory and
surveillance programs. Special attention was
devoted to CBOE's evaluation of the performance of ItS market makers and board brokers and allocation of option classes to those
members. The staff found that CBOE's performance In the area of floor member evaluation had Improved considerably
since the
time of the Oornrrussron staff's last mspectlon.26
The Inspection also revealed Significant
new developments In CBOE's market surveillance program. At the time of the mspscnon,
CBOE was In the process of restructuring this
program to Include methods employed by the
NYSE to monitor stock trading In periods of
unusual market activity. The staff suggested
that CBOE's current procedures not be discarded until the new procedures have been
fUlly evaluated.
The inspection
of CBOE's Investigation
Section 27 led to staff recommendations
that
CBOE adopt a system enabling It to maintain
records more fully descnbmq Instances In
which market makers are given psrmlssron to
trade at variance With their obligations
to
maintain fair and orderly markets.28 Members
of the CBOE staff stated that they would
Institute a procedure for keeping such records.
The staff also sought to determine the
extent to which CBOE members engaged In
"front-running"
of blocks,29 "up-ticking"
(or
"down-ticking")
at the close of buslness30
and prearranged
spread transacnons. 31 At
the time of the inspection, CBOE appeared to
have made progress In establishing surveillance programs for the detection of these
practices.
The Oornrmssron staff paid particular attennon to CBOE's surveillance program for detecting members' holding POSitions In excess
of the maximum limits set forth In CBOE's
rules.32 The Commission's
staff suggested
that CBOE faCIlitate Its review procedures by
arranging to have POSition reports sent on a
regular baSIS to its Trading Procedure Department as well as to ItS Compliance Department.

SUPERVISION OF NASD
2-4, 1975, the Oornrrussion

The Secunnes

Exchange Act provrdes that

an assooanon of brokers and dealers may be
registered with the Commission as a national
secunnes association If It meets the standards and requirements
for the registration
and operation of such associations contained
In Section 15A of the Act. The Act contemplates that such assooranons will serve as a
medium for self-regulation
by over-thecounter brokers and dealers. In order to be
eligible for registration, an assooation's rules
must be desiqned to protect Investors and the
public Interest, to promote Just and equitable
pnnaples of trade and to meet other statutory
requirements
Registered securities associations operate under the Cornrrussron's general supervisory autnonty, which Includes the
power to review disciplinary actions taken by
an assocratron, to approve or disapprove
changes In the association's
rules and to
abrogate, alter or supplement such rules The
National ASSOCiation of Secunties Dealers,
Inc. ("NASD"), IS the only such associanon
registered With the Commission
under the
Act
In adopting legislation to permit the formation and registration
of national sscunnes
assooanons, Congress provided an incentive
to membership by permitting such associations to adopt rules precluding any member
from dealing With a nonmember broker or
dealer except on the same terms and conditions and at the same pnces as the member
deals With the general public The NASD has
adopted such rules As a practical matter,
therefore, membership IS necessary for profitable pamcpanon In many underwnnnqs since
members properly may grant only to other
members pnce concessions, discounts and
Similar allowances not granted to the general
public.
By the close of the fiscal year, 2,928 brokers and dealers were NASD members, a
decrease of Sixty-three members dunng the
year. This loss reflects the net result of 303
adrrussrons to and 366 terminations of membership. The 1975 Amendments provide, for
the first time, for the registration With the
Cornrrussron of muruopal secunnes protsssronats, consequently,
approximately
250
rnurucipal secunnes brokers and dealers became members of the NASD. The number of
members' branch offices decreased by fortyfour to 5,968 as a result of the opening of 916
new offices and the closinq of 960. Dunng the

fiscal year, the number of registered representatives and prmcipats (which categones
Include all partners, officers, traders, salesmen and other persons employed by or affiliated With member firms In capacmes which
require registration) decreased by 2,984 to
194,718 as of June 30, 1976. This decrease
reflects the net result of 14, 793 Initial registrations, 16,633 re-reqrstranons and 34,410
terminations of registrations dunnq the year.
DUring the fiscal year, the NASD adrrurustered 40,762 qualification
exarmnanons, of
which 14,295 were for NASD qualification,
2,025 for the Cornrrussron's SECO program33
and the balance for other agenaes, including
major exchanges and vanous state secunnes
requlators

NASD Rules
Prior to the 1975 Amendments, the Securities Exchange Act required the NASD to file
for Cornmrssron review copies of proposed
rules or rule amendments 30 days pnor to
their proposed effectiveness. The Commission could disapprove them If It found them
mconsistent With the requirements of the Act
Otherwise, the Cornrmssron would Issue a
statement to the effect that It had reViewed
such proposed rules or rule amendments and
had "not disapproved" them Moreover, the
Comrrussron would generally review, In advance of pubncanon, general policy statements, directives and interpretations Issued
by the NASD Board of Governors pursuant to
ItS powers to administer and Interpret NASD
rules
Section 19(b) of the Act, as amended by
the 1975 Amendments, gave the Comrmssron
more exphcrt oversrqht authonty over the
NASD's rule making processes (as well as
those of other self-regulators) and provided
further statutory cntena for such Cornrmssron
oversrqht 34 Proposed NASD rule changes
are now filed With the Cornrrussron. after
which the Cornrrussron generally has thirtyfive days from the time the notice of the
proposal has been published In which to
approve the proposal, or to institute proceedIngs to determine
whether
the proposal
should be disapproved.
If the Cornrrussion
finds good cause for Immediate approval
upon filing, and publishes ItS reasons for so
finding, the Commission
may approve the

83

..
:I
1:1

, II

proposed rule change or amendment prior to
the thirtieth day after publication.
DUring the fiscal year, numerous proposed
changes to NASD rules were submitted to the
Commission for ItS consrderanon, Among the
major filings which the Commission approved
were.
(1) Adoption of a new interpretation and
explanation by the Board of Governors of
Artrde III, Sections 1, 27 and 28 of the NASD
Rules of Fair Practice concerning personal or
private secunnes transactions by persons associated with a member firm and such member's responsibility to supervise such transactions. The new Interpretation and explanation
IS desiqned (1) to give an NASD member
notice of the private secunnes activlues of ItS
associated persons (2) to give notice to persons associated with a member that their
Involvement In private securities transactions
outside the scope of their assocration with the
member may require their reqrstranon as brokers, dealers or Investment advisers under
Federal or state securities laws, and (3) to
acvise members of their obligations to supervise the private secunnes transactions of their
associated persons In thrs regard, an associated person contemplating such transactions
IS required to notify the member In writing of
rus Intention, which notice provides a mechanism to assist members In satisfying their
supervisory responsibilities
The new Interpretanon appeared necessary In view of past
Instances of private securities transactions
mvofvmq associated persons In which customers mistakenly believed that the transacnon was sponsored by the member
(2) Adoption of new Article XVIII of the
NASD's By-Laws and Schedule G thereunder
concerning, among other things, the reporting
of transactions
In eligible seeurrtres In the
consolidated
transaction
reporting system
(the "consolidated system") contemplated by
Secuntrss EXchange Act Rule 17a-15,35 and
ann-marupulanon
rules relating to over-thecounter trading In such securities The new
requirements provide that pnnopal transactions effected by NASD members must be
reported In the consolidated system at the
price recorded on the trade ticket Without
taking Into account any cornrrussron, commission equrvalent, or differential
Imposed In
connection
With the transactron,
The new
procedures effectively eliminate the previous

84

disparity between the reporting of pnnopat
transactions effected by NASD members and
the reporting of Identical transacnons effected
on national secunnes exchanges
(3) Amendments to Schedule D under Article XVI of the NASD By-Laws to eliminate
capital requirements for market makers authonzed to enter quotations In the NASDAQ
(Natrona! ASSOCiation of Securities Dealers
Automated
Quotation)
System, to modify
block reporting requirements, to revise fees
for Level I NASDAQ usage, to reduce the
NASDAQ market maker requirements to requrre only one market maker (Instead of two)
for any security traded on NASDAQ, to outline procedures on limitation of access to the
NASDAQ System, and to permit the mdusion
In the NASDAQ System of securities Issued
by certain open-end Investment companies
registered under the Investment Company
Act The NASD eliminated the NASDAQ capital requirements because the recent amendments to Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c31 established an industry-wide
uniform net
capital rule 36 Moreover, In order to Improve
the NASD's market surveillance program and
to provide better Information to the public, the
NASD amended ItS block reporting regulalions to require dally reporting of the total
number of block transactions executed for all
Issues In which a firm IS a registered market
maker. With regard to the mclusion of certain
open-end
Investment
companies
In NASDAQ, It appeared that since shares of these
companies were not continuously offered and
were already traded In the over-the-counter
market, It was In the Interest of the investing
public to provide broader dissemination
of
quotations In such shares. Other admendments to Schedule D specify the reasons for
which the NASD may summarily limit or prohibit access to NASDAQ by Issuers and market makers, and outline the procedures for
NASD review of gnevances arising from such
action. Section 15A(h)(3) of the 1975 Amendments gives the NASD authority to take such
summary action under certain circumstances
(4) Amendments
to Schedule
D of the
NASD By-Laws to perrrut the mdusion In the
NASDAQ System of stabiliZing bids accompanied by penalty snpulanons. The penalty
stipulation IS Imposed by the underwriter of a
new Issue upon a participant
In a selling
group when the participant sells back to the

underwnter
shares which the former had
agreed to distribute In furtherance
of the
offenng In this situation, the penalty stipulation generally provides that the participant
forfeits ItS seiling concession on those shares
sold back to the underwriter
The NASD theretofore had considered a
stabiliZing bid qualified by a penalty stipulabon as not representing a "firm" quotation
(I e , the bid IS so conditioned that It does not
represent an opporturuty for certain members
to sell to the managing underwnter at the
quoted pnce) 37 However, the amendment to
Schedule D now permits inclusion In NASDAQ of a stabilizing bid accompanied by a
penalty stipulation, provided the stipulation
only depnves a member of the syndicate of
ItS seiling concession for any shares returned
to the managing underwriter via the stabihzIng bid

NASD Inspections
Dunng the fiscal year, the Commission's
staff Inspected the NASD's distnct offices in
the NASAtlanta, Boston and Cleveland.38
DAQ and Market Surveillance Departments
of the NASD's Washington headquarters, and
the NASD's Arbitration Department. located
In New York City. These inspections were
conducted as a part of the Commission's
contmuinq oversight of the NASD's performance of ItS self-regulatory
functions
The
Inspection program also IS desrqned to Improve coordination between NASD and Commission programs for regulation and enforcement activrnes In the over-the-counter
markets.
The NASD distnct office inspections by the
Commission
Involved a review of (1) the
composition and effectiveness of the Distnct
Cernrrnttees, the District BUSiness Conduct
Cornrruttees ("DBCC's"),
examination
subcommittees, nominating committees and quotations committees,
(2) the administrative
management and functioning of the distnct
staffs, especially their working relationships
with the vanous committees
comprised of
representatives of NASD member firms, (3)
the district staffs' cooperation with the Comrrussron's regional offices, the exchanges and
other Interested regulatory bodies Including
the state sscunnes regulators, (4) the effectiveness of NASD disciplinary
procedures,
and (5) the need, If any. for adoption of new

rules or amendments to existmq NASD or
Commission rules, or NASD policies and Interpretations
Problems encountered
dunnq
these Inspections Included (1) questions concerning the adequacy of enforcement of the
NASO's Mark-Up Polley by certain DSCC's.
(2) a need to generate greater consistency
with respect to the timely Initiation of drsciphnary proceedings and the seventy of sanctions Imposed, (3) Instances of msumcient
specncity In wntten decsrons rnernonahztnq
DBCC drsciplmary action, (4) the possible
need for greater representation
of non-exchange
member
firms
on the vanous
DBCC's, and (5) occasionally msutnerent administration and enforcement of the NASD's
in-firm supervision standards, All these problems were reviewed with representatives of
the NASD's National Office dUring the course
of the fiscal year, and appropriate correclive
action had been Initiated by year's end.
The objectives of the NASD Arbitration
Department Inspection were to review and
evaluate (1) the NASD's arbitration procedures to determine the quality and fairness of
ItS program, (2) the administrative procedures
used by the NASD arbitration staff, (3) the
selectron
and composrtron
of arbitration
panels to ensure the fairness of ItS proceedIngs and lack of orscnrnmanon, and to survey
(4) the types of cases and Issues Involved,
and (5) the awards made by the arbitration
panels The inspection revealed delays In the
processing
of disputes submitted
to the
NASD for arbitration The staff noted that as
of the inspection date, approximately
flftythree cases remained "open" or unresolved
Of trus number, thirty-three cases had remained open for periods ranging from SIX
months to a year after the date of their
subrrussron for arbitration At least one case
had been open for nearly two years. A meetIng With the NASD on this matter Will be
scheduled early In the coming fiscal year.
The inspection of NASD's NASDAQ operalJons39 revealed a need to Improve enforcement of the NASD's minimum requirements
of two market makersw and 500 shareholders of record for mclusion of a secunties
Issue on NASDAQ. and of the NASD's policy
With respect to "crossed markets"
The inspection also uncovered a delay In Implementing a NASDAQ "Bid Analysis Program"
which was deSigned In 1974 by the NASD

and the Commission to detect market manipulation. Finally, the undesirable consequences of the high tumover rate of personnel In NASDAQ's Market Surveillance Secnon was noted by the Commission's staff.
In subsequent drscussrons with the NASD's
representatives concerning Implementation of
the NASDAQ Bid-Analysts Program, the
NASD stated that It planned to start a pilot
program along these lines by September of
1976 The NASD also agreed to meet with
the Commission's market surveillance staff to
discuss the NASD's plans for the program
With respect to the personnel problems In
NASDAQ's Market Surveillance Section, the
NASD pointed out that thrs sscnon-c-pamcularly ItS antifraud department-Is now fully
staffed with experienced personnel, and IS
expected to be more effective In the future.
The inspection of the NASD's Arbitration
Department revealed delays In the processIng of disputes submitted to the NASD for
arbitration. The staff noted that as of the
inspection date, approximately fifty-three
cases remained "open" or unresolved Of thrs
number, thirty-three cases had remained
open for periods ranging from SIXmonths to a
year after the date of their submrssion for
arbitration At least one case had been open
for nearly two years. The NASD's Arbrtrauon
Department staff said that the main reasons
why these fifty-three cases remained open
were difficulties In scheduling mutually convenient hearing dates and delaying tactics by
certain parties to these proceedings A meetIng with the NASD on thrs matter Will be
scheduled early In the coming fiscal year

NASD Disciplinary Actions
The Commission receives from the NASD
copies of ItS dacisrons In all cases where
drsctphnery acnon IS taken against members
or persons associated With members Generally, such actions are based on alleqanons
that the respondents have violated specined
provrsrons of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice Where violanons by a member firm are
found, the NASD may Impose such sanctions
as expulsion, suspension, limitation of acnvrties or operations, fine, censure or other
fitting sanction If the violator IS an Individual,
rus registration with the NASD may be suspended, he may be barred from assooanon
86

with any member, or he may be fined, censured, or otherwise SUitablysanctioned.
DUring the past fiscal year, the NASD reported to the Commission final disposinon of
348 disciphnary complaints In which 209
members and 523 mdividuals were named as
respondents Complaints against nine members and thirty-two mdrviduals were dismissed for failure to establish the alleged
violations. Thirty-five members were expelled
from membership and twenty-one members
were suspended for periods ranging from one
day to two years. Fines also were Imposed In
many of these cases. In 126 cases, members
were fined amounts ranging from $25 to
$20,000, and In eighteen cases members
were censured. Additionally, 157 persons associated With member firms were barred or
had their registrations revoked, and elghtyone had their reglstraliOns suspended for
penods ranging from one day to five years
Finally, 206 other mdividuals were censured
or fined amounts ranging from $100 to
$20,000.

Review of NASD Disciplinary
Actions
DISCiplinaryactions taken by the NASD are
SUbject to review by the Commission on ItS
own motion or on the nrnely application of
any aggrieved person. Prior to the 1975
Amendments, the effectiveness of any penalty imposed by the NASD In those cases
accepted for review by the Commission was
stayed pending such review. However, Section 19(d) of the Securities Exchange Act, as
amended, provides In part that the effectiveness of any sanction Imposed by the NASD
(or any self-regulatory organization) IS not
stayed pending appeal to the Commission
unless the Commission so orders. If the
Commission finds, on appeal or on review by
ItS own motion, that the drsciphned party
committed the acts found by the NASD and
that such acts Violated the spectned rules, the
Commission must sustain the NASD's action
unless It finds that the penalties imposed are
excessive or oppressive, In which case It may
reduce or set aside such penallJes The Comrrussron,however, may not Increase the penalties Imposed by the NASD
At the beginning of fiscal 1976, thirty proceedings for review of NASD drsophnary de-

crsions were pending before the Commission,
and dunnq the year fourteen additional cases
were brought up for review The Commission
disposed of twenty-nine of these appeals In
seventeen cases, the Commission affirmed
the NASD's action
The Commission
dismissed the appeal In one case because of
respondent's failure to file a brief, modified
the NASD's findings or penalties In eight
cases, remanded two cases to the NASD,
and permitted withdrawal of one appeal At
the close of the fiscal year, fifteen appeals
were pending
Three Significant opinions emerged dUring
the fiscal year
In Unified Underwriters,
Inc ,41 the Commission affirmed the NASD's
findings that the respondent
violated the
NASD's Rules of Fair Practice by falling to
comply with ItS Interpretations respecting free
riding and withholding
Here, dunnq the
course of a distribution,
respondent
purchased for ItS own account shares In several
public offerings at the public offering price
When these shares advanced to an Immediate premium In the aftermarket,
and after
respondent had held these shares for periods
ranging from seven to ninety days, respondent sold these shares In the openmarket for a
profit The respondent argued that Its actions
did not violate the NASD Interpretation since
It was not a participant In the distribution and
since ItS purchases were not made with a
view to distribution but solely for Investment
purposes The Commission found, however,
that respondent's
trading was for the purposes of realizing short-term capital gains
and that, since the shares were Immediately
resold, respondent did not Intend to hold the
shares for Investment
Accordingly, the respondent was held to have engaged In a
distribution and violated ItS obligation to make
a bona fide public offering at the public offering pnce
In Todd and Company, Inc 42 the Commission affirmed the NASD's findings that respondents arbitrarily set the market price In
the trading of the common stock of Automated Medical Laboratones, Inc, Just after
Todd had completed seiling Automated's first
pubhc offering of 250,000 shares, In order to
Induce customers to purchase and sell that
stock In large quantities
The Cornrrussron
held that the respondents' prices were not
determined as "passive responses to market

forces" but were "arnfrcral devices Invented
for the purpose of generating demand" Further, the Commission found that the respondents engaged In a "crass manipulation that
could not possibly be deemed pnvrleqed under any conceivable legal theory" 43
In reviewing the penalties, the Commission
noted that respondent Langbein, the firm's
president, appeared to have been Influenced
by erroneous legal advice and, accordingly,
reduced the duration of hrs suspension and
that of rus firm from twelve months to SIX
months However, the Commission affirmed a
$50,000 fine Imposed against respondents 44
In Frank De Felice Ph 0 & ASSOCiates,
Inc ,45 the Commission 1f' -med the findings
of the NA8D that the respondents violated
Just and eqintable principles of trade by obtaining loans under two subordination agreements without disclosmq to the lenders the
firm's tmancral Situation, affording them a
clear descrrption of the terms of the subordination agreement, or Informing them that the
protections afforded customers by the Securities Investors Protection Act of 1970 were not
available to them Although some of ttus
information was a part of the agreement, the
Commission noted that the "Ieqalrstrc boserplate" In the form agreement was no substitute for the clear statement In ordinary language which respondents were obligated to
give the lenders However, due to a lack of
evidence indicating dehberate deception, the
NASD's sanction was reduced to ninety-day
suspension for each respondent

Review of NASD Membership

Action
Under Section 15A(g)(2) of the Exchange
Act, the NA8D must notify the Commission of
ItS Intention to admit a registered brokerdealer subject to a statutory drsquahficatron to
membership, or to permit a statutorily OISquahfred person to become associated with a
member, not less than thirty days prior to
admission of the member or assocrauon of
the person At the time of the flhng of such
notice, the NASD may apply for an order
stating that the Commission Will not proceed
under those provrsrons of the Act empowerIng the Commission to exclude the firm or
associated person, notwithstanding
the disquahhcatron The Commission, In ItS discre-

87

non and subject to such terms and conditions
as It deems necessary, may Issue an order
permitting such membership or association If
It finds such acnon appropriate In the public
Interest and for the protection of Investors At
the beginning of the fiscal year, four applications of thrs nature were pending before the
Commission
DUring the year, eight applications were filed, five were approved and three
were Withdrawn, leaving four applications
pending at the end of the year

SUPERVISION OF THE
MUNICIPAL SECURITIES
RULEMAKING BOARD
Under Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 19b-4 thereunder, the Municipal
Securities Rulemaklng
Board ("MSRB")
IS
required to frle With the Commission
any
proposed rule change, accompanied
by a
concise general statement of the basis and
purpose of such proposed rule change
In
general, the Commission must then publish
notice of the proposed rule change together
With the terms of such change or descnptron
of the subjects and Issues Involved, and must
gIve parties an opportunity to submit their
views Most proposed rule changes may not
take effect unless approved by the Cornrrussion, however, certain rule changes, including
those establishing or changing a fee, dues or
other charges Imposed by the MSRB or rules
concerned solely With the administration of
the MSRB, need not be approved by the
Commission before taking effect
Prior to June 30, 1976, the MSRB had
made nine filings of proposed rules Five of
the filings embodied proposals which became
summarily effective Without Commission approval 46 Those rules concerned detmrtrons,
MSRB fees and administration, and the definition of a "separately Identifiable department
or drvrsron" of a bank 47 In addrtion, the
Comrnissron approved a proposal establishIng a $100 initial assessment to be paid by all

Financial Results of the NASD
Each year the Cornrrussron reviews the
NASO's proposed fee and assessment
schedule, Its supporllng financial statements
for the current and past fiscal years, and
proposed budget for the following fiscal year
The fee and assessment schedule must comply with Section 15A(b)(5) of the Secunties
Exchange Act, which requires the NASO to
allocate dues equitably among Its members
The NASO's statement of financial results
for Its fiscal year ended September 3D, 1975
revealed that the NASO's equity Increased to
$92 million from $7.8 million In the pnor year
This Increase In the NASO's equity resulted
from higher net operating earnings and from
profitable operations of the National Cleanng
Corporation, the NASO's wholly-owned clearIng subsidiary.
Operating revenues of the NASO were
$13 0 million, an Increase of $0.8 million or 7
percent, and resulted from $1.8 million more
Income received from NASOAQ Issuer fees.
Other sources of Income generally declined.
For the second consecutive year, fees
charged for adrrnrustennq qualifications examinations declined by 25 percent to $2.4
million In fiscal year 1975, versus $3 1 million
In fiscal year 1974. Member assessments
and branch office fees also declined to $5 9
million In fiscal year 1975 from $6.4 million In
1974, an 8 percent decrease.
Ounng the 1975 fiscal year, operating expenses of the NASO declined to $12.0 million
from $12.1 million In fiscal 1974 The decline
ISattnbutable to a continuation of the NASO's
cost cutting programs which have been msntuted In recent years. Thus, Increases In
operating revenues, taken together With decreased operallng expenses, resulted In net
operating Income of $0.9 million as opposed
to $0.1 million In the prior year, a marked
Increase. Additionally, in fiscal year 1975, the
National Clearing Corporation had net income of $0.5 million wtuch, when added to
the NASO's net Income, Increased the Association's equity by $1.4 million, compared
Witha net loss of $0.6 million In ItS 1974 fiscal
year

NASD BUdget
A review of the NASO budget ISconducted
as a part of the Cornrmssron's regulatory

oversight responsibilities. Dunnq recent
years, the Commission has been specifically
concerned With the NASO's budqetmq regarding ItS program for examination of member broker-dealers, In order to assure that the
NASO has a sutncrent examiner staff to carry
out ItS enforcement and surveillance responsrbiunes. The NASO bUdget for fiscal year
1976 provrdes for expenditures of $135 million, against actual expenditures of $120
million In fiscal year 1975, an Increase of $1.5
million. The Increase IS largely attributable to
the Increase In staff required to fulfill additional regulatory responsibilities Imposed by
the 1975 Amendments, which require the
NASO to oversee the rnurucipal secunties
acnvmes54 of ItS members and to enforce
rules promulgated by the MSRB
The NASO projects the addition of 250 new
member firms which deal exclusively In murucipalsecunnes and consequently has budgeted for an additional 46 examiners at a cost
of approximately $0 6 million The budget
provides for 556 full-time employees, a net
Increase of 62 positions over the NASO staff
as of June 3D, 1975, and an Increase of 32
POSitionsover the pnor staff budget of 524
The NASO has projected ItS Income for
fiscal year 1976 at $13.5 million, based upon
ItS current schedule of fees and assessments The NASO fee structure remains unchanged for fiscal year 1976, but the annual
assessment base has been modified to reflect the proration of assessments for partyear membership In the NASO, and has been
expanded so that the amount to be reported
by members as gross Income now Will include Income from transactions In rnurncrpal
securities

American Stock Exchange,
Midwest Stock Exchange,
National Association of Securities
Dealers, and New Vork Stock
Exchange
In calendar year 1975, the markets govemed by the four largest (In terms of total
revenue) self-regulatory organizations-the
American Stock Exchange ("Amex"), Midwest Stock Exchange ("MSE"), NASO, and
the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")experienced rising share volume On the
NYSE, volume rose from 38 billion In 1974 to
5 1 billion In 1975, an Increase of 32 percent
89

Over the same penod of time, MSE share
volume Increased 20 percent, share volume
from over-the-counter
transactions by members of the NASD Increased 17 percent, and
Amex share volume Increased 14 percent.
Ttus rise In share volume resulted In increased revenues for these four self-regulatory organizations. 55
Although the Amex expenenced the smallest percentage Increase In share volume of
the four largest self-regulatory organizations,
It experienced
the largest percentage
increase In revenues, In part due to ItS Initiation
of trading In listed options. 56 The 1975 total
revenue of the Amex was 24 percent above
that for 1974. Transaction fees, which doubled between 1974 and 1975, accounted for
much of the Increase. Thrs rapid rise In
revenues, coupled with only a 16 percent nse
In expenses, gave Amex Its first profitable
year Since 1972
The MSE posted a 15 percent increase in
revenue between 1974 and 1975, a percentage gain exceeded only by Amex. ThIS gain
In revenue was not attributable to anyone
source but was generated by an Increase in
most revenue components,
the exception
being communication
fees whIch dIpped
slightly. Although the MSE's expenses increased dUring 1975, ItS revenues Increased
at a higher rate, resulting In 1975 net income
surpassing that of 1974 by over $910,000
The NYSE ranked third among the four
largest self-regulatory
organizations
In percentage gain In total revenue between 1974
and 1975. The rise In NYSE's share volume
caused transaction fees to increase by $2 5
million. LJstlng fees climbed from $20 million
In 1974 to $23 rrulhon In 1975. SImilarly,
Increases occurred In revenues ariSing from
cornrnumcanon fees, c1eanng fees and deposrtory fees, contributing
to an $11 million
increase in total revenue. Much of the revenue Improvement was carried through to pretax Income, which In 1975 was $9 million
higher than In the prevrous year.
NASD revenues are not as sensitive to
changes in volume as are those of the national exchanges.
As a result, the NASD
experienced
the smallest
percentage
increase In total revenue of the four largest
self-regulatory
organizations
between 1974
and 1975, approximately
SIX percent. ThIS
nse In revenue, however, was sunicient to

90

move the NASD from an operating loss of
$0.8 mIllion In 1974 to pre-tax earnings of
$1.3 million for 1975

Boston Stock Exchange, Chicago
Board Options Exchange, Pacitic
Stock Exchange and Philadelphia
Stock Exchange
LJke the four largest self-regulatory organizations, the next four self-regulatory organizations (In terms of gross revenue) also expenenced nsmq revenues, expenses and volume 57 The Boston Stock Exchange ("BSE")
generated a 24 percent Increase In share
volume; the Chicago
Board Options Exchange ("CBOE") experienced a 154 percent
increase in contract volume; the Pactnc Stock
Exchange ("PSE") gained 26 percent in Volume, and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange
("Phlx") gained nme percent In share volume
during 1975.
The CBOE's large Increase In volume generated a 130 percent Increase in its transacnon fees and a rise of nearly 800 percent m
ItS commurucanon
fees. Expenses for the
CBOE, however, rose by only 76 percent
dunng 1975 As a result, the CBOE erased ItS
1974 loss of $445,000 by earning $1.3 million
In 1975.
The BSE's rise In revenues came from
Significantly Increased transaction fees and
c1eanng fees, both of which are highly correlated to exchange share volume. Share volume on the BSE Increased by 27 percent
from 43 million shares in 1974 to 54 million
shares in 1975. Expenses also rose between
January and December 1975. Tlus resulted In
net income climbing to $356,000 in 1975, a
substantial
improvement
over the $11,000
recorded in 1974.
The PSE also expenenced
Increases m
revenue due to greater volume However, the
PSE experienced large increases In communrcatron, data processing,
collection,
and
other expenses primarily associated with the
exchange's preparation for opnon trading and
with enhancement of data processing capabilities at the exchange's
service bureau
Consequently,
pre-tax Income slipped from
$517,000 in 1974 to a loss of $75,000 In
1975.
The Phlx also regIstered gains in total
revenue.
Between
1974 and 1975 Phlx
gained 16 percent In total revenue pnmanly

due to a 42 percent nse In transaction fees.
Unlike PSE, however, Phlx's pre-tax Income
mcreased to $84,000 In 1975 compared to a
pre-tax loss of $341,000 In 1974.

Cincinnati Stock Exchange,
Detroit Stock Exchange,
Intermountain Stock Exchange,
and Spokane Stock Exchange
Three of the four smallest sell-regulatory
organizations-Cincinnati
Stock Exchange
("CSE"), Detroit Stock Exchange rOSE"),
Intermountain Stock Exchange ("ISE") and
Spokane Stock Exchange ("SSE")--<levlated
to some extent from the trend expenenced by
the eight larger self-regulatory organizations
discussed above,58 the exception being the
CSE In 1975, CSE quadrupled
Its 1974
share volume of 2 million shares. This generated a 13 percent Increase In revenues, a
relatively small increase In expenses, and a
near tnpling of net Income
The ISE did not fare as well. ISE volume
declined dunng 1975 by 38 percent. However, because the ISE's pnmary sources of
revenue are not dependent upon volume, the
dedme In total revenues was only 10 percent
ISE managed to reduce its expenses dunng
1975 and, as a result, Its pre-tax Income rose
by 33 percent over 1974 levels
The DSE also expenenced
a decline In
revenues dunng 1975, and ceased operanons on June 30, 197659 pnmanly because of
declines In both volume and membership
Between January and December 1975, share
volume for DSE declined by 75 percent from
1 2 million shares In January to 0 3 million
shares In December Share volume showed
an additional decline of 74,000 shares between the fourth quarter of 1975 and the first
quarter of 1976. The number of Individual
members of DSE fell from 55 to 44 dunng the
penod 1974 to 1975, a decline of 20 percent
The SSE, which receives Income pnmanly
from membership dues and listing fees, expenenced small Increases rn revenues and expenses with no Significant change In net
income. SSE also sustained a 50 percent
decline In trading volume between 1974 and
1975 but, because SSE's sources of revenue
are unrelated to volume, the fmanoal condition of SSE was not senously affected.

Expenses and Operations of the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board ("MSRB")
Section 23(b) of the secunues Exchange
Act, as amended by the 1975 Amendments,
requires that the Comrmssron
submit "a
statement and analysis of the expenses and
operanons of each self-regulatory orqaruzalion in connecnon With the performance of Its
responsibilities under this title" The only responsibility of the MSRB under the Secunnes
Exchange Act IS rulemakmg for the municipal
sscunnes Industry. The MSRB Income of
$793,468 was denved from two fees established by rules adopted pursuant to Section
15B(b)(2)(J) of the Sscunnes Exchange Act
Fees mdude a one hundred dollar imnal fee
paid by all rnurucipal secunnes brokers and
rnurucipal secunnes dealers and an underwrlling assessment equal to 005% of the
face amount of all rnurucipal secunnes which
are purchased from an Issuer as part of a
new Issue by a municipal secunties broker or
a rnurucipal secunbes dealer which have a
fmal stated maturity of not less than two
years from the date of the secunties Over
70% of the MSRB's expenses were for salarres and other employee compensation, travel

BROKER-DEALER

REGULATION

Registration
Brokers and dealers who use the malls or a
means or Instrumentality of Interstate commerce In the conduct of an Interstate secunties busmess are required to register With the
Commission 60
As of June 30, 1976, there were 5,308
broker-dealers
registered,
compared
With
3,546 a year earlier This represents an increase of 1,762, or 50 percent since June 30,
1975. The large Increase In effecbve registranons IS due pnmanly to the fact that brokers
and dealers who confine their busmess to
transactions
on a national securities
exchange ("floor members"), and rnurucipal secunnes protessronals were required to register With the Commrssion for the first time as
of December 1, 1975, pursuant to Secnon

91

15(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act as
amended by the 1975 Amendments
Of the
total of 5,308 effective registrations, approxrmately 1,800 registrants were floor members
and 260 were murucrpal securities professionals
DUring fiscal 1976, 503 registrations were
terminated, of which 442, or 87 9 percent,
were withdrawn by the broker or dealer and
sixty-one, or 121 percent, were revoked or
cancelled by the Commission.
DUring the
year, 2,293 new applications became effective, while 250 new applications were either
withdrawn, returned or denied

Recordkeeping and Preservation
Requirements
Secunues Exchange Act Rules 17a-3 and
17a-4 require registered brokers and dealers,
tnter alta, to make, keep current, and preserve for prescribed Intervals specified books
and records relating to their business Dunng
the past fiscal year, the Cornrmssron twice
amended these record keeping and preservation requirements. On August 25, 1975, the
Commission adopted 61 amendments to Rule
17a-3(a)(12)(I)(h),
which then required brokers and dealers to obtain, for each assooated person, a record of any arrests, indictments or convictions for any felony or misdemeanor, other than minor traffiC offenses As
amended, the provrsron requires the maintenance of such records only With respect to
arrests, indictments
or crimes which may
directly reflect on an rndrvidual's trustworthiness In dealing With customers' funds and
secuntles
In March 1976, the Commission
adopted62 amendments to Rules 17a-3 and
17a-4 to require the maintenance and preservation of records ansmq out of Securities
Exchange Act Rule 17f-2, which Implements
the provisrons of Section 17(f)(2) of the Secuntres Exchange Act requiring the creation of
industry-Wide programs for the fingerprinting
of Industry personnel and the suormssron of
such fingerprints to the Attorney General of
the United States for rdentrncanon and appropriate processing

Financial Responsibility
Requirements
The Implementation and refinement of the
Commission's
uniform net capital rule, dis-

92

cussed In Part 1 of thiS report,63 consntuted
the most Significant development of the past
fiscal year In the area of financial responsibuIty requirements for brokers and dealers DurIng the year, the Commission's staff evolved
new procedures to expedite the processing of
public mqumss and interpretive requests addressed to the Uniform net capital rule and
related financial responsibutty and reporting
requirements. The staff got over sixty phone
mqumas a week and answered more than
800 letters requesting interpretations of these
regulations durrnq the fiscal year
The Cornrrussron's financial responsibility
and reporting program for newly registering
brokers and dealers In municipal secunties'"
Involved two provisrons of Securities
Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3, the customer protection rule On November 20, 1975,65 In
order to afford these brokers and dealers an
appropriate period of adjustment to pcssibly
unfamiliar regulatory requirements, the Comrrussron suspended untJI January 31, 1976,
Rule 15c3-3(d), which obliges brokers and
dealers to verify and obtain possession and
control of their customers'
fully pard and
excess margin secunnes. At the same time, 66
In recognition of the difficulty frequently experienced In promptly acquiring a particular muruopal security, the Commission reaffirmed
the mdefrrute suspension of the "buy-in" requirements of Rule 15c3---3(m) as applied to
murucipal securities

Broker-Dealer Examinations
The Sscunnes Acts Amendments of 1975
augmented the Commission's
broker-dealer
examination
responsrbrlitres.
As amended,
Section 15(b)(2)(C) of the Act requires the
Commission (or a self-regulatory organization
acllng at the Commission's direcnon) to examine each newly registered broker or dealer
Within SIX months of the granting of ItS registration. Dunng the past fiscal year, the Commission Implemented a Post Effective Conference Program wherein each new SEC067
registrant receives such an examination from
the Commission
The seff-requiatory organizations have Similar responsrbihty In the case
of newly registered brokers or dealers for
Which such an organization IS the designated
exarmrnnq authonty 68
In addition to the Post Effective Conference
Program the Commrssron has continued ItS

regular exammauon program for both SECO
brokers and dealers and members of selfregulatory organrzatlons.
The Commission's exarrunauon program
for SECO brokers and dealers consists of two
types of examinations. The first type IS a
routine examination conducted once a year to
determine the nnanoal and operational condition of the SECO firm The second type of
examination, the so-called "cause" examination, is conducted whenever a fmancial or
operational problem has been noted In a firm.
Cause examinations generally emphasize the
particular problem encountered rather than
the overall condition of the firm. Dunng the
previous fiscal year, the Commission conducted 193 routine examinations and 92
cause examinations of SECD firms; approxrmately the same number of SECO examinations conducted the previous fiscal year.
As part of the Commission's responsibility
to oversee the operations of self-regulatory
orqaruzanons, and In keeping Withthe pattern
of selt-requlatron in the secunnes Industry,
the Commission conducts an ongoing review
of the regulatory programs of the vanous selfregulatory orqaruzanons. One phase of thrs
review consists of an on-site examination of
the self-regulatory organization's examination
and compliance programs and faCilities The
"overstqht" exarrunasecond phase-the
non-s-rs deSigned to evaluate Doth the financial and operational condition of the subject
broker or dealer, and the quality of the most
recent examination of that firm performed by
Its self-regulator. Commenced promptly after
the complsnon of an exammanon made by
the self-regulator, an oversight examination
Includes a physical inspection of the brokerdealer's books and records and supporting
'matenals and a review of the firm's selling
practices. The program contemplates a SImultaneous comparative review of the workIng papers and reports of the examination
conducted by the self-regulatory organization
dunng the corresponding penod.
The Oommrssron'sheadquarters office staff
has pnmary responsibility for on-site mspsctrons of the self-regulatory organization's
headquarters office, while the comrmssion's
regional offices have pnmary responsibility
regarding the overSight examination program
Representatives from the headquarters and

regional offices hold quarterly meetings to
diSCUSS
the results of both on-site inspections
of the self-regulators and oversrqht examinations. SUbsequent to such meetings, conferences or other communications take place
With the self-regulatory organizations, dunng
which the staff conveys Its analysis of and
any recommendations concerning the selfrequtator's programs Moreover, the specinc
results of a particular oversiqht examination
generally are discussed With the self-regulator Immediately after the examination
The second type of examination of a member firm of a self-regulatory organization IS a
cause exammauon, nearly Identical In purpose and scope to the Comrrussron'scause
examinations of SECO brokers and dealers
Dunng the previous fiscal year, the Comrrussron conducted 390 oversiqht sxarrunanons and 384 cause examination of such
member firms, a slight Increase over the total
number performed In fiscal year 1975, and In
keeping With the goal set by the Commission
for such examinations
The Comrrnssron continues to update ItS
Broker-Dealer Exammatlon Manual and
Checklists In order to reflect the current rules
and regulations applicable to brokers and
dealers In addmon, the Comrrussron prepares and distnbutes to all regional offices
educational matenals on new regulatory developments or examination techniques to
supplement the Broker-Dealer Examination
Manual and tarmuanze the secunues compliance examiners WIthsuch matters.
The self-regulatory organizations srrrnlartly
have developed and updated their examination manuals and checklists dunng the past
fiscal year. In addition, these organizations
prepare educational rnatenal on regulatory
developments for their examiners. Such rnatenals are often the subject of examiner trainIng sessions
To further coordmate the Commission's
regulatory efforts between Its headquarters
and regional offices, the Oornrrussron staff
prepares and transmits to the regional offices
a monthly status report regarding new rule
proposals and regulatory developments, the
Commission's examination program and the
surveillance and examination efforts of the
self-regulators

Early Warning and Surveillance
The Cornrrussron
IS responsible for the financial and operational soundness of all registered brokers and dealers. In trus connection, pursuant to Section S(al of the Secunties Investor Protection Act IJf 1970, the CommiSSIOn requires each self-regulatory organization to provide the Commission with early
warning lists Identifying member firms which
may be In or approaching tmancal difficulty
or which may require c1oser-than-normal surveillance for other reasons Trns Information
IS collected by the staff on at least a biweekly basis and IS transmitted to the appropnate Commission regional office, which venfles the condition of those firms on the early
warning list Each firm on the list IS subjected
to intensified rnorutonnq by the regional office, acting In conjunction with the firm's selfregulatory examining authority
Other early warning techniques employed
by the Commission Include Secuntres Exchange Act Rule 17a-11, which requires a
broker or dealer to notify the Cornrrussron and
the appropnate self-regulator If the firm falls
below certain standards of finanaal and operational soundness, measured In terms of caprtal sutncrency and adequacy of books and
records If a firm drops below a level speerned In the Rule, It must take Immediate
remedial action and begin an accelerated
financial and operational reporting cycle to
provide the Commission with current information about how well the firm IS complying with
the rules
The Commission penodically reviews the
early warning and surveillance tools of the
self-regulatory
organizations
to Insure that
they constitute sound, effective programs
which Will enable each organization to detect
and monitor member firms that are In or
approaching financial difficulty at the earliest
possible time
The Cornrmssron's program for reviewing
the early warning and surveillance programs
of the self-regulatory organizations has two
phases In the first phase, on-SIte inspections
of the self-regulatory organizations, the Commission's
staff reviews and attempts
to
strengthen where necessary, a self-regulator's early warning and surveillance
programs, while at the same time evaluating and
defining the goals, procedures, budget and

94

staffmg of those programs
Dunng the past
fiscal year, the Commission's staff conducted
on-site inspections of the early warning. surveillance and examination programs of the
Chicago Board Options Exchange. Boston
Stock Exchange, Midwest Stock Exchange,
American Stock Exchange. and the Pacmc
Stock Exchange. The staff also completed an
on-site mspecnon of the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange rrutratad In the previous
fiscal
year 69 In addition, the Cornrrussron staff conducted on-site inspections of the examination, early warning and surveillance programs
of the NASD distnct offices In New Orleans,
Kansas City, Boston, and Los Angeles With
regard to all self-regulators,
In particular
those not receiving on-site inspections dunnq
mainthe past fiscal year. the Cornrrussron
tains on-qomq communications with the organizations to determine the status of their
regulatory programs, especially In such areas
as meeting examination goals, surveillance of
member firms on the early warning list, and
new regulatory developments
The second phase of trus review, generally
earned out by the Regional Offices, Involves
an on-site review of member firms of selfregulators to determine their understanding of
and compliance with the vanous early warnIng standards and procedures applicable to
them. As a rule, the Regional Offices combine their evaluation of a member organization's understandmg of and compliance with
applicable early warning standards with a
review of that firm's nnanoat and operational
soundness and of the self-regulator's
most
recent examination of that firm
The efforts of the Comrnrssron, In coruuncnon with those of the self-regulators, to develop comprehensive
and effective
early
warrnnq and surveillance programs constitute
one explanation for the steady decline In the
number of securities firms who have been
subject to liqurdatron In the past several
years.70 Indeed, hqurdation proceedings under the Secunnes Investor Protection Act of
1970 have been commenced only once durIng the first seven months of 1976.

Training Program
The Comrrussron firmly believes In the
need for comprehensive penodrc trarrunq programs for secunties compliance examiners,

both those on the Commission's
staff and
those employed by the vanous self-regulatory
organizations
Such training efforts broaden
the knowledge and the skills of the exammers, and acquaint them With the latest modifications to examination procedures AccordIngly, In the past fiscal year the Commission
has carned out a senes of training courses,
some directed only toward Commission examiners and others toward regulatory organizations' examiners Some of these programs
are developed and conducted by SEC personnel, others utilize the expertise of moivrouals and orqaruzations not connected With the
Commission
The Commission
encourages
ItS own compliance
examiners to Improve
their skills through correspondence
courses,
seminars, and lecture courses provided by
colleges and umversrtres: and In appropnate
cases, the Commission pays tumon fees on
behalf of ItS examiners
The Commission's
Internally developed
training efforts essentially consrst of four drstinct programs
1 Pen odic two-day training seminars conducted at each regional office and dealing
With the Commission's
oversight examinations Such seminars review the results of
oversight exarrunanons, diSCUSSany new and
Important
developments
or techniques
emerging from these examinations, and proVide an opportunity for the regional offices to
diSCUSSWith staff members of the self-regulatory organizations,
who are mvited to the
seminars, means whereby exammanon programs and techniques may be refined and
more closely coordinated
2 Two-day seminars held twice each year
In each regional office for the more expenenced securities compliance examiners on
the subject of examination techniques
Such
seminars diSCUSS Significant new developments In the Industry and particular examination techniques that may be utilized to deal
With such developments.
3. One four-day training seminar held at
the Commission's
headquarters
Thrs seminar increasingly employs audiovisual instruction and provides examiners from the Comrrnssron, the self-regulatory organizations and
State secunlles comrrussrons With Information
on baSIC examination techniques, as well as
the vanous regulatory programs of the Comrrussron pertaining to broker-dealer nnancrat

and operational compliance
The seminars
generally Include lecture and workshop sessrons, With representatives from the Commission and the self-regulatory
organizations
parnopannq as lecturers, commentators and
workshop session leaders
4 BI-weekly, one-hour training sessions In
the regional offices for the Comrnrssron's examiners These sessions focus on new developments, requlatory problems, rules and examination techniques
The mdrvrduals charged With pnmary responsibrhty for each regional office's examination program meet every three months With
members of the Comrrussron's staff to discuss new training and examination
techniques, areas where additional training IS
requued, and the strengths and weaknesses
of the Commission's regulatory current program Such meetings ensure Uniformity of
regulalion throughout the Commission's
regional offices and contnbute to the contmumq
refinement of the Cornrrussron's training and
exarrunatron programs
The Cornrrussron's tnree volume BrokerDealer Examination Manual contains, among
other things, a compendium of Comrnrssron
rules, releases, and other relevant documentation
Taken together
With exarrunation
checklists and other supplementary material.
It IS Intended to provide the Cornrrussron's
examiners
With a centralized
reference
source of the rules, interpretations, examination procedures and techniques With which
they must be familiar In conjunction With the
Manual, the Cornrrussron utilizes professionally produced training films and case problems which Illustrate the proper procedures
for conducting a thorough examination of a
broker or dealer
In addrtron to Inviting examiners employed
by the self-regulatory organizations to certain
of the Cornrrussion's training programs, the
Commission also works With the self-regulators to Improve their own training programs
The Commission
periodically
reviews the
training efforts of the self-regulators and has
encouraged each self-regulator to hold Informal, br-rnonthly training programs and more
formal annual training sessions for their own
examination staffs In many Instances, the
Comrmssron's examiners have been mvrted
to attend or partiopate In such sessions

Regulatory Burdens on Brokers
and Dealers
The Commission has been sensitive to the
Impact of ItS regulations and reporting requrernents, In addrtron to those of the selfregulatory orqaruzatrons,
upon all brokers
and dealers and especially
upon smaller
firms. As a consequence, dunng recent years
It has undertaken
a number of programs
aimed at streamlining and Simplifying such
requirements for the entire secunlles industry.
The Commission has reviewed and continues to review ItS financial and operational
reporting rules and related reporting requirements and those of the self-regulatory bodies
In an effort to anevrate the burden of compliance faced by brokers and dealers, and especially smaller broker-dealers, and to assure
that such rules 'and requlatrons reflect the role
of the small broker-dealer
In the Nation's
sscunnes markets. To the extent that It IS
found that the benefit to the pubuc Interest
contemplated by the Commission's rules and
requlanons IS not commensurate
With the
burden Imposed on brokers and dealers, and
In particular on smaller firms, the Commission
has modified rules and regulations through
the use of provisions creating appropriate
partial or complete exemptions from certain
regulatory obligations
Other efforts by the Commission In thrs
area Include the formation In May 1974 of a
Federal advisory committee, the Report Coordmannq Group, to advrse the Commission
on Simplifying and standardizing vanous reporting forms used by the Commission and
Trus projthe self-regulatory orqarszanons."
ect has produced concrete results In the form
of the FOCUS reporting concept which, as
discussed In Part 1 of trus Annual Report, 72
dramatically
lessens the burdens placed
upon brokers and dealers to demonstrate
compliance WIth the Commission's financial
and operallonal regulabons.
Another equally Important product of the
Report Coordinating Group's efforts has been
the development
of uniform forms for the
01 brokers and dealers (Form
registration
BD), and their agents and associated persons (Form u-4) As previously reported.P
these forms have achieved mcreasmqly Wide
acceptance among the Commission, sell-reg-

96

ulatory orqanrzanons,
and State secuntrss
regulators. Dunng the fiscal year, four addinonal States adopted Form BD and one
adopted Form U-4. Thus, to date, forty-nine
States, the Commission, and the NASD accept Form BD, these regulators, as well as all
national secunnes exchanges, accept Form
U-4
In January 1976, the Report Coordinating
Group recommended adoption of unrform interpretations of certain terms In Item 10 of
Form BD In order to permit consistent responses by all registrants
On February 6,
1976, the Commission
formally
adopted
these Interpretations
74 Other
junsdrcnons
and organizations which have adopted Form
BO have Informally indicated their concurrence With the recommendations
of the
Group
Two other Federal advisory cornrmttees
In recent
established
by the Commission
years have had as one of their purposes the
prOViding of assistance to the small brokerdealer cornmuruty. The Cenfral Market System AdVISOry Committee was created to ensure the maintenance
of an appropriately
competitive environment for the brokerage
communrty, especially for the smaller firms 75
The other committee,
the Broker-Dealer
Model Compliance Program AdVISOry Committee, was responsible for compiling a gUIde
to common regulatory obllgallons of brokerdealers, particularly small broker-dealers, and
for suggesllng
ways to comply with such
obligations 76

CLEARANCE AND SETTLEMENT
Progress Toward a National
System of Clearance and
Settlement of Securities
Transactions
Dunng the past fiscal year, With the Comrrussron's active encouragement,
enbties involved In secunnes processing Improved their
ability to complete secuntres transactions
promptly and accurately For example, deposrtones Instituted transfer agent custodian
("T AC") programs which are deSigned to
reduce both the number of certificates mamtamed In deposrtories and certificate movement between
deposrtones
and transfer
agents 77

Dunng the fiscal year, the continued development of Interfaces among c1eanng corporations and deposrtones, which Immobilize secunnes cernncates by allowing pamctpants to
move secunnes throughout the country by
book entry, tended to reduce costs and accelerate the settlement process
As a result of such Improvements, as well
as the Increased participation In depositones
by brokers and dealers, banks and other
institutions,
the Commission
believes that
progress IS being made toward the development of an efficient national system for the
clearance and settlement of secunnes transactions This progress made can be measured by the fact that secunties processing
mechanisms efficIently handled record tradIng volume dunng the early months of calendar year 1976. The Commission expects that
the continued development and refinement of
c1eanng and depository services WIll attract
more persons to become participants In these
systems In order to realize the substantial
benefits wruoh accrue from such participation.
Increased particpatron WIll In turn further reduce the dependency of the clearance and
settlement
mechanisms
upon the physical
movement of certmcates

Rule Changes of Registered
Clearing Agencies 78
DUring
trscal
year
1976, numerous
changes In, or additions to, the rules, practices and operations of the thirteen registered
cleanng agencies 79 were submitted to the
Commission for ItS approval under the proviExsions of Section 19 of the Securities
change Act 80 The tollowmq are among the
more SIgnificant Items on which the Oornrmssron acted favorably'
1 The Midwest Secunnes Trust Company
("MSTC") established several programs deSigned to taohtate the handling of seeunnes
MSTC's Transfer Agent Custodian ("TAC")
Program81 permits the depository to retain a
working supply of cernncates while deposmnq
the remaining
certificates
With a transfer
agent bank to be held In custody In the form
of a balance certificate registered In the name
of MSTC's nominee
ThIS aids secuntres
processing by reducing certificate movement
between the deposrtory
and the transfer
agent The Depository Input Satellite System82 allows MSTC parnopants to deposit

secunnes With banks acting as agents for
MSTC and to receive credit for the deposrts
at MSTC pnor to the actual physical delivery
of secunnes from the banks to MSTC MSTC
also expanded ItS depository Interface WIth
PaCifiC secunnes DepOSItory Trust Company
("PSDTC") to permit book entry movements
of secunnes from PSDTC to MSTC 83
2 MSTC amended ItS rules to provide for
Increased representation on MSTC's Board
of Directors for five Chicago cleanng house
banks which participate In MSTC by auowinq
the banks to nominate five of the eleven
Board members 84
3 PaCifIC Cleanng Corporation ("PCC")
established
satellite
tacrhtres In Seattle,
Washlngton,85 Portland, Oregon86 and Denver, Colorado 87 The purpose of these tacihnes IS to provide access to the cleanng and
depository operations of PCC and PSDTC for
broker-dealers,
banks and other qualified
users In the Seattle, Portland and Denver
areas.
4 The Paofic Stock Exchange, Inc. rrntrated Interfaces
between PSDTC and the
Deposrtory
Trust Company
("DTC")
and
MSTC 88

5. Stock Cleanng Corporation ("SCC") developed a mechanism for the processing of
odd-lot transactions on the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE") through SCC's continuous net settlement ("CNS") system 89
6 The NYSE adopted and the Comrmssron
approvedw amendments to DTC's rules to
enable the NYSE to sell part of the capital
stock of DTC to ItS participants The amendments perrrut direct ownerstup of DTC shares
by mstrtutional
partrcipants.
Broker-dealer
participants are not permitted to own DTC
shares directly. Instead, the NYSE, the Amerroan Stock Exchange, Inc, and the NASD act
as representatives of their members
7 DTC also amended ItS fee schedulev' to
enable DTC's fees to bear a closer relationship to ItS costs

8 Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia ("SCCP") adopted new procedures atlowmq SCCP members to pledge securmes
held In SCCP's depository to the Options
Cleanng Corporation In order to guarantee
opuon contracts
written by SCCP members 92
9 Boston Stock Exchange Clearing Corporation ("BSECC") adopted procedures to irn-

97

plement a market-to-market requirement applicable to transactions on the Boston Stock
Exchange having a contract price not exceeding $250,000.93 This action was designed to protect clearing members of
BSECC from losses resulting from the failure
of other clearing members to sellie such
trades.
In approving these proposals, the Commission acted With a view toward facilltabng the
development of a national system for the
prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, and the ehrnrnation of seounnes certificate movement In
connecbon WIth the settlement of securibes
transacbons.

Expenses and Operations of
Registered Clearing Agencies
Secnon 23(b) of the Secunnss Exchange
Act, as amended by the 1975 Amendments,
requires that the Comrrussron submit "a
statement and analysis of the expenses and
operations of each self-regulatory orqarnzabon In connecbon WIththe performance of ItS
responsibihnesunder this tItle, for which purpose data pertaining to such expenses and
operations shall be made available by such
organization to the Comrrussron at ItS request." The 1975 Amendments also require
c1eanngagenCIesto regIster as separate selfregulatory organizations as of December 1,
1975 The revenue and expense figures for
all registered clearing aqencres other than
TAD Deposnory Corporation, Bradford Securities Processing Services, Inc. and Options
Cleanng Corporation (which were not wholly
owned subsidianes of a national securities
exchange or the NASD when the 1975
Amendments were signed Into law) are included In the revenue and expense analyses
of their respective parent self-regulatory orgarnzanons.94 Thrs precludes companson between those clearing agencies and the remaining registered cleanng aqenoes; It has
not, therefore, proven possible to set forth
separate and uniform nnanoal data for regiStered clearing aqenoes. Separate statements
and analyses of the operating results of each
regIstered clearing agency WIll be available
for mclusron In the Commiss.on's Annual Report for fiscal year 1977.
98

Exemptions
During fiscal year 1976, the Oommissron
received SIXapplications from transfer agents
for exemption from reglstralton under Section
17A(c) of the Act. All SIX applicants were
Informed that the Commission's staff would
not recommend that the Commission grant
an exemption, and that the staff would conSider the applicanons as Withdrawn unless
the applicant indicated otherwise. Only one
applicant Indicated a desire for further consideranon: thiS appucauon was pending at the
close of the nscal year
Fifteen applications for exemption from
registration as a cleanng agency under Secnon 17A(b) of the Act were fIled. One entity
Withdrew ItS exemption request and the remaining apphcattons-e-whrch are discussed In
Part 1 of thrs Report95-are being considered.

SECURITIES INVESTOR
PROTECTION CORPORATION
The Secunnes Investor ProteclJon Act96 of
1970 (the "SIPC Act") established the Secunnes Investor Protection Corporabon ("SIPC")
to provide certain protections to customers of
member brokers and dealers who are unable
to meet their ftnancral obligations to such
customers. SIPC IS a non-profit membership
corporation, the members of which are most
of the registered brokers and dealers 97 While
SIPC IS funded primarily through assessments on ItS members, under certain condrnons It may borrow up to $1 million from the
United States Treasury.98

Proposed Legislation to Amend
the securities Investor Protection
Act of 1970
In October 1975, the Cornmissron testified
before the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Finance of the House Committee
on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on a btll
to amend the SIPC Act 99 This bill grew out of
a June 1974 report1OO to the SIPC Board of
Directors by a Special Task Force appointed
by SIPC to consrder possibte changes In the
1970 Act. Among other things, the bill would:
(1) permit SIPC to make direct payments to
customers In certain relatively small cases by
amending eXisting procedures requiring

oourt-appointed trustees In all SIPC hquidalions; (2) permit customer accounts to be
transferred In bulk to other SIPC members In
appropnate cases rather than to be hquidated
on an individual baSIS;and (3) raise the dollar
limitations upon the protections available to
Individual customers. The Commission expressed Its support for the bill and offered
certain comments. At the end of the fiscal
year, this proposed leglslatlon-as well as a
companion Senate bl1l101-was sllll pending

Litigation Related to SIPC
In SEC v. Morgan, Kennedy & Co , Inc, 102
the trustees of a profit sharing plan trust that
held an account with the debtor broker-dealer
asserted that the 108 bsnencranss of the
trust were separate customers of the debtor,
each entitled to protection under the SIPC
Act or, alternatively, that the several trustees
were separate customers. The United States
Drstnct Court for the Southern District of New
York held that each of the beneficiaries was a
separate customer. In January 1976 the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district court, holding
that only the trust Itself was a customer for
purposes of the SIPC Act. 103On June 14,
1976, the Supreme Court dedi ned to review
that decrsion.104
In SEC v. Executive Secunties Corporauon.v» certain broker-dealers and educational mstrtutronswhich had loaned securities
to the debtor asserted that they were customers of the debtor With respect to such
loans and therefore entitled to protection under the SIPC Act. A Federal court of bankruptcy held that secured stock lenders which
had no other sacunues accounts or dealings
Withthe debtor were not customers Withinthe
meaning of the SIPC Act, and, therefore,

Fund.

Proposed Amendment to SIPC
By-Laws
In June 1975, SIPC submitted to the Commission a proposed amendment of ItS bylaws which would have required SIPC members to display the SIPC symbol In their
offices and to Include a reference to SIPC In
their advernsmq. On August 28, 1975, the
Commission determined to disapprove the

proposed amendment on the grounds that
the SIPC Act does not vest SIPC With the
authonty to require such display by ItS members 106

REGULATION OF SECO
BROKER-DEALERS
Under Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, the Commission IS responsible
for prescnbinq rules establishing qualifications standards for all brokers and dealers,
mcludmq those who are not members of the
NASD ("nonmember" or "SECO" brokers or
dealers) Thrs section also empowers the
Commission to adopt rules governing the
business conduct of SECO brokers and dealers, In order to provide regulation of such
brokers and dealers comparable to that provided by the NASD for ItSmembers
At the close of the fiscal year, the number
of SECO brokers and dealers registered With
the Commission and not entitled to an exarnptron from the Commission's SECO
rules 107 totaled 309,108 and the number of
associated persons of such firms (I e , partners, officers, directors, sole proprietors and
employees not engaged In merely clerical or
ministerial funcnons) totaled 23,236.
Secuntres Exchange Act Rule 15b9-2 Imposes an annual assessment to be paid by
SECO brokers and dealers to defray the cost
of their regulation by the Commission. DUring
the fiscal year, the Commission proposed to
amend Rule 15b9-2 and the annual assessment schedule for SECO brokers and dealers
for fiscal year 1976 (Form SECQ-4-76). The
proposals would'
(1) reduce the current annual personnel
assessment from $15 to $5,
(2) Introduce a 0 375 percent assessment on annual gross Income from
over-the-counter transactions,
(3) reduce the Initial fee for mdrviduals
filing Form U-4 from $50 to $35,
(4) change the due date for SECO annual assessments from June 1 to September 1; and
(5) change the SECO fiscal year from
July 1 to October 1 cycles, to conform
the SECO fiscal year to the new Federal fiscal year
The modifications to the SECO fee and
assessment schedule were desrqned to rnm-

pnmanly resulting from the Inclusion In SECO
of a number of rnunrcipal secuntles brokers
and dealers who were required to register
with the Commission by the 1975 Amendments and elected not to JOin the NASD The
proposed
amendments
to both rule and
schedule were adopted by the Commission
shortly after the close of the fiscal year 109

SHORT SELLING INTO
UNDERWRITTEN OFFERINGS
As previously reported, 110 the Commission,
on Apnl 2, 1975, published for public comment, among other things, a revised version
of proposed Secunnes Exchange Act Rule
10b-21 , which was first proposed In 1974 111
Proposed Rule 10b-21 would Impose certain
limitations on purchases to cover short sales
where such short sales were effected before
the commencement of an offenng mvoivrnq
securities of the same class or senes
These proposals were intended to regulate
certain trading practices which continue to be
of substantial concern to the underwriting
community Short selling by hedge funds and
other persons reportedly continue to take
place In antrcipanon of underwritten offerings,
particularly
of securities
traded over-thecounter Such short selling may be Intended
to create downward pressure on the trading
market, forcing the Issuer or underwnter to
lower the offenng pnce, thereby perrrutnnq
short sellers to cover their short sales at
lower prices With secunnes purchased In the
offering or In the lower aftermarket
Thrs
practice has reportedly caused Issuers and
underwriters to abandon prospective offermqs The Commission IS continuing to study
these and other associated trading practices
In order to mmate appropriate regulatory acbon

EXEMPTIONS
Of three requests received for exemptions
from the broker-dealer registration requirements, one was granted pursuant to Section
15(a)(2) as necessary and appropnate In the
public Interest and for the proteclion of investors
Securities
Exchange
Act Rule 10b-6
places certain protuoinons upon trading In
secuntles by persons Interested In a distnbu-

100

lion of such secuntres Dunng the fiscal year,
approximately 360 exemption requests under
paragraph (f) of Rule 10b-6 were granted on
facts indicatmq that the transactions did not
appear to constitute manipulative or deceptive devices or contrivances Within the meanIng of the rule
DUring tbrs year the Director of the DIVISion
of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated
authonty, exempted two life Insurance companies registered as broker-dealers from the
provrsrons of the Uniform net capital rule,
Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1. Due to
the specral nature of their business, their
fmancral posinon, and the safeguards established by those firms for the protection of
customers' funds and secunnes, the Commission was satisfied that It was not necessary
or appropriate In the public Interest or for the
protection of Investors to subject such brokerdealers to the provrsrons of Rule 15c3-1.
The Cornrrussron monitors the Impact of
competitive cornrrussron rates by obtaining
pertinent data on a quarterly basis from certain brokers and dealers through Securities
Exchange Act Rule 17a-20 and related Form
X-17 A-20. Some brokers and dealers subject to the rule's filing requirements cannot,
because of special circumstances or an unusual business rrux, provide the Comrrnssron
With rnearnnqtul information regarding competitive comnussron rates Consequently, durIng FIscal Year 1976, the Commission
granted exemptions from the Form X-17A-20
filing requirement to twenty-one brokers and
dealers.
Other applications for exemption from the
provisions of the Secuntres Exchange Act are
discussed elsewhere In thiS Annual Report, In
connectron
With the mdrvrdual provrsions
thereof germane to these applications.

107 In March 1976, the Commission
announced, In Securities Exchange Act Release
No. 12160 (March 3, 1976), 9 SEC Docket
80, the amendment of Secunues Exchange
Act Rules 15b8-1, 15b9-1, 15b9-2, and
15b10-1 through 15b1Q-6 to provide an exemption from such rules for brokers and
dealers whose activities are generally confined to a national secunnes exchange Specmcally, a broker or dealer IS exempt from the
SECO provisrons If (1) It IS a member of a
national secuntres exchange, (2) It carnes no
accounts of customers, and (3) ItS annual
gross Income derived from the purchases
and sales of securities otherwise than on the
exchange of which It IS a member IS no
greater than $1,000, provided, however, that
gross Income derived from transactions otherwise than on such national secunnes exchange which are effected for ItS own account With or through another registered broker or dealer IS not subject to that dollar
limitation

loa Thrs represents an Increase of seven
such brokers and dealers from the prior fiscal
year, and constitutes the third consecutive
Increase In the number of effective SECO
registrations The past year's Increase may
be attnbuted to the SECO reqistranon of

Enforcement

Part 4
Enforcement

The Commission's enforcement activities,
which are designed to combat secuntres
fraud and other Illegal activities, continued at
a high level dunnq the past year. These
activities encompass CIvil and criminal court
actions, as well as administrative
proceedIngs conducted Intemally. Where vrolanons of
the secunnes laws are established, the sanenons which may result range from censure by
the Cornrrussion to prison sentences Imposed
by a court.
The enforcement program IS designed to
achieve as broad a regulatory
Impact as
posstble within the framework of resources
available to the Commission. In light of the
capability of self-regulatory
and state and
local aqencies to deal effectively with certain
secuntrss violations, the Commission seeks
to promote effective coordination and cooperation between ItS own enforcement acnvmes
and those of other agencies

DETECTION
Complaints
The Commission receives a large volume
of cornrnurucanons from the public. These
consist mainly of requests for Information and
complaints against broker-dealers and other
members of the seounnes community as well
as complaints concerning the market price of
particular secunnes
DUring the past year,
approximately 5,300 complaints against broker-dealers were received, analyzed and answered. Most of these complaints dealt With
operational problems, such as the failure to
deliver secunnes or funds promptly, or the
alleged mishandling of accounts In addition,

there were about 11,000 complaints received
concerning
Investment
advisers.
Issuers,
banks, transfer agents, mutual funds or Similar matters.
The Oommrssron seeks to assist persons In
resolvmq complaints and to furnish requested
information
Thousands
of Investor complaints are resolved through staff inquiries of
the firms Involved
While the Comrrusston
does not maintain an arbitration program to
resolve disputes between brokerage firms
and Investors, a complaint may lead to the
instrtunon of an mvesnqanon or an enforcement proceeding, or It may be referred to a
self-regulatory or local enforcement agency

Market Surveillance
The Commission's staff has devised procedures to Identify possible Violative acnvmes In
the secunnes markets through surveillance of
listed secunnes This program IS coordinated
With the market surveillance operations of the
New York, American and regional stock exchanges, as well as the various options exchanges
In nus regard, the Comrrussron's market
surveillance
staff maintains
a continuous
watch of transactions on the stock and options exchanges and reviews reports of large
block transactions to detect any unusual price
and volume variations It also rnorntors nnanCial news bckers, ftnanoal publications and
statistical services In addition, the staff has
supplemented ItS regular reviews by receiving
dally and penodic market surveillance reports
from the exchanges and the NASD which
provide In-depth analysis of Information de107

veloped by them To augment ItSsurveillance
capabilities, the staff IS uSing various data
processing services so that Irregular trading
activity WIll be promptly detected and effectively investigated
For those securities traded by means of the
NASDAQ system, the Commission also has
developed a surveillance program, which IS
coordinated with the NASD's market surveillance program, through a review of weekly
and special stock watch reports
For those over-the-counter securities not
traded through NASDAQ, the Commission
uses automated equipment to provide an
efficrent and comprehensive surveillance of
stock quotations distributed by the National
Quotation Bureau. Thts IS programmed to
Identify, among other things, unlisted securities whose price movement or dealer Interest
varies beyond specified limits In a pre-established time period. When a secunty IS so
Identified, the equipment prints out current
and historic market Information. Other programs supplement thrs data with information
concerning sales of sscunnes pursuant to
Rule 144 under the Securities Act, ownership
reports, and penoorc company filings such as
quarterly and annual reports These data,
combined with other available information,
are analyzed for possible further Inquiry and
enforcement action
In addition, recognizing that the computer
provides the most expeditious method of reviewing and analyzing the volummous trading
data generated by the sacuntres markets, the
Commission has developed a program which
provrdes an analysts of the bid listings for
each security by summarizing specrned types
of acnvny by each broker-dealer firm subrmtling price quotations for that particular security.
The staff oversees tender offers, exchange
offers, proxy contests and other acnvmes
involving efforts to change control of pubhc
corporations Such oversight mdudes review
not only of trading markets In the securities
Involved, but also filings WIththe Commission
of required schedules, prospectuses, proxy
material and other information

INVESTIGATIONS
Each of the acts administered by the Comrrnssron authorizes investigations by It to determine If violations have occurred Most of
108

these are conducted by the Commission's
regional offices Investigations are carned out
on a confidential baSIS,consistent with effective law enforcement and the need to protect
persons against whom unfounded charges
might be made Thus, the existence or results
of a nonpubllc Investigation are generally not
divulged unless they are made a matter of
public record In proceedings brought before
the Commission or In the courts DUring the
fiscal year 1976, a total of 413 investigations
were opened, as against 490 In the preceding
year

ENFORCEMENT

PROCEEDINGS

The Cornrrussion has available a Wide
range of possibte enforcement remedies It
may, In appropriate cases, refer ItSfiles to the
Department of Justice with a recommendalion for cnrmnal prosecution The penalties
upon conviction are specified In the vanous
statutes and Include Imprisonment for substantial terms as well as fines
The securities laws also authorize the
Commission to file Injunctive actions In the
Federal drsmct courts to enjoin continued or
threatened Violations of those laws and applicable comrntsson rules In Injunctive actions,
the Commission frequently has sought to
obtain anCillary relief under the general equrty
powers of the Federal district courts The
power of the Federal courts to grant such
relief has been JudiCially recognized The
Oornrrussronoften has requested the court to
appoint a receiver for a busmess where
Investors were likely to be harmed by continuance of the exrstmq management It also
has requested court orders WhiCh, among
other things, restnct future activities of the
defendants, require that rescissron be offered
to securities purchasers, or require disgorgement of the defendants' III-gotten gains
The Commission's pnmary function IS to
protect the public from fraudulent and other
unlawful practices and not to obtain damages
for Injured mdrviduals Thus, a request that
dlsgorgement be required IS predicated on
the need to deprive defendants of profits
denved from their unlawful conduct and to
protect the public by deternng such conduct
by others.
If the terms of any Injunctive decree are
Violated, Criminal contempt proceedmgs may

be filed as a result of which the violator may
be fined or Imprisoned
The Federal secunnes acts also authorize
the Commission to Impose remedial administrative sanctions Administrative enforcement
proceedings Involve alleged violations of the
securities
acts or regulations
by firms or
persons engaged In the secunnes busrness
Generally speaking, If the Commission finds
that a respondent WIllfUlly Violated a provrsion
of or rule under the securities acts, failed
reasonably to supervise another person who
committed a Violation, or has been convicted
of or eruomed from certain types of misconduct, and that a sanction IS In the public
Interest, It may revoke or suspend the registration of a broker-dealer or Investment advrser, bar or suspend an mdrvidual from the
securities business or from assocranon With
an Investment company, or censure a firm or
mdivrdual. Proceedings may also cover adequacy of disclosure In a registration statement or In reports filed With the COmmission
Such a case may lead to an order suspendIng the effectiveness of a registration statement or directing compliance With reporting
requirements
The Commission also has the
power to suspend trading summarily In a
security when the public Interest requires

ADMINISTRATIVE

PROCEEDINGS

Summarized below are some of the many
administrative proceedings pending or finally
disposed of In fiscal 1976
Mitchum, Jones & Templeton, Inc 1-ln an
Initial decision which became the final deCIsion of the Comrrussron. Mitchum, Jones &
Templeton ("registrant"), a Los Angeles broker-dealer,
was found to have aided and
abetted Violations of antifraud and other proVISions of the secunties laws In connection
1972
With ItS partrcipanon In a registered
stock offenng of SaCom The administrative
law Judge concluded that the pubhc Interest
did not warrant rrnposrtron of a sanction
Registrant was a member of the underwntIng syndicate for the SaCom offenng However, ItS syndicate department manager had
an undisclosed understanding With the managing underwriter that registrant would not be
subject to the normal underwnter's
risk of
havinq to take unsold stock Into ItS Investment account None of the shares for which
registrant was committed were sold, pursuant

to the understanding, the managing underwriter purchased those shares for ItS own account upon termination of the syndicate The
failure to disclose the understanding was held
to render the representations concerning registrant In the reqrstratron statement and otherwise materially misleading
In holding that It was not necessary or
appropriate to sanction registrant, the adrrnnistranve law Judge noted, among other things,
that the misconduct represented an Isolated
occurrance, that It has not been proven that
registrant had failed reasonably to supervrse.
and that the responsible employee had not
been associated With registrant since 1973
Chartered
New England
Corp 2_ The
Comrrusston
instituted
administrative
proceedings against Chartered New England
Corp ("Chartered"),
a New York brokerdealer, ItS president, two vice presidents and
a registered representative
The order alleged, among other things, that the respondents Violated the antifraud and registration
provisrons of the Federal secunties laws In
connection With Chartered's acnvmes as an
underwriter and a market-maker In the securities of Audio Media Corp
On accepting offers of settlement from the
respondents, the Cornrmssron suspended two
of the respondents for specrtred periods of
time from assocration With a broker or dealer
The Cornrrussron also requrred that Chartered
and the remaining respondents, With certain
exceptions. not engage In the activmes of a
broker or dealer for a penod of three months
and not engage In offers of securities for a
penod of rune months
The order further
required, With respect to Chartered, procedures for compliance With the secunnes laws
and specified addmonal sanctions against an
mdivrdual vice president
which Included,
among other things, a prohibition against
sharing In the profits of Chartered for a runemonth penod
Michael Batterman, et al J_ The Commission accepted offers of settlement from MIchael Batterman, who had been a registered
representative With a broker-dealer now no
longer In busrness, from Ragnar Option Corporation, an options dealer, and from Ragnar's pnncrpal executive officer, Victor Sperandeo These respondents
were found to
have manipulated the market for the common
stock of Vetco Offshore
Industnes,
Inc,

109

which was then listed on the Amencan Stock
Exchange ("AMEX").
In essence, respondents developed a system of bUying and seiling options for Vetco
stock In such a way as to Insure that when
the stock to cover those options was purchased or sold on the AMEX, those orders
would arrive simultaneously and be matched
against each other These transactions created a false and misleading appearance of
active trading In Vetco stock In addition,
Batterman, who was wntmq most of the options Involved, entered Simultaneous orders
to purchase and sell short Vetco stock (Involving over 180,000 shares) for accounts
over which he had discretionary
authonty
These "wash" sales also created a false and
misleading appearance of active trading Batterman's use of hrs discretionary accounts for
thrs purpose also constituted a fraud against
rus customers, who were required to pay a
brokerage fee on these "wash" sales and
who realized substantial losses because of
margin requirements
In addition to consenting
to a censure,
Ragnar and Sperandeo
agreed to restrict
their dealings In options In specmed terms so
as to prevent recurrance of the type of trading
which produced their part In the manipulation
Batterman, also on consent, was barred from
the securrtres Industry, With the proviso that
after two years he could apply for perrrussron
to become associated In a non-supervisory
POSition upon a showmq that he Will be adequately supervised
Paul L RIce 4_ The Commission
suspended Rice from association With any broker-dealer for 30 days Rice was a salesman
for a former broker-dealer firm The sanction
was based on the Cornrrussron's findings that
Rice had arranged for two of his customers to
sell 698,000 shares of unregistered common
stock of United Australian 011, Inc In Violation
of the Secuntres Act's registration provrsions
The Cornrrussron stated "Rice's argument
that the responsibility for complying With the
Secuntles Act's registration and prospectusdelivery requirements
rested wholly on rus
supenors goes much too far Salesmen also
have some measure of responsibihty In these
matters Thrs IS not to say that they must be
finished scholars In the metaphysics of the
Securmes Act But tarmhanty With the rudiments IS essential "

IDS, Ltd and Arthur LIpper, 11/5_ The
Cornrmssron barred lOS, Ltd (S A.) of Geneva, SWitzerland,
and Arthur Lipper, III,
president of Arthur Lipper Corporation, a broker-dealer firm, from association
With any
broker-dealer, and revoked the broker-dealer
registration of Lipper Corp It discontinued the
proceedings against Investors Planning Corporation of Amenca (IPC), now known as
CIP, lnc., a broker-dealer which was pnncrpally owned by lOS In determining to discontinue that aspect of the proceedings,
the
Comrrussion noted that IPC "was never an
Independent actor" and that "ItS present owners are wholly unaffiliated With lOS"
The remedial action was based on findings
that, dunng 1967 and 1968, lOS, which managed unregistered off-shore Investment companies, arranged to have Lipper Corp execute those companies' over-the-counter porttone transactions
and payor
"give up" a
portion of the cornrrussrons on such busmess
to IPC The Cornrrussron concluded that lOS
and IPC, aided and abetted by Lipper Corp
and Lipper, Violated the antifraud provrsrons
In reaching this conclusron, the Cornmrssron
found that. "Since neither of the lOS respondents (lOS and IPC) performed any brokerage function In connection With the overthe-counter transactions handled by Lipper
Corp, It IS apparent that they did nothing In
return for the Income that they denved from
those transactions
They Simply caused the
funds to divert $1,450,000 to them Lipper
Corp. was a mere condurt for the diversron
No extended discussron IS required to demonstrate that trus was a gross breach of
noucrary duty by the lOS respondents.
Since the Lipper respondents (Lipper Corp
and lJpper) knew about lOS's relationship to
the foreign funds, and since their active assistance was an essential element of the
scheme, they were clearly parncipants In the
lOS respondents' breach of trust"
The Comrrussron also concluded that lOS
and IPC engaged In a Similar rebanve comrmssron scheme With other brokers (not the
Lipper respondents) In connection With the
New York Stock Exchange portfolio transacnons of Fund of America, Inc, a registered
Investment company for which IPC was the
pnnopal underwriter and investment adviser
In addition, the lOS respondents were found

to have violated specified provrsions of the
Investment Company Act
Arthur LIpper, III, and LIpper Corp. have
appealed the Commission's decisron to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circutt, which appeal IS stili pending 6
Collms Secunties Corporatlon7-The
Commission revoked the broker-dealer
and investment adviser registrations of Collins Secunties and barred ItS president, Timothy
Collins, from association With any broker or
dealer After two years, he may apply to the
Commission
for permission to become so
associated In a position which IS not connected With the making of markets In securities
The Commission found that respondents
had manipulated the market for the common
stock of Big Horn National Life Insurance
Company, and sold the stock to customers
Without drsclosmq that they had artrncally
Inflated ItS price They were also found to
have Violated the anti manipulative provrsions
of Rule 10b--6 under the Exchange Act and
failed to comply With credit extension, recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
In rejecnnq Collins' argument that, as chief
executive officer of a large broker-dealer firm,
he could not be held responsible for every
mfracnon of credit extension, recordkeepinq
and reporting requirements, the Commission
stated: "[T]he president of a broker-dealer
has the responsibility for compliance WIth all
applicable requirements, He retains that responsibility unless and until he reasonably
delegates a particular function to another
person In the firm, and neither knows nor has
reason to know that the person In question IS
not properly pertorrnmq his duties '
Respondents have appealed the Commission's decrsron to the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
and that court has granted a stay of the
sancnons pending disposmon of the appeal B
Spangler and Nassar Firms 9_ The Comrrussion revoked the broker-dealer registrations of Richard C Spangler, Inc. and Nassar
and Co. Inc, and barred Richard C Spangler, Jr and George M Nassar, the respective presidents of Spangler, Inc and Nassar,
Inc, from association With any broker-dealer
It also granted the request of the firm of
Albert Teller and Co Inc, for the Withdrawal

of ItS broker-dealer registration, and censured
ItS president, Albert Teller.
The Commission found that Spangler, Nassar and Teller, Inc fraudulently sold the stock
of lnterarnencan Industries, Ltd , a company
which had a "commercially untried" oral contraceptive pili and "whose prospects turned
entirely
on an alleged
SCientific
breakthrough"
Spangler, Nassar and Teller, Inc
were found to have made misrepresentations
concerning the testing, efficacy and sales of
lnterarnencan's pili, and prospective nses In
the market price of ItS stock
In excluding the Spangler and Nassar respondents from the securities business, the
Commission said; "In Nassar's case, as In
Spangler's,
we deal With a high-pressure
sales effort that lasted for a long time, was
unsupported by any semblance of an adequate foundation, and was characterized by
grossly reckless price predictrons."
As to
Teller, Inc and Teller, the Comrrussion found
that the case against them stood on a "different footing" It observed "The Teller otncrals
who sold lnterarnencan stock fraudulently are
no longer With the firm And Teller, who
owned Virtually all of the firm's stock, made
no fraudulent
representations
himself
HIs
derehctron stems solely from a failure to supervise."
In ordering Withdrawal and censure, It took
Into account "the purely vrcanous nature of
Teller, Inc's liability and the fact that Teller's
misconduct was limited In extent and brief In
duration."
Nassar has appealed the Cornrrnsston's
decisron as to him and his firm to the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Ctrcurt, 10

TRADING SUSPENSIONS
The Secunties Exchange Act authonzes
the Commission summarily to suspend tradIng In a secunty traded either on a national
secunties
exchange
or In the over-thecounter market for a period of up to ten days
If, In the Comrrussron's opmron, such action IS
In the public Interest Dunng fiscal 1976, the
Cornrrussron Initiated a new procedure permitting a person adversely affected by a
trading suspension to petition the Commission In wnnnq to terminate the suspension If
he has reason to believe that It IS not neces-

111

sary In the public Interest or for the protection
of Investors." As a result of the Secuntres
Acts Amendments of 1975, authonty to suspend trading In secunues of banks was transferred from the Commission to the Federal
bank regulatory agencies. The Commission
has sought to provide technical assistance
and coordination to these bank regulatory
aqencres If It should appear that a suspension of trading In bank securities may be
necessary
Dunng fiscal 1976, the Commission suspended trading In the secunties of 126 companies, an Increase of 11 percent over the
113 securities suspended In fiscal 1975 and a
54 percent decrease from the 279 secunnes
suspended In fiscal 1974 Of the 126 companies whose seeuntres were the subject of
trading suspensions In fiscal 1976, 70 were
suspended because of delinquency In filing
required reports with the Commission In
most other instances, the trading suspension
was ordered either because of substannal
questions as to the adequacy, accuracy or
availability of public information concerning
the company's nnanoat condition or business
operations, or because of transactions In the
company's securities suggesting possible
mampulauonsor other violations.
For Instance, on March 25, 1976, the Commission suspended trading In the secunnes of
Presley Companies, pending ctanncanon of
rumors relating to the company's entry Into
the field of energy technology 12 The Commission's action occurred shortly after a rapid
Increase In the pnce of Presley's stock amid
conflicting reports of an arrangement
whereby the company acquired the hcenstnq
nghts to a oevice which purportedly produced
hydrogen gas from tap water. Subsequently,
on May 20, 1976, the Commission Initiated
proceedings to determine whether the company had failed to comply with certain provisions of the Exchange Act by filing reports
wluch, among other things, omitted matenal
information required to be stated therein, or
necessary to make statements therein not
misleading

DELINQUENT REPORTS
PROGRAM
Fundamental to the success of the disclosure scheme of the Federal securities laws IS
the timely filing In proper form and content of
112

annual and other periodic and current reports
required to be filed by Issuers and Individuals
The Delinquent Reports Program was started
by the staff two years ago to Identify required
reports which have not been nrnely filed and,
when appropriate, to recommend remedial
enforcement action. Such enforcement action
entails alerting the public to the lack of current and accurate mtorrnanon and, where
necessary, seeking a court order requmnp
the filing of delinquent reports coupled With
an InJuncllonagainst further violations of the
Exchange Act's reportmg provisrons,
The staff of the Commission contmuously
rnorutorscompliance with the periodic reportIn9 requirements of Sections 13 and 15(d) of
the Exchange Act. When Cornrrussron records Indicate a delinquency, the staff Will,
among other things, mall the registrant a
notice of detected delinquency and request
that a wntten explanation be filed under cover
of Form B-K On July 14, 197513, the Comrmssron announced Its intention to indude
thereafter In a registrant's public file certam
correspondence to and from a registrant concerning ItS delinquency notwithstanding the
registrant's continued filing responsibilities
ThiS procedure makes available to the public
a delinquent registrant's reasons for failing to
meet ItSstatutory disclosure obligations.
The Commission suspended trading In the
secunties of approximately seventy reqrstrants dunng the 1976 fiscal year pnmanly
based on their failure to file at least one
required annual report These suspensions
were temporary-they ran for one ten-day
penod for each delinquent registrant Approximatety twenty, or about 29 percent, of the
seventy suspensions Involved registrants
whose securities were listed for trading on a
national secunnes exchange
Dunng nus fiscal year, the Comrrussion
Initiated five CIVilactions against delinquent
registrants seekmg court orders compelling
the Immediate filing of delinquent reports and
permanently enjoining future analagous Exchange Act violations. Three of those acnons
were resolved by consents to the entry of,
inter alia, fmal judgments of permanent injunction; 14 one case, SEC v. Western Ortxs
Company, was resolved by the grant of a
summary judgment In favor of the Commission which mduded a final Judgment of permanent InjUnctlon,15and one action IS pend-

Ing. 16 Another crvrl action under this Program,
SEC v Umted Communities Corp and Alexander L Guterma, Initiated on May 27, 1975
and resolved by consent on July 28, 1975, IS
noteworthy because the Commission sought
and obtained Injunctive relief against both the
delinquent registrant and ItS chief executive
officer. 17
In this fiscal year, the Commission
also
initiated
two ctvil contempt
proceedings
based on delinquencies In spite of court ordered injunctions
against such violations
Both proceedings are pending but one deserves particular mention. SEC v VTR, Inc
was a civu injunctive
action settled by a
consent upon which a Final Judgment of
Permanent Injunction was entered on April
19, 1973 by the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia. Havmq detected
subsequent violations of trus mjuncnon, the
Cornrrussron rrunated a crvtl contempt proceeding on August 26, 1975 against both
VTR, Inc and ItS chief executive
officer,
David E Jordan 18 There have been several
hearings on nus matter and the Court has
found both VTR, Inc. and Jordan In civil
contempt of Its Final Judgment of Permanent
Injunction 19 However, some of the violations
contmue, and the Court has granted the
CommisSion's requested remedial relief includinq the appointment of a limited receiver
(I) to oversee the preparation and filing of
delinquent VTR Exchange Act reports, and
(II) to submit recommendations for a program
to assure future VTR compliance
with ItS
Exchange Act and Court ordered filing obliganons 20 Moreover, the Court decreed that
VTR be fined $25 per day and Jordan be
fined $75 per day for each day of continued
civil contempt The Commission has moved
for the entry of Judgments of fine against VTR
and Jordan on three separate occasions and
the Court has granted such JUdgments resultIng In aggregate fines against VTR, Inc. of
$4,975 and aggregate fines against Jordan of
$14,925. To date $6,000 of such fines have
been paid Into the registry of the Court. Trus
matter IS stili pendlng.21

CIVIL PROCEEDINGS
DUring fiscal 1975, the Comrrussron Instituted a total of 158 Injunctive actions Some

a permanent Injunction against Shevell, Epstein, and LeVine based on consents filed by
these indiVidual defendants
The relief obtained In these actions In- I
eludes, among other things, the appointment Ii
of additronal Independent

Boards of Directors of Eastern and ASSOCIated, the maintenance of an execulive committee consisting of the new additional directors, and the appointment
of a new chief
executive officer, as well as the appointment
of addrtronal trustees to the Eastern and

comthe allegations
plaint, as well as any other matters deemed
appropriate
On April 22, 1976 both Eastern and ASSOCIated filed petitions for reorganization
pursuant to Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act
Later, on April 28, 1976 Eastern and Assooated filed "Consents
to Adjudication"
and
were ultimately declared bankrupt Due to the
filing of the bankruptcy proceedings by Eastern and ASSOCiated, the investigation being
conducted by the respective speoal counsels
was terminated
In June 1976, Eastern resumed opsranons, on a scaled-down baSIS,
113

pursuant to Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act.
It is anticipated that the Investigation of the
special counsel for Eastern will resume upon
approval by the Bankruptcy Court.
SEC v. PRF Corp. Involved alleged violations by PRF of the proxy provrsions of the
Federal secuntres laws.23 The complaint
charged that, by use of a false and misleadIng proxy statement, the shareholders were
soiiorted to vote on a conversion of Class A
stock, owned by the controlling shareholder
and rus family and assooates, Into common
stock In such a way that the only practical
effect of such conversion was to Increase by
2,000 percent the dividend nghts of the former Class A stockholders at the expense of
the common stockholders The complaint
also charged that the shareholders were not
Informed that there was a substantial question as to the legality of such a conversion.
The complaint further charged that the proxy
statement did not disclose other matenal
facts, Including the purpose and effect of a
plan to buy 1,000,000 shares of common
stock from the estate of the controlling shareholder at hrs death for $1,500,000 In addition, the complaint alleged that PRF's proxy
statement failed to Include the information
required by the Oornmlssron's proxy rules
and regulations and that It did not provrde the
shareholders of PRF the opportumty to vote
against proposals as required by the Commissron's proxy rules
PRF consented to an order permanently
enjOIningIt from Violating the proxy provrsions
of the Federal secunnes laws Certain anollary relief was ordered by the court, including.

The case of SEC v Ftrestone Ttre & Rubber Co, et et , involves use of corporate
funds for unlawful political contnbuuons, both
domestic and foreign, over a penod of 8
years The Commission obtained injunctive
and ancillary relief against Firestone, Robert
P. Beasley, formerly Its executive vice president and Vice-chairmanof the Board of Directors, and Raymond C Firestone, chairman of
Firestone's Board of Directors and formerly
chief executive offlcer.24 In ItS complaint, the
Oornrrussron alleged, among other things,
that penodic and annual reports and proxy
rnatenals filed by Firestone With the Commission dunng the penod from 1968 through
June 15, 1976 were false and misleading In
Violation of the antifraud, proxy and reporting

118

the death of Howard Hughes In April 1976,
the court, on the Commission's motion,
agreed to substitute his estate as defendant
(the case now being re-captioned SEC v
iummts et al In the action, filed In March
1975 by the Commission, which alleged a
sequence of actions by Hughes, his wholly
owned company Summa, his attorney and
Summa director, Chester C. Davis, and his
assistant, Robert Maheu, arising from the bid
by Hughes In 1968 to purchase the assets of
Atr West, a regional West Coast airline. The
Commission's complaint alleged, among
other things, that Hughes (a) hired public
relations man James "Jimmy the Greek"
Snyder to disseminate false and misleading
reports to shareholders, (b) made contributions to certain political figures who had spoken on Snyder's request In support of the
Hughes offer, (c) caused the Issuance In both
1968 and again In 1970 of materially false
and misleading proxy statements, and (d)
engaged In a scheme of stock manipulation
and lawsuits against Atr West directors opposed to hrs offer to force those directors to
change their votes to tus support. The Comrmssron alleged that Air West shareholders
had been led to believe that they would
receive $22 for their shares and supporter,
the Hughes offer for that reason, when Ultimately, through valuations of assets and
forced write downs alleged not to be In accordance With the Purchase Agreement, the
shareholders received only $8 75

and has had most of the defendants' affirmative defenses stricken from the record. Judgment by default has been obtained against
James Snyder. Howard Hughes on two occasions failed to appear for deposmons, and
both he and hrs companies (of which the
Court declared 111mto be the Managing
Agent) have been defaulted. The Commission has been conducting extensive diSCOVery since November 1975, and expects thiS
to continue through this fiscal year with a trial
on the merits against the remaining parties
shortly thereafter.

An Important
part of the Commission's
cnrmnal enforcement program IS ItS Criminal
contempt proceedings.
In U S v. William
Robert Cook, 53 Wilham Robert Cook was
convicted of three counts of Criminal contempt after a six-day trial The contempt
arose from rus disobeying the provrsions of a
permanent Injunction entered against him In
1970 The defendant
had engaged
In a
course of conduct In willful disobedience of
the Injunction in the offer and sale of fractional undlvrdad working interests In oil and
gas leases He distributed fraudulent Schedule B sheets, made false statements to investors, usmq high pressure "boiler room" telephone salesmen, and Improperly used investors' morues. Trus case IS particularly Significant In that the defendant received a threeyear prison term. The convicnon was affirmed
by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth
CIfCUlt
In another Criminal contempt proceeding,
With the CIVil
which arose In connnecnon
Injunctive action entitled SEC v. TransJersey
Bancorp, the Commission charged that the
defendants
had engaged In a scheme to
manipulate the price of TransJersey securities from $13 per share In September 1975 to
$27 per share In October 1975.54 Ralph
Iannelli, who had been previously snjomed
from engaging m rnanipulative conduct, was
found gUilty of Criminal contempt after an
eight-day JUry trial. ThIS cnrnmal proceeding
was insntuted and tned by the Commission's
staff rather than through a referral of the case
to the Department of Justice. Iannelli was
given a two-year suspended sentence and
place on probanon for two years
US v, Tom R. Rodgers 55-0n an appeal
from hrs cnrrunal contempt convionon, which

sought to set aside the prior consent decree
on which the contempt charge was based,
Tom R Rodgers argued that he did not have
effective counsel at the time he consented to
the Injunction The Court of Appeals for the
Fifth CircUit held that the Sixth Amendment
nght to effective counsel does not apply to
civrl proceedings The court also stated:
"Consent Decrees would not be worth very
much If every violation of them had to be
prosecuted de novo as a violation of the
securities acts. We think It ISsafe to conclude
that Congress did not Intend for enforcement
of the securities acts to be confined In this
way. "

Organized Crime Program
The prosecution of securities cases ISoften
based primarily on circumstantial evidence
requmnq extensive investigation by highly
trained personnel. The difficulties In such
investigations and prosecutions are compounded when elements of organized crime
are Involved. Witnesses are usually reluctant
to cooperate because of threats or fear of
physical harm. Books, records. and other
documentary evidence essential to the Investigation and to a successful prosecution may
be destroyed or nonexistent. The organized
cnme element ISadept at diSgUISingItSpartieipation In transactions. through the use of
aliases and nominee accounts, by operating
across international boundaries, and by takIng advantage of foretgn bank secrecy laws.
It frequently operates through "fronts" and
Infiltrates legitimate business concerns. Organized crime also has an extensive network
of affiliates throughout this country In all
walks of life, and m.rnany foreign nations. As
a result of these problems. CIViland criminal
litigation Involving organized crime can result
In unusually lengthy proceedings. Despite
these difficulties, the Commission. working In
cooperation Withother enforcement aqenoes,
has been able to make major contributions to
the fight against organized crime.
DUring the fiscal year 1976. the organized
crime program focused pnncipally on two
goals. (1) increasing the Commission's effectiveness In obtaining current reliable Information relating to organized Criminal activity In
the securities Industry; and (2) aggressively
pursuing to completion investigations of situations brought to the Commission's attention

as potentially mvolvmq the the Infiltration of
elements of organized crime Into the Industry
In order to Increase the flow of reliable
data. an Intelligence unit was established In
1974 In the Divrsion of Enforcement Its pnnctpal function ISto maintain channels of communication With state, local and other Federal
agencies, as well as comparable agencies of
foreign governments. which might have Information on organized cnrnmal activrty In the
secunnes Industry, Information received by
this Unit IS correlated With other available
information and evaluated In light of the Comrrussron's responsibilities under the Federal
secunnes laws, Information Indicating pOSSIble securities law Violations by organized
cnrrunal elements IS relayed by the Intelligence Unit to those other members of the
staff whose pnncipal duties are to Investigate
activrty by organized crime ThiS program has
already generated a Significant number of
new cases, as well as contributing new
sources of Information to ongoing Investigations
In furtherance of the intelligence function.
members of the statt have continued to participate In seminars and lectures sponsored
by state and local governments and their
representatives have been Included In the
Commission's training programs Thrs has
alerted local authonnes to the role of the
Comrrussion In curtailing organized cnrnmal
activity In the securities Industry, Members of
the Commission staff are also assiqnsd on a
full time baSISto certain of the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Forces, Both
the Strike Forces and the Oornrmssron staff
have benefited thereby In learning more
about organized Criminalacnvny In the securities Industry.
As a result of the organized crime unit's
enforcement efforts dunnq the past fiscal
year, the Commission filed injunctive actions
naming 23 persons and contributed to the
return of Indictments naming 17 mdivrduals
and the convicnons of 35 of them Two persons considered to be Important members of
organized cnme were eruomeo, three such
members were indicted and three convicted
on indictments returned In pnor years The
Comrmssron presently has 58 matters under
mvestiqatronmvolvmq organized cnme
After an extensive Cornrmssron Investigation and the efforts of the Organized Cnme
125

Strike Force In Manhattan, on June 29, 1976,
a Federal grand JUryIn the Southern District
of New York indicted seven individuals, Including GUido Benrgno, and two former stock
brokers charging them with seeunnes fraud
and conspiracy In connection with the offer
and sale of counterfeit American Home Products Corporation stock certificates. The Indictment alleges that as part of the scheme, the
defendants caused Seed Capital Corporation,
a former New York stock brokerage firm, to
deliver 13,000 fraudUlently Issued shares to
purchasers In exchange for approximately
$1,400,000 Thereafter, the defendants
caused Seed Capital to Issue checks for
$1,300,000 which the defendants then
cashed
In another significant case the Commission
hied a CIVilaction In the U.S District Court for
the Southern District of New York, on April
26, 1976, seeking a permanent mjunction
against John C Doyle and eight others, to
prevent further violations of the anti-fraud and
antlmarnpulatron provisrons of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 In connection with
transactions In the securities of Canadian
Javelin Limited The complaint alleges that
Doyle, the prrncipal shareholder of Canadian
Javelin, and the other defendants participated
In a scheme to manipulate the market price of
Canadian Javelin stock on the American
Stock Exchange.

Cooperation with Other
Enforcement Agencies
In recent years the Comrnlssion has given
increased ernphasrs to cooperation and coordination with other enforcement agencies,
including the self-regulatory organizations,
enforcement agencies at the state and local
level, and certain foreign agencies. Its programs In thrs area cover a broad range For
example, the Cornrnlssron believes that certain cases are more appropnately enforced at
the local rather than the Federal level where
the activities, while perhaps Violatingthe Federal securities laws, are essentially of a local
nature In these Instances, the Commission
authonzes the referral of the case to the
appropriate state or local agency, and members of the staff familiar With It are made
available for direct assistance to that agency
In its enforcement action. A member of the
staff has been specifically designated as a
126

liaison With state enforcement and requlatory
authonnes

The Commission also has fostered programs desrqned to provide a cornprehensrve
exchange of Information concerning mutual
enforcement problems and possible secunnes Violations DUring the fiscal year, It continued ItSprogram of annual regional enforcement conferences These conferences are
attended by personnel from state secunnes
agencies, the U S Postal Service, Federal,
and state and local offices of selt-requlatory
assocratrons, such as the NASD. They provide a forum for the exchange of Information
on current enforcement problems and new
methods of enforcement cooperation One
result of these conferences has been the
establishment of programs for JOintmvesnqanons Although the conferences were Initially
hosted by the Commission's regional offices,
many state and local agencies are now servIng as sponsors or co-sponsors

SWISS TREATY
The ratification process continued on the
Treaty between the United States and SWitzerland on Mutual ASSistanceIn Cnmmal Matters.56 Negotiations on this Treaty began In
1969 and culminated In ItS signing In Bern In
May of 1973. The SWISSratification procedure, which Included Implementing legislation
believed necessary, was completed in the
middle of January 1976. The Treaty was
transmitted to the President in early February
and to the Senate In the middle of February
The Senate Foreign RelalJons Committee
held heanngs on the Treaty In the middle of
June, and It was approved by the Senate
approximately a week later The exchange of
Instruments of ratification should follow
shortly The Treaty takes effect 180 days
after that date.
In general, the Treaty provides for broad
cooperation between the two countries In
criminal matters. Provision IS made for assistance In locating Witnesses, obtaining Witnesses' statements and testimony, the production and authentication of business records, and the service of Judicial and administrative documents. The Treaty also provides
for special assistance in cases involvmq organized crime
The Treaty should be of assistance to the
Cornrrnssron In major cases where SWISS

financial institutions are utilized to engage In
securities transactions In the United States,
or where funds resulting from Illegal activities
are secreted In such situations

FOREIGN RESTRICTED LIST
The Cornrrussion maintains and publishes
a Foreign Restricted List which ISdesiqned to
put broker-dealers, financial institutions,
Investors and others on notice of unlawful
distributions of foreign secuntres In the United
States The list consists of names of foreign
compames whose securities the Commission
has reason to believe have been, or are
being offered for public sale In the Umted
States In violation of the registration requirement of Section 5 of the Securities Act of
1933 The offer and sale of unregistered
seeuntres deprives Investors of all the protections afforded by the Securities Act of 1933,
including the right to receive a prospectus
contarnmqthe information required by the Act
for the purpose of enabling the Investor to
determine whether the Investment IS SUitable
for him While most broker-dealers refuse to
effect transactions In secuntres Issued by
companies on the Foreign Restricted trst,
this does not necessarily prevent promoters
from Illegally offering such secunties directly
to Investors In the Umted States by mall, by
telephone, and sometimes by personal sohcrtanon. DUringthe past fiscal year, 15 corporations were added to the Foreign Restricted
trst, bringing the total number of corporations

Part 5
Investment Companies
and Advisers

PartS
Investment Companies
and Advisers

Under the Investment
Company Act of
1940 and the Investment
Advisers Act of
1940, the Commission IS charged with extensive regulatory and supervisory responsibilities over Investment companies and investment advisers
The responsrbrnty
for discharging these duties lies with the Divrsron of
Investment Management
Unlike other Federal secunnes laws, which
emphasize disclosure, the Investment Company Act provides a regulatory framework
within which Investment companies must operate. Among other things, the Act (1) prohibits changes In the nature of an Investment
company's business or ItS Investment policies
Without shareholder
approval, (2) protects
against management self-dealing, embezzlement or abuse of trust, (3) provides specifrc
controls to eliminate or mitigate mequitable
capital structures, (4) requires that an investment company disclose ItS financial condition
and Investment policies, (5) provides that
management
contracts
be submitted
to
shareholders for approval and that provisron
be made for the safekeeping of assets, and
(6) sets controls to protect against unfair
transactions
between an Investment company and ItS affiliates
Persons advismq others on their secuntres
transactions for compensation must register
With the Commission under the Investment
Advrsers Act Thrs requirement was extended
by the Investment Company Amendments
Act of 1970 to Include advisers to registered
Investment
companies
The Advisers Act,
among other things, prohibits performance
fee contracts which do not meet certain requirements, fraudulent, deceptive or rnampu-

lanve practices, and advernsrnq which does
not comply With certain restrictions.
Investment companies and assets under
the management of Investment advisers constitute Important resources for Investment In
the nation's capital markets In order to continue their role of channeling indiVidual savIngs Into capital needed for Industrial development, Investment companies and Investment advisers must have the confidence of
Investors, and the safeguards provided by the
Investment Company and Investment AdVISers Acts contribute to sustaining such confidence

NUMBER OF REGISTRANTS
As of June 30, 1976, there were 1,286
active Investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act, With assets
havmq an aggregate market value of over
$806 billion Those figures represent a decrease of 17 In the number of registered
companies and an Increase of nearly $6 4
billion In the market value of assets since
June 30, 1975 Further data IS presented In
the statistical section of this Report At June
30, 1976, 3,857 Investment advisers were
registered With the Commission, representing
an Increase of 437 from a year before
DUring the fiscal year, the DIVISion's staff
conducted examinations
of 260 Investment
companies and 425 Investment advisers, 17
and 21 respectively, more than dunnq fiscal
1975. It IS the Commission's ultimate objective to examine all Investment company registrants Within the first year after registration,
and to examine each registered Investment
133

company and registered Investment adviser
every other year This should provide effective regulatory oversrqht As a result of the
Commission's examination and Investigation
program In 1976, numerous Violations of the
Investment Company Act and of the Investment AdVisers Act were uncovered, and approximately $1,582,928 were returned to investment companies and their shareholders
Ten Investment company and forty Investment adviser matters were referred to the
DIVISion of Enforcement for possible action

PROPOSED LEGISLATION
Investment Advisers Act
Amendments of 1976
On December 11, 1975, the Cornrmssron
transmitted to Congress proposed amendments to the Investment Acvisers Act of 1940
to provide substantial additional protections
to Investment advrsory clients
These proposals, desiqned to upgrade the
standards and quality of regulation of investment advtsers, would provide the Cornrmssion With the authonty to prescnbe minimum
qualification standards and financial responsrbility requirements for registered advisers In
addition, the legislation would (1) make certain technical and conforming changes, (2)
eliminate the "Intrastate" exemption provided
In the Act, (3) c1arrfy the existence of a prrvate
rrght of action based on a Violation of the Act,
(4) amend the definition of "person associated With an Investment adviser," and (5)
authonze
and direct the Cornrmssron
to
study
(I) the extent to which persons not Included In the definition of Investment
adviser or specifically excluded therefrom engage In actrvrtres Similar to
those engaged In by Investment adVISers and whether such exclustons are
consistent
With the Act's underlying
purposes; and
(II) the extent to which the establishment
of one or more self-regulatory organizations would tacihtate the Act's purposes
On February 3 and 4, 1976, the Subcommittee on Secunnes of the Senate Committee
on Banking, HOUSing and Urban Affairs, held
hearrngs on S 2849, a bill SUbstantially Similar
to the Cornrrnssron's proposals FollOWing the

134

Subcommittee's
consideration of the measure, the full Committee on Banking, HOUSing
and Urban Affairs favorably reported S 2849
on May 20, 1976, With certain changes A
companion bill, H R 13737, was the subject
of hearrngs on May 20 before the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Finance
of the House Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce, and the full Committee,
which adopted the changes made by the
Senate Committee

THE NASD MAXIMUM SALES
LOAD RULE
On October 10, 1975, the Comrrussron
approved the National ASSOCiation of Securrties Dealers' maximum sales load rule relatIng to mutual fund shares and certain other
redeemable sscunnss 1 Seclion 22(b) of the
Investment Company Act gives the NASD
authorrty, With Cornrrussron oversrqht, to promulgate and enforce rules to prevent sales
charges which are "excessive"
The statute
provides that such rules must allow for "reasonable" compensation for sales personnel,
broker-dealers,
and underwriters.
and for
"reasonable" sales loads to Investors
For mutual funds and Single-payment contractual plans the rule essentially provides a
ceiling of 8 50% on sales charges (declining
to 6 25% for larger purchases), but conditions
the right to charge the maximum on the
fund's offerrng (1) diVidend reinvestment at
net asset value, (2) rrghts of accumulation,
and (3) volume discounts, as defined In the
rule A specmc deduction from the maximum
allowable sales charge IS Imposed for failure
to provide each of the services
The rule change also provides maximum
sales loads ranging from 8 50% down to
6 50% on Single-payment varrable annumes,
and a maximum of 8 50% of total payments
as of a date not later than the twelfth year
after purchase for multiple-payment
variable
annurty contracts

CONTRACTUAL PLAN RESERVE
REQUIREMENTS LOWERED
On October 22, 1975, the Cornrrusston
amended Rule 27d-1 under the Investment
Company Act 2 Tnrs revision, which became
effective December 15, 1975, modified the
reserve requirernents for front-end load con-

tractual plans ("penodlc
payment plans")
The reserve requirements were established
by the Commission
In 19713 and are designed to ensure that sponsors of front-end
load penodic payment plans will be able to
carry out their obligations to refund sales
charges pursuant to Sections 27(d) and 27(f)
of the Investment Company Act The revrsion
of these requirements was based upon data
filed with the Commission on the sales, persistency and refund expenence of more than
32,000 front-end load plans dunng the two
years following the adoption of the reserve
requirement
The revrsron was designed to
prevent unnecessary
burdens upon plan
sponsors, while contmumq to ensure proper
protection for Investors

PROPOSED RULES
Rule 15a-2
On March 25, 1976,4 the Commission proposed the adoption of new Rule 15a-2 under
the Investment Company ActS to provide a
procedure which funds may follow In order to
be certain that annual continuances of their
advisory and pnncipal undsrwntmq contracts
meet the requirement of Sections 15( a)(2)
and 15(b)(1) of the Act that such continuances be "specifically approved at least annually"
One purpose of the statutory requirement
IS to prevent the life of an advisory or distnbubon contract from continuing for an unreasonable penod of time Without re-evaluation by
directors or shareholders Another purpose IS
to assure that the decisron to continue a
contract IS based on sutncrsnt Information as
to the performance of the Investment advrser
or pnncipal underwnter to be meaningful
Under the proposed rule the management
of a fund could be certain of fulfilling these
purposes by haVing the directors or shareholders vote on the continuance of a contract
dunng a specified penod pnor to the date a
contract would terminate, If ItS continuance
were not so approved The rule would not
preclude consrderanon of a contract at more
frequent Intervals and would not prescnbe the
exclusive method of complying With Section
15 of the Act
The DIVISion IS analyzrnq the comments
received and IS prepanng appropnate recommendations to the Commission

"Open-seasons"

Rule

In August 1975, the Commission published
for comment proposed Rule 22~6
and a
proposed amendment to Rule 134 under the
Secunties Act of 1933 which together would
further Implement the recommendations
of
the DIVISion's August 1974 "Mutual Fund
Drstnbution Report" These proposals would
permit mutual funds, their pnnctpal underwnters, and dealers to offer fund shares at
reduced or no load to qualifying repeat investors At year end, the comments were being
analyzed by the staff

Temporary Rule 6c-2(T) and
Proposed Rule 6c-2
In February 1974, the Commission adopted
Temporary Rule 6c-2(T) and proposed for
public comment a permanent measure, Rule
6c-27 to provide corporations organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement
and
Act of 19718 ("ANCSA corporations"
"Settlement
Act" respectively)
blanket exemptive relief from a substantial number of
provrsions of the Investment Company Act
The corporations,
over 200 In number,
were created to receive, hold, and administer
the land, minerai nghts and cash awarded by
the United States Government to Alaska's
Native Indian, Aleut and Eskimo populations
In settlement of their abonqmal claims to the
land In the State of Alaska Dunng the first
few years of the exrstence of the ANCSA
corporations,
only the cash portion of the
award was actually drstnbuted to the companies, and many of the Settlement Act companies Invested the cash In secuntres Hence, a
substantial number of these entities became
Investment companies Within the meaning of
the Act, and registered pursuant to Section
8(a) of the Act
On January 2, 1976, the Settlement Act
was amended to exempt ANCSA corporations from all provisions of the Act, as well as
all provrsions of the Secunnes Act of 1933
and the Secuntres Exchange Act of 1934 9
As a practical matter this amendment makes
registration
under the Act by an ANCSA
corporation both unnecessary and inappropnate. The Commission proposed.!" therefore, pursuant to Section 8(f) of the Act, to
declare by order upon ItS own motion that
such ANCSA corporations as had registered
135

have ceased to be Investment companies as
defined rn the Act and rescinded Rule 6c-

2(T)
Rule 206( 4~4
On March 5, 1975, the Commission proposed the adoption of new Rule 206(4)-4 and
new paragraph (14) of Rule 204-2(a) under
the Investment Advisers Act 11 The proposed
rules are rntended to assure that extsnnq and
prospective clients of an Investment adviser
obtain written disclosure of material information which would enable such persons to
evaluate, among other things, the adviser's
quautrcanons, methods, services and fees
They generally would require that Investment
advisers furnish a written disclosure statement to every client and prospective client
(other than a registered Investment company)
upon entering Into. extending or renewing an
advisory contract with such client and that
copies of each such disclosure statement be
maintained by Investment advrsers as part of
their recordkeepmq obligations under the Advisers Act. The proposed written statement
would include, among other things. a desenplion of the types of services offered, length of
time the Investment adviser has been In such
business. Investment techniques, sources of
information used. general standards of education and business background required of
advisory personnel and the baSIS of fee
charges There are additional disclosure requirernents for advrsers provrdmg Investment
supervisory services or managing Investment
advisory accounts. DUringthiS fiscal year. the
staff has analyzed the comments received on
thrs proposal and IS now consrdennq an alternative approach to accomplishing the proposal's objectives

guard against fraudulent secunnes trading
practices.
Rule 204-2(c) requires that books and records be maintained and preserved "In an
easily accessible place" and that partnership
articles and corporate books and records be
maintained at the Investment adviser's pnncrpal office In this regard, there has been
some uncertainty as to whether places outSide the tern tory of the United States are
"easuy accessible" To resolve thrs question.
the Cornrrussion adopted new paragraph (J)
under Rule 204-212 which requires a nonresident Investment adviser either (1) to
maintain and preserve copies of the books
and records at a location WIthin the United
States and file With the Commission a notice
specifying the address of such place, or (2) to
file with the Commission an undertakmg to
furnish copies of such books and records
upon demand by the Commission. The rule IS
substantially Similar to Rule 17a-7 under the
Securibes Exchange Act.

Rules Concerning Applications
for Orders Filed Under Investment
Advisers Act
On May 13, 1976, the Commission proposed the adoption of Rules 0-4, 0--5. and 0-613 under the Advisers Act. which would
establish rules governing the filing and processing of applications for orders under the
Advisers Act The proposed rules, which are
Similar to the rules under the Investment
Company Act concerning applications, are
Intended to provide the Commission With the
kind of formal and complete record normally
required as the baSISfor Commission action
on applications for orders The DIVISion IS
presently considennq the comments received
on the proposed rules.

Rule 204-2(j)

Rule 202-1

In order to strengthen the protections afforded by the Investment Advisers Act to
Investment advisory clients, one amendment
to the recordkeepmq rule was made Rule
204-2 requires Investment advisers to maintain such books and records as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate In the puohc Interest or for the protection
of Investors The recordkeepinq requirernents
of Rule 204-2 serve as an Important safe-

The DIVISionbecame concerned that cer.
tam provisrons of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") en.
couraged persons who were otherwise ex.
empt from registration to register under the
Investment Advisers Act In order to Insulate
trustees of their employer-sponsored employee benefit plans from liability for a breach
of fidUCiary duty by In-house rnanaqe.s In
order to extend ERISA's substantial protsc-

136

nons to beneftcianes of such plans, the Commission proposed on September 29, 1975,14
and adopted on March 12, 1976,15 Rule 2021, which excludes from the definition of an
Investment adviser a person who offers Investment advice to an employee benefit plan,
as defined In ERISA, sponsored by his employer, If such person does not otherwise
engage In the Investment advisory business
or hold himself out generally to the public as
an Investment adviser

APPLICATIONS
One of the Commission's
pnncipal activities In the regulation of Investment comparues and Investment advisers IS the consideration of applications for exemptions from varIOUS provrsrons of the Investment Company
and Investment Advisers Acts or for certain
other relief under these Acts, Applicants may
'also seek determinations
of the status of
persons or comparues. DUring the fiscal year,
224 applications were filed under the Investment Company Act, and final action was
taken on 265 applications
There were no
applications filed under the Advisers Act, and
final action was taken on two As of the end
of the year, 115 applications were pending
under both Acts
Under Section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act, the Commission,
by order upon
application, may exempt any person, secunty
or transaction from any provisron of the Act, If
and to the extent such exemption IS necessary or appropriate In the pubhc Interest and
consistent With the protection of Investors and
the purposes fairly Intended by the policy and
provisrons of the Act Under Section 206A of
the Advisers Act, the Commission has Identical authority With regard to provrsions of that
Act Under Section 17 of the Investment
Company Act, affiliates of a registered investment company cannot participate In a JOint
arrangement
With the registered company
and cannot sell to or purchase from the
registered company unless they first obtain
an order from the Commission
Many of the
applications filed With the Commission relate
to these actions
Among the applications disposed of dunnq
the fiscal year, the follOWing were of particular
Interest
The Commission
Issued an oprruon and
order under the Investment Company Act

denying the application of International Funeral Services of Califorma, Inc ("Internanonat") for exemption from all provrsrons of
the Act 16 International's application sought
exemplion from the Act to permit It to finance
ItS funeral service operations by selling ItS
4 '/2 percent 20-year debentures on the installment basis to the purchasers of International's pre-need funeral service contracts
Internalional anticipated that the debentures
would be used to pay for funeral services
supplied by International to the pre-need purchaser at death By usrnq the debentures,
lnternatronal
would be able to obtain the
Immediate use of the cash proceeds from the
sale of the debentures and avoid a Califorma
law which requires that the cash proceeds
from the sale of pre-need funeral service
contracts be placed In trust until the funeral
services are performed
The Commission's
decisron was based
upon a deterrrunatron
that, If International
Issued and sold ItS debentures on the Installment basis, It would be a face-amount certificate company and thus an Investment company Within the denrunon of Section 3(a)(2) of
the Act and that International did not propose
to meet the statutory requirements of the Act
for face-amount
certificate cornparues With
respect to cash surrender nghts and values
and the maintenance
of reserves to meet
surrender values and matunty amounts The
Commission's opiruon noted that "purchasers
of applicant's debentures would thus assume
all of the nsks Inherent In the traditional faceamount certificate But they would have none
of the protections envisaged by Congress"
The fact that the debentures would be tied to
the performance of funeral services by International was not Viewed as a basis for distmction International has filed an appeal of
the Commission decrsion wrucn, as of the
end of the fiscal year, IS pending before the
Umted States Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circurt 17
Dunng the fiscal year, the Continental Illinos National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago
requested assurance that the Divrsron would
not recommend that the Commission take
action to require It to register under the
Investment Company Act a collective trust
fund (CIRT) used as an Investment medium
for trusts which meet the requirements
of
Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code
137

(the "Code") and trusts which meet the requirernents of Section 408(e) of the Code
(individual retirement accounts)
The Division denied Continental s request
on the basis that the proposed collective fund
would not be a "collective trust fund maintained by a bank consisting solely of assets
of such [Code Section 401] trusts" (ernphasis
added) wittun the meaning of Section 3(c)(11)
of the Act
Contmental thereafter sought reconsideration of the DIVISion'spositron. and asked that
the matter be submitted to the Commission
The Commission agreed with the decisron to
deny the request for a "no action" position,
and further asked that the DIVISion mform
Contmental that the Commission had taken
no position on the legal conclusions set forth
In the DIVIsion's earlier no-action response,
but had based ItS determination on ItS view
that the proposal raised Significant legal and
policy Issues which could not properly be
considered In the context of a no-action letter.
At the end of the fiscal year, the staff was
engaged in considennq an application for
exemption filed by Continental pursuant to
Section 5(c) of the Act
Dunng the fiscal year, several mutual funds
organized as limited partnerships applied for
exemptive orders under vanous provrsrons of
the Investment Company Act Until recently, It
had not been teasrble for a mutual fund
registered under the Act to operate In limited
partnership form because State partnership
laws did not authonze voting powers for holders of limited partnership shares As a result,
such a fund could not satisfy the requirements of the Act which mandate shareholder
voting on specmed matters. Ho. sver, recent
amendments of the laws of so.ve States
permit limited partners to be grantee' certain
voting powers without the exercise of such
powers being deemed to be "control" 01 the
business Previously, such control would
have SUbjectedlimited partners to unlimited
habiltty as general partners
The Commission has granted exemptions
to several limited partnerships dunng the fiscal year 18 These exemptions have been
sought by rnurncipal bond funds and "exchange" funds, both of which depend upon
their limited partnership form for the tax treatment they seek to achieve. For example, the
tax exempt character of Income from muruci-

138

pal secunnes IS "passed through" to holders
of limited partnership Interests, but such income would lose Its tax exempt character If It
were dlstnbuted as diVidends to shareholders
of a mutual fund organized as a corporation
In addition, the limited partnership device.
unlike the corporation, presently permits
mvestors to exchange appreciated secuntres
for mterests 10 limited partnerships without
the recognition of capital gains at that time
However, legislation currently pendmg 10
Congress might elimmate trus "tax-free" exchange priVilege for limited partnerships, and
such funds are awaltmg a resolution of the
tax status of exchanges before comrnencmq
operation

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS
"Money Market" Funds
Throughout the fiscal year, "money market" funds continued to be a dynamic segment of the mutual fund Industry Generally,
these are funds which Invest In short-term
debt seeunnes such as treasury bills, commercial paper and certificates of deposrt.
Money market funds raise unique regulatory
questions because of their short-term nature
and the characteristics of the secunnes 10
which they Invest.
The Initial two questions addressed by the
DIVISionwere the methods by which money
market funds value portfolio securities and
calculate rates of return or "Yield" With respect to these matters, the Commission published for comment proposed gUidelines 19
deSigned to standardize valuation of shortterm debt securities by these funds and to
establish Uniform calculanons to be used 10
reportmg money market fund yields and rates
of return.20 In addition to analyzinq the comments that were received on these proposals,
the DIVISiondeveloped computer Simulations
of money market fund portfolios and, In February 1976, held a public meeting to soncrt
adotnonat views from Interested persons. The
DIVISion expects to complete ItS study of trus
matter In the near future.

Registration of Foreign
Investment Companies
Foreign mvestment companies, which generally are prohibited by Section 7(d) of the

Investment Company Act from selling their
secunnes In this country, offer an opporturnty
for Investing In diversified pools of secunnes
ISSUed by companies In foreign countnes On
December 2, 1974, the Commission Issued a
release " requesting
public comments
on
whether
foreign
Investment
companies
should be permitted to register under the
Investment Company Act and allowed to sell
their shares In this country and, If so, under
what conditions
The Issues raised In thrs
release were consistent With a recommendation of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development
that member
countries review their regulation of investment comparues, and when deciding whether
to permit a foreign Investment company to
operate In their country, give substantial
weight to whether such company IS domiciled
In a country which compiles with the DECO's
rules on operation of Investment companies
The Commission also sought comments on
related Issues, Including whether such companies could be allowed to register and sell
shares In thrs country Without sacnncrnq the
high level of Investor protection embodied In
the Act.
In response to the release, the DIVISion of
Investment Management
received approxrmately fifty comments, including comments
from domestic and foreign Investment comparues, representatives of the Uruted States
and of foreign government
agencies and
Umted States Investors After consideratron
of these comments,
the DIVIsion recommended to the Commission that certain factual and legal questions which are crucial to
the determinations which must be made pursuant to the Act can best be resolved on a
case-by-case
baSIS and In the context of
formal applications filed by mdivrdual comparues for exemptions from specrnc provisions
of the Act and for orders permitting such
companies to register under the Act and to
sell their shares In the Umted States The
DIVIsion also recommended that rule-making
would be premature at thiS time
The Cornrrussron adopted thrs recommendation and published a statement of policy
and gUidelines for the filing of applications for
The release
orders permitting reglstratlon.22
stated that the Commission would entertain
applications filed by foreign Investment comparues pursuant to Section 7(d) of the Act

which may Incorporate requests for exemplion from other sections of the Act With which
a foreign applicant IS unable to comply The
release also set forth certain mrmrnurn prerequisites to filing, such as a rrururnum Size,
and descnbed information which should be
Included In any such application No foreign
Investment company has yet sought to avarl
Itself of this procedure, although overtures
have been made by several

Securities Depository System
Dunng the past fiscal year, the DIVISion
continued to study the problems that may be
presented
when an Investment
company
uses a secunnes depository either directly or
through a custodianship of ItS assets
Section 17(f) of the Investment Company
Act provides that subject to Commission regulation, a registered management Investment
company, or any permitted custodian for such
company, With the consent of the company,
may deposit all or any part of the secunnes
owned by the company In a system for the
central handling of secunnes established by a
national secunties exchange or national secunnes assocratron registered With the Comrrussron, or such other person as may be
permitted by the Commission, pursuant to
which system all secunnes of any particular
class or senes of any Issues deposited Within
the system are treated as fungible and may
be transferred or pledged by bookkeeping
entry Without physical delivery of such secunties
A letter Issued by the DIVISion Indicated
that no action would be recommended to the
Commission against a fund which authonzes
ItS bank custodian to use the Federal Book
Entry Deposit System In connection
With
treasury secunnes owned by the fund If the
fund's Board of Directors approve the arrangement, at least once a year, after making
certain determinations In good faith
The DIVISion IS continuing to consider what
rules, If any, are necessary or appropriate for
the protection of Investors In connection With
the participanon In a depository by an Investment company.

"Index" Funds
A recent Innovation In the Investment company Industry IS the so-called "Index fund,"

139

II

"

I'

an Investment company whose principal investment objective IS to seek to match the
performance of an established common stock
Index Shortly following the end of the past
fiscal year, the first registration statement for
a fund seeking to match the performance of
Standard and Poor's Corporation Composite
Stock Price Index was filed The development
of the Index fund concept was accelerated
with the recent enactment of federal pension
reform legislation which Imposes certain obligations on persons acting In a fiduciary capacity with respect to retirement fund Investments Index funds are seen by some as a
means by which fiduciaries may discharge
these obligations In a prudent manner while
achieving the Investment performance of a
diversified pool of common stocks

Reallocation of Management
Compensation
Mutual liquid Assets (the "Fund") wants to
start a no-load mutual fund which Will Invest
In money market securities The Fund's manager and distributor
of ItS shares Will be
Athena Management
Incorporated
("Athena")
Instead of providing for the payment of
sales and distnbunon expenses either out of
a sales load charged the Investor or as an
out-of-pocket
expense of the manager-adviser/distributor, as other Investment companies do, Athena Intends to reallocate one-half
of the management compensation to be paid
under the management agreement with the
Fund to the secuntres dealers who have sold
the Fund's shares It IS contemplated
that
under the agreement the manager will receive monthly compensation
at the annual
rate of 112 of 1 percent of the average net
asset value of the Fund
The Fund requested assurance that the
Drvrsion would not recommend that the Comrrussion take any action concerning these
arrangements
The Drvrsion granted the
Fund's request. But It advised the Fund that
the staff IS presently analyzing a number of
Issues related to tne distribution of investment company shares, Including the question
of whether any portion of the assets of an
open-end fund may be properly used, directly
or indirectly, to pay distribution expenses In
addition, It stated that, If It SUbsequently were
to decide that the procedure descnbed above

140

does not comply with the Act, steps must be
taken Immediately to modify the procedure
accordingly
The Divisron further stated that
ItS position assumed that the Fund's directors
would be fUlly Informed of the uncertain legal
status of the proposed
arrangement
and
would consrder the appropriateness
of the
Fund's entering the arrangement In light of
such information

Public Utility
Holding Companies

Under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, the Commission regulated interstate public utility holding company systems
engaged In the electric utility business and/or
retail distribution of gas The Commission's
JUrisdiction also covers natural gas pipeline
companies and other non utility companies
which are subsrdrary companies of registered
holding companies. There are three principal
areas of regulation under the Act (1) the
physrcal Integration of public utility companies
and functionally related properties of holding
company systems, and the Simplification of
Intercorporate
relationships
and financial
structures of such systems; (2) the nnancmq
operations of registered holding companies
and their subsidiary companies, the acquisrnon and drsposmon of secunnes and properties and certain accounling practices, servicIng arrangements, and Intercompany transactions, (3) exemptive provisrons relating to the
status under the Act of persons and companies, and provisions regulating the right of
persons affiliated with a public-utility company to become affiliated WIth another such
company through acquisrnon of seeunnes

PROCEEDINGS
COMPOSITION
At the end of calendar 1975, there were 20
holding companres registered under the Act
There were 18 registered holding companres
WIthin the 15 "active" registered holding-company systems 1 The remairunq two registered
holding
companies,
which are relatively
small, are not Included among the "active"
systems.s In the 15 active systems, there
were 68 electnc and/or gas utility subsrdiaries, 63 nonumty subsrdianes, and 16 mac-

Amencan
Electnc Power CompanyAmerican Electnc Power Company (AEP), a
registered holding company, has filed an application to acquire the common stock of
Columbus and Southern Oruo ElectriC Company, a nonassociate electnc utility company.
The DIVISion of Corporate RegUlation and the
Department of Justice oppose the acqutsmon,
arguing that AEP had not sustained ItS burden of showmq substantial economies which
would result from the acquisrtron and that the

145

acquismon would have anti competitive effects
warranting disapproval
under the Act. The
Administrative Law Judge denied the application. ADP appealed to the full Commission.
The Commission
heard oral argument on
October 8, 1974. Dissatisfied WIth the state of
the record, the Comrnrssron subsequently ordered AEP and certain other parties to answer In supplemental bnefs certain questions
presented by the Commission relannq to the
alleged econorrues. After subrrussron of bnefs
by AEP and others, the matter IS now before
the Commission for decisron.
Central and South West Corporation
("CSW')-Several
Oklahoma rnurucipaunes
have complained
to the commrssion
that
CSW's electnc utility subsrdianes are not operated as an Integrated electnc system as
required by Section 11(b)(l), and have requested a heanng on that Issue. CSW has
one Oklahoma and two Texas SubSidiaries. It
also has a fourth subsidiary serving portions
of LOUISiana, Arkansas and Texas. CSW's
Texas companies have been Interconnected
with several other large Texas utilities In a
completely Intrastate system
Exchange of
power within the CSW system across the
Oklahoma- Texas border IS not permitted under an agreement between CSW and the
other companies.
The matter was set down shortly after the
close of the fiscal year for heanng before an
administrative law JUdge
Delmarva Power and Light Company-on
Apnl 5, 1972, the Commission Instituted proceedings under Section 11(b)(1) to determine
whether Delmarva should be required to divest Itself of ItS gas ulihty operations
Delmarva and its Maryland and Virginia subsunaries constitute a large Integrated elsctnc
system. Delmarva then filed an application for
exemption under Section 3(a)(2), which exempts from the Act a holding company which
IS predominantly an operating company. The
two proceedings were consolidated for hearIng and the DIVISion of Corporate Regulation
opposed Delmarva's application for exemption.
In tus Initial decision, to which the Divrsron
has taken exception, the administrative law
judge held that Delmarva's gas business was
not retamsble under the Act, but that, In light
of the Commission's recent decisron In Union
Electrtc, 3 which highlighted the problem" ere-

146

ated by the energy cnSIS, Delmarva would not
be required to divest Its gas business. The
law fUdge further held that Delmarva was
entitled
to an exemption
under Sectron
3(a)(2) of the Act and that compliance WIth
the Section 11 Integration standards IS not
necessary as a preeonoltron to granting such
an exemption.
Empire State Power Resources, IncConsolidated Edison Company of New York,
Inc, Long Island lighting
Company, New
York State ElectriC and Gas Corporation,
Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation
and
Rochester Gas and Electnc Corporation, five
of the seven sponsors of Empire State Power
Resources, Inc. ("ESPRI") have JOintly applied to the Oornrmssron under Section 3(a)
of the Act for an order exempting them as
holding companies With respect to ESPRI,
and, In the case of Niagara and Rochester,
for aumonzanon under Section 10 to acquire
ESPRl's stock
ESPRI Will be jOintly owned by Its sponsors. It Will construct and own generating
faCIlities throughout New York State to supply
electnclty to its sponsors. ESPRI IS expected
to construct 13 nuclear and 3 coal-fired base• load units With a rated capacity of 18,600
MW. The sponsors estimate that the construcnon costs dunng the penod 1980-1991
Will exceed $20 billion.
ESPRI represents the most Significant effort on the part of utility companies In any
State or region of the country to coordinate
construction and operation of JOintly owned
faCtlitles.
No hearing has yet been scheduled on the
application, although a consumer group has
requested one. The New York Public Service
Cornrrussron, however, has held extensive
heanngs on the matters relating to the project Within that Cornrmssron's junsdlctlon.
Otuo Power Company-OhIo
Power, an
electnc utility subsrdiary of Amencan Electnc
Power Company, filed an application for authonty to Issue short-term notes In an aggregate amount of up to $270 million through
June 30, 1976. Ormet Corporation,
OhiO
Power's largest Single customer, opposed the
application and requested a hearing. A hearIng was held on the proposal December 3-5,
1975. After the heanng, the Division of Corporate RegUlation and Ormet argued to the
Oornrrussron that Oruo Power had not demon-

strated any need for the full amount of the
borroWingauthority requested. The Commission agreed. In Its Opinion of Apnl 27, 1976,
the Commission authonzed Ohio Power to
Issue only $190 million In short-term debt
through June 30, 1976.4
North Penn Gas Company-The Commission approved a negotiated plan filed pursuant to Section 11(e) of the Act under which
Penn Fuel System, Inc. ("System") proposed
to acquire 100 percent of the common stock
of North Penn Gas Company ("North Penn")
and up to 93 percent of the outstanding
common stock of Penn Fuel Gas, Inc ("Penn
Fuel"). System was also granted an exemption under Section 3(a)(1) of the Act. 5 On
February 2, 1976, the Federal Dismct Court
In Philadelphia ordered that the plan be enforced.
Under the plan, System will acquire about
243,000 shares of North Penn common stock
at $18.50 per share, payable $3.10 In cash
and the balance In 10 percent senal installment notes on which the final payment will be
due on December 31, 1979. System will also
Issue Its common stock to the Ware family In
exchange for the remaining shares of North
Penn common stock and up to 93 percent of
the outstanding common stock of Penn Fuel.

HOLDING COMPANY DEBT
Section 7(c)(1) of the Act Identifies COrTh
mon stock and first mortgage bonds as the
pnmary source of long-term utility system
financing. Congress, however, has authorized the Commission to approve alternate
methods of nnancmq In exceptional circumstances.
In 1969 and 1970, the Commission excepted the sale by General Public Utilities
Company (GPU) of $100 million of holding
company unsecured debentures from Section
7(c)(1) (ReI. 35-16540, November 28, 1969
and ReI. 35-16892, November 4, 1970).
There was little choice MaSSive Investment
In plant under construction had outrun the
bonding power of the operating companies
and the short-term borrOWinglimits of the Act.
Practical limits on common stock sales left
the debentures the only feasible source of
finanCing.
Dunng the difficult financial times of the
recent fiscal year, the Oornrnlssron again exercised Its exemptive authonty to allow The

Southern Company to sell $125 million of SIXyear notes" and Northeast Utilities to sell $50
million of ten-year notes. 7

FINANCING OF FUEL AND GAS
SUPPLIES
Fuel curtailments have made It increasingly
necessary for electric and gas utilities, mcludIng those registered under the Act, to Invest
in their own sources of supply and their own
delivery facilities.8 During fiscal 1976, the
Commission allowed 8 registered systems to
Invest over $100 million In these activities. 9

AMENDMENT OF FORM U5S AND
RULE 48(b) UNDER THE ACT
The Oomrrussron amended Form U5S, the
Annual Report lor registered holding companies under the Act, In two ways. First, the
Form was changed to require that a registered company report total annual compensation of employees, other than officers, paid
more than $40,000 by system companies.
The Form previously required a report of total
compensation In excess of $15,000 The
amendment was made to conlorm to the
requirements of Form lQ-K.
The Form has also been amended to allow
reporting companies to substitute a statement
of the total loans to and guarantees for employees for the Itemized list previously required.

The Commission also amended Rule 48(b)
which formerly exempted, automatically, all
loans to or guaranties by system companies
for the account of employees that otherwise
would require Commission authonzanon. As
amended, Rule 48(b) limits the automatic
exemption to a maximum of $10,000 for any
one employee. That limit however Will not
apply to the financing of an employee's residence.lo

PROPOSED BANKRUPTCY
LEGISLATION
DUring the ftscal year, the Commission
submitted an extensive report to Congress'
on two pending bills which are Intended to
replace the present Bankruptcy Act. The bills
were prepared by the Cornrrussion on the
Bankruptcy Laws of the United States (S 236
and H 31) and the National Conference of
Bankruptcy JUdges (S 235 and H 32). Commissioner Philip A t.oorrus, Jr , testified with
respect to thrs report before a Senate sub-

151

committee on November 5, 1975, and before
a House subcommittee on Apnl 5, 1976.
The proposed legislation for the most part
deals With consumer
bankruptcy
matters
Thus, the Commission's report was limited to
the small portion of the legislatIOn dealing
With rehabilitation of corporations
The Comrmssron expressed particular concern In the
report that certain Important Investor safeguards now In Chapter X, Including Cornrmssion partrcpauon as advisor to the courts and
parties and parties to the reorganization,
would be eliminated under the proposed legislanon

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES
In fiscal year 1976, the Commission entered 4 new Chapter X proceedings Involving
companies with aggregate stated assets of
approximately
$765 million and aggregate
Indebtedness of approximately $684 million
Including the new proceedings, the Commission was a party In a total of 124 reorqaruzalion proceedings dunng the fiscal year. 2 The
stated assets of the companies Involved In
these proceedings totaled approximately $4 5
billion and their Indebtedness about $4.0 billion
Dunng the fiscal year, 9 proceedings were
closed, leaVing 115 In which the Commission
was a party at year end

ADMINISTRATIVE

MATTERS

In Chapter X proceedings, the Commission
seeks to protect the procedural and substantive safeguards afforded parties In such proceedings. The Commission also attempts to
secure judicial Uniformity In the construction
of Chapter X and the procedures thereunder.

On appeal by the New York Stock Exchange
("Exchange")
, the distnct court vacated an
order of the bankruptcy Judge enjoIning the
Exchange from applying to the Commission
to de list the debtor's secuntres. The court, as
urged by the Commission In an amicus curIae brief, held that the bankruptcy
JUdge
lacked the power to Issue the injunction because the Commission has statutory authonty
over the listing and deli sting of securmes on
nanonal excnanqes.s The drstnct court also

Interstate Stores, Inc 5_ The trustees contracted
to sell certain
real estate
for
$650,000. At the heanng on the apphcation to
approve the sale, a second party offered to
pay $675,000, the onglnal offeror agreed to
pay this amount. The second party then increased rus offer to $685,000. The onglnal
party claiming surpnse at trus competitive
bidding, stated he was unprepared at that
time to pay more. The bankruptcy
fudge
concluded the heanng and directed the trustees to submit an order authonzinq the sale
for $685,000 FollOWing the heanng, the first
party offered to pay $725,000, but the bankruptcy judge confirmed the sale to the other
party for $685,000.
The onqrnal party asked the bankruptcy
judge to vacate hrs order and to reopen
bidding The Commission supported tus POSItion The bankruptcy jUdge denied hrs request. He appealed to the distnct court, which
vacated the order confirming the sale and
remanded the matter to the bankruptcy judge.
SUbsequently, at a heanng before the bankruptcy judge, the trustees sold the real estate,
after spirited bidding, to the original offeror for
$1,210,000.
In another aspect of thrs proceeding, the
trustees sought expungement of a $38 million
proof of claim. The claimant sought to modify
an order of the bankruptcy court staying SUitS
against the bankrupt so as to permit the
prosecution of Its $38 million claim In a cantorrua state court. The Commission supported
the trustees In their efforts to have this claim
tried In the Chapter X court. The Oommisaron
contended that In light of the size of the claim
and the central Importance of its resolution to
the tormulanon of a plan of reorganization,
the Chapter X court must hear and summarily
determine the trustees' application
to expunge under Section 196 of the Bankruptcy
Act. The Commission further argued that If
the claim were determined by a California
state court, public Investors would be depnved of the Oomrmssron's assistance In the
resolution of that claim.
The bankruptcy jUdge In effect determined
that the clarm could proceed to tnal In California. The trustees appealed to the dlstnct
court The distnct court directed the Chapter

x court

to retain jursrdrctron to determine the
claim
The claimant appealed to the Second CirCUlI. At the close of the fiscal year, this
appeal was pending.

8_ The Commission
supported the trustee In urging the Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Crrcurt In Cincinnati to
affirm the district court's ruling which permitted the sale of certain real estate free and
clear of certain liens with the proceeds to be
placed In escrow subject to further order of
the court
The Commission argued In ItS brief that the
questions of when and under what circumstances property may be sold free of liens In
a reorganization case IS "In the sound discretion of the District Judge
"7 Here, the court
did not abuse ItS discretion since the lien of
the appellant would attach to the proceeds,
which exceeded the value of the claim
The Commission also urged that other ISsues raised by appellant concerning the validity, enforceability and priority of ItS mortgages were clearly not ripe for appeal since
the district court had not ruled on these
matters because of the need for further eVIdentiary hearings
Kmg Resources Company 8_ The Court of
Appeals for the Tenth Crrcuit, as urged by the
Commission, affirmed the district court's holdIng that senior debt IS not entitled to postpennon Interest at the expense of subordinate
debentures, where the subordination agreement was to pnnopal and Interest to the date
of payment, but did not specifically provide
for subordmanon to post-petition Interest 9
The district court's order disallowed the
claims of senior creditor banks for post-petition Interest from the funds otherwise distributable to publicly-held debentures which were
subordinated to the senior debt by the terms
of the Indenture pursuant to which those
debentures were Issued Since the district
court had determined that the debtor was

claims for Indemnity and contribution were
not allowable since such claims are limited

TRUSTEE'S INVESTIGATION AND
STATEMENTS
A complete accounting for the stewardship
of corporate affairs by the prior management
IS a requisrte under Chapter X One of the
primary duties of the trustee IS to make a
thorough study of the debtor to assure the
discovery and collection of all assets of the
estate, including claims against officers, directors, or controlling persons who may have
mismanaged the debtor's affairs The staff of
the Commission often aids the trustee In hrs
mvesnqatron
EqUity Fundmg Corp of Amenca 13_ The
trustee had filed SUit against the Independent
accountants who reviewed the fraudulent financial statements and rendered their opmIon that the statements fairly represented the
financral condmon of the cornpanres.rThe
accountants are also defendants In litigation
brought by Equity Funding Corp of America's
("EFCA")
security holders to recover the
losses allegedly suffered from the purchase
of EFCA's securities
The trustee seeks recovery for the estate
under two general categories of damages
The first Involves $3,750,000 for recovery of
the fees paid to the accountants for work
Incompetently performed and for the fees and

153

costs Incurred by the estate In ascertaining
EFCA's true financial condition The -second
part of the trustee's SUit claims recovery for
all of the liabilities Incurred by EFCA and ItS
subsrdianes from the publication of false financial statements. This part of the action
involving hundreds of millions of dollars essentially duplicates the claim by EFCA's secunty holders.
Since It was clear that the defendant's
ability to pay for any jUdgment on any of
these causes of action would be limited, the
trustee and representatives of the security
holders agreed to a drvtsron of a partial
recovery. The agreement. which was Incorporated Into the plan of reorganization, provided
for a maximum recovery for the estate of $2.4
million plus certain costs If the recovery
exceeded about $4 9 million, the estate
would receive about .$2.45 million and the
other plaintiffs the same amount plus all of
the balance.
Beverly Hills Bancorp 15_ The trustee of
this holding company has had no business to

effort to hold down the mounllng administrative costs, the Commission applied for an
order directing the trustee to complete rus
mvestrqanon,prepare and file hrs Section 167
report, and prepare and file a plan of reorganuauon by a specified time.
The Commission, to assist the trustee in
hrs mvesnqanon, had made the comrmssion's enforcement investigative transcripts
available In a pending CIVil SUIt under the
Secunnes Act. 16 The trustee had appointed a
special counsel to conduct the lnvesngauon,
but it appeared that his activmss were limited
to reading the Commission's rnvestrqatlve
transcripts
The Commission contended In Its application that the thorough investigation contemplated by Congress to be made by the dismterested trustee was the cornerstone of
Chapter X, upon which a plan or report would
be based. 17 The Commission urged that the
trustee's investigatory function required affirmative discovery as opposed to relying on
available work done by others for more speCifIC purposes.t- The court continued the
heanng on the Commission's application
pending resolution of certain collateral matters.

PLANS OF REORGANIZATION
Generally, the Commission flies a formal
advrsoty report only In a case which Involves
substantial pubhc Investor interest and presents SignifIcant problems. When no such
formal report IS filed, the Commission may
state ItSviews briefly by letter, or authonze its
counsel to make an oral or written presentation Dunng the fiscal year the Commission
published four advisory reports, two of which
supplemented a prior advisory report, dealing
With four plans of reorganizallon 19 Its views
on five other plans of reorqaruzanon were
presented to the courts either orally or by
written memoranda 20
EqUity Funding Corp. of America 21_ The
trustee proposed a plan of reorqaruzanon for
mrs holding company premised upon a series
of cornprormses Interrelated Since the claims
of each class of creditors affected those of
every other class. EqUity's prinopal assets
are two substantial operallng Insurance comparues valued at about $100 million. Consolidated assets of the new enterpnse WIll be
about $400 million With the pnnopa! consolidated liabilities being $235 million of reserves
for policy IIabtlltles.
The plan would create a new holding company which would Issue about $27 million of
Income notes to secured bank creditors and
7,900,000 shares of Its stock, valued at $87
million, to be diVided among other creditors
Certain other secured creditors whose clarms
aggregated about $50 million were paid In
cash from the proceeds of hquidanon of their
collateral.
Even though EqUity was found to be insolvent so that ItS common stock did not parncrpate as such,' about $21 million In new common stock (20 percent of the estate) was
allocated to settle the class action SUits asserted principally by stockholders. Their net
losses estimated at about $170 million. About
$20 million of common stock was allocated In
settlement of claims of $64 million to pubhclyheld subordinated debenture holders. In addition, the subordinated debentures Issued by
EFCA's Euro-dollar subsidiary shares $1.5
million in cash from the subsidiary estate In
addition to their stock drstnbuuon as subordinated guaranteed debt of EFCA. The claims
of the original shareholders in one of the
Insurance comaprues who sought to reclaim

In kind the Insurance shares of which they
were defrauded In a 1971 merger were also
settled under the plan by an aliocaton of $12
million of common stock of the reorganized
company. The remaining $34 million of common stock was distnbuted pnrnanly to bank
creditors With claims of $40 4 million and
miscellaneous claims of about $4.3 million.
The Commission filed an advisory report
concluding that the plan was fair and equitable and feasible. 22 The plan was overwhelmIngly accepted by all classes of creditors and
was consummated on March 21, 1976.
KIng Resources Company. 23-At the conelusion of plan heanngs, the court referred
the trustee's internal plan of reorganization to
the Commission for report. The plan provided
for full payment In cash of administrative
costs, pnonty claims and secured claims
Unsecured creditors, including owners of the
publicly held subordinated debentures, face
value $41 million, will receive 25 Class A and
25 Class B shares for each $1,000 of claims.
The two classes have Identical nghts except that the Class A shares have a $20
liqUidation preference If the reorganized company IS hqurdated, To give recognition to the
contractual subordination, the plan provided
that the senior creditors would receive In the
actual drstnbutron only Class A shares, while
the subordinated debentures would receive
after exchanging their Class A shares for
senior creditors Class B shares about 10
Class A shares and 40 Class B shares for
each $1,000 claim.
The public shareholders of the debtor WIll
not participate
as shareholders
since the
debtor estate was found to be Insolvent
However, the plan proposes to compromise
the class action claims on behalf of the
shareholders and public debenture holders,
which are based on, among other things,
Violation of Federal and State secunnes laws,
by Issuing to thrs class about 15 percent of
the common stock of the new company.
The Oomrrusston's
advisory report concluded that the plan could be found to be fair
and equitable and feasible, If amended In
certain respects.24 The Commission
concluded that, since hqurdanon of the new company was remote, the liqUidation preference
did not give sutnerent recognition to the subordination
provision of the Indentures. To
afford senior creditors their contractual nghts,

the Commission recommended that the Class
A shares be convertible Into one and one-half
shares of Class B shares at the holder's
option dunng the first five years after reorgan-

izanon
The Commission also recommended that
additional evidence be taken WIth respect to
the value of the assets of International Resources Irrruted, a wholly owned subsrdrary
of the debtor. The foreign debentures had an
Independent claim to these assets as well as
equal rank With the domestic debentures on a
guarantee by the debtor The trustee allowed
a $1 million nonsubordmated claim In recognition of this nght, but the record was inadequate to evaluate the fairness of thrs proposal
The trustee amended trus plan to provide
for the conversion feature, as urged by the
Commrssron, but limited thrs pnvileqe to two
years. The first year the conversion rate IS
one and one-half shares of Class B for each
Class A share and the second year the rate IS
one and one-quarter shares of Class B stock
for each Share of Class A.
The senior creditor banks appealed the
drstnct court's order approving the plan of
reorganization, arguing that the court erred
by (I) not consrdennq a plan of uqurdanon for
the debtor, (II) valumq the debtor's nonproducmq Arne properties on a discounted cash
flow method; (III) including all unsecured
creditors In a Single class, and (IV) not providIng adequate compensation under the plan to
senior creditors In recognition of their senior
nghts
The Commission argued, as It concluded In
Its advisory report, that the trustee properly
valued the Arne Interests and that the plan
correctly Included senior creditors In the one
class of unsecured creditors. With regard to a
plan of hqurdannn, the Commission noted that
while Section 216(10) of Chapter X permits
such a plan, nevertheless, "the court should
be 'reorganization minded' and not 'hquidanon minded.' "25 The general pohcy of Chapter X to preserve values, keep businesses
operating and maintain employment far outweighs the banks' desrre for hquidanon.
To afford senior creditors their contractual
nghts under the subordination provrsron, the
Commission urged that the plan be amended
to provide for a longer conversion penod as
orgmally suggested In the advisory report.

155

Since. however, almost a year had elapsed
from the date of approval of the plan, the time
to begm the conversion penod should commence from confirmation of the plan rather
than from Its consummation

filed a third supplemental advisory report statIng that the plan was not "fair and equitable,

It afforded preferred treatment to certain large
creditors by offenng them a senes of notes
which were senior to the notes offered small
creditors. Further, It was tnrs essentially unfair aspect of the plan upon which ItS feastbilIty was predicated.
In addition, the plan's
teasibihty was premised on the availability of
a tax loss carry-forward, an assumption that
was open to question The Commission suggested proposed amendments to make the
plan fair, equitable and teasrble
Thereafter, the plan was amended substantially In accordance
with the Commission's suggestions, Including the Issuance of
Identical notes to all general unsecured creditors The Commission filed a fourth supplemental advisory finding that the plan as
amended was fair, equitable and Ieasrble 28

IS the sale of the debtor's stock ownership In

which Okorute
created for the benefit of ItS employees. 31
The ESOT IS finanCing the purchase through

remaining funds being borrowed from banks
The sale agreement provroes for a procedure
for resolvmq a claim of $12.2 million under

The Comrrussion filed an advisory memo.

randum concluding that the plan was fair and
equitable and feasible The plan called for the
payment In full of costs of administration, tax
and governmental claims and claims of $850
or less. Also, secured bank claims of about
$15 million will be paid In full In cash. The
remaining cash Will be distributed to unsecured creditors, including public subordinated
debenture holders, with recoqiruuon of the
subordination
provisions of the Indentures.
Since the debtor was found to be Insolvent,
no participation was afforded to shareholders.
The plan was approved and confirmed by
the court whereupon the sale of Okorute to
the ESOT was consummated
Valtu, Inc., holder of about $7.6 million face
amount of the debtor's subordinated debentures as a result of a tender offer conducted
during the proceeding at a price of $30 net
per $100 principal amount, has appealed to
the district court, the confirmation of the plan
contending that the bankruptcy judge erred
by not considerinq ItS alternative "Internal"
plan filed at the time of confirmation and by
permitting certain creditors to vote for the
trustee's plan. At the close of the fiscal year,
the matter was stili pending before the district
court.
Maryvale Commumty Hosptte', Inc. 32-.At
the close of the fiscal year, the district Judge
ordered the trustee to make the final distribution to public bondholders pursuant to a confirmed plan of orderly hqurdanon which terminated a long, but very successful, Chapter X
proceeding In which the Commission played
an active role throughout.
The case grew out of the public Issuance of
high-interest first mortgage bonds by charitable nonprofit corporations In the southwest In
the early 1960's. In 1963, Maryvale bondholders filed a fraud SUit under the Federal
secuntrss laws and a creditors' petition for
reorganization under Chapter X. The petition
was approved but was vigorously contested,
and the Commission Intervened In the public
Interest and supported the petitioning creditors, who were faced at the outset with a
basic junsdiononal Issue.33
The court-appointed trustee managed the
debtor's business operations and eventually
sold the hospital for a sum sutncrent to repay
bondholder pnnopat, Simple Interest, and interest on defaulted Interest at eight percent
according to the terms of the Indenture. While

the trustee's plan to pay the proceeds to the
bondholders was upheld on appeal,34 drstnbunon of a substantial portion was delayed by
extensive litigation over a claim asserted by
the former pathologist for the hospital Ultimately, the trustee prevailed, 35and the bondholders received the final payment amounting
to approxrrnately
158 percent of the face
value of the bonds Pursuant to the plan, the
court fixed a bar date to expire not less than
five years on or before which bondholders
may claim their drvrdends, at the end of
whrch, since the debtor IS a charitable corporation, any unclaimed funds Will be distributed
to designated Arizona nonprofit organizations
Lyntex Corpotetion, et al 36_ The plans of
reorganization contemplating orderly uquidanon of the debtor and ItS subsrdtarres " provided for the subordination of all costs and
expenses of administration of the superseded
Chapter XI proceedings to those Incurred In
the Chapter X proceeding. The court, In an
unreported memorandum decision, rejected
>the Commission's posinon that the applicable
"fair and equitable" standard requires equal
treatment for cost and expenses of adrrurustration In both proceedings, but agreed that
all administrative costs and expenses within
each proceeding be treated equally by the
terms of the plans. The plans of orderly
hqutdatron as amended were approved by the
court
Bubble Up Delaware, Inc, et al 38_ The
co-trustees developed a consolidated plan of
reorganization provrdmq for the distribution of
the proceeds from the previous sale of the
debtors' assets as gOing concerns 39 The
plan proposed a settlement of the pending
controversy between the public stockholders
of the Parent company who had claims based
upon the Federal secunties laws and the
general creditors of all three related debtor
estates. Essentially, the co-trustees' plan provided for substantively consolidating the three
debtor estates and allocating by way of compromise the combined assets to the various
creditor groups on a percentage baSIS
In ItS memorandum on the plan filed WIth
the court, the Commission pointed out that
the "formula for distribution
. IS the result of
negotiation and compromise among the Interested parties" and that while compromises
form a normal part of corporate reorqaruza-

157

lions, they must be fair and equrtable WIthan
adequate record to support that conclusion.40
It also noted that the plan provisions applied
the leading cases on the Issue of consohdatlon41 and that the provision for recognition of
resossron claimants based on Federal secuntres fraud claims was proper 42

ACTIVITIES WITH REGARD TO
ALLOWANCES
Every reorganization case ultimately presents the difficult problem of determining the
compensation to be paid to the vanous parties for services rendered and for expenses
Incurred In the proceeding The Commission,
which under Section 242 of the Bankruptcy
Act may not receive any allowance for the
service It renders, has sought to assist the
courts In assuring economy of adrnmrstratron
and In allocating compensation equitably on
the basts of the claimants' contributions to the
adrnrrnstrahcnof estates and the formulation
of plans. DUring the fiscal year 525 apphcanons for compensallon totaling about $23.5

urged by the Commission, the court of appeals remanded In order that the notice requrred by Chapter X be given to creditors.
The Fourth Ctrcurt noted In accordance
with the position of the Commission that

The court, agreeing WIth the Cornrrussron,
also held that there was no jusnncanon for

the debenture holders) payable pursuant to
the trust Indenture, and that ItS services durIng the Chapter X proceeding which were
benencral to the estate should be paid as a
cost of administration, rather than from the
amount available for distribution to the debenture holders, as ordered by the district
court.
The court In commenting that the district
court "apparently disregarded
the SEC's
evaluation of counsel's services and recommendation of a proper allowance therefor"
stated that the Comrrussion's fee recommendations In reorganization cases are entitled to
great weight.46
Nettonet
Telephone Company, Inc, et
al 47-Shortly after a transfer of the proceed-

ings from Chapter XI to Chapter X upon the
motion of certain creditors, eight law firms
applied for fees totalling more than $300,000
for services rendered dunnq the Chapter XI
proceedings. The Oomrmssronurged that the
applications be denied WIthoutprejudice suggesting that they be resubmitted at the conclusion of the Chapter X proceedings Among
other things, the Comrrussron advised the
court that the misfiling under Chapter XI and
the prolonged eight-month proceeding under
a wrong chapter of the Bankruptcy Act raised
questions concerning the benefits conferred
on the estate, which questions could only be
answered at the conclusion of the Chapter X
proceeding upon an adequate record 48
At the close of the fiscal year, the court had
not rendered a decision With respect to the
applications.
U S tmencmt, Inc 49_ The trustee of trus
large pubuoly-owned real estate conglomerate sought "interim compensation based
upon an annual salary of $125,000, payable
monthly .. subject to pencdic review and
exarrnnanon by the court." After a hearing,
the bankruptcy judge allowed interim compensation of $10,000 per month until further
order of the court and directed the trustee to
file quarterly "report of services" which was

noticed for penodrc heanngs for "review" by
the court While he submits a report of servIces rendered, the trustee files no application
for allowance of compensation
The Commission objected to thrs procedure for compensating a Chapter X trustee,
asserting that It did not comply with the
established pen odic application, notice, and
heanng procedure onginally suggested by the
Commission and adopted by the courts In
compliance With Secbon 247 of the Bankruptcy Act so When the bankruptcy judge
entered a subsequent order approving the
trustee's report of services and pnor payment
of $30,000 for the first quarter, the Commission filed a notice of appeal to the district
court asserting that the procedure followed by
the bankruptcy judge did not comply With the
application, notice, and heanng provrsrons of
Section 247 of the Bankruptcy Act and Chapter X Rules 10-215 and 10-216 In ItS brief,
the Commission POinted out that Chapter X IS
a public Investor protection statute whrch,
mter alia, contains "detailed machinery govermng all claims for allowances
from the
estate,"S1 and that the procedure adopted by
the lower court does not permit the court or
parnes In Interest to evaluate the services
rendered before mtenm fees are paid and
undermines the Important statutory nght to be
heard on all allowances from the estate S2
Although bnefed, the appeal had not been
heard before the close of the fiscal year.
Interstate Stores, Inc S3_ The Independent
trustee applied for a second mtenrn allowance of $40,000 for services rendered over a
one-year penod
General counsel for the
trustee sought a first mtenrn allowance of
$575,000 for services rendered over a 17'/2
month penod. In addition, vanous special
counsel for the trustee retained for particular
tasks and who had expended insubstantial
amounts of time requested mtenrn fees
Approximately 22 percent of general counsel's reported total time expended on the
estate dunng the penod (9,670 hours) was
not supported by adequate time records A
portion of the Independent trustee's time was
not substantiated by time records. The Comrrussion recommended
to the bankruptcy
judge mtenrn allowances of $450,000 and
$25,000 to general counsel and the independent trustee, respectively. The Commission also recommended that approximately
one-half of general counsel's expenses, for

which reimbursement was sought, was not
properly chargeable to the estate and should
be disallowed. The Commission also recommended that the payment of mtenrn allowances to four special counsel be dented Without prejudice pending completion
of their
work
Apart from reducmq the request of the
Independent trustee by $5,000, the bankruptcy Judge granted all the applications In
full, Without setting forth any reasons In law or
fact why he declined to follow the Commission's recommendations
Subsequent to the
close of the fiscal year, the Commission
appealed the bankruptcy Judge's decrsron to
the orstnct court. S4

INTERVENTION IN CHAPTER XI
Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act provides
a procedure by which debtors can effect
arrangements With respect to their unsecured
debts under court supervision. Where a proceeding IS brought under that chapter but the
facts indicate
that It should have been
brought under Chapter X, Sectton 328 of
Chapter XI and Rule 11-15 of the Rules of
Bankruptcy Procedure authonze the Commission or any other party In Interest to make
application to the court to transfer the Chapter XI proceeding to Chapter X.
Under Rule 11-15, which became effecbve
as of July 1, 1974, the Commission as well as
other parties In Interest, except the debtor,
have 120 days from the first date set for the
first meebng of creditors to file a motion The
time may be extended for good cause. A
motion made by the debtor for transfer, however, may be made at any time. The rule
requires a shOWIng that a Chapter X reorqaruzanon IS feasible Thrs In effect means that a
motion can be granted only If the court finds
both that Chapter XI IS Inadequate and reorganization under Chapter X IS possible The
pnor procedure for filing a Chapter X pennon
after the granting of the motion and a separate hearing on the pennon has been abotished,
Attempts are sometimes made to misuse
Chapter XI so as to depnve Investors of the
protection which the secunnes Act of 1933
and the Seeunties Exchange Act of 1934 are
desiqned to provide In such cases the Comrmssion's staff normally attempts to resolve
the problem by Informal negotiations
If thrs

159

proves fnntless, the Commission Intervenes
In the Chapter XI proceeding to develop an
adequate record and to direct the court's
attention to the applicable provisrons of the
Federal securities
laws and their bearing
upon the particular case
W T Grant Company 55-Grant's filing of
a Chapter XI petition on October 2, 1975,
tnggered the single largest attempted business rehabilitation instituted under the Bankruptcy Act At that time, Grant operated about
1,070 retail stores throughout
the United
States and employed 62,000 persons. The
Chapter XI petition reflected assets and habrlrues of $1,016,776,242 and $1,030,556,198,
respectively, as of September 4, 1975 The
public Investor Interest In Grant consisted of I)
$117,336,000 In pnnopal amount of debentures (3 Issues) held by 3,600 persons; II)
75,000 shares of preferred stock held by 500
persons; and III) 14 million shares of common
stock held by 35,000 persons
Grant was
Indebted to a consortium of 27 banks in the
aggregate sum of $641 million The banks
asserted secunty Interests In customer receivables, merchandise inventones and certain
securities
of a large Canadian
rnajontyowned retail store chain Subsidiary
At the outset, there were Impediments to
the transfer of the case to Chapter X The
debtor-in-possession
order, entered on October 2, 1975, contained provisrons authonzinq
the banks to accelerate payment of $90 million they lent back to Grant, In the event of a
transfer monon Another ex parte order authorrzed the banks to terminate their credit
card agreements With Grant In the event of a
transfer monon Grant and others advised
that any motion to transfer would be vigorously contested and the banks made It clear
that they would litigate the usage of collateral
In Chapter X, At the same time, the Commission was assured by Grant and others that
the objective of the Chapter XI filing was
rehabilitation and reorganization
The business of Grant at the time of ItS
Chapter XI filing was In a state of turmoil
Trade credit was unavailable and the flow of
merchandise Into the stores was reduced to a
trickle. Difficulties were even Incurred In getting merchandise for the Christmas selling
season by paYing cash on delivery and cash
before delivery In short, the business posture
of Grant was so ehaonc and a transfer motion
would have Introduced such Inordinate com160

plexmes that the Cornmrssron was precluded
as a practical matter from making such a
motion until there was some stabilization In
the busmess.
Grant embarked on a SWift IiqUidallon program. Between November 1975 and January
1976, 67 percent of the Grant chain was
hqtndated (712 stores). As a result of the
hqurdations, there was a fund of $320 million
to which secured creditors (pnrnanly the consortium of 27 banks) laid claim, and upon the
use of which Grant's Viability depended
A
mere 4- 1/2 months after Grant's Chapter XI
filing, the court on February
12, 1976,
granted the liqUidation request of the creditors' committee
(SIX banks and five trade
creditor representatives),
With Grant's consent, and ordered the remaining 359 stores
hquidated
The debtor's
testimony
that,
among other things, the creditors' committee
resolution to liqUidate was "terminal"
and
"lethal" precluded any residual POSSibility that
a Chapter X pennon could be filed In "good
falth."ss On April 13,1976, Grant was adjudicated a bankrupt and a straight hqurdatmq
bankruptcy trustee was thereafter appointed
DUring the Chapter XI proceedings,
the
Cornrrussron opposed the payment of bonuses aggregating $2.7 million to a professronal liquidator. The court awarded less than
10 percent of the amount sought The Commission unsuccessfully opposed the payment
of Interim fees to the attomeys for the debtor
Unfortunately, however, Grant was hquidated
prior even to the expiration of the nme under
Bankruptcy Rule 11-15 for the Cornrrussion
to transfer the case to Chapter X.
GAC Corporation, et et 57-The Commission and certain debenture holders moved
under Section 328 and Rule 11-15 of the
Bankruptcy Rules to transfer these proceedrnqs to Chapter X. The debtor IS a holding
company which operates an extensive land
development business through subsrdianes
GAC Properttes, Inc. ("PropertieS"), the primary operating subsidiary, sells subdivrded
lots and home sites to the public on the
Installment sales baSIS pursuant to the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act 58 GAC
Properties Credit, Inc ("Credit"), a subsrdiary
of Properttes, was created In 1970 to taohtate
the selling of $100 million In debentures to
the public through two $50 million Issues.
Thereafter, ItS sole busmess activity was pur-

chasing receivables generated from Properties' land sales
On a consolidated basts, the companies
listed $436 million In assets and about $384
million In liabilities as of December 31, 1974
The debtor reported losses of about $28
million for the year ended December 31,
1975, with Installment land sales declining 95
percent from ItS peak In 1971 of $128 million
The compames' capitalization now Includes
about $79.2 rrulnon of two Issues of seruor
debentures held by about 6,000 persons and
about $53 5 million of convertible subordinated debentures held by about 3,000 persons The debtor also has publicly-held ISsues of preferred stock, and ItS common
stock IS held by about 25,000 persons
The Commission
In ItS transfer motion
urged, among other things, that there was a
need for a thorough investigation by an independent trustee and that rehabilitation of the
company required a substantial adjustment of
widely held public debt. The parent company
consented to the Commission's transfer motion and on May 19, 1976, the court ordered
the company transferred from Chapter XI to
Chapter X and subsequently appointed the
previously appointed receivers of Properties
and Credit as co-trustees of the parent corporation. Subsequent to the close of the frscal
year, the Court granted the Comrmssron's
motion With respect to the two pnmary subsidianes.
Contmental Investment corporeuon 59_
The Commission filed a monon pursuant to
Section 328 of Chapter XI and Rule 11-15 of
the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure to transfer this proceeding to Chapter X. The debtor
IS a diversified flnancrat services holding company which through vanous operating subsrdianes IS engaged In the business of life
Insurance, Investment company management
management
and 011 and gas partnership
The Chapter XI petition reflected assets and
liabilities of $51.2 million and $80.2 million,
respectively
The debtor's capitalization includes two outstanding
Issues of subordinated debentures In the pnnopal amount of
$38 6 million held by about 1,600 persons In
addmon, there are dose to 13 million shares
of outstanding common stock held by some
4,100 persons.
Pnor to the filing of ItS Chapter XI petition,
the debtor attempted a voluntary restructunng

of, among other things, ItS publiC debt pursuant to proxy sonotanon matenals and a
registration statement filed With the Commission The attempt failed because of a failure
to obtain the required 95 percent debenture
holder acceptances
The debtor did obtain,
however, the requisrte number of acceptances from debenture holders for confirmation of a plan of arrangement under Chapter
XI 60 The debtor then filed a petition under
Chapter XI together With a plan of arrangement to affect the public debt In the manner
that was attempted through the aborted voluntary restructunng, and With the pre-filing
acceptance In hand sought SWIft confirmation
The Cornrrussion moved to transfer the
case to Chapter X arqumq (I) Chapter X IS
required where more than a minor adjustment
of the nghts of public debenture holders IS
necessary, (II) public debenture holders are
entitled to "fair and equrtable'' treatment, (III)
the plan of arrangement
was not feasible
because, among other things, certain litigation claims against the debtor were not dischargeable In Chapter XI, (IV) a comprehensive reorganization
rather than a "Simple
cornposrtron"
of unsecured
debt was requrred, (v) there was a need for a new
management and an investigation by a dismterested trustee Into the debtor's past acnvrbes, and (VI) the debtor sought to circumvent
the protections afforded public Investors by
Chapter X through the use of preflling acceptances
At the close of the fiscal year, the bankruptcy Judge had not rendered a decrsion on
the Cornrrusston's transfer action.
Continental Mortgage Investors 61_ The
Commission and certain seruor creditors, including banks and institutions, filed motions
to transfer trus Chapter XI case rnvolvmq a
$600 million real estate Investment trust to
Chapter X The debtor has outstanding $46
million of convertible subordinated
debentures held by 2,000 public Investor-creditors
and 20 8 million shares of benenoal Interest
held by 28,000 public Investors The Commrssron In ItS motion argued, among other
things, that there was a need for a thorough
mvesnqatron by an Independent trustee, and
that rehabilitation
of the debtor required a
substantial adjustment of Widely held public
debt
The Cornrrussron pressed for the rnamte-

161

nance of the status quo pending a determination of Its transfer motion, In order that gOing
concern values and assets were not diSSIpated before a reorganization attempt under
Chapter X could get underway. The need for
maintenance of the status quo was accentuated by indications that the debtor may be
contemplating hquidanon rather than rehabilitation and by the delays obtained by the
debtor, over strong Commission objections,
of the heanng on the transfer monon, Indeed,
the Commission felt It necessary to appeal
the order of the bankruptcy judge adjourning
for 9O-days the heanng on the transfer motion.
At the close of the fiscal year, a heanng on
the Commission's transfer motion had still not
been held. And, despite the Commission's
insistence on maintenance of the status quo,
the debtor obtained authonty on a number of
occasions to dispose of assets.
Esgro, Inc 62- The Comrmssron's appeal
to the distnct court from the bankruptcy
judge's denial, WIthout prejudice, of a Section
328 transfer motion was dismissed when the
debtor agreed to amend ItS plan of arrangement so as substantrally
to Increase the
amount payable to ItS public debenture holders In settlement of their claims 63
The Commission brought to the debtor's
attention that Its proxy matenal soncrnnq consents to the arrangement
may have been
matenally rrusleadrnq In viotanon of proxy
provisrons of the Secunnes Exchange Act. 64
When the debtor sought confirmation desptte
the pending appeal, the Comrrussron moved
to stay confirmation and, alternatively, to intervene In the Chapter XI proceeding 65 to
enforce compliance WIth the proxy antifraud
provrsions and to object to confirmation. The
Comrmssron requested that the court VOid the
consents because of the alleged Violation of
the proxy prOVISIOnS66
When the debtor agreed to amend rnatenally ItS proposed arrangement for the benefit
of the general creditors and debenture holders, the Commission withdrew ItS objections
as did the Oftrcral Creditors'
Committee,
which also had filed objecnons. The order
confirming the modified arrangement became
final; the Oomrmssron then dismissed ItS appeal.

National Telephone, Inc et al 57-Dunng
the pendency of a motion by certain creditors

162

to transfer the proceedings from Chapter XI
to Chapter X, the majonty shareholder and
former chairman sought to convene a speeral
meeting of stockholders to remove three of
the company's SIX directors. He tailed however to comply With the proxy provlsrons of
the seconnes
Exchange Act of 1934 The
Oornrmssron supported an applicatron for an
order barnng the holding of the meeting on
the grounds that, among other things, such a
meeting, absent filing with the Commission
and transmittal to stockholders of an Information statement, would violate the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Based on trus ground,
the court enjomed the convening of the speoal meeting of stockholders.

American Beef Packers, Inc and Beef/and
International, Inc 68-The Oomrrussron intervened In this Chapter XI proceedmg
and
joined With the States of Iowa and Nebraska
In seeking the appointment
of a receiver
pursuant to Section 332 of Chapter XI. American Beef, whIch is publicly held, has assets
of about $110 million and liabilities of over
$92 rrulhon. The application alleged, among
other thmgs, that preferential
transfers of
money were made to affiliates of American
Beef before and after the Chapter XI filing;
that certain officers and directors were subjects of mvesnqanons by vanous state and
Federal aqencies: and that Amencan Beef
was mismanaged by ItS officers and directors
in that It diverted funds from ItS pnncipal
creditors, ISSUed checks drawn on accounts
Insufficient to pay the checks, and applied
funds necessary for Its continued operations
for capital Improvements.
The application became moot when a proposed plan of arrangement
requiring new
management was confirmed. The majonty of
claimants, whose claims arose from the sale
of livestock and livestock feeds were paid 55
percent of their daims in cash with the remainder to be paid from available cash flow.
Trade creditors were paid 50 percent of their
clairns In full satisfaction thereof.
Scott, Gorman Mumclpals, Inc. 69_ The
Oomrnlssron intervened In ttus Chapter XI
case Involving a municipal bond dealer and
sought the appointment
of a receiver pursuant to Section 332 of Chapter XI and
Bankruptcy Rule 11-18(b). In this connecbon,
the Oomrmssron
alleged that substantial
sums of secunties, notes and bonds of the

debtor's customers were Illegally pledged and
rmsappropnated, After an evidentiary hearing
a receiver was appointed. The Commission
further sought and was granted a danncanon
of ItS Chapter XI stays of all actions against
the debtor, so as to permit the commencement of a lawsuit against the debtor and its
pnnopals for violations of the Federal secunties laws. Shortly thereafter a complaint was
filed by the Commission for violations of the
antifraud provisions of the Secunties Act of
1933 and of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.70
Ultimately, the debtor was adjudicated a
bankrupt and a bankruptcy trustee appointed

SEC Management
Operations

A number of Important developments occurred In 1976, contributing to Increased operating efficiency, Improved service to the
public, and effeclJve use of the Commission's
resources The Commission awarded a new
contract for the public drsserrnnatron
of filed
Information The contractor plans a number of
user workshops In major cities over the next
two years, and Increased promotion of ItS
new "Search line" telephone service that offers research of filings to subscribers and
non-subscribers
Projects for future Improvements In operations depend to a large extent
on our ability to cope with our own paperwork
problems
The Commission has been successful In obtaining funding In 1977 to initiate
a program for technological
Improvements.
DUring 1977, the Commission plans to embark on a comprehensive micro-Imagery program which Will, over a three year period,
convert all active official public filings and
formal correspondence to microfiche The microfiche program will be combined With a
reliable on-line document Indexing, tracking
and retrieval system It IS anncipated that the
Commission will benefit by extensive use of
telecommumcatrons,
including comprehensive data-entry systems, desiqned to eliminate a substantial amount of clerical effort
and Improve the accuracy and timeliness of
essential information

ORGANIZATIONAL

CHANGES

The Commission established an Offlce of
Consumer
Affairs on May 20, 1976 The
Office IS charged With protecting the Interests
of consumers, I e., smaller mdividual mves-

tors, In their dealings With the secunnes industry and In providmq special representation
for such Investors In matters before the Comrrussron.
An Office of Small BUSiness Policy was
established In the Commission's
Office of
Economic and Policy Research. The function
of this Office IS to direct and coordinate the
Commission's
examination
of the efficacy
and Impact of secunnes regulation on small
busmesses
To assure coordination between the Commrssion's relations With the press and With
Congress, and to provide Increased emphaSIS In both areas, the Commission combined
the Offices
of Public
Information
and
Congressional Affairs.
Effective Apnl 2, 1976, the Commission
changed the name of the DIVISion of Investment Management Regulation to the DIVISion
of Investment Management Additionally, the
Commission approved the transfer of functions and personnel from the DIVISion of Corporanon Finance relating to disclosure requirements applicable to Investment companies and certain Similar types of Issues to the
DIVISion of Investment Management

INFORMATION HANDLING
Significant progress was made durrnq the
use of
year In furthering the Commission's
electronic data processing (EDP) In support
of ItS information handling activities.
Certain EDP systems were developed as a
result of the rrnplementatron of the Securities
Acts Amendments of 1975. These systems
Involved the creation of mtormanon bases on
167

rnuructpal securitres dealers and transfer
agents, and the addition of new data elements to the broker-dealer registrant mtorrnanon base. Assistance was also provided to
the Commission's staff through the techmcal
review of documents filed by secunties information processors
to determine
the adequacy of required Information.
In a related area, the Office of Data Processing was extensively Involved In the design and development of a computer system
for processing mtormanon contained on the
broker-dealer
Financial
and Operational
Combined Uniform Single Report (FOCUS
Report) 1
An EDP system was also developed to
faciutate statrstrcal analyses of information
collected by the Commrssron In support of ItS
Street Name Study 2
Currently under development IS a system
for more effectively indexing Information relatIng to SEC registrants that will allow more
effIcient use of many EDP data files and will
serve as the central or master index for
locating and retrieving the filings of companies reporting to the Commission.
Plans for the coming year mctude the Implementation of a limIted telecornrnunrcanons
capability to support the previously
menboned central Index and certain other information systems Also planned IS the complebon of a five-year automatic data processing
program to establish long-range mtorrnanon
systems goals and provide for significant expansion and further development
of EDP
WIthin the Commission

OFFICE OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
As noted above, the Commission established an Office of Consumer Affairs In response to the President's four POint regulatory reform program. The Offrce was charged
WIth protecting the Interests of consumers,
I e., smaller individual Investors, In their dealings with the secunnes Industry and In provrdIng special representation for such investors
In matters before the Cornrrussron.
As ItS first assignment,
the Office was
Instructed by the Comrrussron to draw up a
proposal for the establishment of a meaningful Investor dispute grievance system which
would utilize, If possible, the securmes industry's self-regulatory organizations. The proce168

dures should be designed to avoid any cumbersome, ineffiCIent, or overly expensive requirernents which would discourage smaller
consumers
In the securities
Industry from
asserting their gnevances and dalmlng monetary damages In trns regard, they Will perform the same function as eXisting small
clarms courts. On June 9, 1976, the comrmssion mvited public comment on the need for
and possrbte structure of such a system and
scheduled a public forum on thrs matter for
JUly, 1976.
In adcmon to proposing a dispute gnevance procedure, the Oomrmsston asked the
OffIce to explore the possibnrty of Improving
ItS consumer protection program by upgradIng the Cornrrsss.on's complaint processing
effort; prOVIding for greater commes.on overSight of the complaint processing procedures
of the self-regulatory organizations; instituting
a legal aid system for Injured consumers who
meet requisite quahhcanons, reviewing the
cornmlssron's
standards for partroipanon as
emtcus cunse in court cases Involving Injury
to consumers; making greater use of public
investigatory
proceedings;
increasing
the
Oomrrussron's consumer education program,
and prOViding for greater consumer Input In
Comrrussion rulemaklng proceedings.
To ard In accomplishing
the above the
Comrmssron on June 9, 1976, mvited all
Interested persons to submit In writing their
Ideas for a procedure that Will be available
nanonwide through the self-regulatory organizations to Investors for settling disputes ansIng out of dealings In securities between a
customer and a registered broker-dealer."
In
this release the Oornrrussron also mvited the
people who had submitted written comments
to make an oral presentanon at an Informal
public forum held on July 15, 1976.

OFFICE OF PUBLIC
INFORMATION
The Office of Public Information has the
responsibility for disseminating
news about
Commrssron actions. This IS done prmopany
through the dally publication
of the SEC
News Digest The News Digest summarizes
such matters as: (1) proposed public offerIngs of securities for wmch a Secunnes Act
registration statement is filed; (2) notices of

subscription basts, by the Government PrintIng Office Currently there are 3,055 subscribers In addition, the Office of Public Information assembles copies of Important releases,
orders, decisrons, rules and rule proposals for
dally distribution to the media and all selfregulatory organizations.
The Office IS also called upon to respond to
approximately 75-100 dally telephone mqurnes from the press and the general public
The Office also receives approximately 2~0
letters per week from the general public seekIng assistance on a wide range of secunnes
related matters
Dunng the past year, the Office of Public
Information Initiated a consumer education
program through the use of written and audio-visual aides Several small brochures, designed as gUides and warnings to Investors,
were printed and distributed. "Eagle on the
Street", a narrated slide program on the
history and current role of the SEC, was
produced
It has been seen by a variety of
groups, Including graduate business and law
school students and CIVIC and professional
organizations
Copies of the program have
been placed with the National Audio Visual
Center for sale to the general public

ACTIVITY UNDER FREEDOM OF
INFORMATION ACT
DUring the year, the Commission determined to centralize and coordinate staff acnvIty on FOIA matters and assigned rssponsrbrlmes to the Office of Reports and Information
Services The first FOIA Officer for the Comrrussron was appointed and a Branch of FOIA
and Privacy Act created In the Office of
Reports and Information Services
The Commission's Freedom of Information
rules, revised on February 19, 1975, provide
that the public can Inspect or obtain copies of
all records maintained by the SEC with the
exception of certain specified categories of
Information Most financial and other information filed by registered companies has always
been available for Inspection or copying by

the public. However, the public was denied
access to certain categones of material, notably investigatory records Pursuant to various
FOIA requests, the Commission has made
available for public Inspection many records
which had traditionally been considered confidential Among these records are portions of
the Broker-Dealer and the entire Investment
Advisers and Investment Company Inspection Manuals, the Summary of Administrative
Interpretations
under the Secuntles Act of
1933 and the Commission's pen odic Secunties Violations Bulletin Moreover, the Commission has made available, pursuant to particular FOIA requests, staff letters of comment on registration statements or other filmqs and Wells Committee subrrussions.

Dunng 1976, the Commission focused ItS
recrurtrnent actrvrties on the strengthening of
ItS Equal Employment Opportunity Program
Under the leadership of a top-level committee
chaired by a Member of the Commission, the
SEC pursued an active attorney recruitrnent
program which Included on-campus
VISitS
combined With a thorough screening and review of applications at the Headquarters level
to Insure consideratron of candidates from all
segments of the population The Committee
also developed a cooperative training program to enable graduate students In nonlegal
curncula to participate In the work of the SEC
and to broaden the Comrmssron's recruitment
base Though most of the results of these
efforts Will not be seen until the transitional
quarter and early fiscal 1977 appomtrnents,
the Commission did Increase by 236 percent
the number of female attomeys on the staff,
169

the number rose from 55 at the end of fiscal
year 1975 to 68 at the end of 1976, and
represents a gaIn of 183 percent In the last
three fiscal years.
The Office of Personnel developed and
obtained CIvil Service Comrrussron approval
for an Upward MobIlity Training Agreement,
whIch wIll facihtate the advancement of the
Oomrrussron's current clencal and secretarial
employees Into the professional and technical
staff of the Oommlssron

Personnel Management
Evaluation
In July 1975, the CIvIl Service Commrssron
Issued ItS report on personnel management
svaluatron of the SEC A number of specinc
dehciencies were noted and several recomrnendanons were made to Improve personnel
management pracnces, A substantial amount
of nrne and resources were devoted to the
correction and Improvement of these areas,
and most were resolved to the mutual sanstaction of the SEC and CSC One of the more
slgnrflcant areas addressed by CSC dealt
wIth the grade structure and posinon management of the Secuntles Compliance Exammers These are key non-attorney Jobs WIthin
the agency, and It IS of utmost Importance
that examiners be given assignments that are
professionally challenging and offer mearunqful opportunity for advancement. The Comrrussron has begun an effort to develop more
clearly defined Job cntena for the journeyman
and seruor level examiners posmons, so that
orsnncnons between grade levels wIll be both
meanrngful and equitable This WIll be an ongomg program whIch wIll require monrtonng
over the next several years
The Commissron mmated ItS own management review and evaluation program dunng
fiscal year 1976 wIth a team of management
and personnel specialists, who began with a
revIew of the operations and personnel management acnvity of the newly organrzed DIVIsron of Investment Management
SImilar reviews are scheduled throughout the Oornrrussion dunng the transrnonal quarter and Into
fiscal year 1977

Training and Development
The training and development efforts durIng fiscal year 1976 Included the major cate170

gones of Executive Development, AffirmatIve
Action and Protessronal Skills:
ExecutIve Development: DeSIgned to enhance the performance and potential of our
rruddle management, thIS opportunity enabled
seven G5-14/15's
to attend advanced management development
training. In addition,
the SEC sent three of Its top management
executives to the Federal Executive Institute
and to the executive Seminar Center
Program Development The SEC worked
closely WIth the Nanonai Audro V,sual Center
to develop a film on tnal proceedings; thIS fIlm
IS being utilized by many of our protessronat
staff throughout the agency. The Amencan
InslJtute of CertIfied Public Accountants provrded under contract a senes of seminars on
advanced and "refresher" accounting pnnopies designed to keep our accounting and
finanaal staff up to date WIth the dynarmcs of
the accounting dISCIpline.
An Internal MobIlity Program was developed. When Implemented ,n early fall, thIS
program WIll encourage senior professionals
to seek temporary posnlons outside of their
orqarnzanon (but within the SEC) that will
provide them WIth broadenrng work expenences that could be useful to them when they
return to their permanent assignments.
AffirmatIve Action: Our TUItIon Support
Program was utilized by over 100 employees
as a means of assistance In the pursuit of
undergraduate education. Plans for next year
call for an mcorporanon of thiS program into a
larger Upward Mobility Program.
Protesstons! SkIlls Development. EmphaSIS was once again placed on Inhouse "techmeal" training both In the RegIons and In
Washington.
Enforcement,
regulatIons and
Investment training conferences
were conducted for both new and "seasoned" professtonats. A senior tnal attorney seminar is now
being planned for the winter months. Trns
program WIll address the needs of regIonal
enforcement attorneys who must litigate Slgnrficant cases on an Infrequent baSIS.

OFFICE SPACE
Dunng the first quarter of the fiscal year,
the Office of Management and BUdget upheld
the comrmssion's appeal against the General
Services Adnurustranon's deosron to assign a
new but unsatisfactory headquarters bUIlding
to thIS agency. FollOWIng thrs outcome, the

Commission explored other alternatlves that
would enable It to centralize all of ItS WashIngton metropolitan area offices In one buildIng or In a few bUildings In close proximity to
each other at a site that would be easily
accessible to VIsitors and members of the
secunnes Industry and allow for staff expansion over the next several years. Although an
adequate location at an acceptable price was
not found, a new headquarters
remains a
high priority for the Commission.
The General Services Administration, With
the approval of the Congress, signed a new
nve year lease for Capitol Mall North, the
present primary office location of the Commission. As the fiscal year ended, it appeared
that the Oomrmssron's
Washington
staff
would continue to be located at their three
separate area locations for the Immediately
forseeable future

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Total fees collected by the Commission In
fiscal 1976 represented 52 percent of funds
appropriated by the Congress for Commission operations. The Oornmissron IS requred
by law to collect fees for (1) registration of
seeuntres Issued, (2) qualifications
of trust
Indentures; (3) registratlon of exchanges, (4)
registration of brokers and dealers who are

members of the NASD; and (5) certification of

documents flied With the Commission. In addition, by fee schedule the Commission Imposes fees for certain filings and services,
such as the filing of annual reports and proxy
material
The Securities Acts Amendments of 1975
increased the transaction fees to be paid by
all national security exchanges to one threehundredth of 1 per centum of the aggregate
dollar amount of the sales of securities transacted during each preceding calendar year.
The 1975 Amendments have also mduded
under this fee requirement certain transacnons by every registered broker and dealer
wruch are not transacted on a nanonal secunues exchange, provided, however, that no
payment Will be required for any calendar
year In which the fee would be less than
$100
With reference to the fee schedule, the
Investment adviser assessment fee refunds
Originally announced In Commission release
IA-4B6 have been almost completed.
To
date, approximately
2,750 refund checks
have been mailed totaling slightly more than
$607,000.

Purpose of Registration
Effective registrations for cash sale for the

remaining at the same level as the previous

year In this category there were substantial
differences In distribution as between equity
and debt offerings; Ie. equity offerings increased from $33 billion to $40 billion In fiscal
1976-a
23 percent rise-and debt offerings
declined from $38 billion to $29 blilion-a 22
percent decline
Among the securmes registered for cash
sale, almost all debt Issues were for Immediate offerings, whereas nearly three-fourths of
the equity registrations were for extended
cash sale. Registration of extended offerings
totaled $28 9 billion With investment companies accounting for $18.8 billion and employee plans $9 1 billion Corporate equity
registrations accounted for 29 percent of rrn-

mediate cash sale registrations, up 39 percent from fiscal 1975
Securities registered for the account of the
Issuer for other than cash sale are primarily
common stock Issues relating to exchange
offers, mergers and consolidations In fiscal
1976 common stock effectively registered for
trus purpose totaled $11 billion, an Increase
of nearly three and one half limes over the
previous year
Registrations for the purpose of secondary
offenngs (proceeds gOing to seiling security
holders) typically concern sales of common
stock In fiscal 1976 these registrations
amounted to $2 1 billion, representing a 64
percent Increase from fiscal 1975
