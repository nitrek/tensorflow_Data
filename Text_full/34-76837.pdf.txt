In the Matter of

NOTICE OF AMENDED
PROPOSED PLAN OF
DISTRIBUTION AND
OPPORTUNITY FOR
COMMENT

In response to comments received on the proposed plan of distribution (“Prior
Proposal”) in Gregg C. Lorenzo, A.P. File No. 3-15211, published on March 30, 2015,1
the Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has submitted an amended proposed plan
(“Amended Plan”) to the Commission for publication. Notice is hereby given, pursuant
to Rule 1103 of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s
(“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103,
that the Commission has published the Amended Plan at
http://www.sec.gov/litigation/fairfundlist.htm#lorenzo and seeks comment from
interested persons.2 Based on comments and additional information received on the
Prior Proposal, the Division revised the calculation of each Eligible Customers’3 pro
rata percentage of the total pooled harm and clarified who is to be eligible to
participate in the distribution.
On November 20, 2013, the Commission issued an Order Making Findings and
Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Section 8A
of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 15(b), 21B, and 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Order”) as to Respondents Gregg C. Lorenzo
(“Lorenzo”) and Charles Vista, LLC (“Charles Vista”) (collectively, “Respondents”)
(Securities Act Rel. No. 9480 (November 20, 2013)). The Order found that
Respondents made fraudulent misrepresentations to several customers of Charles
Vista, a broker-dealer controlled by Lorenzo, to induce them to invest in convertible

Exchange Act Rel. No. 74607 (March 30, 2015).
The Commission, pursuant to delegated authority, previously issued an order extending the time for
approval or disapproval of this plan. Exchange Act Rel. No. 75059 (May 15, 2015). As a result of the
Commission’s decision to repropose the Prior Plan for comment, an order approving or disapproving
the Amended Plan will be entered in accordance with the provisions of Rule 1104, 17 C.F.R. 201.1104.

debentures issued by a start-up waste management company, Waste2Energy
Holdings, Inc. (“W2E”). The Order further found that Charles Vista had a
considerable financial interest in the debentures offering and was the exclusive
placement agent for the issuance of 12% W2E debentures. The debentures were
convertible to W2E stock, which is a penny stock. Additionally, the Order found that
W2E’s financial situation was precarious and W2E’s securities were extremely
speculative because, among other reasons, the company had millions of dollars of
debt that was senior to the debt W2E was issuing through the debentures offering.
Finally, the Order found that after Respondents knowingly or recklessly made
fraudulent misrepresentations to several Charles Vista customers, these customers
invested in W2E debentures.
In the Order, Lorenzo and Charles Vista were jointly ordered to pay disgorgement
of $130,000 and prejudgment interest of $20,000. In addition, Lorenzo was ordered to
pay a civil penalty of $375,000 and Charles Vista was ordered to pay a civil penalty of
$4,350,000. Pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as
amended, the Order established a Fair Fund for the benefit of injured investors using
the disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties paid and to be paid by
Respondents. Lorenzo has paid $130,000 in disgorgement, $20,000 in prejudgment
interest, and a civil penalty of $375,000. Charles Vista has not made any payments to
date.
THE DISTRIBUTION PLAN
The Amended Plan proposes to distribute an amount from the Fair Fund to six
customers of the Respondents each of whom was injured by the violations described in
the Order. The Amended Plan describes its methodology for distributing the Fair Fund
in paragraph 7. At the end of paragraph 7, and using information obtained from the
Commission’s investigation and the comment process on the Prior Proposal, the
Amended Plan presents a table with the dollar amount of each Eligible Customer’s
principal investment in W2E, the dollar amount, if any, of third-party reimbursements
received by each Eligible Customer, and a net harm (“Harm Amount”) for each
Eligible Customer. The table also lists for each Eligible Customer the percentage of
the total of all Eligible Customer harm (“Pro Rata Share”) represented by each Eligible
Customer’s individual harm. The Prior Proposal was amended in order to reflect
recalculations of the percentages of the Eligible Customers’ pooled harm based on
public comments and additional information received.
To calculate the dollar amount that each Eligible Customer will receive
pursuant to the Amended Plan, the Fair Fund administrator will multiply the Pro Rata
Share by the “Net Fair Fund.” The “Net Fair Fund” is the Fair Fund, less any reserve
for federal, state, or local taxes, fees or other expenses of administering the Plan. As
noted above, the Fair Fund currently consists of the $525,000 paid by Lorenzo. Any
outstanding payments received after approval of the Plan will be added to the Fair
Fund and distributed in accordance with the Plan.
Eligible Customers will not be required to make claims or submit
documentation to establish their eligibility. The six Eligible Customers were
identified on the basis of information obtained by the Commission staff through
review and analysis of applicable records. Within sixty (60) days of the
2

Commission’s approval of the Plan, the Fund Administrator will send each Eligible
Customer a notice regarding the Commission’s approval of the Plan and, including as
appropriate, a statement characterizing the distribution, a link to the Plan posted on
the Commission’s website and instructions for requesting a copy of the Plan, a Harm
Amount calculation and a preliminary calculation of the Eligible Customer’s
distribution check amount (i.e., Fair Fund Payment), a description of the tax
information reporting and other related tax matters, the procedure for the distribution
as set forth in the Plan, and the name of the Fund Administrator to contact with
questions regarding the distribution (the “Plan Notice”). The Fund Administrator will
coordinate with the appointed Tax Administrator to request information from each
Eligible Customer that is needed to accomplish the distribution in accordance with
applicable tax requirements relating to the Fair Fund.
The Plan also provides procedures for Eligible Customers to dispute the
amounts received. Disputes will be limited to calculations of an Eligible Customers’
Harm Amount. Should an Eligible Customer wish to dispute the amount to be
received, an Eligible Customer must submit a written communication to the Fund
Administrator. The Fund Administrator must receive the written communication
detailing the dispute along with any supporting documentation within thirty (30) days
of the date that the Plan Notice is sent to an Eligible Customer. The Fund
Administrator will investigate the dispute, and such investigation will include a
review of the written dispute as well as any supporting documentation. Within thirty
(30) days of receipt of the written dispute, the Fund Administrator will notify the
Eligible Customer of her resolution of the dispute, which shall be final.
