After requesting and reviewing the record, Claimant #2 provided written notice that
Claimant #2 would not contest the Preliminary Determination. Claimant #3 failed to submit a
timely response contesting the Preliminary Determination. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 21F10(f), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-10(f), the Preliminary Determination as to Claimant #2 and
Claimant #3 denying their claims for award has become the Final Order of the Commission with
respect to their award claims.

The CRS preliminarily determined that Claimant #1 provided original information to the
Commission that led to the successful enforcement of the Covered Action pursuant to
Section 21F(b)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 21F-3(a) promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R.
§ 240.21F-3(a).
The CRS also preliminarily determined to recommend that Claimant #1’s award be set in
the amount of --- percent --- of the monetary sanctions collected in the Covered Action,
which will equal payment of more than $17,000,000. In arriving at this recommendation, the
CRS considered the factors set forth in Rule 21F-6, 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-6, in relation to the
facts and circumstances of Claimant #1’s application.
Claimant #1 did not contest the Preliminary Determination of the CRS. Accordingly,
pursuant to Rule 21F-10(f), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-10(f), the Preliminary Determination became
the Proposed Final Determination of the CRS.
3

In detailing the ways that Claimant #1’s original information led to the success of the
Covered Action, we caution that whether original information leads to successful enforcement
depends on an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individual case. Thus, the
discussion here is not precedential for other matters.

Upon due consideration under Rules 21F-10(f) and (h), 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.21F-10(f)
and (h), the Preliminary Determination of the Claims Review Staff is adopted. Accordingly, for
the reasons set forth in the Preliminary Determination, it is hereby ORDERED that Claimant #1
shall receive --- percent --- of the monetary sanctions collected, or to be collected, in the
Covered Action.
III.

Claimant #4’s and Claimant #5’s Claims Are Denied
A. Preliminary Determination

On February 1, 2016, the CRS also preliminarily determined to deny Claimant #4’s and
Claimant #5’s award applications because their information did not lead to the successful
enforcement of the Covered Action. See Section 21F(b)(1) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 21F3(a) thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-3(a). Also, Claimant #5 based the claim for award on
information provided to the Commission before July 21, 2010. Such information is not “original
information,” as that term is defined under Rule 21F-4(b)(1) of the Exchange Act, because it was
provided before the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act.4
B. Claimant #4’s Response
On March 24, 2016, Claimant #4 submitted a written response contesting the Preliminary
Determination. Claimant #4 failed to identify any specific tip or complaint Claimant #4 made to
the Commission in connection with the Covered Action. Instead, Claimant #4 contended that
Claimant #4 provided documentation to the Commission evidencing

C. Claimant #5’s Response
On February 10, 2016, Claimant #5 submitted a written response contesting the
Preliminary Determination. In the response, Claimant #5 failed to identify any specific tip or
complaint Claimant #5 made to the Commission in connection with the Covered Action. Rather,
Claimant #5 contended that the preliminary denial of Claimant #5’s claim violated the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the First Amendment, to the U.S.
Constitution. In support of this argument, Claimant #5 pointed to

None of the information identified by Claimant #4 or Claimant #5 in their responses had
any apparent relevance to the question of whether they provided information to the Commission
that led to the successful enforcement of the Covered Action.
D. Analysis
To qualify for an award under Section 21F of the Exchange Act, a whistleblower must
voluntarily provide the Commission with original information that leads to the successful
enforcement of a covered judicial or administrative action or related action. 15 U.S.C. § 78u6(b)(1). As relevant here, original information “leads to” a successful enforcement action if
either: (i) the original information caused the staff to open an investigation, reopen an
investigation, or inquire into different conduct as part of a current investigation, and the
Commission brought a successful action based in whole or in part on conduct that was the
subject of the original information; or (ii) the conduct was already under examination or
investigation, and the original information significantly contributed to the success of the action.
Rule 21F-4(c)(1)-(2), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-4(c)(1)-(2).
We find that none of the information Claimant #4 or Claimant #5 submitted led to the
Redacted
successful enforcement of the Covered Action.6 First, at no point prior to
the
Covered Action did the staff members responsible for the Covered Action have any contact with,
or receive any information from, Claimant #4 or Claimant #5. Second, based on our own
assessment of the information that Claimant #4 and Claimant #5 submitted, we cannot see how
this information could have led to the successful enforcement of the Covered Action given the
absence of relevant factual connections between the two.

For instance, Claimant #5 contends that Claimant #5:

In the alternative, we deny Claimant #5’s award application because Claimant #5 did not
provide any original information to the Commission. The Preliminary Determination identified
this as a second ground for denial and Claimant #5 failed to demonstrate otherwise in
Claimant #5’s response to the Preliminary Determination.
5

Because the record demonstrates that Claimant #4’s and Claimant #5’s information did
not lead to the successful enforcement of the Covered Action and they have not shown otherwise
in their requests for reconsideration of the Preliminary Determination, we deny Claimant #4’s
and Claimant #5’s applications for an award.7
IV.

---

Conclusion

Accordingly, it is ORDERED that Claimant #1 shall receive an award of --- percent
of the monetary sanctions collected, or to be collected, in the Covered Action.
ORDERED that Claimant #4’s whistleblower award claim is denied.
ORDERED that Claimant #5’s whistleblower award claim is denied.
By the Commission.

We have considered Claimant #5’s various constitutional claims, but we find them
frivolous. They lack merit and have no bearing on the critical factual question whether
Claimant #5 has met the requirements to receive an award.
