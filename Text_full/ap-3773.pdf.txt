POSTPONEMENT ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on June 18, 2014. The proceeding is a follow-on proceeding based on
SEC v. Pedras, No. 13-cv-7932 (C.D. Cal. June 9, 2014), in which Respondent Christopher A.T.
Pedras (a/k/a Chris Pedras a/k/a Antone Thomas Pedras), was enjoined, by default, against
violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Pedras, who is
in Tonga, has not been served with the OIP.1 The Division of Enforcement was ordered to report on
its efforts to serve Pedras every sixty days, and a telephonic prehearing conference was scheduled
for April 15, 2016. Christopher A.T. Pedras (a/k/a Chris Pedras a/k/a Antone Thomas Pedras),
Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3214, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4160 (Oct. 9, 2015).
In its April 7, 2016, report, the Division advised that a request to extradite Pedras from Tonga
was made, and an extradition hearing took place in Tonga on or about March 29, 2016. No ruling
has been issued yet. The Division notes that, even if Pedras is ordered extradited to the United
States, extradition may not take place immediately because he may have appeal rights.
Accordingly, to allow time for service of the OIP and Pedras’s Answer, consistent with 17 C.F.R. §
201.161, the telephonic prehearing conference scheduled for April 15, 2016, will be postponed and
held on October 14, 2016, at 10:30 a.m. EDT, if the proceeding has not been resolved by then. If
Pedras has still not been served by that date, the Division may wish to file a motion to discontinue
the proceeding. See 17 C.F.R. § 200.30-10(a)(8).
IT IS SO ORDERED.
