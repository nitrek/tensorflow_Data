PURSUANT TO SECTION 21C OF
THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
OF 1934, MAKING FINDINGS, AND
IMPOSING A CEASE-AND-DESIST
ORDER

ALTAIR NANOTECHNOLOGIES,
INC.
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that ceaseand-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), against Altair Nanotechnologies, Inc. (“Altair” or
“Respondent”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Ceaseand-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.1

1

Concurrent with this Order is the Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to
Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, Accepting Settlement,
Implementing Settlement, and Staying Proceedings to Implement Settlement entered against
Altair on September 29, 2016.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:
Summary
1.
This financial reporting matter arises from Altair’s violations of the reporting and
internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act. On September 4, 2014, Altair filed a Form 8-K
reporting that its auditor, Crowe Horwath LLP, had resigned effective August 28, 2014 because it
could not complete the audit for fiscal year 2013 due to material weaknesses in Altair’s internal
controls and procedures that Crowe Horwath had identified during the course of that audit.
Additionally, the Form 8-K explained that Crowe Horwath had experienced substantial difficulty
in obtaining auditable information on Altair’s Chinese operations after it became an entity
operating primarily in China by the end of 2013.
2.
In a March 13, 2015 Form 8-K, Altair confirmed that the material weaknesses
identified by Crowe Horwath had in fact existed in 2013, and therefore Altair’s financial
statements for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2013 should no longer be
relied upon. Altair subsequently appointed Marcum LLP as its new auditor. To date, however,
Altair has failed to file any restated financial statements or a Form 10-K for fiscal year 2013, nor
has it filed any Forms 10-Q or Forms 10-K for fiscal years 2014, 2015, or 2016.
Respondent
3.
Altair Nanotechnologies, Inc. (CIK No. 0001016546) is a Delaware corporation
with principal executive offices in Reno, Nevada and Anderson, Indiana. Altair develops,
manufactures and sells nano lithium titanate batteries and energy storage systems. Beginning in
January 1997, Altair’s common stock was registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange
Act and traded on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market.2 Following NASDAQ’s registration as a national
securities exchange, Altair’s common stock became registered under Section 12(b) of the
Exchange Act on July 31, 2006. In September 2014, Altair filed a Form 25 voluntarily delisting
and deregistering its stock under Section 12(b). Altair’s common stock then reverted to its
previous Section 12(g) registration and currently trades on the grey market (Ticker Symbol:
ALTI).
Facts
4.
In July 2011, Altair became majority owned by a subsidiary of a Hong Kong
company. Altair subsequently announced plans to manufacture and sell products in China, and
in the second quarter of 2012 it established two Chinese subsidiaries to facilitate those plans. In
late 2013, Altair began to move its manufacturing and other operations from the United States to
Altair’s stock initially traded under the ticker symbol “ALTIF” but this was later changed to
“ALTI.” Although Altair’s common stock generally traded on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market
(now known as the Nasdaq Capital Market), from approximately January 1998 to September
2002 it traded on the Nasdaq National Market (now known as the Nasdaq Global Market).

China. By the end of 2013, Altair became an entity operating primarily in China, which caused a
number of changes in management, including the positions of CEO and CFO.
5.
Altair’s transfer of operations from the United States to China also resulted in
changes to its financial reporting practices. Altair began incorporating financial data for its
Chinese operations into consolidated financial statements in the second quarter of 2012. The
financial data was generated using Chinese generally accepted accounting principles and
maintained on a separate, Chinese language electronic accounting system located in China, and had
to be converted to the English language and United States generally accepted accounting principles
for inclusion in Altair’s consolidated financial statements. Altair’s CFO and accounting staff did
not have access to the Chinese accounting system until late 2015, and thus had to rely first on a
Chinese-based accounting firm, and then the employees of Altair’s Chinese subsidiaries, to obtain
the data from that system.
6.
On September 4, 2014, Altair filed a Form 8-K reporting that its auditor,
Crowe Horwath LLP, had resigned effective August 28, 2014. The Form 8-K explained that
Crowe Horwath had determined that it could not complete Altair’s audit for fiscal year 2013 due
to material weaknesses in Altair’s internal controls and procedures that Crowe Horwath had
identified during the course of its work on that audit. These weaknesses related to changes in
Altair’s management and to Altair’s financial reporting and recordkeeping practices that had
resulted from Altair’s transfer of operations from the United States to China.
7.

Specifically, Crowe Horwath found that:
(1)

Altair experienced significant executive management and accounting level
turnover in 2013 which led to a lack of segregation of duties throughout
Altair and resulted in a lack of controls to perform a timely review of
transactions at an appropriate level of precision;

(2)

Altair did not implement adequate procedures and controls over the 2013
year-end financial close and reporting process to ensure timely filings in
compliance with its financial reporting requirements;

(3)

Altair did not implement adequate procedures and controls to
appropriately evaluate routine and non-routine transactions, and as a
result, did not detect material misstatements that were identified by Crowe
Horwath during its audit process;

(4)

Altair did not implement adequate procedures and controls to ensure
accurate and timely communication with its subsidiaries in China, and as a
result, led to material misstatements that were identified by Crowe
Horwath during its audit process; and

(5)

Altair did not implement adequate procedures and controls to ensure the
completeness and accuracy of its consolidated financial statements and
related subsequent events.
3

8.
In a March 13, 2015 Form 8-K, Altair reported that management had analyzed the
internal control issues and material weaknesses identified by Crowe Horwath. Management’s
analysis concluded that there was “factual support that such issues and weaknesses existed in
2013” therefore “the financial statements for the three and nine month periods ended September
30, 2013,” as presented on Altair’s Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2013, filed November 19,
2013, should no longer be relied upon. Altair also reported that management was in the process of
hiring a new auditor and taking other measures to ensure that the Form 10-K for fiscal year 2013
and the financial reports for fiscal year 2014 could be completed as soon as possible.
9.
On April 7, 2015, Altair announced that it had appointed Marcum LLP as its new
auditor and engaged Marcum to conduct audits for fiscal years 2013 and 2014. Altair later
engaged Marcum to conduct an audit for fiscal year 2015 as well.
10.
Altair’s last filed periodic report containing financial statements was its quarterly
report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2013. Since then, Altair has
not filed any reports including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for periods following September
30, 2013, and annual reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and years
ended thereafter.
Violations
11.
As a result of the conduct described above, Altair violated Section 13(a) of the
Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, which require every issuer of a security
registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act file with the Commission information,
documents, and annual and quarterly reports as the Commission may require, on the appropriate
forms and within the period specified on the form.
12.
As a result of the conduct described above, Altair violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of
the Exchange Act, which requires every issuer of a security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the
Exchange Act to, among other things, devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

By no later than 5:30 p.m. ET on November 15, 2016, file with the Commission

deficiency or deficiencies, the Division of Enforcement shall notify the
Office of the Secretary of the Commission and Altair of its conclusion
within 30 calendar days following this failure (or, if the last day of the
period falls on a weekend or federal holiday, on the first business day
immediately thereafter), and the registration of each class of Altair’s
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 will be revoked
pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(j) in accordance with the Order
Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 12(j) of the

(4)

If Altair resubmits its Filings pursuant to paragraph 14(2) above, and the

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent Altair’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
A.
Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Altair cease and desist
from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a) and
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.
B.
Respondent Altair shall comply with the undertakings enumerated in Section III
above; provided, however, that solely for the purpose of complying with those undertakings, Altair
shall not be deemed to have violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13
thereunder.
C.
Respondent Altair shall, within 10 days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil money
penalty in the amount of $250,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the
general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If timely
payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. §3717. Payment must
be made in one of the following ways:
(1)

Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which
will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

6

(2)

Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

(3)

Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United
States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:
Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch
HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
Altair as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy of
the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Victoria A. Levin, Assistant Regional
Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, Los Angeles Regional
Office, 444 South Flower Street, Suite 900, Los Angeles, California 90071.
D.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent Altair agrees that in any Related
Investor Action, it shall not argue that it is entitled to, nor shall it benefit by, offset or reduction of
any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil
penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a
Penalty Offset, Respondent Altair agrees that it shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order
granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of
the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be
deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil
penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action”
means a private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more
investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the
Commission in this proceeding.

By the Commission.
