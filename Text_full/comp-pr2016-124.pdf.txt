~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-§

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") alleges as follows:
SUMMARY
l.

The SEC is bringing this case to stop an ongoing multi-million dollar fraud

scheme. The scheme has been principally orchestrated by Defendant Ash Narayan. He has
carried it out with the assistance of Defendants Richard Harmon, John Kaptrosky, and The
Ticket Reserve Inc. ("TTR"). Almost always without their knowledge or consent, Narayan
directed his clients into high-risk investments in TTR. In exchange, he received almost $2
million in undisclosed finder's fees. He, Harmon, and Kaptrosky obscured this arrangement by
mischaracterizing the finder's fees as either "director's fees" or "loans." They further attempted
to conceal the scheme by creating fraudulent documents-sometimes backdated-and by making
Ponzi-like payments in order to hide TTR's huge losses from Narayan's clients.

Throughout most of the scheme, Narayan was employed as an investment adviser

representative and Managing Partner in the California office of Dallas-based RGT Capital
Management, Ltd. In that capacity, Narayan invested over $33 mi11ion of his advisory clients'
assets in TTR. As noted above, this was regularly done without their knowledge of consentsometimes using forged or copied signatures. Narayan did not tell his clients key information
that he knew about TTR, including that TTR was financially distressed. Nor did he tell them
about serious conflicts of interest, including that he:
•

sat on TTR's Board of Directors;

•

owned mi11ions of shares ofTTR stock; and

•

secretly obtained nearly $2 million in undisclosed finder's fees-usually paid out of
client funds-in exchange for securing investments in TTR.

3.

Together with Narayan, TTR and its Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") Harmon,

and Chief Operating Officer ("COO") Kaptrosky, carried out the scheme by:
•

making undisclosed finder's fee payments to Narayan-often paid out of client
funds-and concealing their true nature by memorializing them as "directors fees" or
"loans";

•

drafting and executing sham promissory notes between TTR and Narayan in order to
further conceal the fraudulent payments (and also help Narayan dodge taxes); and

•

attempting to conceal the fraud by approving and executing Ponzi-like payments to
existing investors using new investor funds.

4.

In February 2016, Narayan was fired from RGT. Around that time, he and the

Defendants learned that the scheme was being investigated by the SEC. Consequently, in March
2016, the Defendants entered into an agreement requiring Narayan to repay TTR monies owed
under the sham "loan" agreements. In reality, he is merely paying TTR back proceeds obtained

as part of the fraud scheme. These funds are being used to pay for ITR's ongoing expensesincluding expenses, reimbursements, and salaries for Harmon and Kaptrosky. This arrangement
is actively depleting the funds available to repay TTR's defrauded investors. Narayan is due to
make another payment to TTR on May 31, 2016.
5.

In addition to engaging in the TTR scheme, Narayan knowingly or recklessly lied

to his clients about his qua1ifications. Narayan held himself out as a Certified Public Accountant
("CPA"). In truth, be is not and never has been a CPA.
6.

By engaging in the conduct alleged in this Complaint, the Defendants have

committed and are committing- and unless immediately restrained and enjoined by the Court
will continue to commit- intentional violations of the anti fraud provisions of the federal
securities laws. Thus, in the interest of protecting the public from further illegal activity, the
SEC brings this action seeking all available relief-including temporary, preliminary, and
permanent injunctions; disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest; and civil
money penalties. In order to preserve any remaining assets for the benefit of defrauded
investors, the SEC further seeks an order: freezing the Defendants' assets; requiring sworn
accountings from them; and appointing a receiver to take control of TTR's assets.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7.

The Court has jurisdiction over this action under Sections 20(b), 20(d) and 22(a)

of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d) and 77v(a)];
Sections 21 (d), 21 ( e), and 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") [ 15
U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa]; and Section 209(d) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
("Advisers Act") [15 U.S.C. § 80b-9(d)]. Venue is proper because a substantial part of the
events and omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in the Northern District of Texas.

FACTS
I.

NARAYAN W AS AN INVESTME~T ADVISOR WHO OWED FIDUCIARY D UTIES TO HIS

CLIENTS.

13.

Narayan joined RGT in 1997. He was Managing Director ofRGT's Irvine,

California office and an investment adviser representative of RGT. In that capacity, Narayan
was in the business of advising his clients regarding the value of securities and the advisability of
investing in, purchasing, or selling securities. He advised over 50 RGT clients. From January
2010 through February 2016, Narayan received approximately $3.8 million in compensation
from RGT.
14.

Although Narayan worked in RGT's California office, the great majority ofRGT's

senior executives live and work in Dallas. Narayan regularly traveled to the Dallas area to meet
with them. He also met with his clients in the Dallas area. From 2013-15, he made at least 15

business-related trips to the Dallas area.
15.

As an investment adviser representative, Narayan had fiduciary duties to bis

clients. He had an affirmative duty of utmost good faith to them. He was required to make full
and fair disclosure of all material facts-including all actual or potential conflicts of interest. He
was required to act in his clients' best interest and to place their interest above his own. And he
was required to provide suitable investment advice to each client in light of that client's financial
situation, investment experience, and investment objectives.
II.

NARAYAN DEVELOPED, AND LATER EXPLOITED, RELATIONSIDPS OF TRUST WITH
HIGH PROFILE, H IGH NET WORTH CLIENTS.

16.

Many ofNarayan's former advisory clients are high net worth individuals. His

clients included many current and former professional athletes. Three of these former clientsClient One, a former Major League Baseball ("MLB") players; Client Two, a current MLB
player; and Client Three, a current National Football League ("NFL") player-exemplify the
type of clients Narayan advised.
17.

Many of these clients-including Client One, Client Two, and Client Three-

lacked meaningful financial or investment expertise. They therefore relied on Narayan, who
owed each of them fiduciary duties, to make important financial decisions on their behalf.
Perhaps most importantly, Narayan advised them on what investments their investment
portfolios should include. Narayan's clients-including Client One, Client Two, and Client
Three-entered into advisory agreements with RGT under which Narayan would manage their
investments.
18.

Narayan's clients trusted him- not only because of their fiduciary relationship,

but also because of his professional qualifications and experience. Narayan knowingly or
recklessly represented to these clients that he was a certified public accountant ("CPA"). For

instance, both his RGT email signature block and his letterhead read "Ash Narayan, J.D., CPA."
His claim that he was a CPA boosted Narayan's credibility. It served as a basis on which his
clients-like Client One, Client Two, and Client Three-believed he was capable of managing
their money conservatively and in accordance with the law. In reality, Narayan is not-and
never has been-a CPA. Knowing that Narayan was falsely holding himself out as a CPA would
have been important to his clients-both in deciding whether to retain him as an investment
adviser and in deciding whether they could trust his investment recommendations.

A.

Client One trusted and relied upon Narayan to manage his investments.

19.

Client One is a former MLB player who retired in 2013. He met Narayan through

his agent in the 2002-03 timeframe. When they met, Client One learned that Narayan advised a
number of other professional baseball players.
20.

Narayan built a relationship of trust with Client One. That trust was based, in

part, on their shared Christian faith and interest in charitable work. Client One's personal trust in
Narayan-as well as his understanding ofNarayan's competence and experience providing sound
financial advice-were important to Client One when he was considering whether to hire
Narayan as his investment adviser representative.
21.

Before hiring Narayan, Client One told him that he wanted to pursue conservative

investments that would not place his principal at risk. Narayan agreed to pursue a low-risk
investment strategy aligned with Client One's goals. With this understanding, Client One
engaged Narayan as his investment adviser representative in the 2002-03 timeframe.
22.

At Narayan's direction, as much as 80% of Client One's MLB salary was directly

deposited to a brokerage account. Narayan managed these funds on Client One's behalf. Client
One understood that these funds would be managed by Narayan as they had discussed-by

investing in conservative, low-risk investments.
23.

Narayan or people working for him regularly delivered investment-related

paperwork to Client One. Because Client One often traveled for work, the paperwork was
typically delivered to the various locations where Client One's team was playing. In 2012, when
Client One was employed by the Texas Rangers, deliveries were made to the Rangers' clubhouse
in Arlington, Texas. During 2001-10, when Client One played for the Houston Astros,
paperwork was also sent to Houston, Texas. In addition, Client One and Narayan had various
business meetings in Texas from 2001-15.
24.

When necessary, Client One signed the paperwork that Narayan sent him. He

always did so with the understanding that Narayan was pursuing the conservative investment
strategy they had agreed upon. He further believed that the documents he signed for Narayan
were consistent with that strategy. Finally, Client One also trusted Narayan and understood him
to be acting as a fiduciary-putting Client One's interests above his own and fully disclosing all
material facts, including conflicts of interest.

B.

Client Two also trusted and relied upon Narayan to manage his investments.

25.

Client Two is a current MLB player. He met Narayan in the 2004-05 timeframe

through another MLB player who was a Narayan client. When they met, Client Two understood
that Narayan was also managing Client One's investments.
26.

As with Client One, Narayan forged a relationship of trust with Client Two. That

trust was based, in part, on their shared Christian faith and interest in charitable work. Client
Two's personal trust in Narayan-as well as his understanding ofNarayan's competence and
experience providing sound financial advice-were important to Client Two when he was
considering whether to hire Narayan as his investment adviser representative.

Page 8 of 25 PageID 10

Before retaining Narayan, Client Two explained to him that he wanted to pursue

an investment strategy with minimal risk. This was true for at least two reasons. First, Client
Two was still working under his first MLB contract. Second, Client Two knew that as an MLB
player his earning potential might be realized within a very limited time window. Client Two
therefore told Narayan that his goal was to achieve financial security through conservative
investments while he was still playing. Narayan agreed to pursue a low-risk strategy. With this
understanding, Client Two engaged Narayan as his investment adviser representative in the
2004-05 timeframe.
28.

Once Narayan became Client Two's investment adviser representative, a

significant portion of Client Two's MLB salary was transmitted to Narayan. Client Two
understood that those funds would to be invested pursuant to the low-risk strategy that Narayan
had agreed to follow.

C.

Client Three also trusted and relied upon Narayan to manage his

investments.
29.

Client Three is a current NFL player. He met Narayan in 2009- the same year he

left college to pursue an NFL career. At that time, he was looking for someone to help him
invest his NFL earnings. Client Three learned by talking to Narayan that he was advising many
other professional athletes, including a number of NFL players.
30.

As with Client One and Client Two, Narayan forged a relationship of trust with

Client Three. That trust was based, in part, on their shared Christian faith and interest in
charitable work. Client Three also learned that they had attended the same church in California.
Client Three's trust in Narayan personally- as well as his understanding of Narayan's
competence and experience providing sound financial advice-were important to Client Three

when he was considering whether to hire Narayan as his investment adviser representative.
31.

Before retaining Narayan, Client Three explained to him that he wanted to pursue

safe, conservative investments that would not put his investment principal at risk. He and
Narayan also discussed the fact that as a professional athlete in a sport that has a high risk of
injury, his earnings might be realized within a short window. Narayan thus agreed that he would
pursue a conservative strategy involving minimal risk. With this understanding, Client Three
engaged Narayan as his investment adviser representative in 2009.
32.

Narayan, working with Client Three's NFL employers, arranged for the direct

deposit of his NFL paychecks. His weekly paychecks were deposited into accounts that were
setup by Narayan and RGT. Narayan was responsible for allocating and managing Client
Three's earnings in an investment account as they had discussed- by investing in conservative,
low-risk investments.
Ill.

NARAYAN FRAUDULENTLY TRANSFERRED OVER $33 MILLION IN ADVISORY CLIENTS'
FUNDS TO TTR, OFTEN WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT.

33.

TTR was founded in 2002. TIR licenses intellectual property that that lets fans

reserve face-value tickets to high-demand sporting events whose teams are yet to be
determined-college football bowl games, for example. Fans pay a fee for the right to reserve
these tickets. CEO Harmon has described TTR's business model as "monetizing anticipation" in
a world in which "people spend a lot more time anticipating stuff than actually doing stuff." 1
34.

Narayan has been on TTR's Board of Director's since at least 2003. He has also

amassed over three million shares of TTR stock. As a practical matter, however, he was TTR's
primary fundraiser. In that capacity, he raised as much as 90% ofTIR's investment capital.

As detailed below, between 2010 and early 2016, Narayan fraudulently directed

over $33 million in client funds to ITR. He knowingly or recklessly concealed material
information from his clients-including ITR's poor financial condition and the conflicts of
interest created by the finder's fees and his heavy involvement with ITR. In addition, with the
assistance of Harmon and Kaptrosky, he is engaged in a continuing scheme to conceal this illegal
activity.
A.

Narayan fraudulently directed millions in client funds to TTR while failing to

disclose material information.
36.

Between March 2010 and January 2016, Narayan directed at least 77 client

investments to ITR. These investments totaled more than $33 million. As detailed below,
Narayan directed that Client One, Client Two, and Client Three alone invest over $30 million.
The ITR investments were in securities-including long-term notes payable, stock, and stock
warrants.
37.

Narayan knowingly or recklessly misled or failed to inform his clients about a

number of material facts related to the ITR investments. He often failed to tell them that they
were investing at all. But even in the rare instances where Narayan's clients knew they were
investing, Narayan knowingly, recklessly, or unreasonably misled them or omitted material
information.

i.

Narayan failed to disclose that he received almost $2 million in finder's
fees.

38.

As TTR's internal records show, Narayan received a total of at least $1,848,000 in

finder's fees in exchange for directing over $33 million in client funds to TTR. He requestedand Harmon and Kaptrosky approved, paid, and tracked-these foes. These fees were often paid

to Narayan out of his clients' funds-as opposed to being invested in TIR's business.
Considering only the Client One, Client Two, and Client Three investments,

39.

Narayan received more $1.6 million in undisclosed fees in exchange for directing over $30
million to TIR, as follows:

40.

This arrangement was material- both because it created a conflict of interest and

because client funds were being misappropriated and sent to Narayan rather than used to build
TTR's business. Nonetheless, Narayan knowingly, recklessly, or unreasonably failed to disclose
it to his clients.

ii.

Narayan/ailed to disclose that he was a member ofITR's Board of
Directors and a major TTR shareholder.

41.

As noted above, Narayan has been on TTR's Board of Directors since at least

2003. Narayan was also a major TTR stockholder---0wning approximately 3 million shares of
stock. This arrangement presented an actual or apparent conflict of interest since Narayan was
also investing his clients' money in TTR.
42.

Narayan knowingly, recklessly, or unreasonably failed to disclose these conflicts

of interest to his clients. This information was material to Narayan's clients, as it would have
been to any reasonable investor.

Page 12 of 25 PageID 14

Narayan failed to disclose that ITR was a financially distressed company
and a high-risk investment.

43.

As the Narayan and the other Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing,

TTR is and has been in severe financial distress for years. TTR's financial statements for 201215 showed:

-$47, 129,702

44.

As they also knew or were reckless in not knowing, in both 2012 and 2013, the

company's external auditor issued an adverse opinion regarding TIR's ability to continue as a
going concern. This reflected the auditor's substantial doubt that TIR would be able to meet its
current and future financial obligations. Harmon himself may have summarized TIR's financial
condition best in a May 26, 2014 email to Narayan: "To be sure our revenue sucks. Our balance
sheet is a disaster."
45.

Only Narayan's ability to keep injecting investor funds into TIR kept it afloat. As

noted in TIR's 2012-13 financial statement notes, which Narayan, Harmon, and Kaptrosky saw:
Management has also provided correspondence from a shareholder/board member
[Narayan] who has a highly successful record of raising additional capital to fund
operations, that he will again raise the capital necessary to meet the Companies'
obligations. However, without a firm commitment for additional capital and firm
commitments from the debt holders of their intentions to forego payment within the next

Page 13 of 25 PageID 15

twelve months, there is substantial doubt if the Companies will be able to meet their
current and future obligations.
46.

Given its precarious financial position throughout the relevant period, investments

in TTR posed considerable risk to Narayan's clients. Yet Narayan knowingly, recklessly, or
unreasonably failed to inform them about this risk. This information was material to Narayan's
clients, as it would have been to any reasonable investor.

iv.

Narayan failed to disclose that the TTR investments violated RGT's
policies.

47.

Throughout the time Narayan was employed by RGT, RGT maintained a Code of

Ethics that describes the standards of conduct expected of all personnel. He agreed to comply
with it. The Code of Ethics required Narayan to: (1) place the interests of clients above RGT's
or any employee's interests; (2) disclose any activities that may create an actual or potential
conflict of interest; and (3) disclose all material facts conflicts of interest. He was also required
to obtain approval of RGT's Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") prior to engaging in any outside
business activity.
48.

Narayan violated the Code of Ethics by failing to disclose the TTR business

activity he was involved in. He further violated it by knowingly or recklessly failing to disclose
to his clients (or to RGT) the many conflicts of interests created by the TTR arrangement.
49.

Narayan knowingly, recklessly, or unreasonably failed to disclose his that he

violated RGT's Code of Ethics-including by investing their money in TTR. This information
was material to Narayan's clients, as it would have been to any reasonable investor.

v.
50.

Narayan violated his duties to his clients.

As noted above, as an investment adviser representative, Narayan was a fiduciary

with duties to his clients. He had a duty to act with the utmost good faith and to fully and fairly
Sec v. Narayan, et al.
Complaint

Page 13 of24

Case 3:16-cv-01417-M Document 2 Filed 05/24/16

disclose all material facts. He had a duty to disclose all actual and apparent conflicts of interest
and to put his clients' interests above his own. And he had a duty to provide suitable investment
advice.
51.

In addition to all of his deceptive conduct, Narayan violated each of these duties.

As detailed above, he consistently fai1ed to disclose material facts-including conflicts of
interest. He also placed his own interests above those of his clients.
52.

Finally, he heavily concentrated clients-including Client One, Client Two, and

Client Three- in investments in a high-risk, flailing, and debt-ridden private company. He did
this despite the fact that these investors had explicitly directed him to pursue low-risk investment
strategies-something he agreed to do. He also did this in spite of the fact that each of these
investors is unique in that, as a professional athlete, he has a very short earnings window. By
doing so, he violated his duty to provide suitable investment advice.

B.

Each of the Defendants was part of a scheme to defraud investors.

53.

The Defendants were part of a scheme to defraud investors. The scheme included

Narayan transferring client funds to TTR without their knowledge or consent-including using
forged or unauthorized signatures. It included the Defendants paying-and then trying to
obscure-the undisclosed finder's fees through the use of sham promissory notes. It included the
Defendants misappropriating investor funds to make Ponzi-like payments to prolong the scheme.
And it now includes the Defendants entering into an agreement under which Narayan is
redirecting fraud proceeds back to TTR to keep it afloat.

Narayan regularly transferred his clients' funds to TTR without their
knowledge or consent, often usingforged or unauthorized signatures.

54.

Narayan knowingly, recklessly, or unreasonably transferred client funds to TTR

without his clients' knowledge or consent. By doing this, Narayan abused his clients' trust and
the discretion they gave him to manage their investments. For example, he repeatedly did this
with investments he managed for Client One, Client Two, and Client Three. He had to do this,
since the TTR investments were very risky and inconsistent with the conservative strategies he
had agreed to pursue.
55.

In the rare instances where the investments were authorized, the client agreed

only to make a small investment. In Client One's case, he agreed in 2010 only to make a small
investment in TTR of no more than $300,000. After that, Narayan directed over $7 million to
TTR without Client One's consent.
56.

Client Three agreed to invest only $100,000. Instead, Narayan directed over $7

minion of Client Two's funds to TTR. Since learning about the unauthorized investments, Client
Three has confirmed that Narayan made the investments using signatures that were forged,
faked, obtained without his knowledge, or copied from other documents without his consent.
57.

Client Two never authorized a single TTR investment-and had never even heard

ofTTR until February 2016. It was at that time that Client One called Client Two to te11 him that
Narayan had been fired and that he had been making unauthorized investments in TTR. Client
Two has since confirmed that Narayan made unauthorized investments in TTR using signatures
that were forged, faked, or copied from other documents without CJient Two's consent.

Harmon, Kaptrosky, and TTR participated in the fraud scheme.

As noted above, although Narayan was on TIR's Board of Directors, in reality he

was TTR's chief fundraiser-raising as much as 90% ofITR's investment capital. With
Harmon's and Kaptrosky's knowledge and at their direction, Narayan was regularly paid finder's
fees-often using client funds. At least in part because Narayan never disclosed the finder's fees
to his clients, he, Harmon, and Kaptrosky knowingly or recklessly took affirmative steps to
conceal the payments.
59.

The Defendants knew that these payments were finder's fees. An October 2014 e-

mail from Harmon to Narayan and Kaptrosky describes these payments as "finder's fee[s]. The
11

same email notes that in order to make the payments appear "kosher," the men were careful that
they were not "'turning around' more than 10%" of the amounts received from Narayan's clients.
60.

A November 2014 email, from Harmon to Kaptrosky describes payments to

Narayan as "Ash money in/money out." And in January 2015, Harmon reiterated in an email to
Narayan and Kaptrosky that "[w]e have addressed the matter of% amount of net funds wired
back to [Narayan] before, and that number is 10%."
61 .

Ultimately, Harmon and Kaptrosky redirected to Narayan approximately 6% of

the funds Narayan's advisory clients invested in TTR. They did so knowingly, recklessly, or
unreasonably-because without investments from Narayan's investors, TTR would have had to
cease operations.
62.

The Defendants tried to conceal the true nature of the finder's fees. The TTR

Board-which consisted of Narayan, Harmon, and one other person-voted to pay Narayan $1
million as a "director's fee." During the SEC's investigation of this matter, Harmon testified that ·
Narayan was the only one who received director's fees, and that the fact that Narayan was the

Complaint

source of as much as 90% of TIR's capital was "certainly" a factor in him receiving fees. Thus,
the "director's fees" were nothing more than thinly-veiled finder's fees.
63.

At other times, however-including when it benefited Narayan by allowing him

to dodge taxes-the TTR payments to Narayan were no longer finder's fees or director's fees, but
"loans." This characterization had the additional effect of obscuring the finder's fees. The
"loans" began at least at early as 2011.
64.

At Narayan's and Harmon's direction and with their knowledge, Kaptrosky drafted

promissory notes to memorialize the sham loans. Each year, when Narayan had received
additional undisclosed fees-even after they exceed the $1 million "director's fee"-Narayan,
Harmon, and Kaptrosky simply drafted a new promissory note reflecting the fees paid to date.
These notes were sometimes backdated. All of the finder's fee payments were ulti_mately
characterized as $1,848,000 in loans to Narayan.
65.

In reality, the loans were a sham. As Narayan, Harmon, and Kaptrosky knew or

were reckless in not knowing, the loan documents were designed to conceal the true nature of the
payments to Narayan-both to hide the undisclosed finder's fees and to help Narayan avoid
taxes. At the very least, it was unreasonable for the Defendants to participate in this
arrangement.
66.

Narayan never made a single payment on the "loans" until early 2016-when he

had been dismissed by RGT and had become aware that he was being investigated by the SEC.
At that time, TTR and Narayan entered into an agreement purportedly requiring him to repay the
sham loans. The agreement includes a $1,000,000 setoff for the "director's fees." This
agreement is nothing more than an after-the-fact attempt to cover up the fraudulent conduct and
to keep TTR afloat now that the Narayan funding has dried up.

Narayan has made S350,000 in payments under the agreement. These funds are

being used to pay for TTR's ongoing expenses- including expenses and/or salaries for Harmon
and Kaptrosky. This arrangement is depleting the funds available for payments to defrauded
investors.
68.

The Defendants also made Ponzi-like payments in order to prolong the scheme.

In these transactions, the Defendants used new investments to pay off older investments. This
had the effect of concealing TTR's woeful financial condition and prolonging the scheme.
69.

Narayan knew of and directed the payments- which had his clients on each side

of the transactions. Examples of these payments include:
•

on August 7-8, 2014, a payment was made in which over $2.6 million in funds
from Client Two and another Narayan client were sent to Client One's wife;

•

on January 9-12, 2015, a payment was made in which $350,000 in funds from
Client Two were sent to Client Three;2 and

•

On January 26-27, 2016, a payment was made in which $2 million in funds from
Client Three were sent to Client One.

70.

In addition to orchestrating these transactions, Narayan knowingly, recklessly, or

unreasonably failed to disclose them to his clients-even though this was material information.
71.

Harmon and Kaptrosky also knowingly, recklessly, or unreasonably assisted in

these fraudulent payments. TTR internal documents- including contemporaneous emailsshow that each was aware of these transactions, approved them, and/or executed them.
72.

Finally, Harmon and Kaptrosky created and executed backdated documents in

connection with certain TTR transactions. In July 2014, Narayan directed Harmon and

2

Narayan also received $92,500 of these funds.

TTR investment. Among other things, the amended note extended the due date on the notesince Client One had not been repaid the millions TTR owed him. Kaptrosky followed
Narayan's direction-creating the backdated note, executlng it on TTR's behalf, and sending it to
Narayan for execution.
