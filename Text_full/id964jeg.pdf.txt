APPEARANCES:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

James E. Grimes, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registrations of Respondents’ registered securities due to
their failures to timely file required periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
INTRODUCTION
On January 7, 2016, the Commission initiated this proceeding under Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with an order instituting proceedings (OIP). The OIP alleges
that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission under Exchange Act Section
12(g) and have repeatedly failed to file timely periodic reports with the Commission, in violation
of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and/or 13a-13 thereunder. Respondents were
served with the OIP by January 13, 2016, and their answers were due by January 26, 2016.
China Holdings Grp., Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3570, 2016 SEC LEXIS 378 (ALJ
Feb. 2, 2016). On February 1, 2016, I held a telephonic prehearing conference at which
Respondents failed to appear. Id. On February 2, 2016, I ordered Respondents to show cause by
February 12, 2016, why the registrations of their securities should not be revoked by default due
to their failures to file answers, appear for the prehearing conference, or otherwise defend the

proceeding. Id. To date, none of the Respondents has filed an answer, responded to the show
cause order, or otherwise defended in this proceeding.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Respondents are in default for failing to file answers, attend the prehearing conference, or
otherwise defend the proceeding. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(1)-(2), .220(f), .221(f).
Accordingly, as authorized by Rule of Practice 155(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a), I find the
following allegations in the OIP to be true.
China Holdings Group, Inc., Central Index Key (CIK) No. 1076891, is a revoked Nevada
corporation located in Palm Desert, California, with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for
the period ended September 30, 2011, which reported a net loss of $63,202 from the company’s
April 28, 1994, inception to September 30, 2011.
Design Products, Inc., CIK No. 1045893, is a permanently revoked Nevada corporation
located in Las Vegas, Nevada, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant
to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-SB registration
statement on August 4, 1999.
Divia.com, Inc., CIK No. 1121165, is a permanently revoked Nevada corporation located
in Las Vegas, Nevada, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-QSB for the period
ended June 30, 2001, which reported a net loss of $3,500 from the company’s July 24, 2000,
inception to June 30, 2001.
Environmental Products & Technologies Corp. (a/k/a Enviro Products & Technologies
Corp.), CIK No. 1021710, is a Delaware corporation located in Westlake Village, California,
with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section
12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed
any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-QSB for the period ended March 31, 2001, which
reported a net loss of $6,445,048 from October 1, 1995, to March 31, 2001.
The Financial Group Connection, Inc. (a/k/a Financial Group Connection, Inc.), CIK No.
1057114, is a revoked Nevada corporation located in Carson City, Nevada, with a class of
securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The
company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic
reports since it filed a Form 10-KSB for the period ended December 31, 2000, which reported a
net loss of $26,662 from the company’s July 24, 1987, inception to December 31, 2000.
Four Peaks Group Inc., CIK No. 1101089, is a permanently revoked Nevada corporation
located in Palm Desert, California, with a class of securities registered with the Commission
2

pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with
the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-QSB for the
period ended June 30, 2001, which reported a net loss of $1,856 for the prior six months.
In addition to their repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, Respondents failed to
heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance
requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations, or, through their failures to maintain
valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not receive
such letters.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require public corporations to
file annual and quarterly reports with the Commission. “Compliance with those requirements is
mandatory and may not be subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice,
Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons.
denied, Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is
not required to establish violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
See SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250,
1268 (D.D.C. 1978). Respondents failed to file timely periodic reports. As a result,
Respondents failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
SANCTIONS
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an opportunity for hearing,
that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of the Exchange Act or
rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will ensure that investors are adequately
protected, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s
violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved,
the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and
the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
Respondents’ failures to file required periodic reports are serious because the failures
constitute violations of a central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic
reporting is “to supply investors with current and accurate financial information about an issuer
so that they may make sound [investment] decisions.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., 2006 SEC
LEXIS 1288, at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that Congress fashioned
for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the
sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977). Respondents’
violations are also recurrent in that they repeatedly failed to file periodic reports. See Nature’s
Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21,
2009) (respondent failed to file seven required periodic reports due over a two-year period);
Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26 (May
3

23, 2008) (respondent’s failure to make eight filings over an eighteen-month period considered
recurrent). Respondents are also culpable because they failed to heed delinquency letters sent to
them by the Division of Corporation Finance. See China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release
No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that revocation may
be warranted even without proof that a respondent was aware of its reporting obligations).
Finally, Respondents have not answered the OIP, responded to the show cause order, appeared at
the prehearing conference, or otherwise participated in the proceeding to address whether they
have made any efforts to remedy their past violations. They have also made no assurances
against further violations.
For these reasons, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to revoke
the registrations of each class of Respondents’ registered securities.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, under Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
registrations of each class of registered securities of Respondents China Holdings Group, Inc.,
Design Products, Inc., Divia.com, Inc., Environmental Products & Technologies Corp. (a/k/a
Enviro Products & Technologies Corp.), The Financial Group Connection, Inc. (a/k/a Financial
Group Connection, Inc.), and Four Peaks Group Inc. are REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, a party may file a petition
for review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of the initial decision. A
party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial
decision, pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of
fact is filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from
the date of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
This initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion
to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become
final as to that party.
A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at
any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall
be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
