ORDER DISMISSING UNTIMELY PETITION FOR REVIEW
On November 17, 2015, Jacob Keith Cooper filed a petition for review of an Initial
Decision finding that he violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws and
imposing sanctions. Because Cooper filed his petition more than two months after his appeal
period had expired, we dismiss it as untimely.
I.

Facts

On August 17, 2015, an administrative law judge issued an Initial Decision as to Cooper,
which ordered, among other things, that any petition for review be filed “within twenty-one days
after service of the Initial Decision.” 1 The following day, the SEC’s Office of the Secretary

served the Initial Decision by certified mail to three addresses on record for Cooper: (i) the
office of his attorney of record, Vincent J. Brown, Esq.; (ii) Cooper’s address in Washington,
Utah; and (iii) Cooper’s address in San Diego, California. All three mailings were returned to
the Commission. The mailings to Cooper’s attorney and Cooper’s Utah address were returned as
unclaimed, despite the fact that the U.S. Postal Service left notice of the mailing at each location
(as reflected by tracking information obtained from the Postal Service’s website). The Postal
Service returned the mailing to Cooper’s California address as undeliverable. In any event, in
his brief in support of his petition, Cooper stated that he received the Initial Decision from his
attorney on August 24, 2015.
On October 13, 2015, we issued an order titled “Notice that Initial Decision Has Become
Final” (“Finality Notice”). 2 The Finality Notice stated that the “time for filing a petition for
review in this proceeding has expired” and that “[n]o such petition has been filed by Jacob Keith
Cooper and the Commission has not chosen to review the decision on its own initiative.” The
Finality Notice stated that the Initial Decision had “become the final decision of the
Commission.”
On October 14, 2015, the SEC’s Office of the Secretary served the Finality Notice by
certified mail to Cooper at the same three addresses, and obtained a signed return receipt
confirming that the Finality Notice was received at Cooper’s Utah address on October 19, 2015.
On November 17, Cooper filed this petition for review of the Initial Decision.
After receiving Cooper’s petition, we issued an order directing Cooper and the Division
of Enforcement to submit briefs addressing “whether Cooper’s appeal should be dismissed as
untimely pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 410(b).”3 The parties submitted simultaneous
briefs. The Division argued that we should dismiss Cooper’s petition as untimely while Cooper
argued that we should allow his petition because his attorney was to blame for its untimeliness.
In its reply brief, “based on the representations in Cooper’s December 18, 2015 brief,” the
Division withdrew its opposition to Cooper’s untimely petition. As we explain below,
notwithstanding the Division’s position, we conclude it is appropriate to dismiss Cooper’s
petition.

Discussion

Rule 410(b) requires that a petition for review of an initial decision be filed “within such
time after service of the initial decision as prescribed by the hearing officer.”4 Here, the law
judge ordered that any petition be filed within 21 days after service of the Initial Decision.5
Under Rule 141(b), the SEC’s Office of the Secretary may serve orders or decisions of a
hearing officer by any method provided by Rule 141(a) or Rule 150(c)(1)-(3).6 Rule 150(c)(2)
provides for service by “[m]ailing the papers through the U.S. Postal Service by first class,
registered, or certified mail or Express Mail delivery addressed to the person.”7 The Office of
the Secretary served the Initial Decision by certified mail on August 18, 2015, to three addresses
of record for Cooper, as detailed above. Under Rule 150(d), “[s]ervice by mail is complete upon
mailing.”8 Thus, service was complete on August 18, 2015.9 Because the Initial Decision was
served by certified mail, we follow Rule 160(b) and add three days to the time provided in the
Initial Decision to file an appeal.10 Cooper, therefore, had 24 days from August 18, 2015 (the 21
days provided in the Initial Decision, plus the additional three days) to file a timely petition for
review, i.e., until September 11, 2015.11

Rule 150(d), 17 C.F.R. § 201.150(d). The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure similarly
permit the clerk of the court to serve notice of the entry of an order or judgment by “mailing
[papers] to the person’s last known address”; and provide that “service is complete upon
mailing.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(b)(2)(C), 77(d); see Rules of Practice, Exchange Act Release No.
35833, 1995 WL 368865, at *27 (June 9, 1995) (Rule 141 “is derived, in part, from Rules 4 and
5(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”).

We have previously stated that “a return receipt or other confirmation of delivery is not
required” for the service of orders subsequent to our service of the Order Instituting Proceedings.

party “on notice that there will be subsequent filings or other papers.” Id.

officer specifies a date certain for filing.”).
11

The Postal Service returned the August 18 certified mailings that were sent to Cooper and
Brown. But the fact that the mailings were returned does not have an effect on whether service
was completed. Cf. Anthony v. Marion Cty. Gen. Hosp., 617 F.2d 1164, 1168 n.5 (5th Cir. 1980)
(stating that service is complete upon mailing under FRCP 5(b) and that “refusal to accept mail
does not vitiate service”); 4B Wright & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 1148 (4th ed.) (“Since
[FRCP 5(b)(2)(C)] expressly directs that service is complete upon mailing, nonreceipt or

Cooper concedes that his petition was untimely. Despite the September 11 deadline to
file a petition for review, Cooper did not file his petition until November 17—more than two
months after the deadline. But Cooper asks that his failure to file timely be excused, pursuant to
Rule 420(b), the doctrine of equitable tolling, or Rule 100(c).
We find no merit in Cooper’s argument. First, Rule 420(b) contemplates an extension of
the appeal period upon a showing of “extraordinary circumstances,” but the provision applies
only to appeals from decisions by self-regulatory organizations, and Cooper’s appeal is from a
law judge’s initial decision.
Second, because Cooper has not shown “(1) that he has been pursuing his rights
diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely
filing,”12 he is not entitled to equitable tolling. We have previously explained that “[e]ven when
circumstances beyond the applicant’s control give rise to the [failure to file timely], however, an
applicant must also demonstrate that he or she promptly arranged for the filing of the appeal as
soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. An applicant whose application is delayed as a result
of extraordinary circumstances remains under an obligation to proceed promptly in pursuing
appellate recourse.”13
We are not persuaded that Cooper has been pursuing his right to appeal diligently or that
an extraordinary circumstance prevented him from timely filing an appeal. Cooper admits that
he received the Initial Decision from his lawyer on August 24. The Initial Decision stated that
Cooper had 21 days to file his petition; yet, the first time he indicated that he was challenging the
law judge’s decision was in mid-November, when he filed his petition.
Cooper claims that he was, in fact, trying to communicate with his attorney, who failed to
speak to him or return any of his messages. 14 Cooper argues that it was “only after the deadline

(…continued)

nonacceptance of the papers by the person to be served generally does not affect the validity of
service.”). In any event, Cooper stated in his brief in support of his petition that he received a
copy of the Initial Decision from Brown on August 24, 2015, which establishes that he had
actual notice of the Initial Decision by August 24. Even if we were to use that August 24 date as
the date of service, a timely petition for review should have been filed by September 14, 2015.

He provides no details about these various attempts to reach his lawyer, including when
he tried to contact Brown or about what topics. Importantly, Cooper does not indicate that his
attempts to contact Brown took place after he received the Initial Decision.

5
to file the petition for review was missed that I realized [Brown] was no longer acting as my
attorney.” But Cooper’s own statements demonstrate that he knew well before the deadline
passed that Brown was not acting as his attorney. Brown represented Cooper at the hearing in
this proceeding, which ended on April 2, 2015, and Cooper admitted that “[s]ince the hearing, I
have had virtually no success communicating with my attorney.” Cooper admitted that “I have
tried to reach Mr. Brown repeatedly and regularly following the hearing and following the
publication of the Initial Decision, but Mr. Brown has not responded to my requests. I have no
idea where he is located currently and have had no way of reaching him for many months.” In
other words, Cooper had been unable to communicate with Brown for approximately four and a
half months before the Initial Decision was issued on August 18. Cooper therefore was on notice
that Brown was no longer acting as his attorney and had time to arrange for other counsel prior to
the deadline for filing a petition for review.
After receiving the Initial Decision, which informed him about the deadline to file his
petition, Cooper alleges that he continued to reach out to Brown to no avail. Further, Brown
failed to appear on his behalf at scheduling conferences in a separate proceeding in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of California. Specifically, Brown failed to appear
at conferences scheduled for August 28, 2015, September 8 and 10, 2015, and October 13,
2015.15 Thereafter, on October 19, Cooper received the Finality Notice, which informed him
that the appeal period had expired and that the Initial Decision had become the final decision of
the Commission. Even after receiving the Finality Notice, Cooper waited 29 days to file his
petition—a period that alone exceeds the 21 days in which a party is required to file a petition
appealing an initial decision. Cooper fails to explain why he waited until mid-November to file a
petition, despite the fact that he failed to reach Brown after receiving the Initial Decision, and
received the Finality Notice on October 19. The record does not reflect that at any time prior to
the filing of his December 8 brief, Cooper reached out to the Commission to suggest that he was
attempting to contact his attorney without success. Cooper only did so in response to the
Commission’s order seeking briefing.
This course of events leads us to conclude both that Cooper was not pursuing his appeal
rights diligently and that he was not prevented from timely filing by some extraordinary
circumstance. Cooper could have, after the multiple instances of non-communication, sought
new counsel to represent him on appeal or sought an extension of time to file a petition.16
Indeed, Cooper had previously hired new counsel in this case four separate times. 17 Cooper also,
15

Brown was sanctioned by the district court judge for failing to appear. See Order
Sanctioning Attorney Vincent J. Brown, SEC v. Total Wealth Management, Inc., No. 3:15-cv226 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 6, 2015).

See e.g., Choice Hotels Intern., Inc. v. Grover, 792 F.3d 753, 756 (7th Cir. 2015)

protect their own interests by hiring someone else.”).

at any time, could have filed a petition himself within the appeal period (as he ultimately did on
November 17, more than two months after the appeal period had run). Cooper therefore is not
entitled to equitable tolling.
Third, for the same reasons as to equitable tolling, Cooper’s failure to timely file is not
excused under Rule 100(c).18 That Rule allows us to direct the use of alternative procedures or
order that compliance with an otherwise applicable rule is unnecessary if it would serve the
interests of justice and would not result in prejudice to the parties to the proceeding. 19 We find
that it is not in the interests of justice to extend the deadline for filing a petition for review or
allow Cooper to file an untimely petition for review given his failure to diligently pursue his
appeal.20
Finally, our conclusion is informed by the need for finality in agency proceedings.
Compliance with filing deadlines “encourages parties to act timely in seeking relief” 21 and
permits persons to know “when decisions are final and on which decisions their reliance can be
placed.”22
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the petition for review of Jacob Keith Cooper is
dismissed as untimely.
By the Commission.
