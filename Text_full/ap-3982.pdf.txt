The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
on June 23, 2016, alleging that Respondent has a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has failed to
file required periodic reports. On July 12, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration,
establishing that Respondent was served with the OIP on June 28, 2016, in accordance with
Commission Rule of Practice 141(a)(2)(iv). 1 See 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii), (iv).
Respondent’s answer was due by July 11, 2016, but no answer has been filed. See OIP at 2; 17
C.F.R. §§ 201.160(b), .220(b).
I ORDER a telephonic prehearing conference for July 21, 2016, at 4:00 p.m. EDT.
Respondent is on notice that it is required to file an answer, appear at the prehearing conference,
or otherwise defend the proceeding, and if it fails to do so, I will deem it in default, determine
that the allegations in the OIP are true, and revoke the registration of its securities. OIP at 2-3;
17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f).
