[Release No. 34-78961; File No. S7-03-14]
RIN 3235-AL48
Standards for Covered Clearing Agencies
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”) is adopting
amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and adding new Rule 17Ab2-2 pursuant to Section 17A of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and the Payment, Clearing, and Settlement
Supervision Act of 2010 (“Clearing Supervision Act”), enacted in Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”). Among other
things, the rules establish enhanced standards for the operation and governance of those clearing
agencies registered with the Commission (“registered clearing agencies”) that meet the
definition of “covered clearing agency.”
DATES: Effective date: December 12, 2016.
Compliance date: April 11, 2017.
The compliance date is discussed in Part II.G below.

of Trading and Markets, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington,
DC 20549-7010, at (202) 551-5710.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission is amending Rule 17Ad-22 by
adding new Rule 17Ad-22(e) to establish requirements for the operation and governance of
registered clearing agencies that meet the definition of a “covered clearing agency.” A covered
clearing agency includes a registered clearing agency that (i) has been designated as systemically
important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) and for which the Commission
is the supervisory agency under the Clearing Supervision Act (“designated clearing agency”), or
(ii) provides central counterparty (“CCP”) services for security-based swaps or is involved in
activities the Commission determines to have a more complex risk profile (“complex risk profile
clearing agency”), unless the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) is the
supervisory agency under the Clearing Supervision Act.
To facilitate the addition of new Rule 17Ad-22(e), the Commission is amending existing
Rule 17Ad-22(d) to limit its application to clearing agencies other than covered clearing agencies
and revising Rule 17Ad-22(a) to add 14 new definitions. The Commission is also adopting new
Rule 17Ad-22(f) to codify the Commission’s statutory authority under Section 807(c) of the
Clearing Supervision Act and new Rule 17Ab2-2 to establish procedures for making
determinations regarding covered clearing agencies in certain defined circumstances, described
further below.
In developing these rules, Commission staff has consulted with the FSOC, CFTC, and
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”). The Commission has also
considered the relevant international standards as required by Section 805(a)(2)(A) of the

2

Clearing Supervision Act. 1 The relevant international standards for designated clearing agencies
and complex risk profile clearing agencies are the Principles for Financial Market
Infrastructures (“PFMI”). 2

I. Introduction
A. Regulatory Framework
Below is an overview of the regulatory requirements for registered clearing agencies that
relate to the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and new Rule 17Ab2-2 as set forth under the
Exchange Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and Commission rules and regulations thereunder.
1. Exchange Act
Section 17A of the Exchange Act directs the Commission to facilitate the establishment
of (i) a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions and (ii) linked or coordinated facilities for clearance and settlement of securities
transactions. 3 In facilitating the establishment of the national clearance and settlement system,

3

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(a)(2); see also Report of the Senate Committee on Banking,
Housing & Urban Affairs, S. Rep. No. 94-75, at 4 (1975) (urging that “[t]he Committee believes
the banking and security industries must move quickly toward the establishment of a fully
7

the Commission must have due regard for the public interest, the protection of investors, the
safeguarding of securities and funds, and maintenance of fair competition among brokers and
dealers, clearing agencies, and transfer agents. 4
As discussed in the Standards for Covered Clearing Agencies proposing release (“CCA
Standards proposing release”), 5 clearing agencies are broadly defined in the Exchange Act and
undertake a variety of functions. 6 Under Section 17A and Rule 17Ab2-1, 7 an entity that meets
the definition of a clearing agency is required to register with the Commission or obtain from the
Commission an exemption from registration prior to performing the functions of a clearing
agency. To grant registration to a clearing agency, the Exchange Act requires the Commission to
determine that the rules and operations of the applicant clearing agency meet the standards set
forth in Section 17A. 8 Specifically, Section 17A(b)(3) provides that a clearing agency shall not
be registered unless the Commission determines that the clearing agency’s rules are consistent
with the Exchange Act. In so doing, the Commission must determine that, among other things,
integrated national system for the prompt and accurate processing and settlement of securities
transactions”).

corrected at 79 FR 29507, 29510–11 (May 22, 2014); see also Exchange Act Release No. 3468080 (Oct. 22, 2012), 77 FR 66219, 66221–22 (Nov. 2, 2012) (discussing the same) (“Clearing
Agency Standards adopting release”).

See 17 CFR 240.17Ab2-1.

8

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(A) through(I) (identifying nine determinations that the
Commission must make regarding the rules and structure of a clearing agency to grant
registration). In 1980, the Commission published a statement of the views and positions of
Commission staff regarding the requirements of Section 17A. See Exchange Act Release No.
16900 (June 17, 1980), 45 FR 41920 (June 23, 1980).

(i) the clearing agency is so organized and has the capacity to be able to facilitate the prompt and
accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to safeguard securities or funds
in its custody or control, (ii) the rules of the clearing agency assure a fair representation of its
members and participants in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs, (iii) the
rules of the clearing agency provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues and fees, and
(iv) the rules of the clearing agency are designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transactions. 9
Following registration, the Commission supervises registered clearing agencies using
various tools. One of these tools is Rule 17a-1 under the Exchange Act, which requires every
registered clearing agency to keep and preserve at least one copy of all documents, including all
correspondence, memoranda, papers, books, notices, accounts, and other such records as shall be
made or received by it in the course of its business as such and in the conduct of its selfregulatory activity for a period not less than five years and, upon request of any representative of
the Commission, to promptly furnish to the possession of such representative copies of any such
documents required to be kept. 10 Another of these tools is the rule filing process for selfregulatory organizations (“SROs”), 11 set forth in Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act and rules
and regulations thereunder. A registered clearing agency is required to file with the Commission
any proposed rule or proposed change in, addition to, or deletion from the registered clearing

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(A), (C), (D), (F).

See 17 CFR 240.17a-1(a) through (c); see also 15 U.S.C. 78q(a)(1), (2).

Upon registration, registered clearing agencies are SROs under Section 3(a)(26) of the
Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26).

agency’s rules. 12 The Commission publishes all proposed rule changes for comment and reviews
them. Proposed rule changes are generally required to be approved by the Commission prior to
going into effect; however, certain types of proposed rule changes take effect upon filing with
the Commission. 13 When reviewing a proposed rule change, the Commission considers the
submissions of the clearing agency together with any comments received on the proposed rule
change in making a determination of whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the
requirements of the Exchange Act. In addition, Section 17A of the Exchange Act further
provides the Commission with authority to adopt rules as necessary or appropriate in the public
interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the
Exchange Act and prohibits a clearing agency from engaging in any activity in contravention of
such rules and regulations. 14
In addition, Commission staff conducts examinations of registered clearing agencies to
assess, among other things, existing and emerging risks, compliance with applicable statutory
and regulatory requirements, and a clearing agency’s oversight of compliance by its participants
with its rules. Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act provides the Commission with authority to
initiate and conduct investigations to determine if there have been violations of the federal

12

An SRO must submit proposed rule changes to the Commission for review and approval
pursuant to Rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act. A stated policy, practice, or interpretation of an
SRO, such as its written policies and procedures, would generally be deemed to be a proposed
rule change. See 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1); 17 CFR 240.19b-4.
13

See 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A) (setting forth the types of proposed rule changes that take
effect upon filing with the Commission). The Commission may temporarily suspend those rule
changes within 60 days of filing and institute proceedings to determine whether to approve or
disapprove the rule changes. See 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(C).
14

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(d).

securities laws. 15 Section 19(h) of the Exchange Act also provides the Commission with
authority to institute civil actions seeking injunctive and other equitable remedies and/or
administrative proceedings arising out of such investigations. 16
2. Dodd-Frank Act
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act provides the Commission with authority to regulate
certain over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives. Specifically, Title VII added provisions to the
Exchange Act that (i) require entities performing the functions of a clearing agency with respect
to security-based swaps (“security-based swap clearing agencies”) to register with the
Commission, and (ii) direct the Commission to adopt rules with respect to security-based swap
clearing agencies. 17
The Clearing Supervision Act, enacted in Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act, provides for
the enhanced regulation of certain financial market utilities (“FMUs”). 18 FMUs include clearing
agencies that manage or operate a multilateral system for the purpose of transferring, clearing, or
settling payments, securities, or other financial transactions among financial institutions or

15

See 15 U.S.C. 78u(a).

16

See 15 U.S.C. 78s(h).

17

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(i), (j); Dodd-Frank Act, Sec. 763(b), 124 Stat. at 1768–69 (adding
paragraphs (i) and (j) to Section 17A of the Exchange Act).
18

The objectives and principles for the risk management standards prescribed under the
Clearing Supervision Act shall be to (i) promote robust risk management; (ii) promote safety and
soundness; (iii) reduce systemic risks; and (iv) support the stability of the broader financial
system. Further, the Clearing Supervision Act states that the standards may address areas such
as risk management policies and procedures; margin and collateral requirements; participant or
counterparty default policies and procedures; the ability to complete timely clearing and
settlement of financial transactions; capital and financial resources requirements for designated
FMUs; and other areas that are necessary to achieve the objectives and principles described
above. See 12 U.S.C. 5464(b), (c).

11

between financial institutions and the FMU. 19 FSOC has designated certain FMUs as
systemically important or likely to become systemically important (“SIFMUs”). 20 SIFMUs are
required to file 60-days advance notice of changes to rules, procedures, and operations that could
materially affect the nature or level of risk presented by the SIFMU (“advance notice”). 21 The
Clearing Supervision Act authorizes the Commission to object to changes proposed in such an
advance notice, which would prevent the clearing agency from implementing the change. 22 The
19

See 12 U.S.C. 5462(6). The definition of “financial market utility” in Section 803(6) of
the Clearing Supervision Act contains a number of exclusions that include, but are not limited to,
certain designated contract markets, registered futures associations, swap data repositories, swap
execution facilities, national securities exchanges, national securities associations, alternative
trading systems, security-based swap data repositories, security-based swap execution facilities,
brokers, dealers, transfer agents, investment companies, and futures commission merchants. See
12 U.S.C. 5462(6)(B).
20

See 12 U.S.C. 5463. An FMU is systemically important if the failure of or a disruption to
the functioning of such FMU could create or increase the risk of significant liquidity or credit
problems spreading among financial institutions or markets and thereby threaten the stability of
the U.S. financial system. See 12 U.S.C. 5462(9). On July 18, 2012, the FSOC designated as
systemically important the following then-registered clearing agencies: CME Group (“CME”),
The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”), ICE
Clear Credit (“ICC”), National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”), and The Options
Clearing Corporation (“OCC”).
The Commission is the supervisory agency for DTC, FICC, NSCC, and OCC, and the
CFTC is the supervisory agency for CME and ICE. The Commission jointly regulates ICC and
OCC with the CFTC. The Commission also jointly regulates ICE Clear Europe (“ICEEU”),
which has not been designated as systemically important by FSOC, with the CFTC and Bank of
England.
The Commission also jointly regulated CME with the CFTC until 2015, when the
Commission published an order approving CME’s request to withdraw from registration as a
clearing agency. See Exchange Act Release No. 34-76678 (Dec. 17, 2015), 80 FR 79983 (Dec.
23, 2015).
21

See 12 U.S.C. 5465(e)(1)(A); 17 CFR 240.19b-4(n). The Commission published a final
rule concerning the filing of advance notices for designated clearing agencies in 2012. See
Exchange Act Release No. 34-67286 (June 28, 2012), 77 FR 41602 (July 13, 2012).
22

See 12 U.S.C. 5465(e).

12

Clearing Supervision Act also provides for enhanced coordination between the Commission and
FRB by allowing for regular on-site examinations and information sharing. 23 The Clearing
Supervision Act further provides that the Commission and CFTC shall coordinate with the FRB
to jointly develop risk management supervision programs for SIFMUs. 24 In addition, the
Clearing Supervision Act provides that the Commission and CFTC may each prescribe risk
management standards governing the operations related to payment, clearing, and settlement
activities (“PCS activities”) of SIFMUs for which each is the supervisory agency, in consultation
with the FSOC and FRB and taking into consideration relevant international standards and
existing prudential requirements. 25
3. Rule 17Ad-22
In 2012, the Commission adopted Rule 17Ad-22 under the Exchange Act to strengthen
the substantive regulation of registered clearing agencies, promote the safe and reliable operation
of registered clearing agencies, and improve efficiency, transparency, and access to registered
clearing agencies. 26 At that time, the Commission noted that the implementation of Rule 17Ad22 would be an important first step in developing the regulatory changes contemplated by Titles

23

See 12 U.S.C. 5466.

24

See 12 U.S.C. 5472; see also Risk Management Supervision of Designated Clearing
Entities (July 2011), available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/otherreports/files/risk-management-supervision-report-201107.pdf (describing the joint supervisory
framework of the Commission, CFTC, and FRB).
25

See 12 U.S.C. 5464(a)(2). The Commission notes that, under Rule 17Ad-22(a)(6), a
SIFMU for which the Commission is the supervisory agency is a “designated clearing agency.”
See infra note 134 and accompanying text.
26

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29513; see also 17 CFR
240.17Ad-22; Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 5, at 66225–26.

13

VII and VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act. 27 In this regard, Rule 17Ad-22(b) established certain
requirements for clearing agencies that provide CCP services, and Rule 17Ad-22(d) established
requirements for the operation and governance of all registered clearing agencies. 28
The requirements in Rule 17Ad-22 help guide Commission determinations, when
considering an application to register as a clearing agency, that the rules and operations of the
applicant clearing agency satisfy the requirements in Section 17A of the Exchange Act. 29
Today’s amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 build on the existing framework for registered clearing
agencies by establishing new requirements for designated clearing agencies, complex risk profile
clearing agencies unless the CFTC is the supervisory agency, and, pursuant to Rule 17Ab2-2,
any other clearing agencies determined by the Commission to be covered clearing agencies.
4. Regulation SCI
In 2014, the Commission adopted Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity
(“Regulation SCI”) to strengthen the technology infrastructure of the U.S. securities markets. 30
In particular, the Commission notes that Regulation SCI is designed to reduce the occurrence of
systems issues, improve resiliency when systems problems do occur, and enhance the
Commission’s oversight and enforcement of securities market technology infrastructure. Since
adoption of Regulation SCI, the Commission has established a monitoring and examination
structure to oversee compliance with Regulation SCI.

27

See Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 5, at 66224–25.

28

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b), (d).

29

See supra notes 8–9 and accompanying text.

30

See Exchange Act Release No. 34-73639 (Nov. 19, 2014), 79 FR 72252 (Dec. 5, 2014)
(“Regulation SCI adopting release”).

14

Regulation SCI applies to “SCI entities,” a term which includes SROs such as registered
clearing agencies. 31 It requires SCI entities to, among other things, maintain policies and
procedures reasonably designed to ensure that certain systems have levels of capacity, integrity,
resiliency, availability, and security adequate to maintain their operational capability and
promote the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, and that they operate in a manner that
complies with the Exchange Act as well as their own rules. 32 Certain SCI systems that are
“critical SCI systems” are held to heightened requirements under Regulation SCI, 33 including a
requirement to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed, among other things, to include a two-hour resumption goal following a wide-scale
disruption, 34 and broader dissemination obligations for “major SCI events.” 35 The definition of
critical SCI systems in Regulation SCI was designed to cover “those SCI systems whose
functions are critical to the operation of the markets, including those systems that represent
potential single points of failure in the securities markets.” 36 Regulation SCI requires SCI
entities to take certain corrective actions when “SCI events” occur. Regulation SCI defines SCI
events to include an event in an SCI entity’s SCI systems that disrupts, or significantly degrades,
the normal operation of an SCI system. In the Regulation SCI adopting release, the Commission

15

explained its view that for clearance and settlement systems a return to “normal operations”
following a systems disruption would include all steps necessary to effectuate timely and
accurate end of day settlement. 37
5. Relevant International Standards
When prescribing regulations that contain risk management standards for designated
clearing agencies, Section 805(a) of the Clearing Supervision Act requires the Commission to
consider the relevant international standards and existing prudential requirements. 38 As
previously noted, the PFMI is the relevant international standard for systemically important
financial market infrastructures, such as covered clearing agencies. 39 The PFMI sets forth
twenty-four principles, each of which includes a headline standard and a list of key
considerations that further explain the headline standard. Accompanying explanatory notes

37

See id. at 72285 n.395.

38

See 12 U.S.C. 5464(a)(2); see also supra note 25 and accompanying text.

See supra note 2 and accompanying text. The PFMI defines a “financial market
infrastructure” (“FMI”) as a multilateral system among participating institutions, including the
operator of the system, used for the purposes of clearing, settling, or recording payments,
securities, derivatives, or other financial transactions. See PFMI, supra note 2, at 7. FMIs
include CCPs, central securities depositories (“CSDs”), securities settlement systems (“SSSs”),
and trade repositories (“TRs”). Cf. 12 U.S.C. 5462(6)(B) (defining “financial market utility”
under the Clearing Supervision Act). The PFMI presumes that all CSDs, SSSs, CCPs, and TRs
are systemically important in their home jurisdiction. See PFMI, supra note 2, at 131 & n.177
(noting the “presumption . . . that all CSDs, SSSs, CCPs, and TRs are systemically important
because of their critical roles in the markets they serve,” but also noting that ultimately “national
law will dictate the criteria to determine whether an FMI is systemically important”).
The Commission notes that the PFMI’s definition of “financial market infrastructure” is
consistent with the Commission’s prior use of the term. See Study of Unsafe and Unsound
Practices of Brokers and Dealers, H.R. Doc. No. 231, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1971) (defining
“financial market infrastructure” as a multilateral system among participating institutions,
including the operator of the system, used for the purposes of clearing, settling, or recording
payments, securities, derivatives, or other financial transactions).

further discuss the objectives of and rationales for the standards, as well as provide guidance on
how the standard can be implemented. 40
Commission staff co-chaired the working group within CPSS-IOSCO that drafted both
the consultative and final versions of the PFMI, 41 and the Commission believes that the
requirements applicable to clearing agencies set forth in the Exchange Act and the rules
thereunder, including the rules adopted today, are consistent with the standards set forth in the
PFMI. 42 Regulatory authorities around the world are in various stages of updating their
regulatory regimes to adopt measures consistent with the PFMI. 43 The rules set forth below are a
continuation of the Commission’s active effort to foster the development of the national
clearance and settlement system, consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act, and
enhance the regulation and supervision of SIFMUs, consistent with the Clearing Supervision
Act.

CPMI-IOSCO has also published subsequent guidance relevant to implementation of the
PFMI. See PFMI: Disclosure framework and Assessment methodology (Dec. 2012), available at

1 assessment report (June 2016), available at http://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d145.pdf (describing
efforts by various jurisdictions to adopt standards for FMIs consistent with the PFMI). Both the
CFTC and FRB have indicated publicly that they have completed all measures necessary to
incorporate fully the PFMI into their regulatory frameworks. See id. at 35.

17

In addition, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) has finalized an
updated capital framework that sets standards for capital charges arising from bank exposures to
CCPs related to OTC derivatives, exchange-traded derivatives, and securities financing
transactions. 44 Among other things, the BCBS capital framework includes lower capital charges
for exposures to a qualifying CCP (“QCCP”) that is subject to a regulatory framework consistent
with the PFMI. The availability of QCCP status for certain covered clearing agencies with bank
clearing members would have implications for the capital charges applicable to those members. 45
6. Recognition and Equivalence within the EU
The Commission is aware of recent public attention on the availability of QCCP status
under EU capital requirements for certain covered clearing agencies that operate in the United
States and have bank clearing members affiliated with a European Union (“EU”) entity. 46

44

See BCBS, Capital requirements for bank exposures to central counterparties (Apr.
2014), available at http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs282.pdf (“BCBS capital framework”). See
generally Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems
(rev. June 2011), available at http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs189.pdf (describing the Basel III
framework, which preceded the BCBS capital framework).
45

See infra Part III.A.1.b (further discussing the BCBS capital framework). The FRB and
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have adopted rules implementing the material
elements of the BCBS interim framework for capitalization of bank exposures to CCPs. See
Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Implementation of Basel III, Capital Adequacy,
Transition Provisions, Prompt Corrective Action, Standardized Approach for Risk-weighted
Assets, Market Discipline and Disclosure Requirements, Advanced Approaches Risk-Based
Capital Rule, and Market Risk Capital Rule, 76 FR 62017, 62099 (Oct. 11, 2013) (“Regulatory
Capital Rules”). In doing so, the FRB noted the ongoing international discussions on the topic
and stated that it intends to revisit its rules once the BCBS capital framework is revised. See id.
The FRB and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s rules define “QCCP” to mean,
among other things, a SIFMU under the Clearing Supervision Act. See 12 CFR 217.2; see also
Regulatory Capital Rules, supra, at 62100.
46

See, e.g., Fiona Maxwell, EU members of U.S. options CCP face $30 billion capital hit:
OCC fears approval will be held up by absence of SEC clearing rules, Risk.net, Nov. 30, 2015,

18

Specifically, the Commission understands that availability of QCCP status in the EU for a U.S.
CCP hinges on the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) recognizing the U.S.
CCP pursuant to the requirements of the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”).
Recognition by ESMA, in turn, is subject to the European Commission (“EC”) first making
certain findings regarding the Commission’s regulatory regime for CCPs. 47 Recognition by
ESMA would result in QCCP status for those U.S. CCPs for purposes of the EU’s capital
requirements, allowing EU-based clearing members of U.S. CCPs to continue to operate and
provide clearing services to market participants based in the EU. Under the EU’s capital
requirements regulation, EU banks and their subsidiaries will incur higher capital charges if they
clear through a U.S. CCP not afforded QCCP status in the EU, that is, a CCP not recognized or
authorized by ESMA. 48

regulation could leave 18 European banks facing an estimated $30 billion jump in capital
requirements, and limit access to equity options listed in the [United States] . . . . The potential
capital hit for OCC members is a consequence of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR),
which states that European banks—whether acting through their branch or subsidiary—will only
be given a 2% risk weight for cleared trades if using a so-called qualifying CCP following
expiration of the current extended grandfathering period. Clearing at a non-QCCP can translate
to risk weights of more than 1250%.”).
47

On March 16, 2016, the EC issued an equivalence decision stating that the CFTC’s
regulatory framework for CCPs is equivalent to EU requirements. See Commission
Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/377 of 15 March 2016 on the equivalence of the regulatory
framework of the United States of America for central counterparties that are authorised and
supervised by the CFTC to the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European
Parliament and of the Council, available at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016D0377.
48

Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and
investment firms. As noted earlier, although the United States affords QCCP status to SIFMUs,
QCCP status in the EU is distinct from the U.S. banking regulators’ determination that any FMU
designated as systemically important by FSOC is a U.S. QCCP.

19

As an initial matter, the Commission understands that, for the EC to make an equivalence
decision, Article 25(6) of the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) requires the
EC to determine that
the legal and supervisory arrangements of a third country ensure
that CCPs authorised in that third country comply with legally
binding requirements which are equivalent to the requirements laid
down in [EMIR], that those CCPs are subject to effective
supervision and enforcement in that third country on an ongoing
basis and that the legal framework of that third country provides
for an effective equivalent system for the recognition of CCPs
authorised under third-country legal regimes. 49
The Commission understands that its adoption of new Rule 17Ad-22(e) could be relevant to the
EC’s ongoing consideration of the Commission’s regulatory regime for CCPs. 50 Further, with
respect to EMIR’s requirement that the legal and supervisory regime of the United States include
an “effective equivalent system” for the recognition of CCPs authorized under non-U.S. legal
regimes, the Commission notes the following. 51
First, the Commission observes that, in certain specific contexts, it is not unfamiliar with
the EMIR regime given that one registered clearing agency, ICEEU, is subject to EMIR and will
be a covered clearing agency pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(a)(5). 52 As previously discussed, each
registered clearing agency is an SRO subject to Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act, which

Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories,

As noted above, ICEEU is also regulated by the Bank of England. See supra note 20.

20

requires SROs to submit proposed rule changes to the Commission for public comment and
Commission review and approval. 53 In the course of its regulation of ICEEU as a registered
clearing agency, the Commission has published, reviewed, and approved under the Exchange
Act a number of proposed rule changes submitted by ICEEU under Rule 19b-4 that, based on the
information and representations made by ICEEU at the time, were intended to facilitate ICEEU’s
efforts to comply with EMIR. These proposed rule changes covered such areas as (i) segregation
and portability of customer positions and margin, (ii) risk modeling, (iii) back testing, (iv) stress
testing, (v) default management, and (vi) liquidity risk management. 54
Further, the Commission observes that the Exchange Act and Commission rules require
that CCPs register with the Commission in certain circumstances, and if registered, must comply
with the relevant U.S. requirements, including the Commission rules applicable to registered
clearing agencies. The Commission also observes that the registration and supervisory
framework for clearing agencies under the Exchange Act provides the Commission with broad
authority to provide exemptive relief from certain of the Commission’s regulatory requirements
under the Exchange Act. Specifically, Section 17A(b)(1) of the Exchange Act provides the
Commission with authority to exempt a clearing agency or any class of clearing agencies from
any provision of Section 17A or the rules or regulations thereunder. Such an exemption may be
effected by rule or order, upon the Commission’s own motion or upon application, and

conditionally or unconditionally. 55 The Commission’s exercise of authority to grant exemptive
relief must be consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, and the purposes of
Section 17A, including the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions and the safeguarding of securities and funds. 56
The outcome of any exemptive request by the Commission (including, potentially, any
exemptions from requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)) is dependent on a number of elements.
For example, the Commission has used its authority under Section 17A(b)(1) of the Exchange
Act to grant exemptions to certain non-U.S. clearing agencies. These exemptions have been
tailored in each instance to the exemptive applicants’ contemplated clearing agency activities. In
certain instances, non-U.S. clearing agencies have received exemptive relief from the registration
requirement under Section 17A(b)(1) to perform the functions of a clearing agency with respect
to transactions involving U.S. government and agency securities for U.S. participants. 57 Factors

55

To apply with the Commission for an exemption under Section 17A(b)(1), the applicant
must complete and file a Form CA-1. In this context, an applicant must attach to its Form CA-1,
along with the other customary exhibits, an Exhibit S. The Exhibit S is a statement by the
applicant demonstrating why the granting of an exemption would be consistent with the public
interest, the protection of investors and the purposes of Section 17A of the Exchange Act,
including the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and the
safeguarding of securities and funds.
56

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(1).

57

See Exchange Act Release No. 34-39643 (Feb. 11, 1998), 63 FR 8232 (Feb. 18, 1998), as
modified by Exchange Act Release No. 34-43775 (Dec. 28, 2000), 66 FR 819 (Jan. 4, 2001);
Exchange Act Release No. 34-38328 (Feb. 24, 1997), 62 FR 9225 (Feb. 28, 1997).
In the case of matching service providers, the Commission first sought comment on
providing exemptive relief before considering any application for exemptive relief. See
Exchange Act Release No. 34-39829 (Apr. 6, 1998), 63 FR 17943 (Apr. 13, 1998) (“Even
though matching services fall within the definition of clearing agency, the Commission
preliminarily is of the view that an entity that limits its clearing agency functions to providing
matching services need not be subject to the full panoply of clearing agency regulation.”). The
Commission then engaged a close analysis of the attendant facts and circumstances of each
22

the Commission has considered when determining whether to grant an exemption have included
the anticipated level or volume of activity that the applicant seeks to effect within the United
States. Generally, the particular system of supervision and oversight in a jurisdiction may also
be factors for the Commission to consider in evaluating any non-U.S. framework.
Other factors the Commission could consider in exercising its exemptive authority could
include: the structure of, scope of, and requirements under the regulatory regime to which the
applicant is subject in its home jurisdiction; the extent to which the presence of said regime is
relevant to the findings the Commission must make in considering an exemption under Section
17A(b)(1) of the Exchange Act, and the nature of the non-U.S. covered clearing agency’s
activities. Such factors, depending on the attendant facts and circumstances, could lead the
Commission to determine that the full scope of the requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e) need not
be applied to a non-U.S. clearing agency to achieve the Commission’s regulatory objectives.
The Commission also notes that where it has exercised its exemptive authority under
Section 17A(b)(1) of the Exchange Act, the Commission and the relevant national competent
authority (“NCA”) of the non-U.S. clearing agency have entered into cooperative arrangements
whereby the Commission and the NCA have arranged to communicate and cooperate to fulfill
their respective regulatory mandates. 58 For the purposes of the discussion immediately above,

applicant for an exemption from registration as a clearing agency on a case-by-case basis. See,
e.g., Exchange Act Release No. 34-44188 (Apr. 17, 2001), 66 FR 20494 (Apr. 23, 2001) (order
granting exemption from registration as a clearing agency to Global Joint Venture Matching
Services – US, LLC, now Omgeo).
58

See, e.g., Understanding regarding an Application of Euroclear Bank for an Exemption
under U.S. Federal Securities Laws (Jan. 30, 2001), available at
https://www.nbb.be/doc/cp/nl/aboutcbfa/mou/pdf/mou_2001-01-30_euroclearbank.pdf;
Exchange Act Release No. 34-37309 (June 12, 1996) (notice of filing of application for
exemption from registration as a clearing agency by Cedel Bank); see also Undertaking on
Consultation and Cooperation regarding Belgian Firms that are Members of U.S. Clearing
23

such cooperation could also be useful in streamlining the Commission’s consideration and
analysis of an application for registration or an exemption from any provision of Section 17A of
the Exchange Act or the rules or regulations thereunder by a non-U.S. clearing agency. For
example, in the case of a non-U.S. clearing agency that is seeking to register or seeking an
exemption with the Commission and is already subject to EMIR, the Commission could look to
coordinate with the applicant’s NCA for the purposes of analyzing and evaluating any materials
the applicant might submit as part of the Form CA-1, including the documentation generated in
the course of the NCA’s EMIR authorization process for the applicant, and any self-assessment
an applicant might produce to evidence its analysis of potential duplication between EMIR
requirements and Commission requirements for registered clearing agencies. Such cooperative
arrangements could be useful not only for the registration or exemption process but also ongoing
coordinated or joint supervisory matters between the Commission and the NCA. However, as
previously noted, additional careful analysis would need to be performed by the Commission on
a case-by-case basis before the Commission could be willing to determine whether such
cooperative arrangements would be appropriate.
B. Summary of the Commission’s Proposal
The Commission is adopting Rules 17Ad-22(e) and (f) and amendments to Rules 17Ad22(a) and (d) substantially as proposed. The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ab2-2 with several
modifications in light of the comments received. Modifications to the proposed rules are
discussed in Part II. Below is a brief summary of the Commission’s proposal as set forth in the
CCA Standards proposing release.

Organizations (July 6, 2006), available at
http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oia/oia_bilateral/belgium.pdf.

24

In proposing amendments to Rule 17Ad-22, the Commission sought to establish an
enhanced regulatory framework for registered clearing agencies that meet the definition of a
“covered clearing agency.” Specifically, as proposed, a covered clearing agency would include
(i) a designated clearing agency; (ii) a complex risk profile clearing agency unless the CFTC is
the supervisory agency; 59 and (iii) any other registered clearing agency that the Commission
determines to be a covered clearing agency pursuant to the procedures set forth in proposed Rule
17Ab2-2. A covered clearing agency would be subject to the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e)
whereas a registered clearing agency that is not a covered clearing agency would remain subject
to the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(d). 60 As discussed in the CCA Standards proposing
release, the Commission believed that such an approach would allow the Commission to
maintain discretion to apply Rule 17Ad-22(d) to certain new clearing agencies while also
applying the requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e) to those clearing agencies that raise systemic
risk concerns due to, among other things, their size, systemic importance, global reach, or the
risks inherent in the products they clear. 61 To facilitate this approach, the Commission proposed

59

The Commission notes that, as defined in Rule 17Ad-22(a)(4) and as used in this release,
“security-based swap clearing agencies” are a subset of complex risk profile clearing agencies
that provide CCP services for security-based swaps. For a CCP other than a security-based swap
clearing agency, the Commission may determine whether the activities of such CCP have a more
complex risk profile and, therefore, whether such CCP is a covered clearing agency pursuant to
Rule 17Ab2-2. See infra Part II.D (further discussing Commission determinations under Rule
17Ab2-2).
60

Rule 17Ad-22(d) sets forth minimum requirements for the operation and governance of
registered clearing agencies. Under the proposal, all registered clearing agencies and covered
clearing agencies would also remain subject to the requirements in Section 17A of the Exchange
Act and the other relevant Commission rules and regulations thereunder, including Rules 17Ad22(a), (b), and (c).
61

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29516.
25

to modify Rule 17Ad-22(d) so that it would only apply to a registered clearing agency other than
a covered clearing agency.
Under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), a covered clearing agency would be required to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to address the following topics concerning its operation and governance:
•

general organization (including legal basis, governance, and a framework for the
comprehensive management of risks);

•

financial risk management (including credit risk, collateral, margin, and liquidity risk);

•

settlement (including settlement finality, money settlements, and physical deliveries);

•

CSDs and exchange-of-value settlement systems;

•

default management (including default rules and procedures and segregation and
portability);

•

business and operational risk management (including general business risk, custody and
investment risks, and operational risk);

•

access (including access and participation requirements, tiered participation
arrangements, and links);

•

efficiency (including efficiency and effectiveness and communication procedures and
standards); and

•

transparency.

The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e) substantially as proposed. Each of the
requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e), any modifications made thereto, and the comments
received with respect to them, are discussed in Part II.C.

26

In addition, the Commission proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 to provide the Commission with
procedures to make determinations regarding the following:
•

whether a registered clearing agency should be considered a covered clearing agency;

•

whether a covered clearing agency meets the definition of “systemically important in
multiple jurisdictions;” 62 and

•

whether the activities of a clearing agency providing CCP services have a more complex
risk profile.

The proposed rule would allow such determinations to occur either at the Commission’s own
initiative or upon request by either a clearing agency or one of its members. In each case, the
Commission would publish notice of its intention to consider such determinations, together with
a brief statement of the grounds under consideration, and provide at least a 30-day public
comment period prior to any determination. Under the proposed rule, the Commission may also
provide a clearing agency subject to any proposed determination opportunity for hearing. The
Commission is adopting Rule 17Ab2-2 substantially as proposed. Modifications to Rule 17Ab22 made in response to the comments received are discussed in Part II.D.
To facilitate the addition of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) and proposed Rule 17Ab2-2, the
Commission proposed to add 14 new definitions to Rule 17Ad-22(a). The Commission is
adopting those definitions substantially as proposed, but is combining the definitions of
“sensitivity analysis” and “conforming sensitivity analysis” into one definition of “sensitivity

jurisdictions”).

27

analysis.” 63 Each of the definitions, any modifications made thereto, and the comments received
with respect to them, are discussed in Part II.C.
Finally, the Commission also proposed Rule 17Ad-22(f) to codify the Commission’s
statutory authority under Section 807(c) of the Clearing Supervision Act. The Commission
received no comments regarding Rule 17Ad-22(f) and is adopting it as proposed. 64

and, where appropriate, the Commission’s response. 67 Comments received that were directed to
a particular proposed rule, or aspects thereof, are discussed in Part II.

supported the Commission’s efforts to promote financial stability through the application of
enhanced standards for covered clearing agencies, in particular those that act as CCPs for
security-based swaps and other derivatives. 69 A third commenter similarly expressed the belief
that the proposed requirements should promote market integrity, improve the robustness of
clearing systems, and protect the financial system against contagion. 70 The Commission believes
that Rule 17Ad-22(e) achieves these goals by supporting the objectives of (i) the Exchange Act
to facilitate the establishment of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and
settlement of securities transactions and linked or coordinated facilities for clearance and
settlement of securities transactions, having due regard for the public interest, the protection of
investors, the safeguarding of securities and funds, and maintenance of fair competition among
brokers and dealers, clearing agencies, and transfer agents, 71 and (ii) the Clearing Supervision
Act to promote robust risk management, promote safety and soundness, reduce systemic risks,
and support the stability of the broader financial system. 72
One commenter generally supported the mandate of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act to
promote transparency and regulation in the derivatives markets. 73 Another commenter noted that
the Dodd-Frank Act has sought to shed light on the opaque markets for swaps and other exotic
OTC derivatives, which numerous other commentators have asserted contributed to the recent
financial crisis, by requiring such derivatives to be cleared through registered clearing

agencies. 74 The commenter stated that this shift toward transparency could be useful if clearing
agencies are themselves robust and stable, noting that, in some ways, the risks associated with
OTC derivatives trading have not gone away but simply shifted to clearing agencies. The
commenter stated that, thus, it is vital for the Commission to not only promulgate strong
regulations for clearing agencies but also to enforce such regulations in a vigorous manner. As
noted above, the Commission believes that the focus in Rule 17Ad-22(e) on transparency,
governance, financial risk management, and operational risk management are consistent with the
objectives of promoting strong rules that help ensure covered clearing agencies are robust and
stable, and that any risks particular to OTC derivatives trading and the risks present in clearing
such derivatives are addressed in requirements for the covered clearing agency’s management of
financial risks.
2. Relationship between Rules 17Ad-22(d) and (e)
One commenter generally supported the Commission’s approach to the regulation of
registered clearing agencies, which the commenter stated applies a more general set of standards
under Rule 17Ad-22(d) for registered clearing agencies other than covered clearing agencies. 75
The commenter stated that this framework would allow new entrants to more firmly establish
themselves as clearing agencies, which is important for the deconsolidation and diffusion of risk
across the market. The commenter noted that at present the clearance and settlement industry,
like much of the financial sector, can be described as highly concentrated, and stated that it is

74

See OSEC at 3.

75

See OSEC at 1. The commenter, however, also raised concerns with the proposed dual
framework under existing Rule 17Ad-22(d) and proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) because the
commenter believed the dual framework could facilitate regulatory arbitrage. See id. at 1–2; see
also infra note 80 and accompanying text.

31

paramount that the Commission set policies that promote the proliferation of viable new clearing
agencies, given that existing clearing agencies typically serve as intermediaries for trillions of
dollars in trading volumes. In the commenter’s view, such concentration in the provision of
clearance and settlement services results in risk concentration and inhibits price allocation for
services, which, in turn, inhibits liquidity. 76 The Commission is mindful of these concerns and
notes, as discussed above, that the approach under Rules 17Ad-22(d) and (e) take into account
various clearing agency activities and the risks they pose while promoting robust risk
management practices and the general safety and soundness of registered clearing agencies. In
particular, as discussed in Part III.B.1.d, the Commission has considered the level of
concentration in the provision of clearing agency services.
One commenter expressed the belief that some of the proposed requirements under Rule
17Ad-22(e) represent a clarification of existing requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(d) rather than
enhanced standards related to the particular risks arising from a clearing agency’s systemic
importance. 77 The commenter recommended that the Commission review and revise Rule 17Ad22(d) to align it with the analogous provisions under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), particularly if
the different language in the proposed rule is intended to clarify language in the existing rule or
represents a logical outgrowth from it. The commenter stated that, to the extent any provision of
the proposed rules reflects a best practice, the provision should apply to all registered clearing
agencies. 78

77

See DTCC at 4 (citing proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1), (8), (10), and (12) as examples).

See id.

32

The Commission does not believe that the requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e) represent
a clarification of existing requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(d) or a codification of best practices.
As discussed above, the Commission proposed to maintain Rule 17Ad-22(d) to ensure that the
Commission could efficiently and effectively regulate registered clearing agencies depending on
the specific activity and risks that each type of clearing agency poses to the U.S. financial
system. Thus, Rule 17Ad-22(d) applies requirements to registered clearing agencies other than
covered clearing agencies, consistent with the continuing development of the national system for
clearance and settlement. Since no clearing agency would be subject to both Rule 17Ad-22(d)
and Rule 17Ad-22(e), the Commission does not believe that confusion would arise from
similarities or differences between the requirements under the two separate rules. With respect
to best practices, Rule 17Ad-22(e) includes requirements for covered clearing agencies intended
to address the activity and risks that their size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S.
securities markets, the risks inherent in the products they clear, and the goals of both the
Exchange Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, and is not an attempt to merely reflect best practices. 79
One commenter stated that the Commission must be vigilant to prevent companies from
engaging in regulatory arbitrage by seeking application of Rule 17Ad-22(d) when the
requirements of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) would be more appropriate. 80 The commenter
explained that the Commission can expect, for instance, large entities to float new subsidiaries or
affiliates seeking to operate under Rule 17Ad-22(d), even though the risk profile of the
subsidiary may be part of the greater risk exposure of the entity at-large. 81 The Commission is
79

81

See id. at 2.
33

mindful of this concern and notes that, in a separate release, the Commission has proposed an
expanded definition of “covered clearing agency” that, if adopted, may further reduce potential
opportunities for arbitrage. 82
The same commenter also recommended that the Commission regularly evaluate
registered clearing agencies subject to Rule 17Ad-22(d) to ensure that their activities have not
risen to a level warranting oversight and requirements pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e). 83 The
commenter stated that the Commission should require frequent audits of the policies and
procedures of clearing agencies operating under Rule 17Ad-22(d) and proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)
because (i) smaller, profitable clearing agencies may quickly outgrow Rule 17Ad-22(d) and (ii)
covered clearing agencies may shift their operations materially after crafting robust policies and
procedures under Rule 17Ad-22(e). In addition, the commenter noted that even if policies and
procedures are implemented in good faith, their efficacy could be questionable because standard
measurements of credit and liquidity risk may only encourage excessive confidence in the risk
profile of financial institutions. 84 The same commenter stated that the Commission’s vigorous
enforcement of clearing rules will ultimately remain more important in achieving real-world risk
reduction than the mere promulgation of detailed rules. 85 The commenter noted that clearing
agencies by definition collect various counterparty risks and, while the agglomeration of such
risks by clearing agencies may have not played a significant role in the most recent financial
82

In a separate release, the Commission is proposing to modify the definition of “covered
clearing agency” to include all CCPs, CSDs, and SSSs. See Exchange Act Release No. 3478963 (Sept. 28, 2016) (“CCA Definition proposing release”).

crisis, the continued growth of trading operations and the consolidation of market power in the
banking and finance sectors suggest that clearing agencies could serve as “ground zero” in the
next crisis. 86
As to this commenter, the Commission notes that registered clearing agencies are subject
to inspections and examinations under both the Exchange Act and the Clearing Supervision
Act. 87 The Commission also monitors registered clearing agencies to assess and evaluate the
risks posed by each clearing agency. Rule 17Ad-22(e) provides the Commission with
requirements against which a covered clearing agency can be, among other things, monitored,
inspected, and examined with respect to its establishing, implementing, maintaining, and
enforcing policies and procedures for managing credit and liquidity risk and its compliance with
such policies and procedures. In addition, the Commission is proposing in a separate release to
expand the definition of “covered clearing agency” to include all CCPs, CSDs, and SSSs. If
adopted, the requirements applied to CCPs, CSDs, and SSSs would be uniform under Rule
17Ad-22(e). 88
3. Relationship among Rules 17Ad-22(b), (c), and (e)
One commenter raised concerns regarding overlap between existing Rules 17Ad-22(b)(1)
through (4) and several of the provisions of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e). 89 The commenter
expressed the belief that proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4), (6), and (7) fully address all of the
matters covered by existing Rules 17Ad-22(b)(1) through (4) and that subjecting covered

35

clearing agencies that provide CCP services to both sets of requirements may create ambiguities
and inconsistencies. 90 The commenter urged the Commission to revise the proposal so that the
provisions of existing Rules 17Ad-22(b)(1) through (4) are not applicable to covered clearing
agencies that provide CCP services. 91 The Commission notes that the commenter has not
identified specific ambiguities or inconsistencies between Rules 17Ad-22(b) and (e) that might
result from application of both rule sets. With respect to the potential for inconsistency, the
Commission believes that while Rule 17Ad-22(e) may overlap with some requirements in Rule
17Ad-22(b), it is not inconsistent with Rule 17Ad-22(b) and, as a general matter, includes
requirements intended to supplement the more general requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(b). With
respect to the potential for ambiguity, the Commission notes that Rule 17Ad-22(b) applies to a
registered clearing agency that provides CCP services and Rule 17Ad-22(e) applies to a
registered clearing agency that is a covered clearing agency. To the extent that a registered
clearing agency is one that both provides CCP services and is a covered clearing agency, then it
is subject to the requirements in both rule sets, with the more general requirements in Rule
17Ad-22(b) supplemented by the requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e). The Commission therefore
is declining to limit application of Rule 17Ad-22(b) to clearing agencies that provide CCP
services and are not covered clearing agencies.
The commenter stated in the alternative that, at a minimum, the Commission should
clarify that the requirement in existing Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1), which requires a registered clearing
agency that provides CCP services to calculate and maintain a record of its financial resources
available to cover participant defaults in accordance with existing Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3), should
90

See id. at 5.

91

See id.; see also 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(1)–(4).

36

instead be determined and calculated in accordance with proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4). The
Commission believes that such clarification in the rule text is appropriate. The Commission
further believes that, in light of the closely linked nature between the management of credit and
liquidity risk, and the holistic approach taken in Rule 17Ad-22(e), 92 a covered clearing agency
generally should also calculate and maintain a record of its qualifying liquid resources under
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7). The Commission therefore is amending Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1) to include a
reference to the requirements for financial resources and qualifying liquid resources in Rules
17Ad-22(e)(4) and (e)(7) respectively, so that covered clearing agencies have reporting
requirements for their financial and qualifying liquid resources equivalent to other registered
clearing agencies. 93 The Commission notes that, to the extent the computations for financial
resources under Rules 17Ad-22(b)(3) and (e)(4) are the same, a covered clearing agency could
indicate so in the supporting documentation required pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1).
4. Risk of Duplicative or Inconsistent Regulation
One commenter noted that coordination among regulators in implementing derivatives
reform is critical to the efficient functioning of the derivatives market by alleviating duplicative
and potentially conflicting regulation of cross-border transactions. 94 In response, the
Commission notes that, as discussed above and previously in the CCA Standards proposing

37

release, the Commission has consulted with the CFTC, FRB, and FSOC in developing these
rules. 95
Another commenter similarly expressed the belief that consistent international regimes
are critical to mitigating regulatory arbitrage because opportunities for regulatory arbitrage
would disadvantage smaller market participants. 96 The commenter stated that no basis exists for
different regulatory treatment between U.S. and non-U.S. markets for security-based swaps,
noting that the Commission may conform its standards for clearing agencies to reflect evolving
international standards, consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act and the Exchange Act. 97 As noted
above, the Commission has considered the relevant international standards in developing these
rules, consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act and the Exchange Act, and the Commission believes
that the scope of and requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e) appropriately address the risk profile of
CCPs that clear security-based swaps. 98
A third commenter supported the view that imposing requirements on dually registered
entities would subject them to duplicative regimes, 99 and the commenter stated that avoiding
unnecessarily duplicative regulation allows for the most efficient use of both public and private
sector resources towards the shared goal of protecting the financial system. 100

38

A fourth commenter stated that the Commission should be wary of imposing additional
requirements on top of those imposed by other regulators, particularly where other regulators are
attempting to (or have) imposed the same or substantially similar standards. 101 The commenter
expressed the concern that, particularly for those clearing entities that are regulated by multiple
governmental authorities in multiple jurisdictions, the approach taken in the proposed rules may
unnecessarily subject clearing entities to the risk of duplicative or inconsistent regulation. 102 The
commenter expressed the belief that avoiding unnecessarily duplicative or, worse, inconsistent
regulation is key to maximizing effective regulation and the use of limited regulatory
activities. 103 The commenter stated that avoiding unnecessarily duplicative regulation will also
allow the Commission to focus its resources on the particular activities within its jurisdiction that
present increased risks and should therefore be subject to increased supervision. The commenter
urged the Commission, in implementing enhanced standards for covered clearing agencies, to
take a more flexible approach that is not “one-size-fits-all” and considers the overall regulatory
status of the relevant clearing agency. 104
With respect to these two commenters, the Commission notes, as previously discussed,
that the Commission has consulted with the CFTC, FRB, and FSOC in the development of these
rules to, in part, avoid unnecessarily duplicative or inconsistent regulation with respect to
clearing agencies that are dually registered in the United States. With respect to such clearing
agencies—as well as clearing agencies regulated by authorities in other jurisdictions—the

39

Commission is nonetheless mindful, pursuant to the comprehensive framework for regulating
swaps and security-based swaps established in Title VII, that the SEC has been given regulatory
authority over security-based swaps. CCPs that clear security-based swaps present risks to the
securities markets that must be subject to appropriate risk management. The Commission’s
intent with respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e) is, in part, to take another incremental step under Rule
17Ad-22 to ensure that these risks are appropriately managed consistent with the purposes of the
Exchange Act, the Clearing Supervision Act, and Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. 105 In this
regard, the Commission does not believe that it has taken a “one-size-fits-all” approach; rather,
the Commission has, through Rule 17Ad-22, sought to apply requirements commensurate and
appropriate to the risk posed by the clearing agency functions and activities specific to covered
clearing agencies as they exist in, and serve, the U.S. securities markets. The Commission
acknowledges that other rules and regulations may apply to a covered clearing agency that are
similar in scope or purpose to Rule 17Ad-22(e). However, the presence of similar regulations
does not negate the Commission’s obligation to ensure that risk in the U.S. securities markets is
appropriately managed consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act, the Clearing
Supervision Act, and Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Further, because Rule 17Ad-22(e) and
other comparable regulations—including those of the CFTC—are based on the same
international standards, 106 the potential for inconsistent regulation is low. The commenters have
provided no examples suggesting that Rule 17Ad-22(e) is inconsistent with another comparable
regulation. Nonetheless, Part I.A.6 above discusses the process by which the Commission could
consider the attendant facts and circumstances in assessing the application of Rule 17Ad-22(e) to
105

See supra Part I.A.

106

See supra notes 1–2, 43, and accompanying text.

40

a non-U.S. covered clearing agency that is subject to similar regulation in its home jurisdiction,
and Part II.A.2 further discusses comments regarding the risk of duplicative or inconsistent
regulation targeted to security-based swap clearing agencies subject to similar regulation in the
home jurisdiction.
Finally, one commenter noted that opportunities for regulatory arbitrage may exist based
on differences between the Commission’s proposed approach and rules adopted by the CFTC. 107
Opportunities for regulatory arbitrage only exist, however, when there are gaps or conflicting
regulations for the same matter. Here, as noted above, the Commission and CFTC have separate
and distinct statutory mandates, as set forth in the Exchange Act and the Commodity Exchange
Act, respectively, for the different markets they regulate. The Commission has specific authority
over the national system for clearance and settlement of U.S. securities transactions, including
transactions involving security-based swaps. 108 Under the Clearing Supervision Act, the
Commission also has specific authority over those SIFMUs for which it is the supervisory
agency. In this regard, such a regulatory structure does not on its face create opportunities for
regulatory arbitrage based on any differences between the Commission’s proposed approach and
rules adopted by the CFTC.
5. Flexible versus Prescriptive Approaches to Regulation, and the Role of
Rule Filings under Rule 19b-4
One commenter supported the proposed approach that covered clearing agencies be
allowed flexibility to use their market experience and understanding of their institutions to shape

107

See OSEC at 2.

108

See supra Parts I.A.1 and 2.

41

the implementation of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e). 109 The commenter emphasized that a flexible
and holistic approach would allow a clearing agency to make decisions from a perspective of
overall risk management, which may be more productive than a more prescriptive approach. 110
Another commenter was broadly supportive of the proposed rules, noting that the rules provide
covered clearing agencies with the necessary flexibility to design and structure their policies and
procedures to take into account the differences among clearing agencies. 111 The commenter
expressed the view that the Commission generally achieved the appropriate balance between
taking a principles-based approach (providing clearing agencies with flexibility) and a more
prescriptive, granular approach (limiting a clearing agency’s discretion). 112 The commenter also
expressed the belief that the precise form of the written policies and procedures required by
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) should be a matter for the clearing agency to determine, and the
commenter listed among such policies and procedures the following: service guides, operational
agreements, compliance procedures, link agreements, and protocols. 113 A third commenter, in
contrast, was concerned that the proposed rules rely inordinately on internal risk testing and
standards rather than a clear set of external, regulatory demands. 114 In the commenter’s view,
financial firms often view their policies and procedures as mere inconveniences.

42

The Commission does not believe that policies and procedures established by covered
clearing agencies and required pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e) can or would be viewed as “mere
inconveniences.” In proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e) the Commission stated—and continues to
believe—that it is important for covered clearing agencies to use their experience and
understanding of the markets they serve to shape the rules, policies, and procedures
implementing proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e). 115 Nonetheless, as discussed above, Rule 17Ad-22(e)
provides the Commission with a uniform set of requirements against which a covered clearing
agency can be monitored, inspected, and examined. Additionally, the Commission notes that, in
using its experience to shape the policies and procedures that implement Rule 17Ad-22(e), a
covered clearing agency must at all times comply with the requirements of both Section 19 of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder for SROs, as well as, for designated
clearing agencies, the advance notice requirements of the Clearing Supervision Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder. 116 Under Section 19(g) of the Exchange Act, a registered clearing
agency (as an SRO) must comply with its own rules and, absent reasonable justification or
excuse, enforce compliance with its own rules by its participants. 117
One of the above commenters further stated that there should be no change in the
requirement for filing proposed rule changes under Rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act, and
noted that not all written policies and procedures that would be adopted by a clearing agency in

115

116

117

See 15 U.S.C. 78s(g).

43

compliance with the proposed rule would be the subject of rule filings under Rule 19b-4. 118 The
Commission notes that the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 do not alter the definition of a rule or a
proposed rule change under the Exchange Act, nor do the amendments change a registered
clearing agency’s obligation to file proposed rule changes under Rule 19b-4. 119
6. Consistency with the PFMI
Five commenters generally supported the Commission’s proposed approach at least in
part because they believed it would reflect consistency with the PFMI, as described further
below.
One commenter supported the Commission’s efforts to update its rules for clearing
agencies to take into account the PFMI and to provide support for determinations by non-U.S.
banking regulators that covered clearing agencies satisfy the requirements for QCCP status under
the BCBS capital framework. 120 The commenter expressed the belief that it would be beneficial
for the Commission’s rules to recite the Commission’s intent to establish standards for covered
clearing agencies that are consistent with the PFMI and to interpret them in that context so long
as it does not result in inconsistency with the Exchange Act or other Commission regulations,
noting that the CFTC included such provision in its regulations for systemically important
derivatives clearing organizations (“SIDCOs”). 121 In this regard, the commenter noted that one
of the elements of the QCCP definition under the BCBS capital framework is that the relevant

regulator has “publicly indicated” that it applies to a CCP, on an ongoing basis, domestic rules
and regulations that are consistent with the PFMI. 122 As previously discussed, the Commission
has publicly indicated that, in developing Rule 17Ad-22(e), the Commission has, among other
things, considered the relevant international standards, including the PFMI. 123 The Commission
also believes, as previously discussed in Part I.A.5, that the requirements applicable to clearing
agencies set forth in the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, including the rules adopted
today, are consistent with the PFMI, and that the rules set forth below are a continuation of the
Commission’s active effort to foster the development of the national clearance and settlement
system consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act.
A second commenter similarly supported the Commission’s proposal to adopt enhanced
regulatory standards that are consistent with the PFMI and that would facilitate the ability of
covered clearing agencies to be considered QCCPs. 124 A third commenter welcomed the efforts
of the Commission to implement standards for clearing agencies that are consistent with the
PFMI. 125 A fourth commenter noted that enhanced standards are necessary to ensure that the
Commission’s regulation of CCPs is consistent with international standards, including the
PFMI—which serves as a prerequisite to obtaining QCCP status under the BCBS capital

framework—and CPSS-IOSCO’s consultative report Recovery of Financial Market
Infrastructures (“Consultative Recovery Report”). 126
A fifth commenter noted that the Commission’s approach differs from the PFMI in some
areas (e.g., segregation and portability and liquidity risk), reflecting the nature of the securities
markets and the particular requirements of the Exchange Act. 127 The commenter supported this
approach because covered clearing agencies need to have appropriate flexibility to implement
timely modifications to relevant parameters, assumptions, and approaches. The commenter also
expressed the belief that the Commission has generally struck the appropriate balance with
respect to incorporating the PFMI principles and the level of granular requirements
thereunder. 128
A sixth commenter, in contrast to the above commenters, urged the Commission to adopt
the key considerations of each principle identified in the PFMI and to strengthen the proposed
rules to affirmatively require robust standards and procedures that ensure accountability,
independence, and financial stability. 129 To the extent that the commenter identified a particular
key consideration that the Commission should include as a requirement in Rule 17Ad-22(e), it is
discussed and addressed in Part II.C. As a general matter, the Commission believes that the
requirements applicable to clearing agencies set forth in the Exchange Act and the rules
thereunder, including the rules adopted today, are consistent with the PFMI. The Commission

also believes Rule 17Ad-22(e) achieves the appropriate balance between imposing new
requirements on covered clearing agencies and allowing each covered clearing agency, subject to
its obligations and responsibilities as an SRO under the Exchange Act, to design its policies and
procedures pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e). This approach is consistent with the Commission’s
existing approach under Rules 17Ad-22(b) and (d) and recognizes that each registered clearing
agency has different organizational and operating structures and clears distinct products that
warrant a tailored approach to governance and risk management respectively. The Commission
notes that such a policies and procedures approach is also consistent with the Commission’s
existing regulation of SROs generally. 130 In addition, in the discussion of each final rule under
Rule 17Ad-22(e) in Part II.C, the Commission has provided guidance based on the key
considerations in the PFMI.
7. Other Comments
The Commission also received several comments that were not directed to the substance
of the CCA Standards proposal itself. These comments recommended study and rulemaking
beyond the scope of the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and Rule 17Ab2-2. 131
130

In the Commission’s experience, proposed rule changes of the type necessary to
implement the rules would generally entail changes to the SRO’s written policies and procedures
that must be submitted for Commission review and approval pursuant to Rule 19b-4 under the
Exchange Act. See supra note 12.
131

See ISDA at 4, 6 (recommending that the Commission (i) develop, in a subsequent
rulemaking, more detailed rules that require customer-by-customer accounting of the collateral
value held by the covered clearing agency with respect to security-based swap positions and
impose corresponding limitations on the value of collateral that the covered clearing agency may
apply towards losses on other customers’ positions carried by the participant and (ii) commit to a
study of insolvency of security-based swap clearing agencies with the goal of identifying
uncertainties, proposing solutions, and fostering public discussion); CFA Institute at 2

Below is a discussion of the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and Rule 17Ab2-2. Part II.A
discusses the scope of new Rule 17Ad-22(e). Part II.B discusses the Commission’s principlesbased approach to developing the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e). Part II.C discusses the
requirements for covered clearing agencies under new Rule 17Ad-22(e) and the definitions that
the Commission is adopting in Rule 17Ad-22(a). Part II.D discusses new Rule 17Ab2-2, Part
II.E discusses new Rule 17Ad-22(f), and Part II.F discusses the amendment to Rule 17Ad-22(d).
Part II.G discusses the effective and compliance dates. 132
A. Scope of Rule 17Ad-22(e)
To facilitate the approach to clearing agency regulation described in Part I.B, the
Commission proposed to add five definitions to Rule 17Ad-22(a) to identify those clearing
agencies that would be subject to the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e). First, the Commission
proposed to define “financial market utility” as defined in Section 803(6) of the Clearing
Supervision Act. 133 Second, the Commission proposed to define “designated clearing agency” as
a clearing agency registered with the Commission under Section 17A of the Exchange Act that is

cleared); SRC at 2 (stating that the SEC and CFTC continue to lack the resources available to
other self-funded financial regulators, creating structural weakness).
The Commission also received one comment letter that recommended modifications to
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) and other rulemaking outside the scope of Rule 17Ad-22. See AMG-ICI at
8–12.
132

If any of the provisions of these rules, or the application thereof to any person or
circumstance, is held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or application
of such provisions to other persons or circumstances that can be given effect without the invalid
provision or application.
133

See 12 U.S.C. 5462(6) (defining “financial market utility” pursuant to the Clearing
Supervision Act); supra note 20 (further discussing FMUs under the Clearing Supervision Act).

designated as systemically important by the FSOC and for which the Commission is the
supervisory agency as defined in Section 803(8) of the Clearing Supervision Act. 134 Third, the
Commission proposed to define “clearing agency involved in activities with a more complex risk
profile” to mean a clearing agency registered with the Commission under Section 17A of the
Exchange Act and that either (i) provides CCP services for security-based swaps or (ii) has been
determined by the Commission to be involved in activities with a more complex risk profile
(“complex risk profile clearing agency”), either at the time of its initial registration or upon a
subsequent determination by the Commission pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ab2-2. Fourth, the
Commission also proposed to define “security-based swap” to mean security-based swap as
defined in Section 3(a)(68) of the Exchange Act. 135 The Commission received no comments
regarding these four definitions. The Commission is modifying the definition of “clearing
agency involved in activities with a more complex risk profile” to strike “and” because it is
unnecessary. The Commission is adopting the remaining three definitions as proposed. 136
Fifth, the Commission proposed to define “covered clearing agency” to mean a
designated clearing agency, a complex risk profile clearing agency for which the CFTC is not the
supervisory agency, or any clearing agency determined to be a covered clearing agency by the
Commission pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ab2-2. Commenters expressed several views on the

134

Rule 17Ad-22 does not currently apply to entities operating pursuant to an exemption
from clearing agency registration.
135

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(68).

136

The Commission notes that, because of modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(a), the definition
of “financial market utility” is being moved to Rule 17Ad-22(a)(7), the definition of “designated
clearing agency” is being moved to Rule 17Ad-22(a)(6), the definition of “security-based swap”
is being moved to Rule 17Ad-22(a)(15). The definition of “clearing agency involved in
activities with a more complex risk profile” remains in Rule 17Ad-22(a)(4). See infra Part VI.

49

entities and activities that should be included within the “covered clearing agency” definition. In
Part I.C.4 above, the Commission considered comments focused generally on the potential for
duplicative or inconsistent regulation as a result of the proposed scope of Rule 17Ad-22(e).
Below is a discussion of comments directed to aspects of the definition of “covered clearing
agency.” 137 Comments directed to the scope of proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a), which would have
provided procedures for the Commission to determine whether a registered clearing agency is a
covered clearing agency, are discussed separately in Part II.D. In light of those comments, the
Commission has determined not to adopt proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a), and therefore, in adopting
the definition of “covered clearing agency,” the Commission has also determined to not adopt
the proposed prong regarding determinations pursuant to Rule 17Ab2-2. 138 Accordingly, the
Commission is adopting the definition of “covered clearing agency” to mean a designated
clearing agency or a complex risk profile clearing agency for which the CFTC is not the
supervisory agency as defined in the Clearing Supervision Act. 139
1. As Applied to CCPs Generally
Four commenters supported applying enhanced standards to CCPs generally. 140 One
commenter noted that the mandatory clearing of OTC derivatives introduced following the 2008

137

The Commission notes that, because of modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(a), the definition
of “covered clearing agency” is being moved to Rule 17Ad-22(a)(5). See infra Part VI.

138

See infra Part II.D.2.a.

139

In addition, as first noted in Part I.C.2, in a separate release the Commission is proposing
to modify the definition of “covered clearing agency” to include all CCPs, CSDs, and SSSs. See
CCA Definition proposing release, supra note 82, at 25–26.
140

See CFA Institute at 2; OSEC at 3; The Clearing House at 1; DTCC at 4 (recommending
that any provision of the proposed rules that reflects best practices should be applied to all
registered clearing agencies).

financial crisis has heightened the need for enhanced standards for CCPs. 141 A second
commenter suggested that the Commission apply Rule 17Ad-22(e) to all clearing agencies to
reduce the risk of failure and the problems such a failure would cause for investors. 142 In so
suggesting, the commenter cited to the size of the derivatives markets and the potential for
disruption and systemic risk that those markets may have on covered clearing agencies. 143 A
third commenter similarly cited to the risks associated with derivatives trading that has shifted
into clearing agencies. 144 With respect to these three commenters, the Commission notes that,
according to the “covered clearing agency” definition, a CCP is a covered clearing agency in
either of the following circumstances: (i) if the CCP is a designated clearing agency; or (ii) if the
CCP is a complex risk profile clearing agency, 145 unless the CFTC is the supervisory authority
under the Clearing Supervision Act. Accordingly, under the “covered clearing agency”
definition, five of the six active CCPs registered with the Commission will be a covered clearing
agency subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e). The Commission believes that it is important to take an
initial step to establish coverage of Rule 17Ad-22(e) over this group of clearing agencies and is
adopting the “covered clearing agency” definition with only the modification described above
141

See The Clearing House at 1.

142

See CFA Institute at 2.

143

See id. The commenter also suggests that, to account for these risks, the Commission
reconsider whether all OTC contracts, whether standardized or not, ought to clear through
covered clearing agencies. The Commission notes that whether OTC contracts ought to be
subject to mandatory clearing requirements was not a subject of this rulemaking during the
proposing stage, and the Commission therefore believes this comment is outside the scope of this
rulemaking.
144

See OSEC at 3.

145

As previously discussed, security-based swap clearing agencies are a subset of complex
risk profile clearing agencies under Rule17Ad-22(a)(5). See supra note 59.

51

regarding Rule 17Ab2-2. However, in consideration of these comments, the Commission is
proposing in a separate release to amend the definition of “covered clearing agency” so that it
would apply to any registered clearing agency that, among other things, provides CCP
services. 146 Under this proposed definition, any CCP registered with the Commission would be a
covered clearing agency.
The fourth commenter recommended that any provision of the proposed rules that reflects
best practices should be applied to all registered clearing agencies, CCPs or otherwise. 147 This
comment has been previously addressed in Part I.C.2. 148
2. As Applied to Security-Based Swap Clearing Agencies
In contrast, three commenters sought to limit the scope of Rule 17Ad-22(e) further than
was proposed. 149 The Commission believes these arguments are unpersuasive, for the reasons
described below.
One of these commenters expressed the view that Rule 17Ad-22(e) should not apply to
complex risk profile clearing agencies but only to designated clearing agencies, and that applying
the enhanced regime of Rule 17Ad-22(e) to non-designated clearing agencies undermines the
significance of being designated, which the commenter stated is inconsistent with the distinction
Congress sought to create between systemically important clearing agencies and other nondesignated clearing agencies. 150 The commenter stated that the Commission should take an

52

approach similar to the CFTC, whereby non-designated clearing agencies could choose to “optin” to the enhanced requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e) if desired. The commenter further stated
that security-based swap clearing agencies should not automatically fall within the definition of a
covered clearing agency, stating that it is not clear security-based swap clearing inherently raises
issues that require enhanced standards as compared to other clearing activities. 151
The Commission believes, however, that it is important to establish coverage of the
enhanced standards of Rule 17Ad-22(e) for CCPs that clear security-based swaps. In the
Commission’s view, in addition to designations of systemic importance under the Clearing
Supervision Act, Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act sets out separate and equally important
objectives. As described above, Title VII provides the Commission with enhanced authority to
regulate security-based swaps, and, among other things, requires the Commission to adopt rules
with respect to security-based swap clearing agencies. 152 The Commission previously has noted
that Title VII’s mandate for the central clearing of security based swaps, wherever possible and
appropriate, reinforces the need for proper risk management by security-based swap clearing
agencies to ensure the stability of the U.S. securities markets. 153 The requirements in Rule
17Ad-22(e), among other things, help to mitigate the risks inherent in the functions of a CCP,
including a CCP for security-based swaps, and therefore the Commission believes that requiring
registered clearing agencies performing such CCP functions to comply with Rule 17Ad-22(e), in
addition to those registered clearing agencies that are designated clearing agencies, is consistent
with the framework of both Title VII and the Clearing Supervision Act. In light of these
151

152

153

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29576.

53

considerations, the Commission does not believe that an opt-in regime is appropriate for
security-based swap clearing agencies.
In the alternative, the commenter stated that application of Rule 17Ad-22(e) should be
limited to the particular business or product lines of a covered clearing agency that warrant
application of the higher standards. 154 The commenter noted that many clearing agencies clear a
range of products, some of which are within and others outside of the Commission’s jurisdiction.
According to the commenter, for those clearing agencies only some activities, such as the
clearing of security-based swaps, should trigger application of Rule 17Ad-22(e), and therefore
the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e) should be limited to those business or product lines. The
commenter noted that this would be applicable where the activity is substantially separate from
other business lines, such as through the use of a separate guaranty fund. The commenter
recognized that certain standards may not be easily applied to a particular business line, 155 but
noted that a categorical rule that does not take into account the scope of a particular clearing
agency’s security-based swap activities or the risks presented by them raises concerns. 156
Rule 17Ad-22(e) applies to a covered clearing agency and does not make distinctions
among the various product or business lines that the covered clearing agency manages. In the
Commission’s experience, many aspects of a clearing agency’s operations are managed at the
entity level (i.e., as a clearing agency) irrespective of product or business line. For example, the
clearing agency’s legal framework, governance, risk management framework, financial risk
154

See ICEEU at 7.

155

See id. The commenter further states that this approach will help reduce the likelihood of
clearing agencies being subject to inconsistent regulation. The Commission addressed this
aspect of the comment above in Part I.C.4.
156

See ICEEU at 7.

54

management, and operational risk management are determined as part of the policies and
procedures of the entity (i.e., the clearing agency), and therefore these areas are not separated out
to apply exclusively to a particular business or product line. 157 Thus, requirements in Rule
17Ad-22(e) directed to these aspects of a clearing agency’s operations generally could not be
easily applied only to a particular business or product line when the clearing agency’s operations
and risk management are organized at the entity level. The Commission believes that this
approach avoids unnecessary complexity and fragmentation in the policies and procedures of a
clearing agency. The operations and risk management of a covered clearing agency are closely
interrelated across various activities in which the clearing agency engages, and within Rule
17Ad-22(e), the requirements have significant interactions among each other, with some building
upon others or complementing others. The Commission believes that this generally also supports
a holistic application of the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e).
However, the Commission understands that some covered clearing agencies may manage
certain activities and risk at an entity level while others manage the same activities and risk at a
business or product level. Covered clearing agencies retain the ability to distinguish among their
products in crafting their policies and procedures. Because a covered clearing agency’s practices
are diverse and difficult to generalize, the Commission has sought to address such concerns in
other ways, such as by streamlining the process for rule filings under Rule 19b-4 filed by dually
registered clearing agencies. 158 Specifically, for rule filings that primarily concern the clearing
operations of a registered clearing agency that are not linked to securities clearing operations but

(“Dually Registered CA release”).

55

only to clearing of products under the authority of the CFTC, the Commission provides a
streamlined process for such rule filings to become effective upon filing with the Commission. 159
Additionally, two commenters urged the Commission to exclude non-U.S. security-based
swap clearing agencies registered with the Commission from the definition of “covered clearing
agency” when they are regulated in their home jurisdictions under a regime that is consistent
with the PFMI. 160 The commenters stated that this approach would be consistent with the
Commission’s treatment under Rule 17Ad-22(e) of dually registered SIDCOs for which the
CFTC is the supervisory agency under the Clearing Supervision Act and believe a similar
exclusion would be appropriate for clearing agencies subject to other regulatory frameworks. 161
The commenters further stated that any decision to apply the enhanced standards for covered
clearing agencies should take into account whether, and the extent to which, the clearing agency
is already subject to similar or comparable standards under other regulation, 162 noting that
recognizing existing foreign regulation is consistent with the Commission’s proposals on
regulation of cross-border activities generally. 163 In the commenters’ view, the approach set out
in the Commission’s Cross-Border proposing release sensibly balanced the interests of the
Commission with those of foreign regulators and appropriately considered the costs and benefits
of adding additional regulatory requirements where the home country regulation is comparable.

comments regarding the risk of duplicative or inconsistent regulation above in Part I.C.4.

78 FR 30968, 31039 (May 23, 2013) (“Cross-Border proposing release”)).

56

In this regard, one commenter expressed the belief that deference to home country
regulation is appropriate because both Rule 17Ad-22(e) and applicable U.K. regulations are
consistent with the PFMI, noting that U.S. and U.K. regulators thus have generally aligned
interests. 164 In particular, the commenter cited, as comparable regulation to Rule 17Ad-22(e),
regulation by the Bank of England under existing U.K. legislation and, for those clearing
agencies that have been granted authorization as a CCP under EMIR, the regulations under
EMIR. 165 A second commenter echoed this viewpoint, noting that EMIR is consistent with the
PFMI. 166 Finally, one of the commenters stated that, in areas where the Commission determines
that the home country regulation is not comparable and determines that additional regulation
may be appropriate, any incremental regulation under Rule 17Ad-22 should be targeted to those
areas of difference. 167
One commenter further stated that, at a minimum, a clearing agency subject to Rule
17Ad-22(e) in addition to comparable home regulation is subject to duplicative regulation, which
is costly for both the clearing agency and its regulators and serves no meaningful regulatory
purpose. 168 The commenter also stated that it is critical that a clearing agency not be subject to
inconsistent regulations in different jurisdictions, noting that such inconsistencies can arise not
only when relevant regulations are different but also when regulators interpret substantially
similar regulations in different ways. As a result, the commenter stated that a clearing agency
164

57

can still be significantly burdened by being subject to two substantially similar sets of
regulations, and in its view, the commenter expressed the view that it would be preferable to
allow clearing agencies, where possible, to be subject to a single set of standards. 169 The other
commenter also supported an approach that would minimize duplicative requirements on those
registered clearing agencies subject to both Rule 17Ad-22(e) and home regulation, while
ensuring that all registered clearing agencies that clear security-based swaps are regulated in a
manner that is consistent with the PFMI. 170
In response to the above comments, the Commission does not believe that a non-U.S.
security-based swap clearing agency regulated in its home jurisdiction, under a regime consistent
with the PFMI, should be excluded, as a threshold matter, from designation as a covered clearing
agency. As previously discussed in Part I.C.4, the Commission’s intent with respect to Rule
17Ad-22(e) is, in part, to take another incremental step under Rule 17Ad-22 to ensure that risks
inherent in certain CCP activity, including the central clearing of security-based swaps, are
appropriately managed consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act, the Clearing
Supervision Act, and Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Commission has, through Rule
17Ad-22, sought to apply requirements commensurate and appropriate to the risk posed by the
clearing agency functions and activities specific to covered clearing agencies as they exist in, and
serve, the U.S. securities markets. The Commission acknowledges that other rules and
regulations may apply to a covered clearing agency that are similar in scope or purpose to Rule
17Ad-22(e). However, the presence of similar regulations does not negate the Commission’s
obligation to ensure that risk in the U.S. securities markets is appropriately managed consistent
169

See id.

170

See LCH at 3.

58

with the purposes of the Exchange Act, the Clearing Supervision Act, and Title VII of the DoddFrank Act.
Further, because Rule 17Ad-22(e) and other comparable regulations are based on the
same international standards, 171 the Commission believes the potential for any inconsistent
regulation is low. Indeed, applying Rule 17Ad-22(e) to a covered clearing agency that is also
subject to comparable regulation consistent with the PFMI in its home jurisdiction should
improve harmonization between the Commission’s regulatory regime and that of the home
jurisdiction, which would reduce the burdens associated with the presence of similar regulation
under multiple regulatory regimes. In addition, because clearing agency practices are diverse
and difficult to generalize, the Commission has sought to address concerns about duplicative
regulation in other ways, such as through streamlining the process for rule filings under Rule
19b-4 filed by clearing agencies dually registered with the Commission and the CFTC so that
rule filings that do not pertain to securities clearing operations become effective upon filing with
the Commission, without pre-effective notice and opportunity for comment. 172 In addition, Part
I.A.6 above discusses the process by which the Commission could consider the attendant facts
and circumstances in assessing the application of Rule 17Ad-22(e) to a non-U.S. covered
clearing agency that is subject to similar regulation in its home jurisdiction.
3. As Applied to Dually Registered Clearing Agencies
One commenter noted that the proposed definition is sufficiently broad to enable the
Commission to include SIDCOs. The commenter stated that the potential for a SIDCO to be
determined to be a covered clearing agency is inconsistent with the Commission’s
171

See supra notes 1–2, 43, and accompanying text.

172

See Dually Registered CA release, supra note 158, at 21047.

59

acknowledgment of the purposes of the Clearing Supervision Act and there being duplicative
requirements for some dually registered entities. 173 The commenter recommended that the
Commission expressly exclude from the definition of “covered clearing agency” those clearing
agencies for which the CFTC is the supervisory agency pursuant to the Clearing Supervision
Act. The Commission notes that the definition of “covered clearing agency” does expressly
exclude those clearing agencies for which the CFTC is the supervisory agency. As previously
discussed, in a separate release, the Commission is proposing to amend the definition of a
covered clearing agency, and addresses the potential effects of the proposed amendment on
clearing agencies dually registered with the CFTC. 174
B. Principles-Based Approach to Rule 17Ad-22(e)
Rule 17Ad-22(e) requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures that address a variety of issues, as described in detail
below. The Commission’s approach sets forth requirements that a covered clearing agency must
achieve when developing its written policies and procedures. With a number of exceptions, Rule
17Ad-22(e) does not prescribe a specific tool or arrangement to achieve its requirements. The
Commission believes that when determining the content of its policies and procedures, each
covered clearing agency must have the ability to consider its unique characteristics and
circumstances, including ownership and governance structures, effect on direct and indirect
participants, membership base, markets served, and the risks inherent in products cleared. This
ability, however, is subject to the requirements of the SRO rule filing and advance notice

173

See CME at 3.

174

See CCA Definition proposing release, supra note 82, at 39–42.

60

processes, which provide some opportunities for the public and participants to comment on the
covered clearing agency’s rules, policies, and procedures.
The Commission does not believe that a granular or prescriptive approach to its
regulation of covered clearing agencies would be appropriate, nor would such an approach
ensure that a covered clearing agency does not become a transmission mechanism for systemic
risk. Moreover, the Commission believes that the primarily principles-based approach reflected
in Rule 17Ad-22(e) will help a covered clearing agency continue to develop policies and
procedures that can effectively meet the evolving risks and challenges in the markets that the
covered clearing agency serves. It has been the Commission’s experience that particular
securities markets (e.g., equities, fixed income, and options) have their unique conventions,
characteristics, and structure that are best addressed on a market-by-market basis. The
Commission recognizes that a less prescriptive approach can help promote efficient and effective
practices and encourage regulated entities to consider how to manage their regulatory obligations
and risk management practices in a way that complies with Commission rules, while considering
the particular characteristics of their business, and believes the approach reflected in across Rule
17Ad-22, including new paragraph (e), is consistent with this approach. Such a principles-based
approach also is consistent with the approach taken in Rule 17Ad-22(d). 175
As a general matter, the Commission believes that using broadly prescriptive
requirements that, on an absolute and ex ante basis, prohibit a covered clearing agency’s use of
175

See, e.g., Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 5, at 66231–32
(noting, with respect to credit exposures and margin requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(d), that a
less prescriptive and more flexible rule sets a more appropriate baseline standard and stressing
the importance of considering different markets characterized by different trading patterns,
volumes, liquidity, transparency and other unique market characteristics when determining the
appropriate risk management mechanisms for a particular clearing agency).

61

particular tools makes it more difficult for a covered clearing agency to maintain flexibility,
subject to its obligations and responsibilities as an SRO under the Exchange Act, to address the
ever-evolving challenges and risks inherent in the securities markets. Accordingly, the
Commission believes that the approach adopted here appropriately preserves such flexibility for
a covered clearing agency, and the broader market, to respond to particular risks or issues arising
in its operations in an effective manner.
Finally, in certain instances, commenters have suggested that the Commission either
prohibit or endorse a covered clearing agency’s use of particular tools or rules, policies, or
procedures. As discussed in more detail below, the Commission generally declines to take such
an approach because it is inconsistent with the principles-based approach reflected in Rule 17Ad22(e). Instead, the Commission’s approach to Rule 17Ad-22(e) is designed to allow the
Commission to consider particular tools in the context of the specific facts and circumstances
facing a clearing agency in light of its governance structure, the products it clears, and the
markets it serves. In addition, in consideration of the issues raised by commenters, the
Commission has provided guidance consistent as to what a covered clearing agency generally
should consider when developing and maintaining its policies and procedures consistent with
Rule 17Ad-22(e).
C. Requirements for Covered Clearing Agencies under Rule 17Ad-22(e)
Below is a discussion of each of the requirements in new Rule 17Ad-22(e), the related
new definitions in Rule 17Ad-22(a), and the comments received by the Commission that were
targeted to specific elements of those requirements and definitions. 176 As previously noted, the
Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e) and the related definitions in Rule 17Ad-22(a)
176

Comments that were of a general nature have been discussed in Part I.C.

62

substantially as proposed. 177 To the extent the Commission is adopting any modifications either
to the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e) or the definitions in Rule 17Ad-22(a), such
modifications are discussed in detail below. Moreover, the below sections are organized by the
particular rules under Rule 17Ad-22(e), with discussion of the definitions incorporated into the
overall substantive discussion of each particular rule. Further, in the discussion of each final rule
below, the Commission has included guidance that a covered clearing agency generally should
consider as it develops and maintains its rules, policies, and procedures in compliance with Rule
17Ad-22(e). As previously noted, this guidance is based, in part, on the key considerations in the
PFMI. 178 The Commission intends for this guidance to be read in conjunction with the relevant
requirements set forth in Rule 17Ad-22(e), so as to provide further explanation of the types of
issues a covered clearing agency generally should consider when implementing those
requirements. The Commission does not intend for this guidance to expand, diminish, or
otherwise modify the requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e).
1. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1): Legal Risk
a. Proposed Rule
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
for a well-founded, clear, transparent, and enforceable legal basis for each aspect of its activities
in all relevant jurisdictions. 179 The Commission proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(20) to define
“transparent” to mean that relevant documentation is disclosed, as appropriate, to the
177

63

Commission and other relevant authorities, to clearing members and customers of clearing
members, to the owners of the covered clearing agency, and to the public, to the extent consistent
with other statutory and Commission requirements. 180
b. Comments Received and Commission Response
i. Use of Legal Opinions
One commenter supported the Commission’s proposal that each covered clearing agency
have policies and procedures that provide for a well-founded, clear, transparent, and enforceable
legal basis for each of its activities in all relevant jurisdictions, and noted that legal uncertainty
can increase risk. 181 A second commenter stated that the Commission explicitly should require a
covered clearing agency to obtain, on at least an annual basis, legal opinions on the
enforceability of structures used to contain losses within a clearing service upon the insolvency
of the clearing service or the covered clearing agency, including closeout netting, right of set-off,
classification as a repurchase-style transaction, and collateral protection opinions, and then
disclose these opinions to its participants. 182
In satisfying the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1), a covered clearing agency could
include within its policies and procedures a requirement regarding legal opinions as to certain
matters, such as the enforceability of structures used to contain losses within a clearing service
upon the insolvency of the clearing service or the covered clearing agency. The use of legal
opinions may be one consideration but compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) ultimately requires

in Rules 17Ad-22(e)(2) and (10). See infra Parts II.C.2 and 10.

that the covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures, taken as a whole, to be reasonably
designed to provide for a well-founded, clear, transparent, and enforceable legal basis for each
aspect of its activities in all relevant jurisdictions. Whether legal opinions are useful to a covered
clearing agency and, if so, what form they ought to take or subject matter they ought to address,
may vary on a case-by-case basis depending on the particular facts and circumstances. Because
the appropriate use of legal opinions will vary on a case-by-case basis, the Commission does not
believe it is appropriate to modify Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) to include a specific requirement for legal
opinions addressing particular matters. 183
ii. Definition of “Transparent”
One commenter, although supportive of the Commission’s proposal to require covered
clearing agencies to develop policies and procedures to fulfill the requirements of Rule 17Ad22(e), noted that, because some policies and procedures may include commercially sensitive
information, it would be inappropriate to require a covered clearing agency to disclose all of its
policies and procedures. The commenter stated that it would be helpful for the language of the
rules to explicitly reflect this reality, which was acknowledged by the Commission in the
preamble to the proposed rules. 184
The Commission acknowledges that disclosure of certain information, for example,
proprietary or commercially sensitive information, may not be appropriate to be disclosed
publicly or to all parties. Because the definition of “transparent” is limited to relevant
documentation, as appropriate, and does not conflict with other statutory and Commission
183

The Commission notes that every registered clearing agency must keep and preserve at
least one copy of all documents as shall be made or received by it in the course of its business as
such and in the conduct of its self-regulatory activity. 17 CFR 240.17a-1.
184

See id.

65

requirements on confidentiality and disclosure, it does not lead to the concerns noted by the
commenter. The Commission already noted in proposing the rule that certain types of
information, such as confidential information, may not be appropriate for disclosure in some
circumstances and to some parties. In addition, the level of disclosure required will necessarily
depend on the particular facts and circumstances. The definition of “transparent” provides a
covered clearing agency with some discretion to develop written policies and procedures
addressing disclosures and the use of confidential or proprietary information, consistent with
statutory and Commission requirements. To improve clarity, the Commission is modifying the
definition of “transparent” to mean for the purposes of paragraphs (e)(1), (2), and (10) of this
section, to the extent consistent with other statutory and Commission requirements on
confidentiality and disclosure, that documentation required under paragraphs (e)(1), (2), and (10)
is disclosed to the Commission and, as appropriate, to other relevant authorities, to clearing
members and to customers of clearing members, to the owners of the covered clearing agency,
and to the public. Below, the Commission provides additional guidance regarding the definition
of “transparent.”
c. Final Rule
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) as proposed and adopting the definition
of “transparent” as described above but moving it to Rule 17Ad-22(a)(19) because of other
modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(a). 185 Because the Commission recognizes that there may be a
number of ways to address compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1), the Commission is providing
the following guidance that a covered clearing agency generally should consider in establishing
and maintaining policies and procedures to address legal risk:
185

See infra Part VI.

66

•

whether its policies and procedures for legal risk provide a high degree of certainty for
each material aspect of its activities in all relevant jurisdictions;

•

whether its rules, policies and procedures, and contracts are clear, understandable, and
consistent with relevant laws and regulations;

•

whether it can articulate the legal basis for its activities to the relevant authorities,
participants, and, where relevant, participants’ customers, in a clear and understandable
way;

•

whether it has rules, policies and procedures, and contracts that are enforceable in all
relevant jurisdictions, and whether it has a high degree of certainty that actions taken by it
under such rules, policies and procedures, and contracts will not be voided, reversed, or
subject to stays; and

•

whether, if it conducts business in multiple jurisdictions, it can identify and mitigate the
risks arising from any potential conflict of laws across jurisdictions.

The Commission notes that a covered clearing agency operating in multiple jurisdictions under
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) generally should address any conflicts of law issues that it may encounter. 186
With respect to the definition of “transparent,” the Commission notes that certain types of
information, such as confidential information, may not be appropriate for public disclosure or
disclosure to certain third parties and that confidential information could be reflected in policies
and procedures with respect to the security of information technology or other critical systems,
such as, for example, as part of business continuity planning. The Commission also notes that

186

In addition, for covered clearing agencies, the “relevant jurisdiction” includes the United
States and any other jurisdiction where the covered clearing agency operates.

67

generally a covered clearing agency could meet the definition of “transparent” by posting
relevant documentation to its website.
2. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2): Governance
a. Proposed Rule
As proposed, Rules 17Ad-22(e)(2) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
for governance arrangements that are: clear and transparent; clearly prioritize the safety and
efficiency of the covered clearing agency; support the public interest requirements in Section
17A of the Exchange Act and the objectives of owners and participants; and establish that the
board of directors and senior management have appropriate experience and skills to discharge
their duties and responsibilities. 187
b. Comments Received and Commission Response
i. Scope of Interests to Consider
The scope of interests required to be considered as part of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)(iii)
attracted a range of comments. One commenter conveyed strong support for the Commission’s
requirement that covered clearing agencies adopt policies and procedures for clear and
transparent governance arrangements that prioritize safety and efficiency, noting that decisions
made by covered clearing agencies could have an impact on multiple financial markets and
jurisdictions. 188 The commenter urged that governance measures should support the objectives
of owners and participants and, with respect to certain matters, the public interest. The

187

188

See CFA Institute at 6.

68

commenter also noted that a clearing agency’s reactions to competition could undermine the
safety and soundness of the clearing agency as well as the industry as a whole. 189
A second commenter sought to clarify that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)(iii) would not
encompass the interests of participants’ customers and other stakeholders. 190 This commenter
expressed the belief that the Commission’s proposed approach, in which the objectives of
participants’ customers and other stakeholders are not explicitly stated in Rule 17ad-22(e)(2)(iii),
is consistent with the PFMI. 191 The commenter acknowledged that the Commission and other
regulators must consider the interests of indirect participants, but the commenter noted that their
interests are adequately addressed through participation of a sufficient number of independent
directors or through other means. 192 A third commenter expressed support for the proposed
standards, believing that a principles based-formulation is generally appropriate, but the
commenter also expressed the belief that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) should provide clear
processes for consideration of participants’ views and involvement of participants in the covered
clearing agency’s decision-making process. 193
The Commission believes that the first commenter’s concern is addressed by the fact that
policies and procedures under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) reasonably designed to support the public
interest requirements in Section 17A of the Exchange Act generally should consider whether

69

they support the stability of the broader financial system of the United States. 194 For example, as
noted by the first commenter, a covered clearing agency could consider the public interest in its
response to large scale price moves or position changes. 195
With respect to the second and third commenters, 196 the Commission is modifying
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) to include new paragraph (vi), which requires policies and
procedures for governance arrangements that consider the interests of participants’ customers,
securities issuers and holders, and other relevant stakeholders of the covered clearing agency. 197
Under new paragraph (vi), other relevant stakeholders are persons that access the national system
for clearance and settlement indirectly (e.g., institutional and retail investors), entities that rely
on the national system for clearance and settlement to effectively provide services to investors
and market participants, and other market infrastructures. Other relevant stakeholders currently
include, for example, transfer agents, liquidity providers, and other linked market infrastructures,
including exchanges, matching service providers, and payment systems. This new paragraph
complements Section 17A(b)(3)(C), which requires the rules of a clearing agency to assure fair
representation of its shareholders and participants in the selection of its directors and the
administration of its affairs. 198 This requirement for fair representation necessarily applies to
194

As previously discussed, the Commission has stated that the public interest is a broad
concept that includes contributing to the ongoing development of the U.S. financial system, in
particular the national clearance and settlement system contemplated by Section 17A of the
Exchange Act, protecting investors, and fostering fair and efficient markets. See supra Part
II.C.2.a.

70

policies and procedures adopted and maintained by a covered clearing agency pursuant to Rule
17Ad-22(e)(2). Consistent with this requirement, the Commission believes that a covered
clearing agency generally should, in selecting its directors and administering its affairs, consider
the interests of owners, participants, participants’ customers, securities issuers and holders, and
other relevant stakeholders to, consistent with the public interest requirements in Section 17A,
strike an appropriate balance among the potentially competing views of such other stakeholders
represented within a covered clearing agency. As noted by one commenter below, the inclusion
of independent directors on the board may be one mechanism for helping to ensure that the
relevant views are presented and considered, 199 provided the covered clearing agency’s overall
corporate governance structure is consistent with the fair representation and public interest
requirements in Section 17A of the Exchange Act. The Commission notes, further, that the
approach a covered clearing agency may take in considering such views could vary depending on
the ownership structure or organizational form of the covered clearing agency. A covered
clearing agency operating under a mutualized utility model where losses are fully mutualized
among its participant-owners may take a different approach to consider the interests of all the
relevant stakeholders compared to a covered clearing agency operating under a different model,
such as one where it is owned by another organization, is operated as a for-profit entity, and/or is
publicly listed and traded.
ii. Representation on the Board of Directors
Commenters generally supported the requirement in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)(iv)
that requires members of the board of directors and senior management to have the skills and
199

See ICI at 14–15; see also infra Part II.C.2.b.ii below (discussing comments regarding
public or independent representation on the board of directors).

71

experience to perform their duties and responsibilities. 200 Multiple commenters, however,
advocated for the inclusion of additional requirement related to the board of directors. One
commenter urged the Commission to require that covered clearing agencies have public or
independent representation on their boards. 201 The commenter also urged the Commission to
define independent directors to exclude parties with significant business relationships with the
covered clearing agency, cross-directorships, or controlling shareholdings, as well as executives,
officers, or employees of the covered clearing agency or its affiliate. 202 Another commenter
recommended that the Commission require a covered clearing agency to include representatives
of both buy-side and sell-side market participants on the board. 203 The commenter stated that
some equities clearing agencies and stock exchanges already include investor representatives on
their boards to benefit from a diverse group of market participants. 204 The commenter expressed
the view that stakeholder involvement at the board level would minimize conflicts of interest by
balancing commercial interests of covered clearing agencies with those of other stakeholders. 205
The commenter also expressed the view that the risk committee of a covered clearing agency

200

See, e.g., CFA Institute at 6 (noting that those responsible for the operations of a covered
clearing agency should be capable of performing the required decision-making in light of the
systemic importance of covered clearing agencies); OCC at 5 (believing that covered clearing
agencies are well positioned to determine which individuals have the appropriate experience,
skills, incentives, and integrity to discharge their duties and responsibilities in a way that reflects
the particular needs of each covered clearing agency).

72

should include a wide range of indirect participants, as the customers of clearing members also
have an interest in ensuring adequate and diverse stakeholder representation in the covered
clearing agency, in addition to transparency in the decision making process. 206
After careful consideration of the comments, the Commission has determined not to
modify Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) to include specific requirements related to public or independent
representation on the covered clearing agency’s board or risk committee. The Commission
believes that new paragraph (vi), previously discussed above, sufficiently addresses the concerns
raised by the commenters because it requires specific policies and procedures for governance
arrangements that consider the interests of a wide range of market participants. In addition,
public representation, combined with clear requirements for the qualifications of the board of
directors, could improve the functioning of the board and could be one way to ensure that the
covered clearing agency has governance arrangements consistent with the fair representation
requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Exchange Act, provided that the covered clearing
agency’s governance structure, as a whole, is consistent with the fair representation and public
interest requirements in Section 17A of the Exchange Act. The Commission is declining to
modify Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) to further specify that a particular director represent the interests of
buy-side or sell-side market participants. The Commission notes that public or independent
representation are one possible approach to governance that can help ensure consistency with the
fair representation and public interest requirements in Section 17A of the Exchange Act. In
addition, and for the same reasons, the Commission is declining to modify Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) to
provide further specification regarding business relationships and affiliates because these topics,

206

See id. at 15.

73

like the above, are already addressed by the fair representation requirement in Section
17A(b)(3)(C) and the public interest requirements of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.
Separate from the above, one commenter also encouraged the Commission to specify that
independent directors must support the objectives of customers and the public, rather than simply
the clearing members. 207 The Commission notes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)(iii) requires policies
and procedures that support not only the public interest considerations of Section 17A of the
Exchange Act but also the objectives of both owners and participants. In addition, the
Commission generally believes that the governance arrangements of a covered clearing agency
should include consideration of the interests of participants’ customers and other stakeholders,
and this is why the Commission is modifying proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2), as previously
discussed, to include new paragraph (vi), which requires policies and procedures for governance
arrangements that consider the interests of participants’ customers and other stakeholders.
Further, the Commission notes that the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Exchange
Act, which require that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to, in general, protect investors
and the public interest, also address the commenter’s concern.
iii. Accountability of the Board of Directors and Senior
Management
One commenter expressed concern that the proposed rules fail to foster accountability by
the board and management, and the commenter requested that the Commission require covered
clearing agencies to clearly document the roles and responsibilities of the board of directors and
management and implement governance arrangements that specify clear and direct lines of

207

See Better Markets at 7.

74

responsibility. 208 To address this concern, the Commission is modifying proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(2) to include new paragraph (v) to require each covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
for governance arrangements that specify clear and direct lines of responsibility. 209 The
Commission believes that such policies and procedures should generally entail documenting the
responsibilities of the board of directors and senior management, which could help foster
accountability and complement the requirements described above that address the qualifications
of the board and management. The Commission believes that this additional requirement will
assist a covered clearing agency in formulating its policies and procedures for assessing the
qualifications of board members and management by requiring the covered clearing agency to
further specify the roles that each individual would fulfill and the lines of responsibility that
would exist within the board and within management. The Commission believes that such
accountability can help ensure that a covered clearing agency is well-positioned to fulfill its risk
management obligations. For example, the Commission believes that a covered clearing agency
should clearly define roles and responsibilities for addressing governance over financial risk
(including credit risk, margin, and liquidity risk), operational risk, and other risks reflected in the
covered clearing agency’s risk management framework.
iv. Conflicts of Interest
One commenter stated that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) does not require covered
clearing agencies to resolve conflicts of interests among board members and management and
urged the Commission explicitly to require covered clearing agencies to document and maintain
208

See id. at 3.

209

See Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)(v), infra Part VI; ; see also infra Part II.C.2.c.

75

policies and procedures governing the resolution of conflicts of interests that may impact certain
decisions by the board of directors. 210 The Commission notes, as discussed above, that the
commenter’s concern is addressed by Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Exchange Act, which requires
that the rules of a clearing agency be designed, in general, to protect investors and the public
interest. 211
v. Crisis or Emergency Decision-Making
One commenter stated that governance arrangements should explicitly address decisionmaking during a crisis or emergency and require the covered clearing agency to obtain the views
and approval of member representatives (such as through its risk committee or otherwise) before
taking any material action in response to an emergency. 212 After careful consideration, the
Commission declines to modify Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) to specifically address decision-making in a
crisis or emergency, and the Commission believes that Rule 17Ad-22(e) addresses such
circumstances as proposed. For instance, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) requires policies and procedures
for governance that are clear and transparent, clearly prioritize the safety and efficiency of the
covered clearing agency, and support the public interest requirements in Section 17A and the
objectives of owners and participants. A covered clearing agency should generally consider

210

See Better Markets at 6.

211

In addition, the Commission has solicited comments on proposed rules designed to
further address conflicts of interest. See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at
29589 & n.664; see also Exchange Act Release No. 34-64017 (Mar. 3, 2011), 76 FR 14472
(Mar. 16, 2011) (proposing Rule 17Ad-25 to address conflicts of interest and Rule 17Ad-26 to
require standards for board members or board committee directors at registered clearing
agencies); Exchange Act Release No. 34-63107 (Oct. 14, 2010), 75 FR 65881 (Oct. 26, 2010)
(proposing Regulation MC to mitigate conflicts of interest at security-based swap clearing
agencies).
212

See ISDA at 2.

76

whether its governance arrangements for decision-making in the ordinary course are appropriate
for a crisis or emergency circumstance in light of the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2).
In addition, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) requires policies and procedures that maintain a sound
risk management framework for comprehensively managing risks that arise in or are borne by
the covered clearing agency. Such policies and procedures must be designed to identify,
measure, monitor, and manage those risks and include plans for the recovery and orderly winddown of the covered clearing agency. 213 The Commission believes that such a framework for
comprehensively managing risk generally should consider the need for decision-making in crisis
or emergency circumstances.
vi. Disclosure of Major Board Decisions
Three commenters responded to a question asking whether the Commission should
require covered clearing agencies to have policies and procedures that provide for governance
arrangements that ensure major decisions are disclosed to the public. 214 One commenter
recommended that the proposed rule expressly require that major board decisions having a broad
market impact be disclosed to all relevant stakeholders and the public, except to the extent that
such disclosure is inconsistent with statutory and regulatory confidentiality restrictions. The
commenter noted that the CFTC has included this provision in its requirements for SIDCOs. 215
Another commenter, however, expressed the belief that such a requirement is unnecessary and
that the interests of public stakeholders in having visibility into major decisions are adequately
served through the participation of independent directors, through the rule filing process, and the
213

See Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(i), (ii), infra Part VI.

214

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29522.

215

See ISDA at 2 n.5 (citing 17 CFR 39.32).

77

existing voluntary disclosure practices. 216 A third commenter expressed the view that
publication of board resolutions prior to a determinative decision would be confusing, potentially
misleading or market moving, and could deter open discussions amongst members of the board
of directors. 217
After careful consideration, the Commission declines to modify Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2).
The Commission notes that existing requirements for registered clearing agencies under
Exchange Act Rule 19b-4 provide a mechanism for publishing notice of proposed rule changes,
which in general must be approved by board action or under authority delegated by the board, to
clearing members, the relevant stakeholders, the Commission, and the public. 218 Designated
clearing agencies are further required to submit advance notices under the Clearing Supervision
Act, which provides another mechanism for disclosure. 219 In addition, the requirements in Rule
17Ad-22(e)(23) regarding disclosure will also provide stakeholders and the public with
information regarding certain operations and decisions of covered clearing agencies. 220
vii. Incentives and Skin in the Game
One commenter stated that the Commission should enhance or clarify Rule 17Ad22(e)(2) to ensure that covered clearing agencies have appropriate incentives to oversee and
manage risk in a manner consistent with the public interest and objectives of participants.

216

See OCC at 5.

217

See LCH at 4.

See supra Part I.C.5 (further describing the obligations of a clearing agency with respect
to proposed rule changes).
219

See supra Part I.A.2.

220

See infra Part II.C.23.

78

According to the commenter, safeguards should exist to ensure that a covered clearing agency
with authority to adopt rules, policies, or procedures governing or affecting risk to participants
does not face undue incentives to take on excessive risk in pursuit of increased earnings. 221 The
Commission believes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) sufficiently addresses the commenter’s concern
by requiring policies and procedures that are clear and transparent, clearly prioritize the safety
and efficiency of the covered clearing agency, and support the public interest requirements in
Section 17A of the Exchange Act and the objectives of owners and participants. 222 Rule 17Ad22(e)(3), discussed below, also requires policies and procedures for the comprehensive
management of risk, and other requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e) are specifically designed to
establish a risk management framework that sufficiently accounts for a wide spectrum of risks
that a covered clearing agency may identify, assess, manage, and mitigate. Further, the
Commission believes that, taken as a whole, Rule 17Ad-22(e) requires each covered clearing
agency to undertake careful and ongoing consideration of the risks faced and posed by its
operations. 223
The same commenter also stated that safeguards should exist to ensure that any default
management decision-making body has appropriate incentives. 224 The commenter stated that the
Commission should require that any decision-making body responsible for administering a

221

222

See supra Part II.C.2.a. and note 194 (describing the scope of the public interest
requirements under Section 17A of the Exchange Act).

See supra Parts II.A.2 and II.C.2.b.i (further discussing the risks posed by a covered
clearing agency’s ownership structure, organizational form, markets served, and products

See The Clearing House at 8.

79

covered clearing agency’s default management policies and procedures be composed of
constituencies with significant exposure to potential loss as a consequence of the default
management process. 225
With respect to these comments, the Commission believes, as discussed above, that Rule
17Ad-22(e)(2) includes requirements designed to ensure governance arrangements that clearly
prioritize the safety and efficiency of the covered clearing agency, support the public interest
requirements in Section 17A of the Exchange Act applicable to clearing agencies, and support
the objectives of owners and participants. In addition, the Commission believes that the
requirement in Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Exchange Act to have rules designed, in general, to
protect investors help ensure that a covered clearing agency’s risk management functions are
appropriately aligned with the goal of risk mitigation and responsive to the legitimate concerns
of the relevant constituents. The Commission does not believe that an approach in which a
CCP’s default management process must be governed by a decision-making body composed of
constituencies with significant exposure to potential loss as a consequence of the default
management process is appropriate. Instead, the Commission believes that covered clearing
agencies should be afforded discretion to structure their default management committees and
manage incentives in light of the needs of their unique ownership or governance structures,
provided that their governance arrangements are consistent with the requirements of the
225

See The Clearing House at 2, 9. The commenter further elaborated that the assumption
of risk by a CCP must be governed by a risk management committee comprised of persons
whose interests are aligned by exposure to the losses associated with such risks (including
members and, where a CCP has capital at risk in the waterfall, representatives of the CCP), with
those members with the greatest risk exposure within the CCP constituting the majority of such
committee. The commenter added that such a structure would ensure that the CCP’s risk
management function is appropriately aligned with risk mitigation incentives. See id., annex at
15.

80

Exchange Act and rules and regulations thereunder, including Section 17A(b)(3)(C), concerning
the fair representation of shareholders or members and participants in the administration of the
covered clearing agency’s affairs. The Commission believes that decisions regarding default
management should reside with those who have extensive expertise and expert knowledge of the
tools available at the covered clearing agency to manage a default. Further, even if the risk
exposures of clearing members are generally stable, they can change, perhaps rapidly, during
periods of market stress.
Lastly, the commenter stated that, to ensure that a covered clearing agency’s governance
arrangements align with the public interest and the interest of constituencies subject to the risk of
a clearing agency default, the Commission should require a covered clearing agency to commit
its own capital on a pre-funded basis to satisfy its losses arising from the default of one or more
participants in an amount that equals or exceeds 10% of the aggregate participant contribution to
the clearing or guaranty fund of the covered clearing agency. Further, the commenter stated that
the Commission should require that a covered clearing agency provide, in its relevant rules,
policies, or procedures, that upon the occurrence of a default or series of defaults and application
of all available assets of the defaulting participant(s) to satisfy resulting losses, the covered
clearing agency shall apply its own capital contribution to the relevant clearing or guaranty fund
in full to satisfy any remaining losses prior to the application of any (a) contributions by nondefaulting participants to the clearing or guaranty fund or (b) assessments that the covered
clearing agency require non-defaulting participants to contribute following the exhaustion of
such participant’s funded contributions to the relevant clearing or guaranty fund. 226 The
commenter expressed concern that, absent such a requirement, a CCP’s own exposure to its
226

See The Clearing House at 2.

81

clearing or guaranty fund(s)—often described as “skin in the game”—is generally quite limited
and capped at the amount of the CCP’s funded or dedicated contribution. 227 The commenter
stated that the absence of “skin-in-the-game” insulates a CCP’s owners from losses at the CCP
even though they benefit from the fee income associated with increased activity at the CCP,
regardless of the incremental risk presented by such activity. 228 The commenter stated that,
particularly in the case of for-profit CCPs (or CCPs whose owners or risk decision-makers are
not subject to default risk assumed by the CCP), this misalignment of risk and reward creates
moral hazard and is inconsistent with supporting the public interest and the objectives of
participants. 229
After careful consideration, the Commission declines to modify Rule 17Ad-22(e) to
specifically include a “skin-in-the-game” requirement. The Commission believes that, taken as a
whole, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) facilitates robust governance arrangements and the management of
competing incentives. The Commission believes it is appropriate to provide covered clearing
agencies with flexibility, subject to their obligations and responsibilities as SROs under the
Exchange Act, to structure their default management processes to take into account the
particulars of their financial resources, ownership structures, and risk management frameworks.
The Commission believes that the proper alignment of incentives is an important element of a
covered clearing agency’s risk management practices, and notes that “skin-in-the-game” may
play a role in those risk management practices in many instances but in other instances may not
be essential to a robust governance framework.

c. Final Rule
As discussed above, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) with
modifications. 230 First, the Commission is adopting new paragraph (v), which requires a covered
clearing agency’s governance arrangements to specify clear and direct lines of responsibility, as
discussed above.
Second, the Commission is adopting new paragraph (vi) to require a covered clearing
agency’s governance arrangements to consider the interests of participants’ customers, securities
issuers and holders, and other relevant stakeholders of the covered clearing agency. The
comments received in response to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) expressed concern as to whether a
covered clearing agency will have governance arrangements sufficiently robust to incorporate
the views of the relevant stakeholders and to withstand the influence of potentially improper
incentives. The Commission believes that this modification alleviates these concerns by adding
a requirement to consider the interests of the relevant stakeholders.
Further, because the Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to
address compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2), the Commission is providing the following
guidance that a covered clearing agency generally should consider in establishing and
maintaining its policies and procedures:
•

whether it has objectives that place a high priority on the safety and efficiency of the
covered clearing agency and explicitly support financial stability and other relevant
public interest considerations; 231

230

See Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2), infra Part VI.

231

For these purposes, the relevant public interest considerations are the public interest
requirements in Section 17A of the Exchange Act. See Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)(iii), infra Part VI.

83

•

whether it has documented governance arrangements that provide clear and direct lines of
responsibility and accountability, and whether these arrangements are disclosed to
owners, relevant authorities, participants, and, at a more general level, the public;

•

whether the roles and responsibilities of its board of directors are clearly specified, and
whether there are documented procedures for the functioning of the board of directors,
such as procedures for identifying, addressing, and managing member conflicts of
interest, and for reviewing the board’s overall performance and the performance of its
individual members regularly;

•

whether the board of directors contains suitable members with the appropriate skills and
incentives to fulfill the board’s multiple roles, and whether the board of directors should
include non-executive board members;

•

whether the roles and responsibilities of management have been clearly specified and
whether management has the appropriate experience, mix of skills, and the integrity
necessary to discharge their responsibilities for the operation and risk management of the
covered clearing agency;

•

whether the board of directors has established a clear, documented risk-management
framework that includes the covered clearing agency’s risk-tolerance policy, assigns
responsibilities and accountability for risk decisions, and addresses decision making in
crises and emergencies, and whether the governance arrangements ensure that the riskmanagement and internal control functions have sufficient authority, independence,
resources, and access to the board; and

•

whether the board of directors has ensured that the covered clearing agency’s design,
rules, overall strategy, and major decisions reflect appropriately the legitimate interests of

84

its direct and indirect participants and other relevant stakeholders, and whether major
decisions have been clearly disclosed to relevant stakeholders and, where this is broad
market impact, the public. 232
A covered clearing agency also generally should consider the specific qualifications,
experience, competence, character, skills, incentives, integrity or other relevant attributes to
support a conclusion that an individual nominee can appropriately serve as a board member or on
senior management. Policies and procedures under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)(iv) could consider,
among other things, requirements as to industry experience relevant to the services provided by
the covered clearing agency, educational background, the absence of a disciplinary record, or
other factors relevant to the qualifications of nominees being considered. With respect to Rules
17Ad-22(e)(2)(iv) and (v), the Commission notes that a covered clearing agency generally
should seek to ensure that board members and senior management do not have conflicts of
interest because conflicts of interest could undermine the decision-making process within a
covered clearing agency or interfere with the ability of board members and senior management
to discharge their duties and responsibilities.
In addition, the Commission believes that processes concerning decision-making by a
covered clearing agency during a crisis generally should consider the views of member
representatives and relevant stakeholders before the covered clearing agency takes any material
action. Further any such policies and procedures must be consistent with the fair representation
requirement in Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Exchange Act and the requirement in Section
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Exchange Act that a clearing agency’s rules be designed, in general, to

232

For a discussion of relevant stakeholders, see Part II.C.2.b.i.

85

protect investors and the public interest. 233 Based on these requirements, the Commission
expects that views of members will be well represented in the governance of the covered clearing
agency, including in the design of governance processes for crisis or emergency decisionmaking. In light of the variation of business models across covered clearing agencies, the
Commission believes each covered clearing agency generally should consider how best to
involve members and other relevant stakeholders in the decision-making of the covered clearing
agency, provided that each covered clearing agency’s decision-making process is designed to be
consistent with the fair representation, investor protection, and public interest requirements of
Section 17A of the Exchange Act.
3. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3): Framework for the Comprehensive Management of
Risks
a. Proposed Rule
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain a sound risk management framework for comprehensively managing legal, credit,
liquidity, operational, general business, investment, custody, and other risks that arise in or are
borne by the covered clearing agency. 234 Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(i) would require a
covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to provide for risk management policies, procedures, and
systems designed to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the range of risks that arise in or are
borne by the covered clearing agency, and subject them to review on a specified periodic basis
233

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(C), (F).

234

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29522–24.

86

and approval by the board of directors annually. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(ii) would require
a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to ensure that it establishes plans for the recovery and orderly
wind-down of the covered clearing agency necessitated by credit losses, liquidity shortfalls,
losses from general business risk, or any other losses. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(iii) would
require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to provide risk management and internal audit personnel
with sufficient authority, resources, independence from management, and access to the board of
directors. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(iv) would also require a covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to provide risk management and internal audit personnel with oversight by and a direct reporting
line to a risk management committee and an audit committee of the board of directors,
respectively. Finally, proposed Rule 17A-22(e)(3)(v) would require a covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to provide for an independent audit committee. 235
b. Comments Received and Commission Response
i. General Comments
Multiple commenters expressed support for the proposed rule. 236 One commenter
expressed support for the added attention in the proposed rules to managing the risks faced by
clearing agencies, emphasizing in particular the proposed requirements for recovery and wind-

235

236

See CFA Institute at 1; SRC at 1–2; OCC at 6.

87

down plans. 237 The commenter stated that a recovery and wind-down plan is essential to
containing wide-spread contagion and noted that the requirement would be appropriate for all
registered clearing agencies. 238 The same commenter expressed support for requiring
independence for those conducting audits, as such would be necessary for establishing good
corporate practices and the integrity of the audit process. 239 The commenter, however, also
expressed concern that the proposed rule could be insufficient in preventing systemic failure of
covered clearing agency systems during a financial panic as a result of new financial products
not performing as expected during times of market stress. 240 Similarly, a second commenter
stated that, given the role CCPs play in, and the risks they pose to, the financial markets, CCPs
must benefit from the full panoply of risk-management tools, including strong loss absorbing
capital, margin, and regular stress testing requirements (including assessing how the failure of
multiple, large clearing members would affect the CCP). 241
With respect to the latter two comments, the Commission believes that proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e), taken as a whole, is designed to mitigate the potential for systemic failures and the
failures of CCPs more generally by requiring a covered clearing agency to establish policies and
procedures relating to their governance and operation. Specifically, requirements in Rule 17Ad-

establish new requirements for clearing agencies other than covered clearing agencies.

88

22(e) address capital, 242 margin, 243 and stress testing 244—in addition to other areas of risk
management, such as collateral, 245 credit risk, 246 liquidity risk, 247 links, 248 and participant
default 249—to help ensure that covered clearing agencies benefit from a range of risk
management tools and can continue operating in times of market stress. Moreover, Rule 17Ad22(e)(3) includes requirements for policies and procedures that reflect a comprehensive
framework for risk management and includes additional requirements for policies and
procedures that specifically establish an independent audit committee and recovery and winddown plans. The Commission discusses these elements of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) further in Parts
II.C.3.b.ii and iii below.
ii. Independence of the Audit Committee
One commenter stated that the Commission struck an appropriate balance in requiring
policies and procedures that provide for an independent audit committee and permitting the
board of directors to establish the criteria for independence. 250 The commenter expressed the
view that the definition of independence should be judged in the context of the particular covered

clearing agency, noting that there is value in having persons with extensive industry experience
serving on its audit committee, and it would not want to preclude from service such persons most
likely to have the relevant experience.
iii. Recovery and Wind-Down Plans
Multiple commenters expressed views on proposed requirements concerning recovery
and wind-down plans. 251 One commenter stated that covered clearing agencies should create
robust and credible resolution plans to ensure that they and policymakers can plan for and
mitigate the potential systemic consequences of a CCP failure without taxpayer support. 252 The
commenter noted that important portions of these plans, including the size and nature of lossabsorbing buffers, should be made public so that the public and counterparties can assess the
risks associated with the CCP and its members. 253 With respect to the disclosure of important
aspects of these plans, the Commission notes that Rules 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv) and (v), discussed
below, 254 would require policies and procedures that provide for a comprehensive public
disclosure that describes material rules, policies, and procedures regarding a covered clearing
agency’s recovery and wind-down plans, updated every two years or more frequently as
necessary so that the disclosure remains accurate in all material respects.

251

See SRC at 2. In addressing comments regarding recovery and wind-down plans, the
Commission generally understands that: (i) when a financial company becomes non-viable as a
going concern or insolvent, recovery refers to actions taken that allow the financial company to
sustain its critical operations and services; (ii) resolution (or wind-down), by contrast, refers to
the transferring of the financial company’s critical operations and services to an alternate entity.
252

See SRC at 2.

253

See id.

254

See infra Part II.C.23.

90

Another commenter noted that wind-down may not be a workable option for critical
market infrastructure providers that are the sole providers in a given market. The commenter
expressed the view that while covered clearing agencies should analyze the feasibility of an
orderly wind-down in their plans and include it when appropriate, recovery strategies (i.e.,
strategies to allocate losses outside of, and without requiring, an orderly wind-down and before
the need to initiate resolution proceedings) are the most effective way to promote financial
stability, ensure the continuation of services, and distribute losses in a fair and economically
efficient manner. 255 The Commission is mindful of this concern and believes that, in conducting
its planning, a covered clearing agency generally should consider sole provider status as one of
many factors in a range of potential considerations related to recovery or wind-down, including a
consideration of which options may be the most feasible or workable. The Commission does not
believe, however, that a covered clearing agency’s sole provider status necessarily precludes
wind-down and, thus, a covered clearing agency is required to have policies and procedures to
establish plans for both recovery and orderly wind-down pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(ii).
A third commenter stated that, while the CCA Standards proposing release helps draw
attention to the importance of recovery and wind-down plans having a sound legal basis, the
release provides little guidance with regard to the content of such plans or stakeholder
consultation procedures with respect to their adoption. 256 The commenter noted that, because the
issues surrounding the recovery and resolution of CCPs are novel and complex, new rules,
policies, and procedures addressing recovery and resolution that go beyond existing, capped
assessment powers would be appropriate subject matter for a detailed review by the Commission
255

See DTCC at 6.

256

See ISDA at 3.

91

and public comment. 257 To facilitate a review and public comment, the commenter expressed
the view that the Commission should articulate principles-based standards against which orderly
recovery and wind-down plans could be assessed, including limited and predictable liabilities of
clearing participants; non-disruption of expectations regarding close-out netting sets; consistency
with accounting criteria for the netting of cleared exposures for financial statement and
regulatory capital purposes; a requirement that loss-allocation rules not put any non-defaulting
clearing member or customer of a clearing member in a worse position than under a liquidation
in the event of the insolvency of the covered clearing agency; due consideration of the effects on
incentives for participation in the default management process and clearing agency moral hazard
risks; and transparency in relation to the default management process, loss allocations, and the
decision-making process governing recovery and wind-down. 258
First, the Commission believes that the factors described by the commenter, among
others, are factors that a covered clearing agency could consider in developing its recovery and
wind-down plans, but the Commission is declining to articulate requirements for all recovery and
wind-down plans. The Commission believes that, given the nature of recovery and resolution
planning, such plans are likely to closely reflect the specific characteristics of the covered
clearing agency, including its ownership, organizational, and operational structures, as well as
the size, systemic importance, global reach, and/or the risks inherent in the products it clears. 259
In particular, the Commission notes that the available recovery tools will vary depending on the
257

See id.

258

See id.

259

See supra Parts II.A.2 and II.C.2.b.i (further discussing the differing characteristics of a
covered clearing agency related to its ownership structure, organizational form, markets served,
and products cleared).

92

products cleared. Second, the Commission also believes that recovery and wind-down plans
should be subject to public comment and Commission review. The Commission believes that
recovery and wind-down plans, and material changes thereto, would constitute a proposed rule
change under Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act and, for designated clearing agencies, an
advance notice under the Clearing Supervision Act because such plans and material changes
thereto would constitute changes to a stated policy, practice or interpretation of the covered
clearing agency and, for designated clearing agencies, a proposed change to its rules, procedures,
or operations that could materially affect the nature or level of risks presented by the designated
clearing agency. 260
The commenter further stated that recovery tools such as forced allocation, initial margin
haircutting of non-defaulting clearing members, invoicing back, or partial non-voluntary tear-ups
should be avoided, and that pro-rata reduction in a covered clearing agency’s payment
obligations should be considered only as a loss allocation measure of last resort after all the
resources in the clearing waterfall have been exhausted. 261 The commenter noted that this
method is transparent and predictable, creating incentives for surviving participants to actively
engage in the default management process and to bid aggressively in the resulting auction
process. 262 The commenter acknowledged, however, that the sequencing and application of any

260

See supra Part I.C.5 (further describing the obligations of a clearing agency with respect
to proposed rule changes under Rule 19b-4 and advance notices under the Clearing Supervision
Act).
261

See ISDA at 3. Similarly, two other commenters also recommend that the Commission
specifically prohibit covered clearing agencies from using variation margin and initial margin
haircutting as recovery tools to continue operation in times of financial distress. See Fidelity at
3–4; see also ICI at 13–14.
262

See ISDA at 3.

93

recovery mechanisms may vary by product type and the nature of the covered clearing agency’s
participants, such as, for example, how certain mechanisms would apply to retail participants. 263
As a general matter, the Commission believes it is not productive to apply such
requirements for recovery and wind-down plans in a one-size-fits-all approach for covered
clearing agencies. The Commission believes that recovery and wind-down plans should be
considered holistically, taking into consideration the covered clearing agency’s governance
structure, products cleared, loss allocation rules, and mutualized structure, as applicable, because
it is not possible to assess the utility of a particular recovery tool in isolation and without the
context of the recovery plan as a whole. The Commission also believes that transparent
governance arrangements can help ensure that members, their customers, and, as appropriate, the
public have sufficient means to provide input on any recovery tools ultimately included in
recovery and wind-down plans. In Part II.C.3.c below, the Commission provides guidance
regarding the types of considerations that a covered clearing agency generally should consider in
developing its recovery tools.
Finally, the commenter suggested that the Commission’s rule should state explicitly that
covered clearing agencies’ recovery and wind-down plans must define the quantitative and
qualitative criteria that would trigger the implementation of each type of plan. 264 The
commenter did not specify what types of quantitative or qualitative criteria should trigger
implementation.
After careful consideration, the Commission declines to establish a requirement that
recovery and wind-down plans have qualitative and quantitate trigger criteria. The Commission
263

See id. at 4.

264

See ISDA at 4.

94

believes that such a requirement would not sufficiently take into account the unique
characteristics of each covered clearing agency. The Commission believes it is not possible to
assess the utility of a particular approach in isolation and without the context of the recovery plan
and the covered clearing agency as a whole. Further, the Commission believes that transparent
governance arrangements can help ensure that members, their customers, and, as appropriate, the
public have sufficient means to provide input on any recovery tools ultimately included in
recovery and wind-down plans and therefore believes that consideration of such elements of a
covered clearing agency’s recovery and wind-down plan is best left to the applicable rule filings
and advance notice processes discussed previously.
iv. Additional Requirements
One commenter supported the proposed requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) but urged
the Commission to establish additional requirements in three areas to ensure accountability and
independence. 265
First, the commenter encouraged the Commission to require the risk management
framework at covered clearing agencies to assign responsibilities and accountabilities for risk
decisions and address crisis and emergency decision-making. The Commission believes that
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2), as modified and discussed in Part II.C.2 above, appropriately addresses
these concerns. Specifically, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)(v), as adopted, requires that a covered clearing
agency’s policies and procedures document the responsibilities of the board of directors and
senior management and specify clear and direct lines of responsibility. In the above discussion,

265

See Better Markets at 8–9

95

the Commission also specifically noted the importance of clear and direct lines of responsibility
in addressing crises and facilitating appropriate decision-making in emergency situations. 266
Second, the commenter urged the Commission to require the board of directors to have a
risk committee comprised of and led by a majority of independent directors; the risk committee
to have a clear mandate and operating procedures; and the risk committee to have access to
external expert advice. 267 The commenter also encouraged the Commission to implement
enhanced measures to ensure that important risk management functions are appropriately
insulated from conflicts of interest among board members representing clearing members. The
Commission believes that the rule as proposed already addresses these concerns. Rule 17Ad22(e)(3)(iii) requires a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to provide risk
management and internal audit personnel with, among other things, sufficient independence from
management and access to the board of directors. In addition, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(iv)
requires policies and procedures that provide risk management and internal audit personnel with
a direct reporting line to, and oversight by, a risk management committee and an audit committee
of the board of directors, respectively. With respect to having a risk committee comprised of and
led by a majority of independent directors, the Commission notes that although it may be
appropriate for a risk committee to be comprised of and led by a majority of independent
directors, the Commission believes that the covered clearing agency would have to consider its
particular facts and circumstances, and that it is inappropriate to prescribe a particular structure
for risk committees in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3). The Commission further notes that the definition of

266

See supra Part II.C.2.b.iii.

267

See Better Markets at 9.

96

independence should reflect the objective of establishing and maintaining robust risk
management.
Third, the commenter requested that the Commission require a covered clearing agency
to have a chief risk officer responsible for implementing the risk management framework and
making recommendations to the risk management committee or board of directors. The
Commission believes that establishing a chief risk officer is one way to structure a risk
management framework consistent with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) and notes that, currently, each
covered clearing agency has a chief risk officer responsible for implementing the covered
clearing agency’s risk management framework. The Commission recognizes that these
responsibilities are critically important but does not believe it is necessary to prescribe a chief
risk officer because other distributions of responsibility among the roles within a covered
clearing agency may also be consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act, provided that
the responsibilities are clearly specified, the persons occupying the specified roles have
appropriate experience and skills to discharge their duties and responsibilities, and the
responsibilities comprehensively encompass the risk management needs of the clearing agency.
c. Final Rule
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) with one modification. To make clear
that the audit committee described in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(iv) and the independent audit
committee described in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(v) are not separate audit committees, the
Commission is adding “independent” before audit committee in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(iv). 268 In
addition, because the Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to address
compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3), the Commission is providing the following guidance that a
268

See Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3), infra Part VI.

97

covered clearing agency generally should consider in establishing and maintaining policies and
procedures for its framework for the comprehensive management of risk:
•

whether it has risk management policies, procedures, and systems that enable it to
identify, measure, monitor, and manage the range of risks that arise in or are borne by the
covered clearing agency and whether the risk management frameworks are subject to
periodic review;

•

whether it provides incentives to participants and, where relevant, their customers to
manage and contain the risks they pose to the covered clearing agency;

•

whether it regularly reviews the material risks it bears from and poses to other entities
(including other clearing agencies, settlement banks, liquidity providers, and service
providers) as a result of interdependencies and develop appropriate risk management
tools to address these risks;

•

whether it can identify scenarios that may potentially prevent it from being able to
provide its critical operations and services as a going concern and assess the effectiveness
of a full range of options for recovery or orderly wind-down, and whether it has prepared
appropriate plans for its recovery or orderly wind-down based on the results of that
assessment; and

•

whether it has provided relevant authorities with the information needed for purposes of
recovery and resolution planning.

The Commission notes that a comprehensive approach to risk management means policies and
procedures should be designed holistically, be consistent with each other, and work effectively
together to mitigate the risk of financial losses to a covered clearing agency’s members and
participants in the markets it serves. The Commission further notes that each covered clearing

98

agency must have its own policies and procedures encompassing a framework for the
“comprehensive” management of risks. For example, if a covered clearing agency’s parent or
holding company were to adopt a company-wide risk management framework, the covered
clearing agency nevertheless would itself need to adopt or ratify those policies and procedures
pursuant to the requirements of the rule filing process under Rule 19b-4 and, if applicable, the
advance notice process under the Clearing Supervision Act, 269 with respect to its own business to
meet the requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3).
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(i), the board of directors of a covered clearing
agency generally should consider whether to subject all material components of the covered
clearing agency’s risk management policies and procedures to review due to the critical role that
risk management plays in promoting prompt and accurate clearance and settlement. Further,
such review generally should take a holistic view of the full range of risk management policies,
procedures, and systems, rather than consider each on an individual or case-by-case basis. In
addition, a covered clearing agency generally should perform the annual review under Rule
17Ad-22(e)(3)(i) once every twelve months.
With respect to recovery and wind-down plans, each covered clearing agency generally
should develop its plans expeditiously to facilitate regulatory review by the Commission and
other relevant regulatory bodies. In particular, the Commission believes that a covered clearing
agency generally should have policies and procedures to provide the relevant resolution
authorities with information needed for the purposes of resolution planning under applicable
authority, including any plans prepared pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3). The Commission works
with the FDIC and other resolution authorities, as appropriate, to help ensure the development of
269

See supra Parts I.A.1 and 2.

99

effective resolution strategies for covered clearing agencies; providing the Commission and the
FDIC information for resolution planning would promote the ongoing development of these
strategies.
In addition, with respect to recovery tools, a covered clearing agency generally should
consider the following when developing its recovery tools: (i) whether the set of recovery tools
comprehensively addresses how the covered clearing agency would continue to provide critical
services in all relevant scenarios; (ii) the extent to which each tool is reliable, timely, and has a
strong legal basis; (iii) whether the tools are transparent and designed to allow those who would
bear losses and liquidity shortfalls to measure, manage, and control their potential losses and
liquidity shortfalls; (iv) whether the tools create appropriate incentives for the covered clearing
agency’s owners, direct and indirect participants, and other relevant stakeholders; and (v)
whether the tools are designed to minimize the negative impact on direct and indirect participants
and the financial system more broadly.
4. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4): Credit Risk
a. Proposed Rule
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
effectively identify, measure, monitor, and manage its credit exposures to participants and those
exposures arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement processes, including by, at a
minimum, meeting the seven requirements specified in the rule. 270
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
270

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29525–27.

100

maintain sufficient financial resources to cover its credit exposure to each participant fully with a
high degree of confidence. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii) would require a covered clearing
agency that provides CCP services, and that is “systemically important in multiple jurisdictions”
or “a clearing agency involved in activities with a more complex risk profile,” to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain additional financial resources, to the extent not already maintained pursuant to
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i), at a minimum level necessary to enable it to cover a wide range
of foreseeable stress scenarios, including but not limited to the default of the two participant
families that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for the covered
clearing agency in extreme but plausible market conditions (hereinafter the “cover two”
requirement). The Commission also proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(19) to define “systemically
important in multiple jurisdictions” to mean a covered clearing agency that has been determined
by the Commission to be systemically important in more than one jurisdiction pursuant to Rule
17Ab2-2. 271 Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iii) would require a covered clearing agency that is
not subject to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii) to establish, implement, maintain and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain additional financial resources, to
the extent not already maintained pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i), at the minimum to
enable it to cover a wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios, including the default of the
participant family that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for the
covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible market conditions (hereinafter the “cover one”
271

See id. at 29525. The Commission received no comments regarding the proposed
definition and is adopting it as proposed. Because of other modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(a),
the definition of “systemically important in multiple jurisdictions” is being moved to Rule 17Ad22(a)(18). See Rule 17Ad-22(a)(18), infra Part VI.

101

requirement). Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iv) would require a covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to include prefunded financial resources, excluding assessments for additional guaranty fund
contributions or other resources that are not prefunded, when calculating the financial resources
available to meet the standards under proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iii), as
applicable. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(v) would require a covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to maintain the financial resources required under proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iii),
as applicable, in combined or separately maintained clearing or guaranty funds.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to test the
sufficiency of its total financial resources available to meet the minimum financial resource
requirements under proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iii), as applicable, by conducting a
stress test of its total financial resources at least once each day using standard predetermined
parameters and assumptions. 272 The Commission also proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(18) to define
“stress testing” to mean the estimation of credit and liquidity exposures that would result from
the realization of extreme but plausible price changes or changes in other valuation inputs and
assumptions. 273 Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi) would also require a covered clearing agency
to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
272

273

See id. at 29527. The Commission received no comments regarding the proposed
definition and, based on its supervisory experience, is adopting it with modifications, as
discussed further below. Because of other modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(a), the definition of
“stress testing” is also being moved to Rule 17Ad-22(a)(17). See Rule 17Ad-22(a)(17), infra
Part VI.

designed to conduct a comprehensive analysis on at least a monthly basis of the existing stress
testing scenarios, models, and underlying parameters and assumptions, and consider
modifications to ensure they are appropriate for determining the covered clearing agency’s
required level of default protection in light of current market conditions. When the products
cleared or markets served by a covered clearing agency display high volatility or become less
liquid, and when the size or concentration of positions held by the entity’s participants increases
significantly, the proposed rule would require a covered clearing agency to have policies and
procedures for conducting comprehensive analyses of stress testing scenarios, models, and
underlying parameters and assumptions more frequently than monthly. Proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(4)(vi) would also require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for the reporting of the
results of this analysis to the appropriate decision makers at the covered clearing agency,
including its risk management committee or board of directors, and to require the use of the
results to evaluate the adequacy of and to adjust its margin methodology, model parameters, and
any other relevant aspects of its credit risk management policies and procedures, in supporting
compliance with the minimum financial resources requirements in proposed Rules 17Ad22(e)(4)(i) through (iii), as applicable. 274
Finally, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vii) would require a covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to require a conforming model validation for its credit risk models to be performed not less than
annually or more frequently as may be contemplated by the covered clearing agency’s risk

274

See id. at 29526–27.

103

management policies and procedures. 275 The Commission also proposed to define “conforming
model validation” in Rule 17Ad-22(a)(5) to mean an evaluation of the performance of each
material risk management model used by a covered clearing agency, including initial margin
models, liquidity risk models, and models used to generate guaranty fund requirements, along
with the related parameters and assumptions associated with such models. 276 The proposed
definition would further require that the model validation be performed by a qualified person
who is free from influence from the persons responsible for the development or operation of the
models or policies being validated so that risk models can be candidly assessed. 277
b. Comments Received and Commission Response
i. Distinguishing CCPs from CSDs
One commenter stated that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) should distinguish between the
types of risks faced by CCPs versus central securities depositories (“CSDs”) (e.g., the
requirement that CSDs hold the financial resources they maintain to cover the risk of participant
default in a guaranty or clearing fund). 278 The commenter recommended that the provision be
revised to clarify the portions of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) that are intended to apply to
covered clearing agencies that are CCPs, and those that should apply to covered clearing

275

See id. at 29527.

276

See id.

277

The Commission is modifying the definition to strike the word “conforming,” as
described in Part II.C.4.c below. Because of this and other modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(a),
the Commission is moving the definition of “model validation” to Rule 17Ad-22(a)(9). See infra
Part VI.
278

See DTCC at 5.

104

agencies that are CSDs. 279 As a general matter, the Commission believes that Rule 17Ad22(e)(4) appropriately distinguishes between the risks inherent in CCPs and CSDs. For example,
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii) requires policies and procedures that meet “cover two” for CCPs that are
systemically important or engaged in activities with a more complex risk profile, while Rules
17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) and (iii) require policies and procedures for financial resources for all other
covered clearing agencies, including CSDs. 280 With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(v), which
requires a covered clearing agency to have policies and procedures for maintaining the financial
resources required under Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iii) in combined or separately
maintained clearing or guaranty funds, “clearing or guaranty fund” would also include the
participant fund of a CSD. 281 The Commission believes that this statement clarifies how Rule
17Ad-22(e)(4) would apply to both CCPs and CSDs, and therefore addresses the concern raised
by the commenter.
ii. Prefunded Financial Resources
One commenter expressed support for proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iv) but sought
clarification on the role of using default insurance to satisfy the rule. 282 The Commission is
aware that default insurance has been discussed among industry participants as a tool to help
CCPs manage credit risk. While the viability of any particular default insurance plan would
necessarily depend on the particulars of the underlying insurance agreement, the Commission

279

See id. at 5; id. at A-1 (suggesting drafting clarifications to proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(4)).
280

See supra Part II.C.4.a.

281

See id. at 5.

282

See Barnard at 2.

105

notes that the financial resource requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) must be prefunded and may
not be conditional as is typical with insurance payments. Therefore, the use of default insurance
generally would not be consistent with the requirement that certain financial resources be
prefunded under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iv).
While generally supportive of the rule, another commenter expressed concern that
members of covered clearing agencies may have difficulty meeting their obligations to the
covered clearing agency if the covered clearing agency delays in exercising its authority to
require members to provide additional guaranty funds after such funds are exhausted following
the default of a member. 283 To address this concern, the commenter stated that it would be
appropriate to ensure that such guaranty funds are properly funded in advance of market stress.
The Commission believes that the provisions in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) adequately
address whether the guaranty fund is properly funded in advance of market stress and is therefore
declining to modify the rule. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) requires policies and procedures for
maintaining sufficient financial resources to cover a covered clearing agency’s credit exposure to
each participant fully with a high degree of confidence through its margin system and collateral
requirements, while Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii) and (iii) require a covered clearing agency to have
policies and procedures that meet either “cover two” or “cover one” on an ongoing basis. In
addition, the Commission notes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iv) excludes assessments for additional
guaranty fund contributions when calculating the financial resources available, preventing a
covered clearing agency from considering among its financial resources contributions that are
not prefunded.

283

See CFA Institute at 7–8.

106

A third commenter stated that, in addition to pre-funded capital and guaranty funds, it
should be clear, in advance, that clearing members (and not the FRB or taxpayers) stand behind
the organization should it run into financial trouble. 284 The Commission notes that Rule 17Ad22(e)(3)(ii) requires policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that a covered
clearing agency establishes plans for the recovery or wind-down of a covered clearing agency
necessitated by credit losses, liquidity shortfalls, losses from general business risk, or any other
losses. The Commission believes that such recovery and wind-down plans are an effective tool
that can help a covered clearing agency establish policies and procedures for managing losses in
excess of its default management and general business risk resources. 285 The provisions of Rule
17Ad-22(e)(5), discussed below, are also intended to help ensure that a covered clearing agency
is resilient in times of market stress by requiring policies and procedures that limit the assets it
accepts as collateral to those with low credit, liquidity, and market risks, and that set and enforce
appropriately conservative haircuts and concentration limits on collateral the covered clearing
agency accepts to manage its or its participants’ credit exposure. 286 Requirements for stress
testing in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) and margin in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) further support the resiliency of
a covered clearing agency by requiring the covered clearing agency to have policies and
procedures that are designed to appropriately size guaranty fund contributions and margin to
market risks. 287 In addition, requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) for policies and procedures
relating to participation in the covered agency require (i) objective and risk-based criteria for
284

107

participation, (ii) participants to have sufficient financial resources and robust operational
capacity to meet obligations arising from participation in the covered clearing agency, and (iii)
monitor compliance with such participation criteria on an ongoing basis. 288 Taken as a whole,
the Commission believes that the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e) comprehensively promote the
resiliency of a covered clearing agency and, in particular, its ability to withstand periods of
market stress.
iii. Segregation of Guaranty Funds
One commenter suggested that, to prevent the spread of losses from one product or asset
type to participants or customers participating in another product or asset type, as well as to
avoid the inequitable treatment of participants clearing less liquid product or asset types, the
Commission should require a covered clearing agency to implement policies and procedures that
would, upon the insolvency of a particular clearing service or the clearing agency as a whole,
contain related losses within the particular clearing service. 289 The commenter stated that the
Commission should require covered clearing agencies to maintain separate clearing or guaranty
funds for product or asset types that exhibit materially different liquidity profiles. 290 The
commenter also stated that combined clearing or guaranty funds, in contrast, transmit losses from
one product or asset type to participants and customers participating in another product or asset
type in a manner that promotes contagion and systemic risk, which the commenter believes is
inconsistent with the PFMI. 291 The commenter further argued that combined clearing or
288

See infra Part II.C.18.

289

See The Clearing House at 3, 17.

290

See id. at 17.

291

See id.

108

guaranty funds are not consistent with the requirement for the equitable treatment of participants
in Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Exchange Act where the cleared products display materially
different liquidity characteristics. 292
First, the Commission notes that Section 17A(b)(3)(D), which sets forth one of the
determinations that the Commission must make in registering a clearing agency, does not
concern clearing or guaranty fund contributions; rather Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Exchange
Act states that the rules of the clearing agency must provide for the equitable allocation of
reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its participants. 293
Second, the Commission believes that a clearing agency can use both margin—targeted
to the risk profile of the participant and used to satisfy losses attributed to the participant—and
guaranty or clearing fund contributions—targeted to the risk profile of the participant and then
mutualized in a pooled fund to satisfy losses attributable to the clearing agency—to help mitigate
the transmission of losses across participants. The Commission disagrees with the commenter’s
suggestion that a pooled fund necessarily promotes contagion and systemic risk; a pooled fund
may offer certain benefits. For instance, a pooled fund can help mitigate the possibility that
participants in the clearing agency will be called upon to help satisfy losses when a defaulting
participant is unable to satisfy those losses, and a clearing agency should carefully assess the
structure of its default waterfall to analyze the potential risk mitigation tools that might be
employed in the default waterfall, including the use of margin and the use of a guaranty or
clearing fund. To the extent that a clearing agency uses guaranty or clearing fund contributions
292

See id. (citing 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(D)).

293

For purposes of this section, the Commission is assuming that “clearing fund,” in contrast
to guaranty fund, refers to a combined pool of both margin collections and guaranty fund
contributions.

109

to mutualize risk across participants, the clearing agency generally should value margin and
guaranty fund contributions so that the contributions are commensurate to the risks posed by the
participants’ activity. The clearing agency also generally should consider the appropriate
balance of individualized and pooled elements within its default waterfall, with a careful
consideration of whether the balance of those elements mitigates risk and to what extent an
imbalance among those elements might encourage moral hazard, in that one participant may take
more risks because the other participants bear the costs of those risks.
The commenter also suggested that, to facilitate effective risk management and better
protect participant/customer collateral, the Commission should require covered clearing agencies
to calculate, collect, and maintain clearing or guaranty fund contributions and participants’ initial
margin requirements independent of each other, subject to an appropriate transition period. 294
The commenter observed that some covered clearing agencies do not maintain separate clearing
or guaranty fund requirements and initial margin requirements, making it more difficult for
participants to model and manage the risks they face from the covered clearing agency. 295 In
addition, the commenter stated that commingling the treatment of clearing or guaranty fund
contributions with initial margin exposes non-defaulting participants (and potentially their
customers) to the risk of losing their initial margin in the event of another participant’s default, a
result inconsistent with the protection of non-defaulting participant/customer collateral. 296 The

294

See The Clearing House at 3, 17, 18.

295

See id. at 17.

296

See id.
110

commenter stated that initial margin of non-defaulting participants and their clearing customers
should not be at risk as part of the default waterfall. 297
Further, the commenter recommended that the Commission modify proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(4)(v) to require a covered clearing agency that provides clearing services for two or more
product or asset types that have materially different liquidity characteristics to segregate the
clearing services for each such product or asset type and organize and structure itself and adopt
such rules as shall be necessary to (i) continue operations for other clearing services
notwithstanding the need to wind down operations for a particular clearing service and (ii)
prevent the use of a particular clearing service’s resources to cover losses that occur in a separate
clearing service. 298
The Commission is declining to incorporate these specific recommendation into Rule
17Ad-22(e)(4)(v). To the extent that these types of commingled arrangements are employed,
they must be prefunded and therefore agreed to by the participants ex ante, prior to becoming
members of the covered clearing agency. The Commission acknowledges that loss
mutualization and other pooling-of-resources arrangements involve trade-offs that a clearing
agency generally should carefully assess and balance. A covered clearing agency may be better
able to manage multiple defaults in extreme conditions more efficiently using pooled resources
because the pooled resources would be greater than the resources of any single defaulting
participant. Further, because the arrangements are prefunded, participants can model and
manage the risks they face from the clearing agency while being able to take into account the
amount of resources that they have provided to the clearing agency. The pooling of resources,
297

See id. at 17, 18.

298

See The Clearing House at 18.

111

however, can increase interdependencies among, and therefore the potential risks to, participants
of the clearing agency. The Commission believes that considering the use of loss mutualization
and other pooling-of-resources arrangements generally should, to minimize systemic risk,
balance the safety and soundness of the covered clearing agency against the potential for
increased exposures among participants that may arise from the manner the covered clearing
agency holds financial resources. The Commission further notes that, pursuant to Rule 17Ad22(e)(23), a covered clearing agency must establish, implement, maintain, and enforce written
policies reasonably designed to disclose, among other things, key aspects of its default rules and
procedures and the risks, fees, and other material costs participants incur by participating in the
covered clearing agency. The availability of these policies and procedures should allow
participants to understand in advance a covered clearing agency’s reliance on either on a
defaulter-pays approach or a pooling-of-resources approach. 299
iv. Stress Testing
Commenters generally supported the use of stress testing and model validation and the
approach taken in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4), 300 but one commenter recommended that the rule also
include a requirement for reverse stress testing. In the commenter’s view, reverse stress testing
is a useful tool to manage expectations and to help anticipate financial resource requirements in
extreme conditions. 301 The Commission also believes that reverse stress testing can be a useful
tool to evaluate the adequacy of financial resources, but the Commission is declining to modify

299

See infra Parts II.C.18 and II.C.23 (describing requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e) for
access and participation and disclosure of rules, key procedures, and market data).
300

See, e.g., CFA Institute at 8; OCC at 9.

301

See Barnard at 2.

112

Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) to specifically mandate this practice so that each covered clearing agency
retains flexibility, subject to its obligations and responsibilities as an SRO under the Exchange
Act, to develop its stress testing framework in light of the ever-evolving challenges and risks
inherent in the securities markets. Below the Commission provides additional guidance on the
requirement that relates to stress testing in the rule.
c. Final Rule
As previously noted, the Commission is adopting the definition “systemically important
in multiple jurisdictions” as proposed, but because of other modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(a),
the definition is being moved to Rule 17Ad-22(a)(18). 302 The Commission is modifying the
definition of “stress testing” to mean the estimation of credit or liquidity exposures that would
result from the realization of potential stress scenarios, such as extreme price changes, multiple
defaults, or changes in other valuation inputs and assumptions. The Commission believes that
this modification, and in particular the removal of “but plausible,” helps ensure that policies and
procedures for stress testing comprehensively consider a range of stress scenarios that may be
used in sizing the guaranty fund, in light of the variation in markets served and products cleared
by covered clearing agencies. 303 Because of other modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(a), the
definition is being moved to Rule 17Ad-22(a)(17). 304 The Commission is also modifying the
302

See supra note 271; see also Rule 17Ad-22(a)(18), infra Part VI.

303

The Commission notes that this does not alter the coverage requirements in Rules 17Ad22(e)(4)(ii) and (iii), which require policies and procedures that enable a covered clearing agency
to maintain financial resources at a minimum level necessary to enable it to cover a wide range
of foreseeable stress scenarios, including but not limited to the default of the participant family
(in the case of “cover one”) or two participant families (in the case of “cover two”) that would
potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for the covered clearing agency in
extreme but plausible market conditions. See infra Part VI.
304

See supra note 271; see also Rule 17Ad-22(a)(17), infra Part VI.
113

definition of “conforming model validation” by striking “conforming” since the Commission has
not separately defined “model validation” in Rule 17Ad-22(a). Because of this and other
modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(a), the definition of “model validation” has been moved to Rule
17Ad-22(a)(9). 305
In addition, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) with modifications. 306 First,
the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(v) so that it references only paragraphs
(e)(4)(ii) and (iii) (and not paragraph (e)(4)(i)) because a covered clearing agency may hold
financial resources consistent with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i), such as initial margin, separately from
the guaranty or clearing fund. 307 Second, the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vii)
to conform to the revised definition of “model validation” and striking “to be performed” from
the rule to be consistent with the corresponding requirement for model validation of liquidity risk
models in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vii). Third, the Commission is making a technical correction to
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iv) to make clear that prefunded financial resources should be exclusive of
assessments for additional guaranty fund contributions or other resources that are not prefunded
by modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iv) to state “exclusive of” assessments rather than “excluding”
assessments. Fourth, the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi)(A) to refer to “stress
testing” rather than “a stress test” to improve consistency with the definition of “stress testing” in
Rule 17Ad-22(a)(17). Fifth, the Commission is revising Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi)(C) to replace
“and” with “or” so that the criteria for conducting analysis more frequently than monthly are
305

See Rule 17Ad-22(a)(9), infra Part VI. The Commission is also striking “conforming”
from Rules 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vii) and (e)(7)(vii) consistent with the new “model validation” term.
See infra Parts II.C.6.c and II.C.7.c.

See Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4), infra Part VI.

307

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29526.

114

disjunctive rather than conjunctive, since the criteria described may not be correlated to each
other. This modification is consistent with the Commission’s description of the proposed rule in
the CCA Standards proposing release. 308 Sixth, the Commission is correcting a technical error in
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi)(D): references to paragraphs (e)(4)(iv)(B) and (C) will be changed to
paragraphs (e)(4)(vi)(B) and (C) respectively. Sixth, the Commission is moving requirements
proposed in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) so that all requirements pertinent to a
covered clearing agency’s management of credit risk are contained in one rule. This
modification and the related rule text are discussed in Part II.C.13.c.
Further, because the Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to
address compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4), the Commission is providing the following
guidance that a covered clearing agency generally should consider in establishing and
maintaining policies and procedures that address credit risk:
•

whether it has established a robust framework to manage its credit exposures to its
participants and the credit risks arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement
processes, mindful that credit exposures may arise from current exposures, potential
future exposures, 309 or both;

•

whether it has identified sources of credit risk and can routinely measure and monitor
credit exposures, using appropriate risk management tools to control these risks;

•

if it provides CCP services, whether it has covered its current and potential future
exposures to each participant fully with a high degree of confidence using margin and

308

309

See infra Part II.C.6 (discussing potential future exposures in more detail).

115

other prefunded financial resources, and (i) if it is involved in activities with a morecomplex risk profile or is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions, whether it
maintains additional financial resources to cover a wide range of potential stress
scenarios including but not limited to the default of the two participants and their
affiliates that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for the
covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible market conditions, or (ii) in the case of
all other covered clearing agencies, whether it maintains additional financial resources
sufficient to cover a wide range of potential stress scenarios including but not limited to
the default of the participant and its affiliates that would potentially cause the largest
aggregate credit exposure for the covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible
market conditions;
•

if it provides CCP services, whether it has, consistent with Rules 17Ad-22(e)(2) and
(e)(3), documented its supporting rationale for, and has appropriate governance
arrangements relating to, the amount of total financial resources it maintains;

•

if it provides CCP services: whether it determines the amount and regularly tests the
sufficiency of its total financial resources available in the event of a default or multiple
defaults in extreme but plausible market conditions through rigorous stress testing;
whether it has clear procedures to report the result of its stress tests to the appropriate
decision makers at the covered clearing agency and can use these results to evaluate the
adequacy of and any appropriate adjustments to its total financial resources; whether it
performs stress tests daily using standard and predetermined parameters and assumptions;
whether it performs, on at least a monthly basis, a comprehensive and thorough analysis
of stress testing scenarios, models, and underlying parameters and assumptions used to

116

ensure they are appropriate for determining the covered clearing agency’s required level
of default protection in light of current and evolving market conditions; whether it
performs this analysis more frequently when the products cleared or markets served
display high volatility, become less liquid, or when the size or concentration of positions
held by its participants increases significant; and whether it performs a full validation of
its risk management model at least annually;
•

if it provides CCP services, whether it considers, in conducting stress testing, the effect of
a wide range of relevant stress scenarios in terms of both defaulters’ positions and
possible price changes in liquidation periods, and whether scenarios include relevant peak
historic price volatilities, shifts in other market factors such as price determinants and
yield curves, multiple defaults over various time horizons, simultaneous pressures in
funding and asset markets, and a spectrum of forward-looking stress scenarios in a
variety of extreme but plausible market conditions; and

•

whether it has established explicit rules and procedures that address fully any credit
losses the covered clearing agency may face as a result of any individual or combined
default among its participants with respect to any of their obligations to the covered
clearing agency, addressing how potentially uncovered credit losses would be allocated,
including the repayment of any funds the covered clearing agency may borrow from
liquidity providers, and indicating the covered clearing agency’s process to replenish any
financial resources that the covered clearing agency may employ during a stress event so
it can continue to operate in a safe and sound manner.

117

With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i), “high degree of confidence” generally refers to the
meaning of the term as it is used in statistical analysis. 310 With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii)
and (iii), a covered clearing agency generally should use statistical methods to develop models
that estimate the financial resources required. With respect to the relationship among Rules
17Ad-22(e)(4)(i), (ii), and (iii), the Commission notes that the requirements to examine credit
exposure under foreseeable stress scenarios including extreme but plausible market conditions in
proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii) and (iii), as applicable, means a covered clearing agency
generally should consider how its credit exposure modeled under such conditions differs from its
credit exposure modeled under normal market conditions to positions of such participants, which
it would also be required to measure, pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i). With respect
to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iv), the Commission notes the following:
•

While the ability to assess participants for contributions under applicable covered
clearing agency governing documents, rules, or agreements could not be included in this
calculation until an assessment has been levied and collected, previously paid-in
participant contributions to the covered clearing agency’s default fund could be counted,
to the extent the covered clearing agency’s rules, policies, or procedures permit such
resources to be used in a manner equivalent to other financial resources in the default
fund.

•

Other sources of prefunded resources, such as margin previously posted to the clearing
agency by participants, may also be treated in this manner.

310

See, e.g., Arthur S. Goldberger, A Course in Econometrics 122–23 (Harvard Univ. Press,
2003) (defining confidence intervals for parameter estimates).

118

•

The ability to draw down under a revolving loan facility could not be counted towards
prefunded resources because funds from such a loan facility would not be in the covered
clearing agency’s immediate possession until they were drawn down, but the covered
clearing agency could count borrowed funds already drawn down, such as under a term
loan or other credit facility.
With respect to stress testing under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi) as a general matter, the

Commission believes that reverse stress testing can be a useful tool to evaluate the adequacy of
financial resources. The Commission believes that a covered clearing agency generally should
consider incorporating the use of reverse stress testing into its policies and procedures under
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi), and if a covered clearing agency determines not to use reverse stress
testing, it generally should indicate why in its policies and procedures. With respect to the
references to “high volatility” and “less liquid” referenced in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi), the
Commission notes that what would constitute such circumstances may vary across asset classes.
With respect to the definition of “model validation” and its use in Rule 17Ad22(e)(4)(vii), a covered clearing agency generally should consider a person free from influence
when that person does not perform functions associated with the clearing agency’s models and
does not report to a person who performs these functions. The definition of “model validation”
does not require policies and procedures for separating model review from model development
or for maintaining two separate quantitative teams within the clearing agency. With respect to
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vii) and policies and procedures for performing the model validation not less
than annually, a covered clearing agency generally should perform the model validation not less
than once every twelve months.

119

With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(viii), the Commission notes that managing a member
default may involve hedging open positions, funding collateral so that the positions can be closed
out over time, or both. A covered clearing agency may decide to auction or allocate open
positions to its participants, but, to the extent possible, a covered clearing agency generally
should allow non-defaulting members to continue to manage their positions in the ordinary
course. In developing policies and procedures pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ix), a covered
clearing agency generally should consider specifying the order of use of different types of
resources, including (i) assets provided by the defaulting member (such as margin or other
collateral), (ii) the guaranty fund of the covered clearing agency, (iii) capital calls on members,
and (iv) credit facilities. A covered clearing agency generally should have policies and
procedures that describe (i) how resources that have been depleted as a result of a member
default would be replenished over time and (ii) what burdens a non-defaulting member may bear.
5. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5): Collateral
a. Proposed Rule
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit
the assets it accepts as collateral to those with low credit, liquidity, and market risks, and set and
enforce appropriately conservative haircuts and concentration limits if the covered clearing
agency requires collateral to manage its own or its participants’ credit exposures. In addition,
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) would require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to include a not-less-than-

120

annual review of the sufficiency of a covered clearing agency’s collateral haircuts and
concentration limits. 311
b. Comments Received
Commenters were generally supportive of the proposed approach, but two commenters
supported further clarification regarding the type of collateral a covered clearing agency can
accept. 312
One commenter stressed that the ability to accept equity securities as collateral is
critically important to its systemic risk mitigation efforts and believes that it should be permitted
to continue accepting such securities as collateral within its existing framework. 313 The
commenter sought to clarify that an appropriately designed portfolio margining system that
permits the use of equity collateral complies with the requirements of proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(5) with respect to quality of collateral. In response, the Commission believes that, for a
portfolio margining system to comply with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5), it would necessarily have to
consider whether such equity collateral has low credit, liquidity, and market risk. This may
require a consideration of whether the collateral carries wrong-way risk. The Commission
provides further guidance on this point in Part II.C.5.c below.
One commenter recommended that the Commission consider establishing prescriptive
standards for eligible collateral. 314 Among other things, the commenter recommended limiting
initial margin to cash in highly liquid currencies, obligations guaranteed by a sovereign that are
311

121

highly liquid, corporate bonds that are highly liquid, equities that are highly liquid, and gold.
The commenter further recommended limiting the assets that a covered clearing agency may
accept as initial margin to collateral that a central bank would accept under an ordinary-course
facility, is deliverable against the collateralized exposure, or is otherwise subject to conservative
risk management practices that the Commission has determined to be adequate to mitigate the
incremental risks associated with the collateral because a central bank would not accept it under
an ordinary-course facility and it is not deliverable against the collateralized exposure. The
commenter further recommended aggregate limits on each type of collateral posted as initial
margin. The commenter also recommended that the Commission prohibit a covered clearing
agency from accepting as initial margin securities issued by a participant or any of its
affiliates. 315
The Commission is mindful of the concerns raised by the commenter but, given the range
of products that covered clearing agencies clear, declines to restrict the types of collateral to the
assets identified by the commenter. A covered clearing agency should have flexibility,
consistent with the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5), to react to changing market conditions.
The Commission notes that a covered clearing agency is required under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) to
have policies and procedures that assess what assets have low credit, liquidity, and market risks
in light of its broader risk management framework and, likewise, what haircuts and concentration
limits are necessary to effectively manage its credit exposure.
c. Final Rule

315

See id. at 10.

122

The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) as proposed. 316 Because the
Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to address compliance with Rule
17Ad-22(e)(5), the Commission is providing the following guidance that a covered clearing
agency generally should consider in establishing and maintaining policies and procedures that
address collateral:
•

whether it has generally limited the assets it accepts as collateral to those with low credit,
liquidity, and market risks;

•

whether it has established prudent valuation practices and developed haircuts that are
regularly tested and take into account stressed market conditions;

•

to reduce the need for procyclical adjustments, whether it has established stable and
conservative haircuts that have been calibrated to include periods of stressed market
conditions, to the extent practical and prudent;

•

whether it has avoided concentrated holdings of certain assets where this would
significantly impair the ability to liquidate such assets quickly without significant adverse
price affects;

•

if it accepts cross-border collateral, whether it has mitigated the risks associated with the
use of cross-border collateral and ensured that the collateral can be used in a timely
manner; and

•

whether it uses a collateral management system that has been well-designed and is
operationally flexible.

316

See Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5), infra Part VI.

123

In assessing what assets have low credit, liquidity, and market risks, a covered clearing agency’s
policies and procedures also generally should account for wrong-way risk, such as the risk that
arises from accepting as initial margin securities issued by a participant or any of its affiliates. 317
Policies and procedures for haircuts and concentration limits generally should account for
wrong-way risk by limiting the acceptance of collateral that would likely lose value in the event
that the participant providing the collateral defaults. For example, this would be true when
accepting equity securities of the participant itself or its affiliates. Further, to reduce the need for
procyclical adjustments, 318 a covered clearing agency generally should consider establishing
stable and conservative haircuts that are calibrated to include periods of stressed market
conditions, to the extent practicable and prudent.
In addition, with respect to policies and procedures for reviewing the sufficiency of its
collateral haircuts and concentration limits not less than annually, a covered clearing agency
generally should perform the review not less than once every twelve months using persons who
are independent from management and have appropriate technical skills.
6. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6): Margin
a. Proposed Rule

317

Wrong-way risk can be either general or specific. General wrong-way risk arises at a
CCP when the potential losses of either a participant’s portfolio or a participant’s collateral is
correlated with the default probability of that participant. Specific wrong-way risk arises at a
CCP when an exposure to a participant is highly likely to increase when the creditworthiness of
that participant is deteriorating.

318

In this context, procyclicality typically refers to changes in risk-management practices
that are positively correlated with market, business, or credit cycle fluctuations that may cause or
exacerbate financial stability. While changes in collateral values tend to be procyclical,
collateral arrangements can increase procyclicality if haircut levels fall during periods of low
market stress and increase during periods of high market stress.

124

As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) would require a covered clearing agency that provides
CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to cover its credit exposures to its participants by establishing a risk-based
margin system that is monitored by management on an ongoing basis and regularly reviewed,
tested, and verified. 319 Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(i) would require a covered clearing agency
that provides CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to result in a margin system that, at a minimum, considers and
produces margin levels commensurate with the risks and particular attributes of each relevant
product, portfolio, and market. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(ii) would require a covered
clearing agency that provides CCP services to establish implement, maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the margin system would mark
participant positions to market and collect margin, including variation margin or equivalent
charges if relevant, at least daily, and include the authority and operational capacity to make
intraday margin calls in defined circumstances. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(iii) would require
a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to calculate margin sufficient to
cover its potential future exposure to participants in the interval between the last margin
collection and the close out of positions following a participant default. The Commission also
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14) to define “potential future exposure” to mean the maximum
exposure estimated to occur at a future point in time with an established single-tailed confidence

319

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29528–31.

125

level of at least 99% with respect to the estimated distribution of future exposure. 320 Proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(iv) would require a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to ensure that it uses reliable sources of timely price data and procedures and sound valuation
models for addressing circumstances in which pricing data are not readily available or reliable.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(v) would require a covered clearing agency that provides CCP
services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to ensure the use of an appropriate method for measuring credit exposure
that accounts for relevant product risk factors and portfolio effects across products.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi) would require a covered clearing agency that provides
CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to regularly review, test, and verify its risk-based margin system by
conducting backtests at least once each day and conducting a conforming sensitivity analysis of
its margin resources and its parameters and assumptions for backtesting at least monthly, and
considering modifications to ensure the backtesting practices are appropriate for determining the
adequacy of its margin resources. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi) would also require a
covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to include conducting a conforming
sensitivity analysis more frequently than monthly when the products cleared or markets served
display high volatility or become less liquid, and when the size or concentration of positions held
by participants increases or decreases significantly. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi) would also
320

See id. at 29529. The Commission received no comments regarding the proposed
definition and is adopting it as proposed. Because of other modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(a),
the definition of “potential future exposure” is being moved to Rule 17Ad-22(a)(13). See infra
Part VI.

126

require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to report the results of such conforming sensitivity analysis
to appropriate decision makers at the covered clearing agency, including its risk management
committee or board of directors, and use these results to evaluate the adequacy of and adjust its
margin methodology, model parameters, and any other relevant aspects of its credit risk
management policies and procedures. 321
With respect to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi), the Commission proposed Rule 17Ad22(a)(1) to define “backtesting” to mean an ex-post comparison of actual outcomes with
expected outcomes derived from the use of margin models. 322 The Commission received no
comments regarding the proposed definition and is adopting it as proposed. 323 The Commission
also proposed to define “sensitivity analysis” to mean an analysis that involves analyzing the
sensitivity of a model to its assumptions, parameters, and inputs. 324 The Commission also
proposed to define “conforming sensitivity analysis” to mean a sensitivity analysis that considers
the impact on the model of both moderate and extreme changes in a wide range of inputs,
parameters, and assumptions, including correlations of price movements or returns if relevant,
which reflect a variety of historical and hypothetical market conditions and actual and
hypothetical portfolios of proprietary positions and, where applicable, customer positions. 325
Under the proposed definition, a conforming sensitivity analysis, when performed by or on

behalf of a covered clearing agency involved in activities with a more complex risk profile,
would consider the most volatile relevant periods, where practical, that have been experienced by
the markets served by the clearing agency. The proposed definition would also require a
conforming sensitivity analysis to test the sensitivity of the model to stressed market conditions,
including the market conditions that may ensue after the default of a member and other extreme
but plausible conditions as defined in a covered clearing agency’s risk policies. 326
Finally, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vii) would require a covered clearing agency that
provides CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to require not less than annually a conforming model validation
of the covered clearing agency’s margin system and related models. 327
b. Comments Received and Commission Response
i. Minimum Liquidation Periods for Initial Margin
One commenter expressed the view that the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) are
reasonable. 328 In contrast, another commenter noted that the proposed rules would address initial
margin liquidation period requirements through the Commission’s supervisory process rather
than establish a minimum liquidation period as part of the covered clearing agency’s initial

326

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29530. The Commission received
no comments regarding the proposed definitions, and the Commission is combining them into
one definition of “sensitivity analysis” to avoid the use of both “sensitivity analysis” and
“conforming sensitivity analysis” in Rule 17Ad-22, as discussed further below. See infra Part
II.C.6.c.
327

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29531; see also supra note 305
and accompanying text (modifying the term “conforming model validation” to “model
validation,” and moving it to Rule 17Ad-22(a)(9)).

128

margin methodology. 329 The commenter stated that, at a minimum, the Commission should
establish minimum liquidation period standards that, as a supervisory matter, are transparent to
the public. To promote transparency and international consistency, the commenter also stated
that the Commission should modify Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(iii) to establish minimum liquidation
periods for initial margin calculation that are consistent with international standards. 330
The Commission is declining to establish minimum liquidation periods as part of a
covered clearing agency’s initial margin methodology. The Commission recognizes that
liquidation periods are a critical assumption for any margin methodology and vary by product
type. Accordingly, liquidation periods generally should be tailored to the market conditions and
risks of the products being cleared. Because market conditions vary and the risks of the products
being cleared over time may change, the Commission believes that a rule or rules establishing
criteria for minimum liquidation periods may not be sufficiently tailored to changing
circumstances as financial markets evolve. A covered clearing agency generally should consider
reviewing liquidation periods as part of its regular review, testing, and verification of its margin
system under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6).
ii. Model Validation
One commenter supported the proposed requirement that a qualified person who is free
from influence should perform the annual model validation for credit and margin risk, but the
commenter asked the Commission to go further with the “free from influence” requirement. 331
329

See The Clearing House at 14.

330

See id. at 3, 14, 15.

331

See Better Markets at 9. The Commission notes that this “free from influence”
requirement applies to model validation requirements in Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4), (e)(6), and (e)(7).
See Rule 17Ad-22(a)(9), infra Part VI.
129

The commenter noted the inevitable and indirect pressures employees may face and suggested
that the models be validated annually by a qualified and independent organization with no
financial stake in the outcome. 332 The Commission previously addressed comments on this topic
when it adopted Rule 17Ad-22(b)(4). At that time, the Commission stated that it was not
persuaded that model validation must be performed by an outside, independent expert. 333 The
Commission believes that objectivity can be preserved where the person performing the model
validation is an employee of the covered clearing agency by a variety of means, including, for
example, separating employees responsible for model validation from those in the covered
clearing agency responsible for the day-to-day functioning of the model and the business lines
that use the model. As a general matter, mechanisms ensuring that any employees responsible
for model validation remain independent from those responsible for using the model on a day-today basis would satisfy this requirement of the rule.
iii. Intraday Margin on a Net Basis and Multilateral Netting
Across CCPs
One commenter supported intraday margin on a net basis and encouraged multilateral
netting across CCPs. The commenter stated that, to prevent intraday variation margin calls from
having destabilizing effects, the Commission should, pending the development of market-wide
solutions, require a covered clearing agency making an intraday margin call to simultaneously
net variation margin that is payable to participants. 334

332

See Better Markets at 9–10.

333

See Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 5, at 66238.

334

See The Clearing House at 3, 14.

130

After careful consideration, the Commission declines to accept the commenter’s
suggestion because it would be inconsistent with the overall approach to Rule 17Ad-22(e). The
Commission notes that the circumstances that could give rise to intraday margin calls at a
covered clearing agency may vary significantly (e.g., intraday volatility, large changes in
participant positions), and may present varied challenges. Although there may be circumstances
where it would be appropriate for a covered clearing agency to incorporate policies and
procedures such as those suggested by the commenter, the Commission’s approach to Rule
17Ad-22(e) is to provide flexibility to covered clearing agencies, subject to their obligations and
responsibilities as SROs under the Exchange Act, to design and structure their policies and
procedures to take into account the differences among clearing agencies. With respect to
intraday margin as a general matter, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(ii) requires policies and procedures for
having the capacity to collect intraday margin in defined circumstances, which generally would
include margin calls on both a scheduled and unscheduled basis.
c. Final Rule
As previously discussed, the Commission is adopting the definitions of “backtesting” and
“potential future exposure” as proposed. 335 As noted above, the Commission is combining the
definitions of “sensitivity analysis” and “conforming sensitivity analysis.” In addition, the
Commission believes that while hypothetical portfolios are often useful and important in
conducting a sensitivity analysis, hypothetical portfolios may not be appropriate in certain cases.
The Commission is modifying the definition so that, under new Rule 17Ad-22(a)(16),
“sensitivity analysis” means an analysis that involves analyzing the sensitivity of a model to its
335

See supra notes 320 and 323. Due to modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(a), the definition of
“potential future exposure” is being moved to Rule 17Ad-22(a)(13). The definition of
“backtesting” remains in Rule 17Ad-22(a)(1). See infra Part VI.

131

assumptions, parameters, and inputs that: (i) considers the impact on the model of both moderate
and extreme changes in a wide range of inputs, parameters, and assumptions, including
correlations of price movements or returns if relevant, which reflect a variety of historical and
hypothetical market conditions. Sensitivity analysis must use actual and, where applicable,
hypothetical portfolios that reflect the characteristics of proprietary positions and customer
positions; (ii) when performed by or on behalf of a covered clearing agency involved in activities
with a more complex risk profile, considers the most volatile relevant periods, where practical,
that have been experienced by the markets served by the clearing agency; and (iii) tests the
sensitivity of the model to stressed market conditions, including the market conditions that may
ensue after the default of a member and other extreme but plausible conditions as defined in a
covered clearing agency’s risk policies. 336 The Commission believes that this reduces the
potential for confusion resulting from the use of two separate definitions.
The Commission is also adopting modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6). 337 First, the
Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) to remove references to “conforming” consistent
with the modification to the definitions of “sensitivity analysis” discussed above and of “model
validation” discussed in Part II.C.4.c. Second, to improve clarity, the Commission is modifying
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(v) to require policies and procedures that use reliable sources of timely price
data and that “use” procedures and sound valuation models for addressing circumstances in
which pricing data are not readily available or reliable. Third, because backtests are conducted
with respect to the margin model and not the margin resources themselves, the Commission is
modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi)(A) to replace the phrase “margin resources” with “margin
336

See Rule 17Ad-22(a)(16), infra Part VI.

337

See Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6), infra Part VI.

132

model.” Fourth, to avoid conflating sensitivity analysis with backtesting, the Commission is
modifying Rules 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi)(B) and (C) to clarify that a sensitivity analysis should be
conducted of the margin model and not of margin resources. Specifically, the rule text will
replace the phrase “margin resources” with the phrase “margin model.” The modifications to
Rules 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi)(A), (B), and (C) are consistent with the discussion of the proposed rule
in the CCA Standards proposing release. 338 Fifth, the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad22(e)(6)(vi)(C) to replace “and” with “or” so that the criteria for conducting analysis more
frequently than monthly are disjunctive rather than conjunctive, since the criteria described may
not be correlated to each other. This modification is consistent with the Commission’s
description of the proposed rule in the CCA Standards proposing release. 339
Further, because the Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to
address compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6), the Commission is providing the following
guidance that a covered clearing agency generally should consider in establishing and
maintaining policies and procedures for margin:
•

whether its margin system has established margin levels commensurate with the risks and
particular attributes of each product, portfolio, and market it serves;

•

whether it has a reliable source of timely price data for its margin system and policies and
procedures, including sound valuation models, for addressing circumstances in which
pricing data are not readily available or reliable;

•

whether it has adopted initial margin models and parameters that are risk-based and
generate margin requirements sufficient to cover its potential future exposure to

338

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29530–31.

339

See id. at 29530.

133

participants in the interval between the last margin collection and the close out of
positions following a participant default;
•

whether initial margin meets an established single-tailed confidence level of at least 99
percent with respect to the estimated distribution of future exposure; whether, if it
calculates margin at the portfolio level, this applies to each portfolio’s distribution of
future exposure; whether, if it calculates margin at more granular levels, such as at the
sub-portfolio level or by product, this is met for the corresponding distributions of future
exposure; and whether the model (i) uses a conservative estimate of the time horizons for
the effective hedging or close out of the particular types of products cleared by the
covered clearing agency (including in stressed market conditions), (ii) has an appropriate
method for measuring credit exposure that accounts for relevant product risk factors and
portfolio effects across products, and (iii) to the extent practicable and prudent, limits the
need for destabilizing, procyclical changes;

•

whether it marks participant positions to market and collects variation margin at least
daily to limit the build-up of current exposures and has the authority and operational
capacity to make intraday margin calls and payments, both scheduled and unscheduled, to
participants;

•

in calculating margin requirements, whether it allows offsets or reductions in required
margin across products that it clears or between products that it and another clearing
agency clear, if the risk of one product is significantly and reliably correlated with the
risk of the other product; and where two or more clearing agencies are authorized to offer
cross-margining, whether they have appropriate safeguards and harmonized overall risk
management systems;

134

•

whether it analyzes and monitors its model performance and overall margin coverage by
conducting rigorous daily backtesting and at least monthly, and more frequent when
appropriate, sensitivity analysis; whether it regularly conducts an assessment of the
theoretical and empirical properties of its margin model for all products it clears; in
conducting sensitivity analysis of the model’s coverage, whether the covered clearing
agency has taken into account a wide range of parameters and assumptions that reflect
possible market conditions, including the most volatile periods that have been
experienced by the markets the covered clearing agency serves and extreme changes in
the correlations between prices; and

•

whether it regularly reviews and validates its margin system.
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(iii), and policies and procedures related to margin

calculations, a covered clearing agency generally should consider whether it calculates margin
sufficient to cover its potential future exposure to each participant.
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(iv) and policies and procedures for price data, the
Commission notes that in selecting price data sources, a covered clearing agency generally
should consider the ability of the provider to provide data in a variety of market conditions,
including periods of market stress, and not select data sources based on their cost alone to ensure
that such price data sources are reliable.
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(v) and policies and procedures for measuring
portfolio effects, the Commission notes that measuring portfolio effects across products means a
covered clearing agency generally should take into account netting procedures or offsets through
which credit exposure may be reduced in measuring credit exposure, including the use of
portfolio margining procedures across products where applicable.

135

With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vii) and policies and procedures for performing the
model validation not less than annually, a covered clearing agency generally should perform the
model validation not less than once every twelve months using persons who are independent
from management and have appropriate technical skills.
7. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7): Liquidity Risk
a. Proposed Rule
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
effectively measure, monitor, and manage the liquidity risk that arises in or is borne by it, by
meeting, at a minimum, the ten requirements specified in the rule. 340
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) would require that a covered clearing agency’s policies
and procedures be reasonably designed to ensure that it maintains sufficient liquid resources in
all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where appropriate, intraday and multiday
settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of
potential stress scenarios that includes the default of the participant family that would generate
the largest aggregate payment obligation for it in extreme but plausible market conditions. 341
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that it holds qualifying liquid resources sufficient to meet the minimum liquidity resource
requirement in each relevant currency for which the covered clearing agency has payment

340

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29531–37.

341

See id. at 29531.

136

obligations owed to clearing members. 342 The Commission also proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(15)
to define “qualifying liquid resources,” which would include three types of assets, in each
relevant currency:
•

cash held either at the central bank of issue or at creditworthy commercial banks;

•

assets that are readily available and convertible into cash through either:
o prearranged funding arrangements without material adverse change limitations,
such as committed lines of credit, foreign exchange swaps, and repurchase
agreements, or
o other prearranged funding arrangements determined to be highly reliable even in
extreme but plausible market conditions by the board of directors of the covered
clearing agency following a review conducted for this purpose not less than
annually; and

•

other assets that are readily available and eligible for pledging to (or conducting other
appropriate forms of transactions with) a relevant central bank, if the covered clearing
agency has access to routine credit at such central bank. 343
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,

implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
it uses accounts and services at a Federal Reserve Bank, pursuant to Section 806(a) of the
Clearing Supervision Act, 344 or other relevant central bank, when available and where

137

determined to be practical by the board of directors of the covered clearing agency, to enhance
its management of liquidity risk.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iv) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
it undertakes due diligence to confirm that it has a reasonable basis to believe each of its liquidity
providers, whether or not such liquidity provider is a clearing member, has sufficient information
to understand and manage the liquidity provider’s liquidity risks, and the capacity to perform as
required under its commitments to provide liquidity.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(v) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that the covered clearing agency maintains and, on at least an annual basis, tests with each
liquidity provider, to the extent practicable, its procedures and operational capacity for accessing
each type of relevant liquidity resource.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(A) through (C) would require a covered clearing
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to determine the amount and regularly test the sufficiency of the liquid resources held
for purposes of meeting the minimum liquid resource requirement of proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(7)(i) by (A) conducting a stress test of its liquidity resources at least once each day using
standard and predetermined parameters and assumptions; (B) conducting a comprehensive
analysis of the existing stress testing scenarios, models, and underlying parameters and
assumptions used in evaluating liquidity needs and resources, and considering modifications to
ensure they are appropriate for determining the covered clearing agency’s identified liquidity
needs and resources in light of current and evolving market conditions at least once each month;

138

and (C) conducting a comprehensive analysis of the existing stress testing scenarios, models, and
underlying parameters and assumptions used in evaluating liquidity needs and resources more
frequently when products cleared or markets served display high volatility or become less liquid,
when the size or concentration of positions held by participants increases significantly, or in
other circumstances described in the covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(D) would also require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to result in
reporting the results of the analyses performed under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(B) and
(C) to appropriate decision makers, including the risk management committee or board of
directors, at the covered clearing agency for use in evaluating the adequacy of and adjusting its
liquidity risk management framework. 345
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to result in
performing an annual or more frequent conforming model validation of its liquidity risk
models. 346
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(viii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to address
foreseeable liquidity shortfalls that would not be covered by its liquid resources and seek to
avoid unwinding, revoking, or delaying the same-day settlement of payment obligations.

Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ix) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to describe
its process for replenishing any liquid resources that it may employ during a stress event. 347
Finally, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(x) would require a covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to ensure that it, at least once a year, evaluates the feasibility of maintaining sufficient liquid
resources at a minimum in all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where appropriate,
intraday and multiday settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under
a wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios that includes, but is not limited to, the default of the
two participant families that would potentially cause the largest aggregate payment obligation for
the covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible market conditions if the covered clearing
agency provides CCP services and is either systemically important in multiple jurisdictions or a
clearing agency involved in activities with a more complex risk profile.
b. Comments Received and Commission Response
i. General Approach
Six commenters expressed general support for the proposed rule. 348 Of these, one
commenter stated that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) was prudent and appropriate in light of the
need for covered clearing agencies to maintain adequate liquidity to minimize systemic risks and
that, by requiring ongoing testing and monitoring of underlying assumptions, covered clearing
agencies should be able to identify potential problems with sufficient time to respond without

significant disruptions. 349 Four commenters expressed support for the Commission’s proposed
approach to qualifying liquid resources other than committed funding arrangements, 350 which is
discussed further below in Part II.C.7.b.iii.
ii. Due Diligence for Liquidity Providers
Two commenters stated that the requirement in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iv)
regarding policies and procedures to perform due diligence of liquidity providers must take into
account the context of the due diligence being performed. 351 One of these commenters stated
that commercial lenders are not likely to provide their borrowers with non-public information on
their internal policies and controls, 352 and that accordingly covered clearing agencies should not
be expected to evaluate a commercial lender’s internal risk controls. 353 First, in the experience
of Commission staff, liquidity facilities may not consist only of traditional commercial loans.
For example, a covered clearing agency may seek out committed repurchase agreement facilities
with counterparties other than traditional commercial lenders. In such a circumstance, the
commenter’s experience with such counterparties may be different than with a traditional

349

See CFA Institute at 9.

350

See CME at 4; DTCC at 6 (noting the appropriate balance in the proposed rule between
the need to have sufficient reliable liquidity resources to meet ongoing settlement obligations in
the event of participant default, and the realities of the availability and costs of committed
liquidity funding); OCC at 11 (supporting the expansion of qualifying liquid resources beyond
committed funding arrangements); The Clearing House at 3, 13 (noting that the proposed rule’s
use of highly reliable funding arrangements, in addition to committed arrangements, provides
needed flexibility and is consistent with the PFMI).

commercial lender. 354 Accordingly, in contrast to the commenter’s assertion, a covered clearing
agency may engage in a relationship with a liquidity provider that is not a typical commercial
lender and therefore may be more willing to facilitate due diligence. Second, while the
Commission acknowledges that a lender may choose not to provide their borrowers with nonpublic information on certain internal policies and controls, the proposed rule does not require a
covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures regarding due diligence for liquidity providers
to specifically review all internal policies and controls. Rather, it requires due diligence policies
and procedures that confirm the covered clearing agency has a reasonable basis to believe that a
liquidity provider understands and manages the liquidity provider’s liquidity risks and the
capacity to perform as required under its commitments to provide liquidity to the covered
clearing agency. If, in performing due diligence consistent with its policies and procedures
formulated in accordance with the rule, a covered clearing agency cannot confirm that it has a
reasonable basis to believe both of the required criteria, then the covered clearing agency would
not have a liquidity provider consistent with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iv).
The second commenter stated that it is not appropriate to require a covered clearing
agency to perform due diligence on a central bank acting as its liquidity provider and requests
that the rules clarify that the requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iv) do not apply where a
central bank is a liquidity provider for a covered clearing agency. 355 The Commission does not
believe that the rule needs to be modified to account for this circumstance, however, as the
policies and procedures of the covered clearing agency could account for the different
circumstances that arise when a central bank is acting as a liquidity provider.
354

See infra Part II.C.7.b.iii (further discussing such repurchase agreement facilities).

355

See LCH at 4.
142

A third commenter expressed the view that the Commission should clarify the due
diligence requirements of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iv) to expressly require a covered
clearing agency to take into account the potential wrong-way risk associated with reliance on
participants or their affiliates as liquidity providers. 356 The commenter further stated that the
Commission should take additional steps to mitigate wrong-way risk by requiring a covered
clearing agency to ensure the appropriate diversification of its liquidity providers and limit its
reliance on its participants or their affiliates as potential sources of liquidity. 357 The Commission
believes that diversifying liquidity providers may be helpful because such diversification would
result in less concentrated, and potentially more manageable, financial commitments among a
covered clearing agency’s liquidity providers. For example, a covered clearing agency generally
should conduct an assessment of the liquidity provider’s business in light of both the covered
clearing agency’s own business and the composition of its existing liquidity providers. In turn, a
covered clearing agency could assess the likelihood that a liquidity provider might be unable to
meet its own liquidity demands at the same time as the covered clearing agency was facing a
liquidity shortfall and attempting to draw on liquidity from its liquidity provider, allowing the
covered clearing agency to account for the potential wrong-way risk associated with reliance on
participants or their affiliates as liquidity providers. Although there may be circumstances where
it would be appropriate for a covered clearing agency to incorporate the policies and procedures
such as those suggested by the commenter, the Commission’s approach to Rule 17Ad-22(e)
focuses on principles. The circumstances may vary, and a covered clearing agency should
appropriately manage its risks as they arise, considering the full set of tools available and its risk
356

357

143

management framework. Accordingly, after careful consideration, the Commission declines to
accept the commenter’s suggestion with respect to wrong-way risk because it would be
inconsistent with the overall approach to Rule 17Ad-22(e). 358
In addition, the commenter stated that the reliance on committed funding arrangements in
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(15) may lead to this overreliance on participants or their affiliates for
liquidity. 359 The Commission addresses this aspect of the comment below in Part II.C.7.b.iii.
iii. Qualifying Liquid Resources
Commenters generally supported the Commission’s proposed approach to determining
qualifying liquid resources. One commenter supported the Commission’s overall approach and,
in particular, the inclusion of assets that are readily available and convertible into cash through
repurchase agreements. 360 Another commenter supported the Commission’s approach to the
definition of “qualifying liquid resources,” and expressed the view that expansion of qualifying
liquid resources beyond committed funding arrangements is necessary to ensure the proper
functioning of covered clearing agencies. 361 The commenter noted that a committed liquidity
facility would generally be preferable over a non-committed facility, but the commenter also
acknowledged that other aspects of a facility (e.g., size or cost of the facility) may tip the balance
toward selection of the non-committed facility. In particular, the commenter emphasized the
unique liquidity needs of clearing entities, the limited number and capacity of liquidity providers
in the market that are willing and able to participate in committed liquidity facilities for clearing
358

See supra Part II.B.

359

360

361

144

entities, and the commercial and regulatory realities that could constrain the availability of
committed facilities for covered clearing agencies. 362 The Commission is mindful of these
concerns, but notes that policies and procedures providing for the use of uncommitted facilities
must also satisfy the terms of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) to address general business and operational
risk that could arise from such uncommitted facilities.
One commenter stated that requiring covered clearing agencies to rely on committed
funding arrangements in all cases could increase a covered clearing agency’s reliance on its
participants or their affiliated banks and potentially exacerbate a liquidity crisis by transferring
the risk of a covered clearing agency to its liquidity providers and vice versa. 363 However, the
comment assumes that the rule prohibits reliance on other types of facilities or prearranged
funding arrangements, which is not the case. To some degree, the purpose of a liquidity facility
is to transfer risk from the covered clearing agency to its liquidity providers. Further, the
resources described in the definition of “qualifying liquid resources” should be viewed as part of
a hierarchy, where cash should be the primary source of liquid resources, followed first by
prearranged funding arrangements and last by other assets readily available and eligible for
pledging to a relevant central bank in a jurisdiction that permits such pledges. In addition, within
the class of prearranged funding arrangements, available committed arrangements without
material adverse change (“MAC”) provisions generally should be obtained before seeking to
obtain other prearranged funding arrangements determined to be highly reliable even in extreme
but plausible market conditions by the covered clearing agency’s board of directors. The
Commission believes that a covered clearing agency generally should consider having policies
362

See id. at 11–12.

363

See The Clearing House at 13.

145

and procedures that establish a preference for cash and prearranged funding arrangements, but
the Commission acknowledges that a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures may
need to account for the extent to which such resources are available to them given the size of
their liquidity demands.
With respect to whether and how repurchase agreements might fit within the definition of
qualifying liquid resources, one commenter stated that prearranged and highly reliable funding
arrangements may be demonstrated through non-committed repurchase agreement facilities with
major bank-dealers. 364 According to the commenter, a covered clearing agency relying on such a
facility would need to ensure that it is structured appropriately to be highly reliable, taking into
account the fact that a facility may be used in a clearing member default scenario in extreme
market circumstances. The commenter also stated that a covered clearing agency’s procedures
for making draws on uncommitted repurchase facilities should specifically contemplate the
timing of close-out arrangements for defaulted clearing members and should provide for draws
on such facilities to be made by specified times during business day mornings to ensure that
dealer banks have sufficient time to facilitate liquidation of the U.S. Treasury securities. The
commenter believed this approach would be fully consistent with the PFMI. 365 The Commission
notes that this type of approach, reflected in the policies and procedures of a covered clearing
agency as part of a broader attempt to define qualifying liquid resources comprehensively, could
be consistent with the Commission’s definition of prearranged funding arrangements determined
to be highly reliable even in extreme but plausible market conditions by the board of directors of

364

See ISDA at 4.

365

See id.

146

the covered clearing agency, assuming it was subject to a not less than annual review. 366 The
Commission believes that the board of directors of a covered clearing agency generally should
rely on rigorous analysis of the properties of a prearranged funding arrangement, in making a
determination that it was highly reliable in extreme but plausible market conditions.
With respect to the rule’s reference to “material adverse change provisions,” two
commenters recommended that the reference be removed. One commenter noted that the
proposed rule text appears to be in tension with the preamble of the CCA Standards proposing
release because it includes, among qualifying liquid resources, prearranged funding
arrangements other than committed arrangements, but only where such arrangements have no
MAC provisions. 367 The commenter stated that, by definition, a non-committed facility is
uncommitted and therefore MAC provisions are inapplicable. 368 The commenter further noted
that this is a liquidity standard not set forth in the PFMI, which will lead to confusion and
inconsistency in attempting to apply the standard. The commenter recommended that the
reference to MAC clauses in the proposed definition of “qualifying liquid resources” be
removed. 369 The second commenter similarly recommended that the Commission remove the
reference to MAC clauses in the definition of qualifying liquid resources for prearranged funding

366

Such policies and procedures should also address the due diligence of the liquidity
provider, as discussed above. See supra Part II.C.7.b.ii.

arrangements other than committed arrangements, noting that Master Repurchase Agreements do
not have MAC clauses because they are uncommitted facilities. 370
In response to the comments, the Commission is modifying the proposed definition of
“qualifying liquid resources” so that only paragraph (A) includes a prohibition on MAC clauses.
For uncommitted facilities, because they are by their terms uncommitted, the party providing an
uncommitted facility generally would have no need to include a MAC clause. In contrast, a
party providing a committed facility could choose to contract into an arrangement with or
without a MAC clause, at the party’s discretion. As noted above, the Commission believes that a
covered clearing agency generally should consider having policies and procedures that establish
a preference for cash and prearranged funding arrangements. Within the category of prearranged
funding arrangements, the Commission also believes that a covered clearing agency generally
should preference committed arrangements over other types of prearranged funding
arrangements, and that within the category of committed arrangements, a covered clearing
agency generally should preference those without MAC clauses over those with MAC clauses.
The Commission notes that a covered clearing agency would, when relying on a committed
funding arrangement with a MAC clause pursuant to the definition of “qualifying liquid
resources,” also need to have policies and procedures demonstrating that such committed facility
was a prearranged funding arrangement determined to be highly reliable even in extreme but
plausible market conditions by the board of directors following a review conducted for this
purpose no less than annually. The Commission also believes that, as a general matter, policies
and procedures regarding qualifying liquid resources, including those related to prearranged
funding arrangements, would constitute a proposed rule change under Section 19(b) of the
370

148

Exchange Act and, for designated clearing agencies, an advance notice under the Clearing
Supervision Act.
c. Final Rule
The Commission is adopting two modifications to the definition of “qualifying liquid
resources” and, because of other modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(a), moving the definition to
Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14). 371 The Commission is modifying paragraph (ii) so that the reference to
MAC clauses is tied to committed arrangements rather than prearranged funding arrangements
more generally, as previously described in Part II.C.7.b.iii. In addition, because not all central
banks permit pledging certain assets that are readily available and eligible for pledging, the
Commission is modifying paragraph (iii) to clarify that practices with respect to routine credit at
a central bank may vary across jurisdictions.
The Commission is also adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) with modifications. 372 First, the
Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi)(A) to refer to “stress testing” rather than “a
stress test” to improve consistency with the definition of “stress testing” in Rule 17Ad-22(a)(17).
Second, the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(C) in two ways. To improve
consistency with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi)(C), the Commission is adding “or” to link “display
high volatility” with “become less liquid” because these concepts are intended to describe events
related to the products cleared or markets served. This change corrects a typographical error in
the CCA Standards proposing release. 373 The Commission is also replacing “and” with “or” in
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(C) so that the criteria for conducting analysis more frequently than
371

See Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14), infra Part VI.

149

monthly are disjunctive rather than conjunctive, since the list of criteria is open to other
appropriate circumstances described in a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures and
may not be correlated. Third, the Commission is making two modifications in adopting Rule
17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(D) to correct technical errors in the proposed rule text: (i) references to
paragraphs (e)(6)(vii)(B) and (C) will be changed to paragraphs (e)(7)(vi)(B) and (C)
respectively; and (ii) the rule will refer to the covered clearing agency’s “liquidity” risk
management framework, rather than its “credit” risk management framework. These
modifications are consistent with the Commission’s discussion of the proposed rule in the CCA
Standards proposing release. 374 Fourth, the Commission is striking “conforming” from Rule
17Ad-22(e)(7)(vii) to be consistent with the modifications to the definition of “model validation”
discussed in Part II.C.4.c.
Further, because the Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to
address compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7), the Commission is providing the following
guidance that a covered clearing agency generally should consider in establishing and
maintaining policies and procedures that address liquidity risk:
•

whether it has a robust framework to manage its liquidity risks from its participants,
settlement banks, nostro agents, custodian banks, liquidity providers, and other entities;

•

whether it has effective operational and analytical tools to identify, measure, and monitor
its settlement and funding flows on an ongoing and timely basis, including its use of
intraday liquidity;

374

See id.

150

•

whether it maintains sufficient liquid resources in all relevant currencies to settle
securities-related payments, make required variation margin payments, and meet other
payment obligations on time with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of
potential stress scenarios, including but not limited to the default of the participant and its
affiliates that would generate the largest aggregate payment obligation to the covered
clearing agency in extreme but plausible market conditions;

•

for the purpose of meeting its minimum liquid resource requirement, whether its
qualifying liquid resources in each currency include cash at the central bank of issue and
at creditworthy commercial banks, committed lines of credit, committed foreign
exchange swaps, and committed repos, as well as highly marketable collateral held in
custody and investments that are readily available and convertible into cash with
prearranged and highly reliable funding arrangements, even in extreme but plausible
market conditions;

•

whether it supplements its qualifying liquid resources with other forms of liquid
resources and, if so, whether these liquid resources are in the form of assets likely to be
saleable or acceptable as collateral for lines of credit, swaps, or repos on an ad hoc basis
following a default, even if this cannot be reliably prearranged or guaranteed in extreme
market conditions;

•

if it does not have access to routine central bank credit, whether it takes account of what
collateral is typically accepted by the relevant central bank, as such assets may be more
likely to be liquid in stressed circumstances, and does not assume the availability of
emergency central bank credit as a part of its liquidity plan;

151

•

whether it obtains a high degree of confidence, through rigorous due diligence, that each
provider of its minimum required qualifying liquid resources, whether a participant of the
FMI or an external party, has sufficient information to understand and to manage its
associated liquidity risks, and that it has the capacity to perform as required under its
commitment;

•

where relevant to assessing a liquidity provider’s performance reliability with respect to a
particular currency, whether a liquidity provider’s potential access to credit from the
central bank of issue may be taken into account;

•

whether it regularly tests its procedures for accessing its liquid resources at a liquidity
provider;

•

if it has access to central bank accounts, payment services, or securities services, whether
it uses these services, where practical, to enhance its management of liquidity risk;

•

whether it determines the amount and regularly tests the sufficiency of its liquid
resources through rigorous stress testing; whether it has clear procedures to report the
results of its stress tests to appropriate decision makers at the covered clearing agency
and to use these results to evaluate the adequacy of and adjust its liquidity riskmanagement framework;

•

in conducting stress testing, whether it considers a wide range of relevant scenarios,
including relevant peak historic price volatilities, shifts in other market factors such as
price determinants and yield curves, multiple defaults over various time horizons,
simultaneous pressures in funding and asset markets, and a spectrum of forward-looking
stress scenarios in a variety of extreme but plausible market conditions;

152

•

whether such scenarios take into account the design and operation of the covered clearing
agency, include all entities that might pose material liquidity risks to the covered clearing
agency (such as settlement banks, nostro agents, custodian banks, liquidity providers, and
linked clearing agencies), and where appropriate, cover a multiday period, and, whether,
in all cases, it documents its supporting rationale for, and has appropriate governance
arrangements relating to, the amount and form of total liquid resources it maintains;

•

whether it has explicit rules and procedures that enable the covered clearing agency to
effect same-day and, where appropriate, intraday and multiday settlement of payment
obligations on time following any individual or combined default among its participants;

•

whether these rules and procedures address unforeseen and potentially uncovered
liquidity shortfalls and should aim to avoid unwinding, revoking, or delaying the sameday settlement of payment obligations; 375 and

•

whether these rules and procedures indicate the covered clearing agency’s process to
replenish any liquidity resources it may employ during a stress event, so that it can
continue to operate in a safe and sound manner.

In addition, with respect to creditworthy commercial banks under Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14), a
covered clearing agency generally should assess the creditworthiness of its commercial banks,
such as by considering their particular circumstances in which they operate and the markets
which they service.

375

The Commission notes that while Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(viii) requires policies and
procedures to address foreseeable liquidity shortfalls, a covered clearing agency also generally
should consider how best to identify unforeseen and potentially uncovered liquidity shortfalls.
For example, a covered clearing agency may be able to identify unforeseen liquidity shortfalls
using hypothetical stress scenarios and reverse stress testing of liquid resources.

153

With respect to assets convertible into cash under Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14), the Commission
notes that the mere ownership of assets that a covered clearing agency may consider readily
available and convertible into cash—based on factors such as the historical volume of trading in
a particular market for such asset—depending on the circumstances may not count towards its
“qualifying liquid resources” unless one of the prearranged funding arrangements in place would
allow the covered clearing agency to receive cash in a timely manner. With respect to the
requirements for qualifying liquid resources more generally, the Commission notes that a
covered clearing agency generally should consider the lower of the value of the assets capable of
being pledged and the amount of the commitment (or the equivalent availability under a highly
reliable prearranged facility) as the amount that counts towards qualifying liquid resources in the
event there is any expected difference between the two. 376
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii), the Commission notes that, for example, if
payment obligations were denominated in U.S. dollars, the minimum liquidity resource
requirement would refer to a U.S. dollar amount.
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iii) and access to routine credit at a central bank, the
Commission notes that a covered clearing agency is not required to use central bank account
services but, rather, is required to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed facilitate such use when available and practical. As noted
376

For purposes of complying with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii), factors that may be relevant for a
covered clearing agency to consider when defining its qualifying liquid resources could include
(i) the portion of its default fund that is held as cash, (ii) the portion of its default fund that is
held as securities, (iii) the portion of any excess default fund contributions held as cash that
could be used by the covered clearing agency to meet liquidity needs, (iv) the portion of any
excess default fund contributions held as securities that could be used by the covered clearing
agency to meet liquidity needs, (v) the amount at any given time of securities or cash delivered
by members that a covered clearing agency may be able to use to meet liquidity needs upon the
default of a member, and (vi) the borrowing limits under any committed funding arrangement.

154

above, whether the services are available or considered to be practical may vary across
jurisdictions. 377 Access to routine credit at a relevant central bank, and the collateral required by
such central bank to be posted to secure a loan, may be determined at the discretion of the central
bank.
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iv) and the policies and procedures for due diligence
required thereunder, “due diligence” has the same meaning as is commonly understood by
market participants. A covered clearing agency generally should not rely solely on
representations made by a liquidity provider but instead should conduct an assessment of the
liquidity provider’s business, in light of the covered clearing agency’s own business and the
composition of its existing liquidity providers. Policies and procedures to develop a reasonable
basis under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iv) could include interviewing the liquidity provider’s staff and
reviewing both public and non-public documents that would allow the covered clearing agency
to gather information about relevant factors, including but not limited to the strength of the
liquidity provider’s financial condition, its risk management capabilities, and its internal
controls.
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(v), a covered clearing agency generally should test
its access to liquidity resources by verifying that a liquidity provider is able to provide the
relevant liquidity resources in the manner intended under the terms of a funding arrangement and
without undue delay by, for example, promptly funding a draw on the covered clearing agency’s
credit facility. The Commission recognizes that testing procedures also could include test draws
377

The Commission notes that the term “central bank” is not limited to a Federal Reserve
Bank. A covered clearing agency based in or operating outside of the United States that has
access to routine credit at other central banks would be able to take this into consideration when
assessing the amount of its qualifying liquid resources.

155

funded by the liquidity provider or tests of electronic connectivity between the covered clearing
agency and the liquidity provider. Testing with liquidity providers may not always be
practicable in the absence of committed liquidity arrangements. In addition, a covered clearing
agency generally should conduct the testing not less than once every twelve months.
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vii) and policies and procedures for performing the
model validation not less than annually, a covered clearing agency generally should perform the
model validation not less than once every twelve months.
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(viii) and foreseeable liquidity shortfalls, foreseeable
liquidity shortfalls could include potential shortfalls that can be identified through testing a
covered clearing agency’s financial resources. 378 The Commission recognizes that foreseeable
liquidity shortfalls could occur even when a covered clearing agency is in compliance with the
proposed requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7), such as when the covered clearing agency is
unable to obtain liquidity pursuant to prearranged funding arrangements that are uncommitted.
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(x), a covered clearing agency is not required to adopt
a “cover two” standard for liquidity risk but is responsible for undertaking such an analysis at
least once a year, pursuant to the covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures under Rule
17Ad-22(e)(7)(x). In making any determination regarding the sizing of a covered clearing
agency’s liquid resources to exceed “cover one,” a covered clearing agency could consider,
among other things, (i) the business model of the covered clearing agency, such as a utility
model (which may be also referred to as an “at cost” model) versus a for-profit model; (ii)
diversification of its members’ business models as they impact the members’ ability to supply
liquidity to the covered clearing agency; (iii) concentration of membership of the covered
378

See supra note 375.

156

clearing agency, as the breadth of the membership may affect the ability to draw liquidity from
members; (iv) levels of usage of the covered clearing agency’s services by members, as the
concentration of demand on the covered clearing agency’s services may bear upon potential
liquidity needs; (v) the relative concentration of members’ market share in the cleared products;
(vi) the degree of alignment of interest between member ownership of the covered clearing
agency and the provision of funding to the covered clearing agency; and (vii) the nature of, and
risks associated with, the products cleared by the covered clearing agency.
8. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8): Settlement Finality
a. Proposed Rule
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to define
the point at which settlement is final no later than the end of the day on which the payment or
obligation is due and, where necessary or appropriate, intraday or in real time. 379
b. Comments Received
The Commission received no comments regarding the proposed rule.
c. Final Rule
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) with one modification. 380 To remove
potential ambiguity as to the timing of settlement finality under the rule, the Commission is
modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) to state that the point at which settlement is final is “to be” no
later than the end of the day on which the payment or obligation is due and, where necessary or
appropriate, intraday or in real time. As modified, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) identifies the point at
379

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29537–38.

380

See Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8), infra Part VI.

157

which settlement is final, which must be defined in a covered clearing agency’s written policies
and procedures, and removes the potential ambiguity that could have allowed an alternative
interpretation of the rule that did not clearly link the concept of settlement finality to “no later
than the end of the day on which the payment or obligation is due and, where necessary or
appropriate, intraday or in real time.”
Further, because the Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to
address compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8), the Commission is providing the following
guidance that a covered clearing agency generally should consider in establishing and
maintaining policies and procedures that address settlement finality:
•

whether its policies and procedures clearly define the point at which settlement is final;

•

whether it completes final settlement no later than the end of the value date, and
preferably intraday or in real time, to reduce settlement risk; and

•

whether it clearly defines the point after which unsettled payments, transfer instructions,
or other obligations may not be revoked by a participant.

In addition, clearly defining the point at which settlement is final might include adopting policies
and procedures (i) establishing that a cut-off point after which unsettled payments, transfer
instructions, or other obligations may not be revoked by a clearing member and (ii) providing
clearing members with guidance regarding extensions for members with operating problems,
such as the approval or duration of such extensions. Policies or procedures creating material
uncertainty regarding when final settlement will occur or that permit the back-dating or “as of”
dating of a transaction that settles after the end of the day on which the payment or obligation is
due generally would not comply with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8). With respect to policies and
procedures requiring intraday or real-time finality to reduce risk, such efforts would be necessary

158

and appropriate when, for example, the risks in question are material or when the opportunity to
require intraday or real-time finality is available and would be reasonable, whether in economic
or other terms, to implement.
9. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9): Money Settlements
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to conduct
its money settlements in central bank money, where available and determined to be practical by
the board of directors of the covered clearing agency, and minimizes and manages credit and
liquidity risk arising from conducting its money settlements in commercial bank money if central
bank money is not used by the covered clearing agency. 381
The Commission received no comments regarding the proposed rule and is adopting it as
proposed. 382 Because the Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to
address compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9), the Commission is providing the following
guidance that a covered clearing agency generally should consider in establishing and
maintaining policies and procedures that address money settlements:
•

whether it conducts its money settlements in central bank money, where practical and
available, to avoid credit and liquidity risks;

•

if it does not use central bank money, whether it conducts its money settlements using a
settlement asset with little or no credit or liquidity risk;

•

if it settles in commercial bank money, whether it monitors, manages, and limits its credit
and liquidity risks arising from commercial settlement banks by, for example,

381

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29538–39.

382

See Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9), infra Part VI.

159

establishing and monitoring adherence to strict criteria for its settlement banks that take
account of, among other things, their regulation and supervision, creditworthiness,
capitalization, access to liquidity, and operational reliability, and whether it monitors and
manages the concentration of credit and liquidity exposures to its commercial settlement
banks;
•

if it conducts money settlements on its own books, whether it minimizes and strictly
controls its credit and liquidity risks; and

•

whether its legal agreements with any settlement banks state clearly when transfers on the
books of individual settlement banks are expected to occur, that transfers are to be final
when effected, and that funds received are transferable as soon as possible at a minimum
by the end of the day, and ideally intraday, to enable the covered clearing agency and its
participants to manage credit and liquidity risks.

While Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9) would permit a covered clearing agency to use multiple settlement
banks to monitor and manage concentration of payments among its commercial settlement
banks, in such circumstances its policies and procedures generally should consider the degree to
which concentration of a covered clearing agency’s exposure to a commercial settlement bank is
affected or increased by multiple relationships with the settlement bank, including (i) where the
settlement bank is also a participant in the covered clearing agency, or (ii) where the settlement
bank provides back-up liquidity resources to the covered clearing agency.
In addition, the Commission believes that a covered clearing agency generally should
consider using commercial bank money only when central bank money is not practicable or
available. In some cases, the use of central bank money may not be practical because direct
access to central bank accounts and payment services may not be available to all clearing

160

agencies or members in all circumstances. For example, when a covered clearing agency
operates in multiple currencies, certain central bank accounts may not be operational at the time
money settlements occur.
10. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10): Physical Delivery Risks
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
establish and maintain transparent written standards that state its obligations with respect to the
delivery of physical instruments and operational practices that identify, monitor, and manage the
risk associated with such physical deliveries. 383
The Commission received no comments regarding the proposed rule and is adopting it as
proposed. 384 Because the Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to
address compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10), the Commission is providing the following
guidance that a covered clearing agency generally should consider in establishing and
maintaining policies and procedures that address physical delivery risks:
•

whether its rules clearly state its obligations with respect to the delivery of physical
instruments or commodities; and

•

whether it has identified, monitored, and managed the risks and costs associated with the
storage and delivery of physical instruments or commodities.

The Commission notes that practices regarding physical delivery vary based on the types of
assets that a covered clearing agency settles. Nevertheless, a covered clearing agency generally
should consider having policies and procedures that state clearly which asset classes it accepts
383

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29539–40.

384

See Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10), infra Part VI.

161

for physical delivery and the procedures surrounding the delivery of each. In addition, physical
delivery may require the involvement of multiple parties, including the clearing agency itself, its
members, customers, custodians, and transfer agents. In particular, a covered clearing agency
generally should consider having policies and procedures that address its relationship with
transfer agents generally and, in particular, with respect to instructions for deposit and
withdrawal at a custodian.
A covered clearing agency could employ several different arrangements pursuant to the
requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10). For example, if a covered clearing agency takes physical
delivery of securities from its members in return for payments of cash, then it generally should
inform its members of the extent of the clearing agency’s obligations to make payment. A
covered clearing agency generally should employ policies and procedures that clearly state any
obligations it incurs to members for losses incurred in the delivery process. Policies and
procedures generally should also clearly state rules or obligations regarding definitions for
acceptable physical instruments, the location of delivery sites, rules for storage and warehouse
operations, and the timing of delivery. Such policies and procedures can help mitigate
operational risks associated with physical deliveries by including provisions to review and assess
the qualifications of potential employees, including, among other things, reference and
background checks and employee training. Such policies and procedures could also relate to
theft, loss, counterfeiting, deterioration of or damage to assets, and employee duties for the
recordkeeping for and holding of physical assets.
11. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11): CSDs
a. Proposed Rule

162

As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(i) would require a covered clearing agency that
provides CSD services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to maintain securities in an immobilized or dematerialized form
for their transfer by book entry, ensure the integrity of securities issues, and minimize and
manage the risks associated with the safekeeping and transfer of securities. Proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(11)(ii) would require a covered clearing agency that provides CSD services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to implement internal auditing and other controls to safeguard the rights of securities issuers and
holders, prevent the unauthorized creation or deletion of securities, and conduct periodic and at
least daily reconciliation of securities issues it maintains. Finally, proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(11)(iii) would require a covered clearing agency that provides CSD services to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to protect
assets against custody risk through appropriate rules and procedures consistent with relevant
laws, rules, and regulations in jurisdictions where it operates. 385
b. Comment Received and Commission Response
The Commission received one comment regarding proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11). The
commenter expressed concern that the language in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(i), which
requires the policies and procedures of a covered clearing agency providing CSD services to be
reasonably designed to ensure the integrity of securities issues, differs materially from PFMI
Principle 11 and FRB’s Regulation HH, both of which require that an entity “help” ensure the
integrity of securities issues. 386 The commenter also expressed the concern that no covered
385

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29540–43.

386

See DTCC at 7 (emphasis in original).
163

clearing agency is in a position to guarantee the integrity of the securities. 387 As a result, the
commenter urged the Commission to include the words “to help” before “ensure,” to avoid any
interpretation that clearing agencies providing CSD services are held to a materially higher
standard than the commenter believes is the Commission’s intention. 388 In the alternative, the
commenter proposed the substitution of another phrase (e.g., “to promote” or “to protect”) that
accurately characterized the cooperative nature of CSDs. 389
In response to the comment received, the Commission notes that the rule text does not
require a covered clearing agency to ensure or guarantee the integrity of securities issues; rather,
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) requires policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure the
integrity of securities issues. The Commission believes that the policies and procedures nature
of the rule mitigates the concern raised by the commenter because the rule requires a covered
clearing agency to ensure that its policies and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure the
integrity of securities issues and it does not require a covered clearing agency to ensure the
integrity of securities issues. The Commission is not modifying proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)
to add the words “to help” before “ensure” because, in the Commission’s view, such an addition
would inappropriately weaken the rule. Although the rule does not require a guarantee of the
integrity of securities issues, the rule does require reasonably designed policies and procedures.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) recognizes that reasonably designed policies and procedures with respect to
the integrity of securities issues is important for investor protection. In this regard, the
Commission believes that such policies and procedures generally should be designed to prohibit
387

See id. at 7.

388

See id. at 8.

389

See id.

164

overdrafts and debit balances in securities accounts, which can create unauthorized issuances of
securities that undermine the integrity of the covered clearing agency’s services.
c. Final Rule
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) as proposed. 390 Because the
Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to address compliance with Rule
17Ad-22(e)(11), the Commission is providing the following guidance that a covered clearing
agency generally should consider in establishing and maintaining policies and procedures that
address CSD services:
•

whether it has appropriate rules, procedures, and controls, including robust accounting
practices, to safeguard the rights of securities issuers and holders, to prevent the
unauthorized creation or deletion of securities, and to conduct periodic and at least daily
reconciliation of the securities it maintains;

•

whether it prohibits overdrafts and debit balances in securities accounts;

•

whether it maintains securities in an immobilized or dematerialized form for their transfer
by book entry and, where appropriate, whether it provides incentives to immobilize or
dematerialize securities;

•

whether it protects assets against custody risk through appropriate rules and procedures
consistent with its legal framework;

•

whether it employs a robust system that ensures segregation between its own assets and
the securities of its participants and segregation among the securities of participants; and

390

See Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11), infra Part VI.

165

•

whether it identifies, measures, monitors, and manages its risks from other activities that
it may perform and whether additional tools may be necessary to address such risks.

In addition, the Commission notes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(i) is not intended to prohibit a
covered clearing agency from continuing to hold physical certificates on behalf of its members
where such securities currently exist in paper form or from providing other custody-only
services. 391 The Commission’s rules do not prohibit, and in some respects contemplate, the
issuance of securities certificates. For example, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(i) would not prohibit a
covered clearing agency from holding American depositary shares in custody. 392
The Commission also notes that the custody risk described in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(iii)
may be related to both physical delivery risk and operational risk, the latter including risks such
as theft, loss, counterfeiting, and deterioration or damage to assets. To mitigate such risks, a
covered clearing agency could consider obtaining insurance coverage to help ensure that (i)
records of securities held in custody accurately reflect holdings, and (ii) employee duties for the
recordkeeping and holding of securities are separate and discrete duties. The Commission notes
that dematerialization of securities alone does not eliminate the applicability of any requirements

391

For example, the Commission understands that, in the United States, CSD services
currently include the provision of custody-only services, in addition to book-entry transfer and
related services that may also include providing custody.

392

An American depositary receipt (“ADR”), whether in a program sponsored or
unsponsored by a foreign issuer, is the physical certificate that evidences American depositary
shares, which represent an ownership interest in a specified number of securities of a foreign
issuer that have been deposited with a depositary. See Securities Act Release No. 33-6894 (May
23, 1991) 56 FR 24420, 24421 n.5 (May 30, 1991). The shares of a foreign issuer that underlie
an ADR are usually held by a custodian appointed by the depositary in the country of
incorporation of the foreign issuer, may be in paper certificate form, and may be in the ultimate
custody of the CSD.

166

to protect against custody risk and instead may create new sources of risk, such as hacking or
digital piracy.
12. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12): Exchange-of-Value Settlement Systems
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) would require a covered clearing agency, for
transactions that involve the settlement of two linked obligations, to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to eliminate principal
risk by conditioning the final settlement of one obligation upon the final settlement of the other,
regardless of whether the covered clearing agency settles on a gross or net basis and when
finality occurs. 393
In response to a request for comment as to whether there are circumstances where it is not
feasible or practicable, in an exchange-of-value settlement context, to ensure that the settlement
of one obligation is final if and only if the settlement of the corresponding obligation is final, the
Commission received one comment. The commenter stated that such a situation occurs when the
settlement of a CDS contract occurs following a credit event. 394 In this case, the commenter
stated that there may be some non-delivery versus payment obligations to be settled, such as
loans, and that at least one CCP has policies and procedures to address this situation to secure
settlement. The commenter expressed the belief that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) should encompass
this situation. 395
In response, the Commission notes that the commenter has not described a linked
obligation as contemplated under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12), such as the delivery of securities against
393

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29543–44.

394

See LCH at 4.

395

See id. at 4–5.

167

payment of either cash or securities in connection with the purchase or sale of a security, because
the commenter has described a non-delivery versus payment obligation. The Commission
therefore believes that the comment is not within the scope of the settlement mechanisms
contemplated by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12). While the Commission believes that a covered clearing
agency generally should have policies and procedures to address “free-of-payment” deliveries or
the settlement of non-delivery versus payment obligations if it accepts non-delivery versus
payment obligations, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) addresses settlement mechanisms that eliminate
principal risk by ensuring that the final settlement of one obligation occurs if and only if the final
settlement of the linked obligation occurs.
The Commission also notes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) requires a covered clearing agency
to have policies and procedures to define the point at which settlement is final. Where a covered
clearing agency’s policies and procedures for ensuring settlement finality apply only when
settlement of the corresponding obligation is final, the covered clearing agency may wish to
consider corresponding policies and procedures that address legal, contractual, operational, and
other risks.
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) as proposed. 396
13. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13): Participant-Default Rules and Procedures
a. Proposed Rule
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that the covered clearing agency has the authority and operational capacity to take timely action
to contain losses and liquidity demands and continue to meet its obligations in the event of a
396

See Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12), infra Part VI.

168

participant default. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)(i) would require a covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to address the allocation of credit losses it may face if its collateral and other resources are
insufficient to fully cover its credit exposures, including the repayment of any funds the covered
clearing agency may borrow from liquidity providers. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)(ii) would
require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to describe its process to replenish any financial resources it
may use following a member default or other event in which use of such resources is
contemplated. Finally, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)(iii) would require a covered clearing
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to require the covered clearing agency’s participants and, when practicable, other
stakeholders to participate in the testing and review of its default procedures, including any
close-out procedures, at least annually and following material changes thereto. 397
b. Comments Received and Commission Response
i. Limitations on Replenishment of Resources
One commenter stated that the Commission’s rule should explicitly require that
replenishment of resources through compulsory means (such as assessments on clearing
members) be subject to a well-defined cap. 398 The Commission is declining to modify Rule
17Ad-22(e)(13) to impose a “cap” on the replenishment of resources by a covered clearing
agency. Consideration of whether a cap is appropriate depends on a number of factors related to
the covered clearing agency’s recovery plan as a whole and cannot be viewed in isolation,
397

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29544–46.

398

See ISDA at 4.

169

including, in particular, what measures a covered clearing agency could implement in the event
that a covered clearing agency experienced losses that exceeded the “cap.” Given this
uncertainty and that each covered clearing agency is structured and operated differently, and that
collectively they clear different products with different risk profiles and employ different default
management procedures, the Commission believes that a cap may not be appropriate in all
circumstances and could potentially increase, rather than decrease, systemic risk because it may
impede the covered clearing agency’s ability to replenish resources to cover losses in the event
of a participant default. 399
As a general matter, the Commission also believes that the commenters’ recommendation
would be inconsistent with the principles-based approach set forth in Rule 17Ad-22(e). 400 The
Commission believes that establishing prescriptive standards (such as a cap) that, on an absolute
and ex ante basis, prohibit a covered clearing agency’s use of particular tools for replenishment
would make it more difficult for a covered clearing agency to maintain an appropriate balance
between affording its participants predictability and certainty, and ensuring that the covered
clearing agency can effectively manage risk. The Commission also notes that policies and
procedures related to such caps or other alternative approaches to limitations on the
replenishment of resources would be related to the development of a covered clearing agency’s
recovery and wind-down plans under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3). 401 The Commission has previously
stated in Part II.C.3.b.iii above that, given the nature of recovery planning—as here with caps—
such plans are likely to closely reflect the unique characteristics of the covered clearing agency
399

See infra Part III.B.3.a.viii (discussing the economic effects of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)).

400

See supra Part II.B.

401

See supra Part II.C.3.b.iii.

170

and will vary depending on the products cleared. The Commission believes that these
mechanisms under Rule 17Ad-22(e) would help a covered clearing agency to appropriately
consider, review, and address the need for a cap on replenishment, pursuant to its governance
arrangements.
ii. Risks of Certain Loss Allocation and Limiting Participant
Liability
Two commenters recommended models for loss allocation to non-defaulting customers of
clearing members. 402 One of these commenters urged the Commission to provide clarification
and guidance that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) would (i) ensure participant liability is limited,
ascertainable, and manageable and (ii) require a covered clearing agency to adopt rules
specifying and providing risk disclosure regarding so-called “end of waterfall” scenarios. 403 The
commenter stated that guidance is necessary to ensure that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) complements
the requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(b)(1), 404 certain guidance in the Consultative Recovery
Report, 405 and a number of risk management practices relevant for participants of covered

402

See The Clearing House at 4; Vanguard at 6–7.

403

See The Clearing House at 4. With respect to these comments, the Commission
understands an “end of waterfall” scenario to be a scenario where a covered clearing agency
suffers losses that, due to the default of one or more participants, exceed in the aggregate the
loss-absorbing resources in the covered clearing agency’s default risk management waterfall.
404

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(1). Rule 17Ad-22(b)(1) states that a clearing agency that
performs CCP services shall establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to measure its credit exposures to its participants at least once a
day and limit its exposures to potential losses from defaults by its participants under normal
market conditions so that the operations of the clearing agency would not be disrupted and nondefaulting participants would not be exposed to losses that they cannot anticipate or control.
405

See supra note 126.

171

clearing agencies. 406 In this regard, the commenter noted that participants are subject to single
counterparty credit limits, certain accounting criteria for netting their positions cleared at a CCP,
and regulatory capital requirements. 407 The commenter also noted that such guidance is
necessary to ensure that a covered clearing agency does not become a transmission mechanism
for systemic risk. As a general matter, the commenter expressed opposition to any CCP risk
management practice that constitutes an unpredictable and uncontrollable loss allocation
arrangement or a restriction on participant withdrawal. For this purpose, the commenter asked
the Commission to adopt the following clarification and guidance that: (i) a covered clearing
agency must address the consequences of circumstances in which the covered clearing agency’s
credit losses upon the default of one or more participants exceed the resources designated to
absorb such losses; (ii) a covered clearing agency may not provide for (1) the forced allocation of
a defaulted portfolio to a non-defaulting participant other than through a successfully completed
auction process or otherwise with the participant’s agreement, (2) invoicing to non-defaulting
participants of losses on cleared positions in the portfolio(s) of one or more defaulting
participants or (3) non-voluntary tear-ups of previously matched and cleared positions; and (iii) a
covered clearing agency must clearly specify the process for, and effective time of, withdrawal
from participant status such that a participant may withdraw upon the later of (1) the closeout or
transfer of all its positions and (2) a reasonable prior notice period, without subjecting such
withdrawal to a discretionary or subjective approval requirement or subjecting the withdrawing

406

See The Clearing House at 4.

407

See The Clearing House at 5.

172

participant to liability for increased exposures after the effective time of withdrawal. 408 The
remainder of the requested clarification and guidance would entail affording participants
increased certainty regarding what exposures and obligations might arise where a CCP
encounters an “end of waterfall” scenario. For this reason, the commenter also asked the
Commission to clarify that a covered clearing agency may not redefine the economic terms of
outstanding cleared contracts without a reasonable prior notice and transition period prior to
effectiveness. 409
The second commenter urged the Commission to prohibit the use of non-defaulting
customer initial, variation and excess margin to aid in the recovery of a covered clearing agency
in the event of financial stress, such as from credit losses, liquidity shortfalls, or other losses. 410
According to the commenter, in such a case losses would effectively be allocated to participants
who have not contributed to the loss. The commenter contended that such exposure is not
present in the OTC swaps market, where customer assets are protected in segregated custody
accounts. The commenter also stated that participants have no means to assess and mitigate such
risk, since they do not have transparency into the financial health and risk management practices
of their fellow participants, security-based swap dealers, or the covered clearing agency itself.
The commenter instead urged the Commission to consider the development of enhanced
recordkeeping and reporting, enhanced oversight and compliance, enhanced risk management

408

See id. at 6. The commenter has also sought clarification and guidance regarding
emergency authority or decision-making at covered clearing agencies and disclosures regarding
such decision-making and participant-default rules and procedures. See The Clearing House at
6–7. These comments have been addressed separately in Parts II.C.2.b and II.C.23.b.
409

See id. at 7.

410

See Vanguard at 6–7.

173

and mitigation, increased contributions by SBSDs and increased contributions to, and
management of, the covered clearing agency guaranty fund. 411
Much of the clarification and guidance sought by the commenters, in the Commission’s
view, would entail broad, ex ante prohibitions on a number of specific default management
practices of CCPs, including the use of uncapped assessment authority, prohibitions on the use of
non-defaulting customer initial, variation, and excess margin to aid in recovery, forced
allocations of defaulted clearing portfolios, invoicing back of losses arising from a defaulting
participant’s positions, and partial non-voluntary tear-ups of previously matched and cleared
positions. As discussed further above, 412 Rule 17Ad-22(e) does not prescribe a specific tool or
arrangement to achieve its requirements. The Commission believes that when determining the
content of its policies and procedures with respect to default management, each covered clearing
agency must have the ability to enhance its policies and procedures to meet the evolving
challenges and risks in the securities market that the covered clearing agency serves. Consistent
with the goals sought by the commenters, the Commission has developed through the
amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and new Rule 17Ab2-2, an enhanced oversight and compliance
framework that includes enhanced requirements for the policies and procedures of a covered
clearing agency that govern financial risk management generally and, in particular, the risk
management of guaranty or clearing funds. The Commission therefore is not adopting the
changes sought by these commenters.
The Commission believes that each covered clearing agency generally should consider
evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of respective tools so that the covered clearing agency
411

See id. at 7.

412

See supra Part II.B.

174

can choose the set most appropriate for each relevant recovery scenario, including the sequence
in which they should be used. As previously noted in Part II.C.13.b.i, ensuring that a covered
clearing agency does not become a transmission mechanism for systemic risk means, in part,
striking an appropriate balance between affording its participants predictability and certainty, on
the one hand, and ensuring that the covered clearing agency can effectively manage risk so that it
can effectively continue its risk mitigating function within the broader financial system, on the
other. As a general matter, the Commission believes that striking such a balance can be difficult
using broadly prescriptive standards that, on an absolute and ex ante basis, prohibit a covered
clearing agency’s application of certain risk management tools. Furthermore, particular
requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e) should not be viewed in isolation but instead should be
considered holistically and in light of other requirements under the Exchange Act and the
Clearing Supervision Act.
The Commission believes that policies and procedures for participant default generally
should be established, maintained, and enforced pursuant to the covered clearing agency’s
governance process, which must be consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the
Exchange Act, Section 19 of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder,
including Rule 19b-4. The individual topics raised by the commenters would have implications
for the development of a covered clearing agency’s recovery and wind-down plans; however, as
noted in Part II.C.3.b.iii above in connection with the Commission’s prior discussion of recovery
and wind-down plans, the impact of such recovery tools the covered clearing agency’s recovery
and wind-down plan can only be considered in the context of the plan as a whole and not in
isolation. The organizational and governance structures of covered clearing agencies vary, as do

175

the composition of their members and the products they clear, and each is relevant to
consideration of potential loss allocation mechanisms.
iii. Stakeholder Participation in Periodic Testing
One commenter expressed concern that the requirement in proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(13)(iii) for policies and procedures to require participants and, where practicable, other
stakeholders in the covered clearing agency to participate in periodic testing and review of its
default procedures may be read to require a covered clearing agency to mandate the participation
of all its participants in such tests. 413 The commenter expressed concern that such a requirement
would not be realistically achievable, of sufficient benefit to outweigh the time and costs, or
appropriate given the sensitive nature of information involved in such tests. The commenter
expressed the belief that covered clearing agencies can accomplish the objective of proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)(iii) by methods other than mandating participation in annual closeout tests
and requested discretion and flexibility to achieve such objective. 414
First, the Commission notes that the commenter provided no estimate of the time or costs
of testing. 415 More generally, the Commission notes that the testing requirements in proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)(iii) are similar to requirements for members or participants to participant in
business continuity and disaster recovery plans testing under Regulation SCI, and therefore
registered clearing agencies are already subject to requirements for members to participate in
such testing and have had to consider how to treat sensitive material in such testing. As with
Rule 1004 of Regulation SCI, the Commission continues to believe that participation rates by

176

members and participants in voluntary industry-led testing has generally been low, and that
mandatory participation is the best means to achieve effective and coordinated testing with
assured participation by the more significant members and participants. 416 The Commission
notes, however, that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)(iii) does not specify that all participants in
the clearing agency participate in every periodic test and review of its default procedures. A
covered clearing agency may designate in its policies and procedures that certain participants, or
certain categories of participants, be designated for participation in certain tests.
c. Final Rule
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) with one modification. 417 As
previously noted, 418 the Commission is moving the requirements in proposed Rules 17Ad22(e)(13)(i) and (ii) to Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(viii) and (ix), respectively, to consolidate
requirements for management of a covered clearing agency’s default waterfall within a single
rule. The Commission believes this modification improves consistency between Rules 17Ad22(e)(4) and (7). Specifically, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) includes requirements intended to facilitate
the management of credit risk, and proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(13)(i) and (ii) include
requirements to address the allocation of credit losses and the replenishment of funds. Similarly,
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) includes requirements intended to facilitate the management of liquidity
risk, and Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(viii) and (ix) include requirements to address liquidity shortfalls
and replenish liquid resources. In contrast, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) requires a covered clearing
agency to have policies and procedures addressing its authority and operational capacity to take
416

See Regulation SCI adopting release, supra note 30, at 72349.

417

See Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13), infra Part VI.

See supra Part II.C.4.c.

177

timely action to contain losses and liquidity demands, and proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)(iii)
included requirements for the testing of default procedures. Accordingly, the rules have been
reorganized.
Further, because the Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to
address compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13), the Commission is providing the following
guidance that a covered clearing agency generally should consider in establishing and
maintaining policies and procedures that address participant-default rules and procedures:
•

whether it has default rules and procedures that enable it to continue to meet its
obligations in the event of a participant default and that address the replenishment of
resources following a default;

•

whether it is well prepared to implement its default rules and procedures, including any
appropriate discretionary procedures provided for in its rules;

•

whether it publicly discloses key aspects of its default rules and procedures;

•

whether it involves its participants and other stakeholders in the testing and review of its
default procedures, including any close-out procedures; and

•

whether such testing and review is conducted at least annually or following material
changes to the rules and procedures to ensure that the testing and review are practical and
effective.

In addition, a covered clearing agency that has financial and operational triggers for default
generally should clearly define these triggers. 419 Where triggers are not automatic through the

419

See Clearing Agency Standards, supra note 5, at 29544. An operational default may
occur when a participant is not able to meet its obligations due to an operational problem, such as
a failure in information technology systems. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) includes requirements related
to operational risk management. See infra Part II.C.17. In addition, the Commission has also
178

application of objective standards or thresholds, the Commission believes the discretion afforded
a covered clearing agency to declare defaults should be clearly defined. For example, a clear
definition may include defining which person or group exercises discretionary authority in the
event of default and providing specific examples of when the exercise of discretion is
appropriate.
With respect to policies and procedures related to managing a participant default, the
Commission believes that such policies and procedures generally should address, among other
things (i) accessing credit facilities, (ii) managing (which may include hedging open positions
and funding collateral positions it is not prudent to close out immediately), transferring (such as
through allocation or auction to other members) and/or closing out a defaulting member’s
positions; and (iii) transferring and/or liquidating applicable collateral. Based on its supervisory
experience, the Commission believes that default procedures would generally set forth (i) the
action that may be taken (e.g., exercising mutualization of losses); (ii) who may take those
actions (e.g., the division of responsibilities when clearing agencies operate links to other
clearing agencies); (iii) the scope of the actions that may be taken (e.g., any limits on the total
losses that would be mutualized); (iv) potential changes to the normal settlement practices,
should these changes be necessary in extreme circumstances, to ensure timely settlement; (v) the
management of transactions at different stages of processing; (vi) the sequencing of actions; (vii)
the roles, obligations, and responsibilities of the various parties, including non-defaulting
members; (viii) the mechanisms to address a covered clearing agency’s obligations to nondefaulting members (e.g., the process for clearing trades guaranteed by the covered clearing

adopted Regulation SCI, which establishes requirements for SROs, among other entities, with
respect to operational risk management. See supra note 30 and accompanying text.

179

agency to which a defaulting member is a party); and (ix) the mechanisms to address the
defaulting member’s obligations to its customers (e.g., the process for dealing with a defaulting
member’s accounts).
With respect to the operational capacity necessary to comply with requirements to
contain losses, the Commission believes that the following measures could help promote
operational capacity: (i) establishing training programs for employees involved in default matters
to ensure policies are well implemented; (ii) developing a communications strategy for
communicating with stakeholders, including the Commission, concerning defaults; and (iii)
making sure the proper tools and resources (whether these are personnel or other) required are
available to close out, transfer, or hedge open positions of a defaulting member promptly even in
the face of rapid market movements.
With respect to the policies and procedures for testing and review of default procedures,
including any close-out procedures, a covered clearing agency generally should perform the
testing and review not less than once every twelve months. In addition, a covered clearing
agency generally should make efforts to secure the participation of all stakeholders in testing and
review of default procedures, but the Commission recognizes that a covered clearing agency may
have limited ability to require said participation by all such stakeholders in all circumstances.
14. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14): Segregation and Portability
a. Proposed Rule
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) would apply only to a covered clearing agency that is
either a security-based swap clearing agency or a complex risk profile clearing agency. Rule
17Ad-22(e)(14) would require such a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to enable the segregation and

180

portability of positions of a member’s customers and the collateral provided to the covered
clearing agency with respect to those positions, and effectively protect such positions and related
collateral from the default or insolvency of that member. 420
b. Comments Received and Commission Response
The Commission received multiple comments on Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) and, more
generally, the Commission’s regime for segregation and portability in the U.S. securities
markets. While some commenters supported the Commission’s proposed principles-based
approach, a number of commenters expressed a preference for an approach that would prescribe,
and in some instances mandate, a specific segregation and portability framework. In addition,
two commenters sought clarification on certain aspects of the proposal relating to portability and
protection of customer assets held at a common covered clearing agency participant. The
Commission discusses these three groups of comments in turn below.
One commenter strongly supported efforts to improve the protection of customer
positions and collateral. 421 Another commenter also expressed general support for the
Commission’s objective of protecting customer collateral posted in connection with clearing
security-based swaps, and stated that the implementation of a regulatory structure that provided
for appropriate protection of collateral would reduce systemic risk by bolstering confidence that
losses related to counterparty risk would be manageable. 422
Several commenters, however, urged the Commission to modify the proposed rule’s
approach to the treatment of customer positions, particularly with respect to security-based
420

181

swaps. Three commenters noted the importance of coordinating efforts with other regulators to
ensure that the Commission’s rules are consistent with other regulatory regimes. 423 Two
commenters expressed related concerns that the proposal could result in significantly weaker
protections for security-based swaps than exist in the OTC market or in the rules for cleared
swaps adopted by the CFTC. 424 Of these, one commenter opposed the Commission’s approach
of providing covered clearing agencies with discretion to adopt policies and procedures
regarding holding of margin for security-based swaps. 425 The commenter stated that the
Commission should instead adopt a mandatory threshold level of protection for customer margin
for security-based swaps that is consistent with the protections afforded to swaps and that is
appropriate to the breadth and depth of the security-based swap market. 426 Moreover, the same
commenter, along with two other commenters, recommended that the Commission explicitly
adopt the LSOC model as a framework for the segregation and portability of customer
positions, 427 and two of the three commenters also urged that the Commission’s LSOC regime be
mandatory and uniform. 428
In addition, one commenter that urged the Commission to adopt a specific LSOC
mandate also expressed several other related comments. The commenter expressed the need for

182

covered clearing agencies to provide individual segregation as an option for customers. 429 The
commenter also recommended that both initial and variation margin be passed on to the covered
clearing agency, with all excess margin held in a segregated account (the “LSOC with excess”
model). 430 The commenter further expressed the belief that security-based swap dealers and
broker-dealers should not be authorized to rehypothecate or use customer margin or excess
margin in its business. 431 Finally, in conjunction with another commenter, this commenter also
submitted a second comment letter noting that, to implement LSOC for security-based swap
positions, the Commission would need to undertake several initiatives in addition to revising
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14), including amending rules under SIPA, revising proposed Rule 18a-4 under
the Exchange Act, amending Rule 15c3-3 under the Exchange Act, and permanently extending
the relief provided in the Portfolio Margining order. 432

429

See ICI at 12–13.

430

See id. at 4–5.

431

See id. at 5. Because the commenter’s recommendation would govern the activities of
security-based swap dealers and broker-dealers, the Commission notes that it is beyond the scope
of Rule 17Ad-22.
432

See AMG-ICI at 8–12. The commenter also noted that the adoption of a sound and
workable segregation regime is essential to ensure that counterparties are protected in
bankruptcy. See ICI at 11-12. The Commission agrees that the development of a covered
clearing agency’s segregation and portability regime should consider the operational and
bankruptcy implications of such a regime. The Commission also notes that the tools available to
a covered clearing agency considering such implications will necessarily depend on the legal
regime applicable to the covered clearing agency. The commenter recommended that the
Commission articulate in a proposal the operational and bankruptcy implications of such a
structure to provide market participants the opportunity to comment on these issues. See id. at 4.
The Commission believes, however, that the operational and bankruptcy implications will
depend on the particular tools that a covered clearing agency employs in its segregation and
portability regime and also on the legal regimes within which the covered clearing agency
operates. Because the Commission is taking a principles-based approach in Rule 17Ad-22(e),
the Commission is not making such a proposal under Rule 17Ad-22(e).

183

After careful consideration, the Commission declines to modify Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) to
explicitly prescribe or mandate the segregation and portability frameworks described
immediately above. The Commission notes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) provides covered clearing
agencies with flexibility, subject to their obligations and responsibilities as SROs under the
Exchange Act, to determine policies and procedures with respect to the means of segregation and
portability consistent with the rule. Furthermore, in contrast with the views expressed by the
commenters above, the Commission believes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) already requires a
mandatory threshold level of protection for customer margin for security-based swaps similar to
the threshold level of protection for swaps because it requires policies and procedures reasonably
designed to both (i) enable the segregation and portability of positions of a participant’s
customers and the collateral provided to the covered clearing agency with respect to those
positions, and (ii) protect such positions and related collateral from the default or insolvency of
that participant.
The Commission believes that prescribing the particular frameworks identified by the
commenters would be inconsistent with the Commission’s principles-based approach to Rule
17Ad-22(e). 433 Although a tool or method like LSOC might be appropriate for a covered
clearing agency operating in certain domestic markets to meet the requirements of Rule 17Ad22(e)(14), in other markets other tools or methods, such as an individual segregation method,
may also provide the threshold level of protection sought by the commenters while being
consistent with the rule. Moreover, in contrast to the markets for cash and listed options in the
United States, where the structure for segregation and portability is primarily maintained at the

433

See supra Part II.A.4.

184

broker-dealer level, 434 in the market for security-based swaps the segregation and portability
structure resides in CCPs, and those entities have taken different approaches reflective of the

434

Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3 requires broker-dealers that maintain custody of customer
securities and cash (a “carrying broker-dealer”) to take two primary steps to safeguard these
assets. The steps are designed to protect customers by segregating their securities and cash from
the broker-dealer’s proprietary business activities. If the broker-dealer fails financially, the
securities and cash should be readily available to be returned to customers. In addition, if the
failed broker-dealer is liquidated in a formal proceeding under the Securities Investor Protection
Act of 1970, the securities and cash would be isolated and readily identifiable as “customer
property” and, consequently, available to be distributed to customers ahead of other creditors.

The first step required by Rule 15c3-3 is that a carrying broker must maintain physical
possession or control of all fully paid and excess margin securities of their customers. See 17
CFR 240.15c3-3. Physical possession or control means the broker-dealer must hold these
securities in one of several locations specified in Rule 15c3-3 and free of liens or any other
interest that could be exercised by a third party to secure an obligation of the broker-dealer.
Permissible locations include a bank, as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Exchange Act, and a
clearing agency. As described herein, holding jumbo/global positions in the record name and
custody of a clearing agency is a fundamental part of current U.S. market structure in which
many holders hold indirectly through “street name.”
The second step is that a carrying broker-dealer must maintain a reserve of cash or
qualified securities in an account at a bank that is at least equal in value to the net cash owed to
customers, including cash obtained from the use of customer securities. The account must be
titled “Special Reserve Bank Account for the Exclusive Benefit of Customers.” The amount of
net cash owed to customers is computed pursuant to a formula set forth in Exhibit A to Rule
15c3-3. Under the customer reserve formula, the broker-dealer adds up customer credit items
(e.g., cash in customer securities accounts and cash obtained through the use of customer margin
securities) and then subtracts from that amount customer debit items (e.g., margin loans). If
credit items exceed debit items, the net amount must be on deposit in the customer reserve
account in the form of cash and/or qualified securities. A broker-dealer cannot make a
withdrawal from the customer reserve account until the next computation and then only if the
computation shows that the reserve requirement has decreased. The broker-dealer must make a
deposit into the customer reserve account if the computation shows an increase in the reserve
requirement. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3.
In addition, records of customer positions are subject to broker-dealer recordkeeping
rules. Exchange Act Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 require records be kept for certain periods of time,
such as three or six year periods depending upon the type of record. See 17 CFR 240.17a-3, 17a4.
See also 15 U.S.C. 78c-5 (providing for segregation with respect to security-based
swaps); Exchange Act Release No. 34-68071 (Oct. 18, 2012), 77 FR 70213, (Nov. 23, 2012)

needs of their different structures, members, markets served, and products cleared. For example,
the Commission notes that one commenter understood Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) to permit a covered
clearing agency to employ either an LSOC model, consistent with the requirements set forth by
the CFTC, or an individual segregation model, consistent with EMIR. 435 Accordingly, the
Commission does not believe, as requested by the commenters, that the Commission should
mandate LSOC on a uniform basis across security-based swap and complex risk profile clearing
agencies.
Notwithstanding its decision not to adopt an approach that prescribes or mandates a
specific portability and segregation framework, the Commission notes that it has been mindful of
the existing structures for segregation and portability for security-based swaps in the United
States, and has granted relief intended to allow investors to participate in the market for securitybased swaps. Notably, the Commission has issued an order granting conditional exemptive relief
from compliance with certain provisions of the Exchange Act in connection with a program to
commingle and portfolio margin customer positions in cleared credit default swaps, which
include both swaps and security-based swaps, in a segregated account established and
maintained in accordance with Section 4d(f) of the Commodity Exchange Act. 436 In this regard,
the Commission observes that the individual segregation method is one tool that provides a

(proposing Rule 18a-4 under the Exchange Act for segregation with respect to security-based
swaps). The Commission has also granted conditional relief under Sections 3E(b), (d), and (e) of
the Exchange Act to, among others, clearing entities dually registered with the Commission and
the CFTC as registered clearing agencies and DCOs, respectively. See Exchange Act Release
No. 34-68433 (Dec. 14, 2012), 77 FR 75211 (Dec. 19, 2012).

threshold level of protection to customers and may be a tool that a covered clearing agency
determines to employ consistent with the requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14). The
Commission also observes that under the “LSOC with excess” model, customer margin is
segregated from clearing member margin, and therefore that framework, like LSOC and
individual segregation as previously described, is also a tool that may also be relevant to a
covered clearing agency’s consideration of how to implement a framework consistent with the
requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14).
In addition, the Commission received two comments that asked the Commission to
clarify certain aspects of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14). One commenter noted that there could be tension
between the competing goals of (i) customer portability and (ii) the need for a covered clearing
agency to ensure the safety and soundness of itself and the markets. 437 The commenter urged the
Commission to recognize the need for a covered clearing agency to balance these competing
priorities and to avoid any interpretation of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) that prohibits a
covered clearing agency from liquidating positions, including customer positions, where
liquidation is reasonably necessary for the protection of the covered clearing agency. 438 In
response, the Commission believes that efforts to enable portability at security-based swap
clearing agencies should be encouraged, but the Commission also recognizes that non-defaulting
clearing members should not be required to take on customer positions to avoid putting the nondefaulting clearing member at risk, exceeding the member’s ability to risk manage the
customer’s portfolio, or existing or creating inconsistencies with the member’s risk profile. If a
customer’s positions cannot be ported, they will instead be liquidated. Therefore, the
437

See OCC at 12.

438

See id.

187

Commission does not believe the comment is inconsistent with either current practice or Rule
17Ad-22(e)(14), which does not prohibit the liquidation of customer positions in the event
porting would be impracticable, contrary to the customer’s preferences, or pose increased risk to
the markets or non-defaulting members.
A second commenter stated that the proposed rule is silent on the issue of protections
from fellow-customer risk (i.e., protecting the positions and related collateral of a participant’s
customers from losses associated with the positions of other customers of that participant), and
that Section 3E(e) of the Exchange Act prohibits clearing agencies from using deposited property
as belonging to any person other than the swaps customer of the depositing broker, dealer, or
security-based swap dealer. 439 The commenter recommended that the Commission make explicit
that a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures must give effect to Section 3E(e) and
that the covered clearing agency should publicly disclose the manner in which its procedures do
so. 440 In response, the Commission notes that Section 3E(e) of the Exchange Act already
prohibits such activity and, therefore any proposed rule change under Rule 19b-4 would need to
be consistent with Section 3E(e).
c. Final Rule
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) as proposed. The Commission is
applying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) only to security-based swap clearing agencies and complex risk
profile clearing agencies because existing rules for the cash securities and listed options markets
applicable to broker-dealers already promote segregation and portability to protect customer
positions and funds in those markets. In proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14), the Commission noted
439

See ISDA at 5.

440

See id. at 5–6.

188

that it intended to avoid requiring changes to the existing structure of cash securities and listed
options markets in the United States where registered clearing agencies that provide CCP or CSD
services play a central role. 441 This approach is consistent with the PFMI.
Transactions in the U.S. cash security and listed options markets are characterized by the
following features: (i) customers of members generally do not have an account at a clearing
agency; 442 (ii) the clearing agency is not able to identify which participants’ customers
beneficially own the street name positions registered in the record name of the clearing agency
(or its nominee); and (iii) the clearing agency has no recourse to funds of customers of members.
Therefore, neither portability nor segregation occur as a practical matter at the CCP level under
the current market structure for cash securities and listed options. 443 Further, customer positions
and funds in the cash securities and listed options markets are protected under the Securities
Investor Protection Act of 1970 (“SIPA”). 444

441

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29546.

442

A customer of a member also would not have an account at the clearing agency where
holding in record name (rather than through street name ownership). This is the case even where
such record name owner-customer does not receive a paper security certificate but holds in bookentry form through the direct registration system, as direct registration system accounts are
maintained by a transfer agent and not by the clearing agency. See Exchange Act Release No.
34-63320 (Nov. 16, 2010), 75 FR 71473, 71474 (Nov. 23, 2010) (discussing the ability of
registered owners to hold their assets on the records of transfer agents in book-entry form
through the direct registration system).
443

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29546.

444

See 15 U.S.C. 78eee et seq. Pursuant to SIPA, when a broker-dealer that is a member of
the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”) fails and customer assets are missing,
SIPC seeks to return customer cash and securities, and supplements the distribution of the
remaining customer assets at the broker-dealer with SIPC reserve funds of up to $500,000 per
customer, including a maximum of $250,000 for cash claims.

189

With respect to portability, the Commission notes the portability requirement in Rule
17Ad-22(e)(14) would not apply only upon a member default; instead, a covered clearing agency
to which Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) applies generally should have policies and procedures that
facilitate porting in the normal course of business, such as when a customer ends its relationship
with a member to start a new relationship with a different member, or as a result of other events,
such as a merger involving the member. Under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14), a security-based swap
clearing agency or complex risk profile clearing agency generally should structure its portability
arrangements in a way that makes it highly likely that the positions and collateral of a defaulting
member’s customers could be effectively transferred to one or more other members.
Consistent with its response to the commenters discussed above, the Commission
recognizes that there may be a number of ways to address compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14).
Therefore, the Commission is providing the following guidance that a covered clearing agency
subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) generally should consider in establishing and maintaining
policies and procedures for segregation and portability:
•

whether it has, at a minimum, segregation and portability arrangements that effectively
protect a participant’s customers’ positions and related collateral from the default or
insolvency of that participant;

•

if it additionally offers protection of such customer positions and collateral against the
concurrent default of the participant and a fellow customer, whether it takes steps to
ensure that such protection is effective;

•

whether it employs an account structure that enables it readily to identify positions of a
participant’s customers and to segregate related collateral, and whether it maintains

190

customer positions and collateral in individual customer accounts or in omnibus customer
accounts;
•

whether it structures its portability arrangements in a way that makes it highly likely that
the positions and collateral of a defaulting participant’s customers will be transferred to
one or more other participants;

•

whether it discloses its rules, policies, and procedures relating to the segregation and
portability of a participant’s customers’ positions and related collateral, and, in particular,
whether it discloses whether customer collateral is protected on an individual or omnibus
basis; and

•

whether it discloses any constraints, such as legal or operational constraints, that may
impair its ability to segregate or port a participant’s customers’ positions and related
collateral.
15. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15): General Business Risk
a. Proposed Rule
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,

implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
identify, monitor, and manage its general business risk and hold sufficient liquid net assets
funded by equity to cover potential general business losses so that the covered clearing agency
can continue operations and services as a going concern if those losses materialize. 445 Proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(i) would require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to determine the

445

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29547–48.

191

amount of liquid net assets funded by equity based upon its general business risk profile and the
length of time required to achieve a recovery or orderly wind-down, as appropriate, of its critical
operations and services if such action is taken. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(ii) would require
a clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to provide for holding liquid net assets funded by equity equal to the greater
of either six months of its current operating expenses or the amount determined by the board of
directors to be sufficient to ensure a recovery or orderly wind-down of critical operations and
services of the covered clearing agency, as contemplated by the plans established under proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(ii). Additionally, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(ii) would require a
covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to provide for monitoring its business operations and reducing
the likelihood of losses. 446 Finally, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(iii) would require a covered
clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to provide for maintaining a viable plan, approved by the board of directors
and updated at least annually, for raising additional equity should its equity fall close to or below
the amount required by the proposed rule as discussed above. 447
b. Comments Received
Most commenters expressed general support for the Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15), but a number
of commenters also raised specific areas of concern and encouraged the Commission to adopt
specific, and in some cases prescriptive, requirements under the rule. The Commission addresses
each of these comments in turn below.

i. General Comments
One commenter expressed support for the proposed requirements for clearing agencies to
identify and monitor general business risk, manage liquid assets, and maintain a viable plan for
raising additional equity when needed. 448 The commenter believed that such requirements
contribute to avoiding disruptions in the operations of clearing agencies, as well as the broader
market. The commenter also expressed support for the proposed rule’s requirements to identify,
monitor and manage general business risk and to hold sufficient liquid assets in a manner
allowing for a recovery or orderly wind-down if necessary. 449 A second commenter expressed
support for the proposed requirement that covered clearing agencies hold sufficient capital to
cover potential general business and operational losses and to enable continuation of business
operations and noted a belief that six months of operating expenses is an appropriate base level
of funding. 450 A third commenter generally endorsed the Commission’s proposal to require a
covered clearing agency to maintain liquid net assets sufficient to allow the covered clearing
agency to continue to operate for no less than six months. 451 A fourth commenter also generally
supported the Commission’s proposal. 452 Finally, one commenter requested that the

Commission phase-in implementation of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15), 453 and that comment is addressed
in Part II.G above.
ii. Application to Derivatives Clearing
One commenter expressed concern that the proposed requirement would be inadequate to
address the potential for general business losses incurred by a covered clearing agency that clears
large quantities of bespoke swap and derivative instruments, and therefore the commenter urged
the Commission to reassess whether clearing of bespoke instruments is appropriate in light of the
potential problems in predicting the performance of such instruments during times of stress. 454
The Commission notes that the purpose of proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e) was not to reassess
whether the clearing of bespoke instruments is appropriate, but to focus on the regulatory
framework for the regulation of covered clearing agencies and address, among other things,
governance and financial risk management. Therefore, the Commission believes that the
comment is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.
iii. Liquid Net Assets
The Commission received multiple comments related to the liquid net assets required
under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(ii). One commenter stated that, in addition to pre-funded capital and
guaranty funds, it should be clear, in advance, that clearing members (and not the FRB or
taxpayers) stand behind the organization should it run into financial trouble. 455 The Commission
believes that Rule 17Ad-22(e), taken as a whole, already contemplates and addresses the

453

See OCC at 15 (noting that it would be in a position to comply with such requirement by
no later than January 1, 2015).
454

194

commenter’s concern. As previously noted, the rule requires policies and procedures reasonably
designed to promote in a comprehensive way the resiliency of a covered clearing agency and, in
particular, its ability to withstand periods of market stress. 456 The Commission notes as a
general matter that the liquid net assets described in the rule should not be confused with the
accounting term “net liquid assets.” For purposes of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(ii), a covered clearing
agency generally should consider liquid net assets to mean cash or highly liquid securities.
When liquid net assets are funded by equity, a covered clearing agency generally should consider
equity to mean common stock, disclosed reserves, and other related earnings. In addition, the
Commission notes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(ii) separately requires policies and procedures for
plans for recovery or orderly wind-down.
Two commenters urged the Commission not to take too narrow a view of what sources of
funding would be considered liquid net assets funded by equity under the proposed rule. 457 The
first commenter believed that in calculating its six-month liquid asset coverage, a CCP should be
allowed to include projected revenues of the CCP over the same six-month period, subject to an
appropriate haircut. 458 The commenter also requested that the Commission clarify that a buffer,
such as a contingent capital arrangement requiring clearing members to contribute funds, should
be considered an appropriate source of equity funding under the rule. 459 On these two issues,
the Commission believes that the commenter has identified policies and procedures that would

456

See supra notes 284–288 and accompanying text (discussing similar position from
commenter regarding Rule 27Ad-22(e)(5)).
457

458

See OCC at 14.

195

not satisfy Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15). Among other things, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(ii) requires policies
and procedures for holding liquid net assets funded by equity. If a covered clearing agency is
relying on projected revenues or on obtaining liquid net assets through contingent arrangements,
then the covered clearing agency is not holding liquid net assets funded by equity. The focus of
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(ii) is mitigating the risk that a covered clearing agency would be unable to
perform its obligations as a going concern; to minimize such performance risk, the covered
clearing agency must necessarily have assets that are readily available, such as cash reserves or
cash equivalents. Projected revenues, like contingent funding mechanisms, do not provide
certainty that a covered clearing agency can continue to perform its obligations when general
business losses arise because the assets may be unavailable to satisfy business losses.
The same commenter and a second commenter also urged the Commission to clarify and
broadly construe what constitutes equity capital to include noncumulative perpetual preferred
stock, which would be permanently available. 460 One of these commenters noted that such
preferred stock constitutes additional tier 1 capital under the BCBS capital framework and
expressed the belief that the elements of capital that constitute tier 1 capital should be permitted
to count as equity under the proposed rule. 461 In response, the Commission believes that the
question of whether a particular noncumulative preferred stock would constitute equity capital
would depend on the terms and conditions of each instrument and therefore such instruments
would need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The Commission therefore declines to adopt
the position urged by the commenter.

460

See DTCC at 10; OCC at 14.

461

See DTCC at 10–11.

196

The same commenter further expressed an expectation that liquid net assets funded by
equity would be calculated by comparing the clearing agency’s shareholders equity to
proprietary cash and liquid marketable securities and deducting unaffiliated third-party debt. 462
The commenter believed that it is appropriate for a covered clearing agency, where it has
significant shareholder equity, to be able to liquefy that equity via intercompany funding so long
as the requisite amount of cash and/or liquid securities is held and maintained at the covered
clearing agency level. The commenter also emphasized the role that holding company structures
play in funding their affiliates, noting that the holding company may have broader access to
financial markets to liquefy the equity base of their subsidiaries. 463 The commenter argued that
such financing would provide a high level of flexibility to meet a covered clearing agency’s
needs. In response to the commenter, the Commission is unable to opine on these particular
calculations of the commenter’s liquid net assets because the determination of whether a
particular liquid net asset calculation meets the requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(ii) would
need to be made on a detailed, case-by-case basis. The Commission would need to understand
and evaluate, for example, the covered clearing agency’s particular capital structure, the types of
securities being held, the nature and extent of the covered clearing agency’s debt holdings, the
structure and elements of the intercompany funding arrangement described by the commenter,
and the nature of the access that the holding company has to the relevant markets for the
purposes of liquefying any subsidiary equity and how that access differs from that of the covered
clearing agency.

462

463

See id.

197

In response to the commenter’s position regarding the role that a holding company
structure may play in addressing the requirement of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15), the Commission
reiterates prior statements made above that the requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e) apply to each
covered clearing agency registered with the Commission. Therefore, for example, if a covered
clearing agency’s parent or holding company were to adopt a company-wide framework
addressing the issues covered in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15), the covered clearing agency nevertheless
would itself need to adopt or ratify those policies and procedures with respect to its own business
to meet the requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15). 464 As adopted, pursuant to Rule 17Ad22(e)(15)(ii) each covered clearing agency is required to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for holding liquid net
assets funded by equity equal to the greater of either six months of its current operating expenses
or the amount determined by the board of directors to be sufficient to ensure a recovery or
orderly wind-down of critical operations and services of the covered clearing agency.
iv. Viable Plan to Raise Additional Equity
With respect to the requirement for a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures
to be reasonably designed to have a viable plan, updated annually, for raising additional equity
when the covered clearing agency’s equity falls below or close to the amount required by the
proposed rule, one commenter believed that the proposed rule should require capital-raising to
occur prior to a covered clearing agency approaching the required equity threshold. 465
Otherwise, the commenter stated, the covered clearing agency may be unable to raise the needed

464

See supra Part II.C.3.c.

465

See CFA Institute at 10.

198

equity due to market conditions. 466 In response, the Commission notes that Rule 17Ad22(e)(15)(iii), as proposed, addresses the commenter’s concern by requiring that the plan be
viable when the covered clearing agency’s equity falls below or close to the amount required by
the proposed rule. However, the Commission is providing further guidance below to clarify its
position further.
Another commenter expressed the belief that an annual review of the plan for raising
additional equity is unnecessary and that a biannual review is sufficient, provided that the plan is
reviewed sooner should changes occur. 467 The Commission continues to believe, however, that
an annual review is an appropriate interval to help ensure that each covered clearing agency is
mindful of changing market conditions. The Commission believes that, in a two-year window
between biannual reviews, so much time passes that a covered clearing agency may find that
market conditions have changed so significantly that a once-viable plan to raise additional equity
is no longer viable. A yearly review cycle helps ensure that the covered clearing agency remains
aware of changing market conditions, facilitating on an annual basis incremental updates to the
plan in response to said changing market conditions. Further, the Commission believes that a
covered clearing agency could adopt policies and procedures that provide for more frequent
review in response to changing market conditions, and that such policies and procedures would
help a covered clearing agency better react to periods of market stress. Therefore, the
Commission has determined not to adopt the commenter’s suggested approach.
c. Final Rule

466

See id.

467

See DTCC at 11.

199

The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) as proposed. Because the
Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to address compliance with Rule
17Ad-22(e)(15), the Commission is providing the following guidance that a covered clearing
agency generally should consider in establishing and maintaining policies and procedures that
address general business risk:
•

whether it has robust management and control systems to identify, monitor, and manage
general business risks, including losses from poor execution of business strategy,
negative cash flows, or unexpected and excessively large operating expenses;

•

whether it holds liquid net assets funded by equity (such as common stock, disclosed
reserves, or other retained earnings) so that it can continue operations and services as a
going concern if it incurs general business losses;

•

whether the amount of liquid net assets funded by equity it holds is determined by its
general business risk profile and the length of time required to achieve a recovery or
orderly wind-down, as appropriate, of its critical operations and services if such action is
taken;

•

whether it maintains a viable recovery or orderly wind-down plan and holds sufficient
liquid net assets funded by equity to implement this plan that, at a minimum, are funded
by equity equal to at least six months of current operating expenses, in addition to
resources held to cover participant defaults or other risks addressed by its financial
resources;

•

whether assets held to cover general business risk are of high quality and sufficiently
liquid to allow the covered clearing agency to meet its current and projected operating
expenses under a range of scenarios, including in adverse market conditions; and

200

•

whether it maintains a viable plan, approved by the board of directors and updated no less
than annually, for raising additional equity should its equity fall close to or below the
amount needed.
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(iii) and the policies and procedures for maintaining

a viable plan, the Commission believes that a viable plan generally should enable the covered
clearing agency to hold sufficient liquid net assets to achieve recovery or orderly wind-down.
Therefore, the Commission believes that a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures
generally should define when a covered clearing agency’s equity falls close to the amount
required by the rule, so that the covered clearing agency has policies and procedures that clearly
define when the covered clearing agency should initiate the plan to raise additional equity. In
developing such policies and procedures, a covered clearing agency generally should consider
and account for circumstances that may require a certain length of time before any plan can be
implemented. For example, before obtaining shareholder approval to issue new shares, a
covered clearing agency may need to call a special meeting subject to a notice period.
In addition, with respect to the plan under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(iii) being approved by
the board of directors and updated at least annually, the board of a covered clearing agency
generally should perform the approval not less than once every twelve months.
16. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16): Custody and Investment Risks
a. Proposed Rule
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
safeguard its own and its participants’ assets and minimize the risk of loss and delay in access to
these assets. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) would also require a covered clearing agency to

201

establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to invest such assets in instruments with minimal credit, market, and liquidity risks.
b. Comments Received and Commission Response
The Commission received one comment on proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16), which
generally sought consideration of more prescriptive or granular aspects to the Commission’s
approach. 468 The commenter made several points about the proposed rule. First, the commenter
noted that to mitigate the risks to participants from current CCP practices for participant
collateral, including commingling, rehypothetication or title transfer arrangements, and
investment practices, the Commission should provide additional guidance regarding the specific
protections a covered clearing agency must employ to safeguard participants’ collateral and
invest such collateral in instruments with minimal credit, market, and liquidity risks. 469
Moreover, the commenter stated its belief that house collateral is inadequately segregated,
current investment practices expose members to unnecessary risk of loss, and CCP investment
policies and practices expose members to interest rate and credit risk through investments in
higher-risk and longer-term instruments, putting member principal at risk. 470
The commenter stated that, due to commingling and inadequate traceability, participants’
rights to the return of their collateral upon the insolvency of a CCP are often uncertain and could
be impaired. 471 The commenter also noted that some CCPs are permitted to rehypothecate
participant securities collateral or to secure their investments using title transfer arrangements,
468

See The Clearing House at 3, 11–12.

469

See id. at 3, 11.

470

See id. at 11.

471

See id.

202

each of which exposes participants to potential loss due to the unavailability of participant
collateral (or its liquidation value) in the CCP’s insolvency. 472
For the purpose of minimizing investment risk and the risk of loss of participant
collateral, the commenter recommended that the Commission confirm the applicability of the
following protections with respect to a covered clearing agency’s treatment of participant
collateral:
•

Limit a CCP’s ability to encumber or impair participants’ rights in guaranty fund
contributions and initial margin posted to the CCP in support of proprietary
positions. 473

•

Specify standards for the establishment, designation, and maintenance of accounts for
the safekeeping of participant collateral, and related requirements to ensure the
treatment of such funds as belonging to the relevant participants in the event of the
insolvency of the covered clearing agency and otherwise; 474

•

Further specify the types of highly liquid investments (and, as applicable, eligible
counterparties and issuers), and related concentration and weighted average maturity
limits, applicable to the investment of participant collateral, as well as the capital of
the covered clearing agency committed to the default waterfall; 475

•

Prohibit the rehypothecation of non-cash collateral of non-defaulting participants and
limit such rehypothecation in the case of a defaulting participant to circumstances

472

See id.

473

See id. at 11–12.

474

See id. at 12.

475

See id.

203

where an immediate liquidation of the non-cash collateral would lead to severe asset
value depreciation; 476 and
•

Require to use pledged arrangements when taking collateral, except where title
transfer arrangements are necessitated by applicable law. 477

The commenter also recommended that the Commission specify a covered clearing agency’s
disclosure obligations with respect to its collateral investment activities, including the extent of
reuse of participant collateral, eligible counterparties for collateral rehypothecation, the covered
clearing agency or participant’s rights to the collateral posted to it and the covered clearing
agency’s investment policies, balances, and concentrations. 478
Much of the clarification and guidance sought by the commenter, in the Commission’s
view, would entail the imposition of prescriptive and granular requirements on covered clearing
agencies with respect to their custody and investment risks. Such ex ante requirements would be
inconsistent with the Commission’s principles-based approach to Rule 17Ad-22(e). 479 Although
it is possible that the commenter’s suggestions could be appropriate in certain circumstances, the
Commission believes that these comments do not take into account the variation among covered
clearing agencies with respect to the different markets served, products cleared, and risk
management needs. Nevertheless, the Commission believes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) already
encompasses the commenter’s suggestions, and that many covered clearing agencies already
employ and can continue to consider these suggestions when designing or revising policies and
476

See id.

477

See id.

478

See id.

479

See supra Part II.B.

204

procedures under the rule. The Commission therefore believes that no modifications to Rule
17Ad-22(e)(16) are necessary.
c. Final Rule
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) as proposed. Because the
Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to address compliance with Rule
17Ad-22(e)(16), the Commission is providing the following guidance that a covered clearing
agency generally should consider in establishing and maintaining policies and procedures that
address custody and investment risk:
•

whether it holds its own and its participants’ assets at supervised and regulated entities
that have robust accounting practices, safekeeping procedures, and internal controls that
fully protect these assets;

•

whether it has prompt access to its assets and the assets provided by participants, when
required;

•

whether it evaluates and understands its exposures to its custodian banks, taking into
account the full scope of its relationships with each;

•

whether its investment strategy is consistent with its overall risk management strategy
and fully disclosed to its participants; and

•

whether its investments are secured by, or claims on, high-quality obligors, allowing for
quick liquidation with little, if any, adverse price effect.

The Commission also notes that failure by a clearing agency to hold assets in instruments with
minimal credit, market, and liquidity risk may limit the clearing agency’s ability to access these
assets promptly. The Commission therefore believes that covered clearing agencies, in seeking
to satisfying the requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16), generally should seek to minimize the

205

risk of loss or delay in access by holding assets that are highly liquid (e.g., cash, U.S. Treasury
securities, or securities issued by a U.S. government agency) and by using only supervised and
regulated entities such as banks to act as custodians for the assets and to facilitate settlement.
The Commission further notes that the rule does not require that a covered clearing agency invest
its own and its participants’ assets but that it have policies and procedures for investing such
assets in instruments with minimal credit, market, and liquidity risks when it determines to so
invest.
17. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17): Operational Risk Management
a. Proposed Rule
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage
the covered clearing agency’s operational risk. In proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17), the
Commission noted that operational risk involves, among other things, the likelihood that
deficiencies in information systems or internal controls, human errors or misconduct,
management failures, unauthorized intrusions into corporate or production systems, or
disruptions from external events such as natural disasters, would adversely affect the functioning
of a clearing agency. 480
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(i) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify
the plausible sources of operational risk, both internal and external, and mitigate their impact
through the use of appropriate systems, policies, procedures, and controls. Proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(17)(ii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain, and
480

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29551.

206

enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that systems have a high
degree of security, resiliency, operational reliability, and adequate, scalable capacity. Finally,
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(iii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
for a business continuity plan that addresses events posing a significant risk of disrupting
operations. 481
b. Comments Received and Commission Response
The Commission received one comment that generally supported the Commission’s
approach in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17). The commenter expressed a belief that most, if not all,
businesses of the size and significance of a covered clearing agency must commit to and
undertake plans to manage operations in the event of a disruption, including through the adoption
of a formal business continuity plan. 482 The commenter also argued that anything less risks
major repercussions and the loss of investor trust. In response, the Commission notes that Rule
17Ad-22(e)(17) addresses the commenter’s concerns by including requirements for policies and
procedures with respect to a business continuity plan.
c. Final Rule
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) with one modification: because the
text in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(ii) for “establishing and maintaining policies and procedures
reasonably designed” is duplicative of the requirement under Rule 17Ad-22(e) to have policies
and procedures reasonably designed to establish, maintain, implement, and enforce the
requirements thereunder, the Commission is removing the duplicative text. In addition, the
481

See id.

482

See CFA Institute at 11.

207

Commission notes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) includes similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(4),
and that, like Rule 17Ad-22(d)(4), Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) concerns operational risks that stem
from deficiencies in internal controls, human errors, and management failures. 483 The
Commission also notes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) includes requirements related to operational
risk management in addition to the requirements in Regulation SCI, previously discussed in Part
I.A.4. The Commission therefore notes that a covered clearing agency, in seeking to address the
requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17), generally should remain mindful of related requirements
under other Commission rules and regulation.
Further, because the Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to
address compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17), the Commission is providing the following
guidance that a covered clearing agency generally should consider in establishing and
maintaining policies and procedures that address operational risk:
•

whether it establishes a robust operational risk-management framework with appropriate
systems, policies, procedures, and controls to identify, monitor, and manage operational
risks;

•

whether its board of directors clearly define the roles and responsibilities for addressing
operational risk and whether it endorses the covered clearing agency’s operational riskmanagement framework;

•

whether it clearly defines operational reliability objectives and whether it has policies in
place that are designed to achieve its service-level objectives;

483

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29551; see also infra Part IV.C.17
(also discussing the similar provisions between Rules 17Ad-22(e)(17) and (d)(4)); Clearing
Agency Standards, supra note 5, at 66248 (discussing Rule 17Ad-22(d)(4)).

208

•

whether the covered clearing agency ensures that it has scalable capacity adequate to
handle increasing stress volumes and to achieve its service-level objectives;

•

whether it has comprehensive physical and information security policies that address all
potential vulnerabilities and threats;

•

whether it has a business continuity plan that addresses events posing a significant risk of
disrupting operations, including events that could cause a wide-scale or major disruption;
and

•

whether it identifies, monitors, and manages the risks that key participants, other covered
clearing agencies, and service and utility providers might pose to its operations.

With respect to “adequate, scalable capacity” under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(ii), the Commission
believes that a covered clearing agency generally should have operational systems that can be
extended or expanded based on its anticipated business needs. Further, the Commission believes
that, to help limit disruptions that may impede the proper functioning of a covered clearing
agency, covered clearing agencies generally should review their operations for potential
weaknesses and develop appropriate systems, controls, and procedures to address weaknesses the
rule seeks to mitigate.
18. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18): Access and Participation Requirements
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
establish objective, risk-based, and publicly disclosed criteria for participation, which permit fair
and open access by direct and, where relevant, indirect participants and other FMUs. Proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) also would require that a covered clearing agency establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require participants

209

to have sufficient financial resources and robust operational capacity to meet obligations arising
from participation in the clearing agency and to monitor compliance with participation
requirements on an ongoing basis. 484
The Commission received one comment regarding Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18). The
commenter expressed support for the fair and open participation requirements under the
proposed rule, the public disclosure of such participation criteria under the proposed rule, and the
proposed requirement that such criteria be risk-based. 485
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) as proposed. Moreover, because the
Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to address compliance with Rule
17Ad-22(e)(18), the Commission is providing the following guidance that a covered clearing
agency generally should consider in establishing and maintaining policies and procedures that
address access and participation requirements:
•

whether it allows for fair and open access to its services, including by direct and where
relevant, indirect participants and other covered clearing agencies, based on reasonable
risk-related participation requirements;

•

whether its participation requirements are justified in terms of the safety and efficiency of
the covered clearing agency and the markets it serves, are tailored to and commensurate
with its specific risks, and are publicly disclosed; and

•

whether it monitors compliance with its participation requirements on an ongoing basis
and clearly defines and publicly discloses procedures for facilitating the suspension and

484

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29551–52.

485

See CFA Institute at 11.

210

orderly exit of a participant that breaches, or no longer meets, the participation
requirements.
The Commission also notes that, in contrast to other requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e) where the
term “transparent” is used in the context of facilitating disclosure “where appropriate,” the
requirement here for policies and procedures reasonably designed to establish “publicly
disclosed” criteria for participation would necessarily require that the relevant policies and
procedures be reasonably designed to provide for disclosure of such criteria for participation.
The Commission also notes that membership standards at covered clearing agencies generally
should seek to limit the potential for member defaults and, as a result, losses to non-defaulting
members in the event of a member default. Using risk-based criteria helps to protect investors
by limiting the participants of a covered clearing agency to those for which the covered clearing
agency has assessed the likelihood of default.
19. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19): Tiered Participation Arrangements
a. Proposed Rule
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
identify, monitor, and manage the material risks to the covered clearing agency arising from
arrangements in which firms that are indirect participants in the covered clearing agency rely on
the services provided by direct participants in the covered clearing agency to access the covered
clearing agency’s payment, clearing, or settlement facilities (hereinafter “tiered participation
arrangements”). In addition, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) would require that a covered
clearing agency establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures

211

reasonably designed to regularly review the material risks to the covered clearing agency arising
from such tiered participation arrangements. 486
b. Comments Received and Commission Response
The Commission received several comments regarding tiered participation arrangements
under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19). One commenter believed that regular reviews of tiered participation
arrangements are an important part of a covered clearing agency’s ability to perform prompt and
accurate clearance and settlement, to protect investors, and to safeguard securities and funds. 487
However, some commenters focused on particular aspects of the proposal in seeking to have the
Commission consider a specific approach or issue. Comments directed to these particular
substantive aspects of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) are discussed below.
i. Need for Due Diligence of Indirect Participants
One commenter believed that the Commission did not provide sufficient guidance
regarding who would be indirect participants of a covered clearing agency and, as a result,
cannot ascertain whether it is correctly reading the proposed rule. 488 The commenter further
expressed the view that it is not appropriate for a covered clearing agency to perform due
diligence on the clients of its clearing members for the following reasons:
•

The covered clearing agency has no direct, contractual relationship to these clients;

•

Performing due diligence on what may be a very large number of clients could be very
burdensome for the covered clearing agency; and

486

487

See CFA Institute at 11–12.

488

See LCH at 5.

212

•

Clients may object to due diligence inquiries from a covered clearing agency and choose
to move their business to another CCP that is not required to perform such due
diligence. 489

Instead, the commenter expressed a view that a covered clearing agency can reasonably rely on
the due diligence that its clearing members perform on their clients and should not have to
perform its own due diligence on these indirect participants. 490
In response, the Commission first notes that the scope of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) does not
only contemplate clients of clearing members. Instead, the rule also contemplates situations
where other parties may enter into a contractual arrangement with a clearing member,
particularly arrangements that create credit exposures to the clearing member, such as where a
third party acts as guarantor to an obligation on behalf of the clearing member, may be indirect
participants in the covered clearing agency. The Commission therefore believes that the
alternative approach suggested by the commenter above does not entirely contemplate the scope
of indirect participants addressed by the Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19).
The Commission acknowledges that there are limits on the extent to which a covered
clearing agency can, in practice, observe or influence a direct participant’s commercial or
contractual relationships, and that these limits will, in turn, affect the appropriateness of a
covered clearing agency performing due diligence on its indirect participants. However, a
clearing agency will often have access to information, including through the due diligence that a
member performs on its clients as well as information on transactions undertaken on behalf of
indirect participants. A clearing agency can also set direct participation requirements that may
489

See id.

490

See id.

213

include criteria relating to how direct participants manage relationships with their customers inso-far as these criteria are relevant for the safe, efficient, and effective operation of the clearing
agency. Accordingly, a covered clearing agency generally should have the ability to identify the
types of risk that could arise from tiered participation and should monitor concentrations of such
risk. Further, the Commission notes that some direct and indirect participants of the covered
clearing agency will be registered with the Commission as, for example, a broker-dealer, and
therefore be subject to their own requirements for reporting and financial responsibility, 491 which
a covered clearing agency could use in developing policies and procedures for tiered
participation arrangements. In light of the availability of the tools described above, the
Commission does not believe that the commenter’s suggestion for a covered clearing agency to
rely on due diligence performed by its clearing members is an appropriate alternative for the
purposes of addressing the requirements a covered clearing agency must satisfy under Rule
17Ad-22(e)(19).
ii. Need to Obtain Information from Clearing Members
One commenter expressed concern that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) could be
interpreted as requiring a covered clearing agency to obtain information from its clearing
members identifying with specificity each of the customers attached to each cleared transaction

491

See, e.g., 17 CFR 240.15c3-1, 15.c3-3 (setting forth net capital and customer protection
requirements for broker-dealers); 17 CFR 240.17h-1T, 17h-2T (setting forth requirements that
certain broker-dealers maintain, preserve, and file a quarterly summary of certain information
regarding those affiliates, subsidiaries and holding companies whose business activities are
reasonably likely to have a material impact on their own financial and operating condition); 17
CFR 240.17a-3, 17a-4, 17a-5, 17a-11 (setting forth requirements for broker-dealers to maintain
books and records, file periodic reports including quarterly and annual financial statements, and
report to the Commission and the appropriate SRO regarding net capital, recordkeeping, and
other operational problems, within certain time periods).

214

and to routinely monitor customer-level risk with respect to each such customer. 492 The
commenter acknowledged that covered clearing agencies should have the ability to gather certain
information from its direct participants and that some circumstances may require clearing
agencies to monitor the systemic risk created by one or more significant indirect participants, but
the commenter believed it is inappropriate for a covered clearing agency to routinely police the
systemic risks created by each indirect participant. 493 In response, the Commission notes that
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) requires a covered clearing agency to have policies and procedures
governing risk management that considers a clearing member’s customer relationships, but it
does not require a covered clearing agency to actively risk manage those customer relationships
on behalf of each clearing member. Instead, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) requires policies and
procedures that identify, monitor, and manage the material risks to the covered clearing agency
arising from tiered participation arrangements. Such policies and procedures would require a
covered clearing agency to account for the range of risks stemming from each clearing member,
which necessarily includes risks resulting from the clearing member’s relationships with its
customers, as previously described above. To engage in effective risk management of a clearing
member, the covered clearing agency would need a complete picture of cleared transactions
attributed to each clearing member, but it may require less specific information from the clearing
member with respect to customers so long as the information it does receive provides the

492

See OCC at 15.

493

See id.

215

covered clearing agency with a comprehensive understanding of the material risks posed to the
covered clearing agency by each clearing member. 494
iii. Recommendation for a Risk-Based Approach
One commenter expressed the belief that covered clearing agencies should use a riskbased approach when developing policies and procedures to implement the requirement that a
covered clearing agency have policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify, monitor,
and manage the risks to the clearing agency arising from indirect participants. 495 The commenter
expressed the belief that a covered clearing agency should provide direct participants with
information relevant to their activities (both direct and indirect) that is available to the clearing
agency, thus enabling direct participants to use such information to evaluate and manage its
correspondent customer relationships. 496 The commenter also expressed a view that a covered
clearing agency should evaluate the risks presented to it by indirect relationships in the context
of a direct participant’s overall risk management policies and procedures. 497 The commenter
expressed the belief that such policies will need to take into account the level of information
available to the covered clearing agency and that there needs to be a distinction between the
supervisory oversight of the direct participant by its primary supervisor and the type of oversight
that a clearing agency can be expected to provide.

494

See supra note 491 (describing examples of such information that is available for certain
participants that are separately registered with the Commission)
495

See DTCC at 11.

496

See id.

497

See id.

216

The Commission agrees that such a risk-based approach could be one approach to
achieving compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19), but believes that each covered clearing agency
should determine the appropriate approach for determining compliance with Rule 17Ad22(e)(19) in light of the composition of its members and the products they clear, as well as its
risk management framework. Policies and procedures at a covered clearing agency for managing
risks from indirect participants will necessarily be constrained to some degree by the lack of a
direct contractual agreement between the covered clearing agency itself and the indirect
participant. The Commission notes, however, that evaluating and managing the risk from direct
participants, pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19), would require policies and procedures consistent
with the Commission’s statements in Parts II.C.19.b.i and ii above. As noted there, the
Commission acknowledges that direct and indirect participants in a covered clearing agency may
be regulated entities themselves subject to reporting and other requirements that may help
facilitate the covered clearing agency’s management of risk from tiered participation
arrangements. 498
c. Final Rule
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) as proposed. Because the
Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to address compliance with Rule
17Ad-22(e)(19), the Commission is providing the following guidance that a covered clearing
agency generally should consider in establishing and maintaining policies and procedures that
address tiered participation arrangements:
•

whether a covered clearing agency ensures that its rules, procedures, and agreements
allow it to gather sufficient information about indirect participation to identify, monitor,

498

See supra notes 491, 494, and accompanying text.

217

and manage any material risks to the covered clearing agency arising from such tiered
participation arrangements;
•

whether it identifies material dependencies between direct and indirect participants that
might affect the covered clearing agency;

•

whether it identifies indirect participants responsible for a significant proportion of
transactions processed by the covered clearing agency and indirect participants whose
transaction volumes or values are large relative to the capacity of the direct participants
through which they access the covered clearing agency to manage the risks arising from
these transactions; and

•

whether it regularly reviews risks arising from tiered participation arrangements and
takes mitigation action when appropriate.

In addition to the guidance above, the Commission notes that, when addressing its compliance
with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19), a covered clearing agency could consider whether its rules, policies,
procedures, and agreements with direct participants allow it to gather basic information about
indirect participants to identify, monitor, and manage any material risks to the covered clearing
agency arising from such tiered participation arrangements. This information should help enable
the covered clearing agency to identify (i) the proportion of activity that direct participants
conduct on behalf of indirect participants, (ii) direct participants that act on behalf of a material
number of indirect participants, (iii) indirect participants with significant volumes or values of
transactions in the system, and (iv) indirect participants whose transaction volumes or values are
large relative to those of the direct participants through which they access the covered clearing
agency. In this vein, a covered clearing agency could consider an indirect participant’s status as
a designated market maker or supplemental liquidity provider in identifying material risks to the

218

covered clearing agency. A covered clearing agency could also consider different trading
strategies or changes in trading strategies used by indirect participants in identifying, monitoring,
and managing material risks to the covered clearing agency.
The Commission also notes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) is intended to promote the ongoing
management of risks associated with tiered participation arrangements stemming from the
dependencies and risk exposures that such arrangements can create. However, because proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) only addresses the situation where indirect participants in the covered
clearing agency rely on direct participants, the Commission notes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19)
would not apply in the circumstance where a covered clearing agency providing CSD services
has members that are broker-dealers maintaining accounts for retail customers.
20. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20): Links
a. Proposed Rule
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
identify, monitor, and manage risks related to any link with one or more other clearing agencies,
FMUs, or trading markets. 499 In proposing the rule, the Commission proposed to define “link” in
Rule 17Ad-22(a)(10) to mean any set of contractual and operational arrangements between a
covered clearing agency and one or more other clearing agencies, FMUs, or trading venues that
connect them directly or indirectly for the purposes of participating in settlement, cross

499

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29553.

219

margining, expanding its services to additional instruments and participants, or for any other
purposes material to their business. 500
b. Comments Received and Commission Response
The Commission received no comments regarding the substance of the proposed rule.
One comment requested that the Commission phase-in implementation of Rule 17Ad22(e)(20), 501 and that comment is addressed in Part II.G below.
c. Final Rule
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) as proposed. 502 The Commission is
adopting the definition of “link” with one modification and moving it to Rule 17Ad-22(a)(8), as
previously discussed. 503 Specifically, in the definition of “link,” the Commission is replacing the
word “venues” with “markets” to improve consistency with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20). 504
Further, because the Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to
address compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20), the Commission is providing the following
guidance that a covered clearing agency generally should consider in establishing and
maintaining policies and procedures that address links:

500

See id. at 29554. The Commission received no comments regarding the definition of
“link” and is adopting it with one modification, as discussed in Part II.C.20.c. Because of other
modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(a), the definition of “link” is also being moved to Rule 17Ad22(a)(8). See infra Part VI.

220

•

whether it identifies, monitors, and manages all potential sources of risk arising from the
link arrangement, before entering into a link arrangement and on an ongoing basis once
the link is established;

•

whether a link has a well-founded legal basis, in all relevant jurisdictions, that support its
design and provides adequate protection to the covered clearing agencies involved in the
link;

•

whether linked CSDs measure, monitor, and manage the credit and liquidity risk arising
from each other;

•

whether provisional transfers of securities between linked CSDs are prohibited or, at a
minimum, the retransfer of provisionally transferred securities are prohibited prior to the
transfer becoming final.

•

whether an investor CSD can only establish a link with an issuer CSD if the arrangement
provides a high level of protection for the rights of the investor CSD’s participants;

•

whether an investor CSD that uses an intermediary to operate a link with an issuer CSD
measures, monitors, and manages the additional risks arising from the use of the
intermediary.

•

before entering into a link with a CCP, whether it identifies and manages the potential
spill-over effects from the default of the linked CCP; and

•

when in a CCP link arrangement, whether it is able to cover, at least on a daily basis, its
current and potential future exposures to the linked CCP and its participants, if any, fully
with a high degree of confidence without reducing the covered clearing agency’s ability
to fulfill its obligations to its own participants at any time.

221

In addition, the Commission reiterates that the requirements for policies and procedures for
linkages must be addressed by each covered clearing agency at the level of the covered clearing
agency. 505 Therefore, each covered clearing agency under Rule 17Ad-22(e) would itself need to
adopt or ratify policies and procedures for linkages with respect to its own business, even if it is
a member of a group or under a holding company that has group-level policies and procedures.
21. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21): Efficiency and Effectiveness
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that it is efficient and effective in meeting the requirements of its participants and the markets it
serves. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21)(i) through (iv) would require a covered clearing agency’s
management to regularly review the efficiency and effectiveness of its (i) clearing and settlement
arrangements; (ii) operating structure, including risk management policies, procedures, and
systems; (iii) scope of products cleared, settled, or recorded; and (iv) use of technology and
communication procedures. 506
The Commission received one comment in support of the proposed approach. The
commenter expressed support for the requirement that a covered clearing agency review its
efficiency and effectiveness in meeting the requirements of its participants and the markets it
serves and for the specific areas to be reviewed as set forth in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21). 507
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) with one modification: the
Commission is removing reference to “recorded” products under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21)(iii)
505

See supra Part II.B.3.c.

506

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29554.

507

See CFA Institute at 12.

222

because recording products is not a function of covered clearing agencies. In addition, because
the Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to address compliance with Rule
17Ad-22(e)(21), the Commission is providing the following guidance that a covered clearing
agency generally should consider in establishing and maintaining policies and procedures that
address efficiency and effectiveness:
•

whether its design meets the needs of its participants and the markets it serves,
particularly with regard to choice of a clearance and settlement arrangement, operating
structure, scope of products cleared, settled, or recorded, and use of technology and
procedures;

•

whether it clearly defines goals and objectives that are measurable and achievable, such
as in the areas of minimum service levels, risk-management expectations, and business
priorities; and

•

whether it establishes mechanisms for the regular review of its efficiency and
effectiveness.
22. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22): Communication Procedures and Standards
a. Proposed Rule
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,

implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that it uses, or at a minimum accommodates, relevant internationally accepted communication
procedures and standards in order to facilitate efficient payment, clearing, and settlement.
b. Comments Received and Commission Response
Two commenters expressed views regarding Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22). The first commenter
supported the Commission’s proposed rules requiring the use of internationally accepted

223

communication procedures and standards. The commenter expressed the belief that such a
requirement will result in more effective communication with direct and indirect participants and
will result in a more prompt and accurate process. 508
The second commenter noted that users of its systems that process transactions only in a
particular market typically rely on long-standing, highly automated communications methods
and messaging formats that are viewed as industry-standard, regardless of international
standards. The commenter urged that these users not be required to retool their communication
systems in such a market to comply with international communication standards and that such a
requirement may impose substantial costs devoid of any material benefits. The commenter noted
that the proposed rule permits a covered clearing agency to accommodate international standards
as an equally appropriate means of satisfying the requirement as is the exclusive use of a
standard (e.g., a clearing agency providing such an accommodation can permit users who wish to
use international standards exclusively to do so, without forcing those users who do not wish
(and have no need to) use the international standards to convert to them). Additionally, the
commenter read the proposed provision as intending to provide sufficient flexibility to enable a
covered clearing agency, when evaluating systems upgrades or new services, to take into account
several factors to select the protocol that it deems most appropriate for the circumstances. 509
In response to the second commenter, the Commission notes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22)
requires policies and procedures that at a minimum accommodate international standards. A
covered clearing agency that does not rely on existing international standards as part of its own
communication protocols could comply with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) by having policies and
508

See CFA Institute at 12.

509

See DTCC at 11-12.

224

procedures that require its systems to be able to receive communications from and transmit
communications to a system that uses the international standards. However, the Commission
also believes that accommodating international standards does not require implementing
international standards as the only or primary communication protocol, particularly if other
automated messaging formats exist that are widely used and considered industry standard in the
United States.
c. Final Rule
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) as proposed. 510 The Commission
notes that the ability of participants to communicate with a covered clearing agency in a timely,
reliable, and accurate manner is important to achieving prompt and accurate clearance and
settlement.
23. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23): Disclosure of Rules, Key Procedures, and Market
Data
a. Proposed Rule
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain clear and comprehensive rules and procedures that provide for the specific disclosures
enumerated in the rule, as discussed below. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(i)-(iii) would require
such policies and procedures to specifically require a covered clearing agency to (i) publicly
disclose all relevant rules and material procedures, including key aspects of its default rules and
procedures; (ii) provide sufficient information to enable participants to identify and evaluate the
510

Relevant internationally accepted communication procedures and standards could include
messaging standards such as SWIFT, FIX, and FpML.

225

risks, fees, and other material costs they incur by participating in the covered clearing agency;
and (iii) publicly disclose relevant basic data on transaction volume and values.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain clear and comprehensive rules and procedures that provide for a comprehensive public
disclosure of its material rules, policies, and procedures regarding governance arrangements and
legal, financial, and operational risk management, accurate in all material respects at the time of
publication, including (i) a general background of the covered clearing agency, including its
function and the market it serves, basic data and performance statistics on its services and
operations, such as basic volume and value statistics by product type, average aggregate intraday
exposures to its participants, and statistics on the covered clearing agency’s operational
reliability, and a description of its general organization, legal and regulatory framework, and
system design and operations; (ii) a standard-by-standard summary narrative for each applicable
standard set forth in proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1) through (22) with sufficient detail and
context to enable the reader to understand its approach to controlling the risks and addressing the
requirements in each standard; (iii) a summary of material changes since the last update of the
disclosure; and (iv) an executive summary of the key points regarding each. 511 Proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(23)(v) would also require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure the
comprehensive public disclosure required under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv) is updated
not less than every two years, or more frequently following changes to its system or the

511

See id. at 29556.

226

environment in which it operates to the extent necessary, to ensure statements previously
provided remain accurate in all material respects. 512
b. Comments Received and Commission Response
One commenter expressed support for the Commission’s proposed requirements
regarding the disclosures set forth in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23). The commenter expressed
the belief that such disclosures are necessary to enhance transparency and allow investors and
other participants to obtain the information necessary to evaluate covered clearing agencies and
also believes that such an approach may add to market discipline. 513 A second commenter
expressed support for strong and effective transparency requirements for covered clearing
agencies. 514 However, a number of commenters requested that the Commission consider
amending the rule to incorporate more granular or prescriptive guidance and requirements, with a
particular focus on achieving consistency with international standards and enhanced disclosures
regarding emergency actions by covered clearing agencies. The Commission discusses these
particular comments below.
i. Comprehensive Public Disclosure
One commenter read the leading language in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv) to imply
a requirement to create a comprehensive document that should address how the clearing
agency’s governance arrangements, legal structure, approach to risk management, and financial
arrangements operate, as opposed to implying a separate obligation to publicly disclose all such
policies and procedures, irrespective of whether they relate to internal operational policies or are
512

See id. at 29557.

513

See CFA Institute at 13.

514

See The Clearing House at 15.

227

otherwise comprehended within the requirements of 17Ad-22(e)(23)(i). 515 The Commission
believes that the commenter’s interpretation of the leading language in proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(23)(iv) is consistent with the requirements of the rule.
In the CCA Standards proposing release, the Commission made several statements
regarding the requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23):
•

With respect to the basic data and performance statistics envisioned by the rule, the
Commission identified, as relevant to the requirement, statistics on the covered
clearing agency’s operational reliability so that the relevant stakeholders and the
general public have data regarding, for example, performance targets for systems and
the actual performance thereof over specified periods, as well as targets for recovery.

•

With respect to the standard-by-standard summary narrative, the Commission sought
to elicit a summary discussion of the covered clearing agency’s implementation of
policies and procedures that would need to be established, implemented, maintained
and enforced by a covered clearing agency in response to proposed Rules 17Ad22(e)(1) through (22).

•

With respect to material changes to the disclosure, the Commission stated that it
would expect a covered clearing agency to consider its particular circumstances, such
as, for example, changes in the scope of services provided by the covered clearing
agency, in satisfying this requirement. 516

The Commission further notes that the comprehensive public disclosure is intended to elicit all
material information that would address compliance with each of the requirements in Rule 17Ad515

See DTCC at 13.

516

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29557.

228

22(e), along with information such as its function and the markets it serves and basic data and
performance statistics. Moreover, in proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23), the Commission also
stated that two purposes of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) were to (i) provide participants with the
information necessary to, at a minimum, identify and evaluate the risks and costs associated with
the use of a covered clearing agency, thereby promoting transparency and enhancing competition
and market discipline, and (ii) provide other stakeholders, including regulators and the public,
with information that facilitates informed oversight and decision-making regarding each covered
clearing agency.
The Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv) so that the language more closely
tracks the categories of requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e) and the statements immediately above.
The purpose of this modification is to make clear that the comprehensive public disclosure is
intended to describe the material rules, policies and procedures of the covered clearing agency
related to compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e), rather than require a complete disclosure of all
rules, policies, and procedures. As adopted, the leading language of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv)
will require policies and procedures providing for a comprehensive public disclosure that
describes the covered clearing agency’s material rules, policies, and procedures regarding its
legal, governance, risk management, and operating framework, accurate in all material respects
at the time of publication.
ii. Consistency with International Standards
One commenter recommended that the Commission provide guidance that it will
interpret and administer Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) as being consistent with PFMI disclosure
framework to ensure that clearing participants have sufficient information to conduct diligence
and assess the risks of exposure to a covered clearing agency and to maintain consistency with

229

evolving international standards. 517 In response, and as previously noted, the Commission
intends to interpret and administer Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) consistent with Section 17A of the
Exchange Act and, to the extent consistent with Section 17A, with relevant international
standards such as the PFMI and the PFMI disclosure framework. 518 Additionally, the
Commission notes that a covered clearing agency could consider the PFMI quantitative
disclosures to develop its policies and procedures in compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23). 519
The Commission believes that the PFMI, the PFMI disclosure framework, and the PFMI
quantitative disclosures can be useful tools to help a covered clearing agency consider how to
disclose information to its participants, other relevant stakeholders, or the public. However, the
Commission also notes that publishing the PFMI disclosure framework or the PFMI quantitative
disclosures does not, in and of itself, constitute compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23). 520 As
previously discussed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) requires that a covered clearing agency (i) publicly
disclose all relevant rules and material procedures, including key aspects of its default rules and
procedures; (ii) provide sufficient information to enable participants to identify and evaluate the
risks, fees, and other material costs they incur by participating in the covered clearing agency;
and (iii) publicly disclose relevant basic data on transaction volume and values. It also requires,
as discussed in Part II.C.23.b.i, a comprehensive public disclosure consistent with Rule 17Ad22(e)(23)(iv). The Commission believes that covered clearing agencies may use a number of

framework).

documents, and the Commission does not review, opine on, or approve them.

230

different approaches to make disclosures under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23), and the Commission notes
that policies and procedures for such disclosures must be in compliance with Rule 17Ad22(e)(23).
iii. Disclosures Regarding Emergency Actions
One commenter stated that, when taking emergency actions, CCPs must consider the
interests of members and market stability in addition to those of CCP owners. 521 The commenter
identified the following concerns:
•

Changes to CCP rules and procedures and other actions taken during emergencies can
affect the economic position of members, imposing unexpected losses and liquidity
demands, and can thus have spillover effects in the broader market. 522

•

Unchecked and unbounded discretion could permit a CCP to alter the fundamental
economic relationship between it and its members without notice or a chance for
members to evaluate the consequences of such changes. 523

In response, the Commission notes that the above comments are most directly relevant to the
Commission’s discussion of crisis and emergency decision-making with respect to Rule 17Ad22(e)(2). The Commission has previously addressed comments regarding crisis or emergency
decision-making in Part II.C.2.b.v.

Procedures

One commenter recommended that the Commission make some clarifications to the
requirement in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(ii) that a covered clearing agency provide
sufficient detail to enable participants to identify and evaluate the risks they incur by
participating in the covered clearing agency. Specifically, the commenter recommended that the
Commission require the covered clearing agency to disclose (i) to its participants the policies and
procedures established by the covered clearing agency pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(13), and (ii) to its participants and their customers, the financial risks to which they would
be subject in a scenario in which the covered clearing agency’s credit losses upon the default of
one or more participants exceed the resources designated to absorb such losses. 524 As discussed
above in connection with the requirements for the comprehensive public disclosure, the two
purposes of proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) were to (i) provide participants with the information
necessary to, at a minimum, identify and evaluate the risks and costs associated with the use of a
covered clearing agency, and (ii) provide other stakeholders, including regulators and the public,
with information that facilitates informed oversight and decision-making regarding each covered
clearing agency. 525 Pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv), the comprehensive public disclosure is
intended to provide participants with the information necessary to, at a minimum, identify and
evaluate the risks and costs associated with the use of a covered clearing agency. In addition, a
covered clearing agency’s recovery and wind-down plans consistent with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)
would also provide further insight into the financial risks to which participants and their
customers may be subject in a scenario in which the covered clearing agency’s credit losses

524

525

See supra Part II.C.23.b.i.

232

exceed the resources designated to absorb such losses. Accordingly, the Commission believes
that the required public disclosure will encompass the information that the commenter seeks.
The same commenter also recommended that the Commission clarify that a covered
clearing agency may not, pursuant to emergency authority or otherwise, modify its rules,
policies, or procedures in a manner that would materially increase a non-defaulting participant’s
exposure to loss or the extent of the covered clearing agency’s recourse to a non-defaulting
participant’s assets, or redefine the economic terms of outstanding cleared contracts, without a
reasonable prior notice and transition period prior to effectiveness. 526 The commenter further
stated that a reasonable prior notice period for such a modification would be one that is sufficient
to enable a non-defaulting participant to complete the process of withdrawal from participant
status, in accordance with the rules of the covered clearing agency, under reasonable
assumptions that take into account the demonstrated liquidity of the relevant product or asset
type. 527 In addition, the commenter stated that any such modification that takes place following
the occurrence of a default or series of defaults involving one or more participants and prior to
expiration of the covered clearing agency’s “cooling-off period” should not take effect until after
the expiration of that period. 528 For the commenter’s purposes, the term “cooling-off period”
referred to the period following the default of one or more participants during which losses
accrued by the covered clearing agency may be satisfied by recourse to the clearing or guaranty
fund contributions of non-defaulting participants, notwithstanding the intervening withdrawal

526

See The Clearing House at 7.

527

See id. at 7 n.16.

528

See id.

233

from participant status of one or more such participants. 529 The commenter’s recommendations
contemplated that cooling-off periods will continue to be specified in the rules of a covered
clearing agency, subject to Commission review. According to the commenter, although
appropriate cooling-off periods may vary by product or asset type, the commenter believed that
the Commission should, in reviewing a covered clearing agency’s rules, ensure that its coolingoff period(s) are of sufficient duration following a participant default (or the last in a series of
substantially contemporaneous participant defaults) to allow the relevant market to return to
stability under reasonable assumptions. 530 In response, the Commission notes that the above
comments are beyond the scope of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23), which pertains to disclosures, but
instead are relevant to crisis and emergency decision-making, which are discussed above in Part
II.C.2.b.v.
v. Additional Disclosures
One commenter believed that, to enhance participants’ ability to evaluate their risks, the
Commission should require a covered clearing agency to provide their participants with
additional, more specific disclosures regarding its default rules and procedures, custody and
collateral investment activities, methodologies for determining initial margin requirements and
clearing or guaranty fund contributions, stress testing methodologies, and the covered clearing
agency’s treatment of participant initial margin and clearing or guaranty fund contributions. 531

529

See id.

530

See id.

531

See The Clearing House at 3, 15. The commenter further stated that, based on current
disclosure practices, members are unable to effectively measure or manage their risk exposure to
CCPs, and that disclosure to a CCP’s risk committee is generally insufficient due to
confidentiality restrictions, which prevents the risk committee from being able to share relevant
234

The Commission notes that each of these topic areas are addressed by requirements under Rule
17Ad-22(e), 532 and therefore these topic areas are also the types of material information that
would constitute elements of the comprehensive public disclosure required under Rule 17Ad22(e)(23)(iv). 533
To facilitate sufficient disclosure, the commenter recommended that the Commission
adopt the recommendations developed by the FRB of New York’s Payments Risk Committee for
participant due diligence of CCPs in these and other areas. 534 The commenter stated that
obtaining information in these areas is necessary for participants to adequately identify and
evaluate the risks they incur by participating in a CCP. Like the PFMI disclosure framework and
the PFMI quantitative disclosures, the framework set forth by the FRB Payments Risk
Committee may be another useful tool to help a covered clearing agency consider how best to
disclose information to its participants, other relevant stakeholders, or the public, but, as noted
above, should not be viewed as a substitute for compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) and the
requirements of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. The Commission further notes that the
disclosure required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) marks a significant increase in the level and detail of
information with their employer clearing member (and, further, not all clearing members even
have employees on the CCP’s risk committee). See id., annex at 26, 27.
532

See supra Parts II.C.4 (discussing requirements for guaranty fund contributions,
allocation of losses pursuant to the default waterfall, and stress testing for credit risk under Rule
17Ad-22(e)(4)), II.C.5 (discussing requirements for collateral under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5)), II.C.6
(discussing requirements for margin under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)), II.C.7 (discussing requirements
for stress testing for liquidity risk under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)), II.C.13 (discussing requirements
for participant-default rules and procedures under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)), and II.C.16 (discussing
requirements for custody and investment policies under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16)).

235

disclosure that a covered clearing agency will be required to provide to its participants and the
public, and that such disclosure will also encompass much of the information covered in the
framework established by the FRB Payments Risk Committee. Therefore, the Commission
declines to further modify Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23).
The commenter further stated that because a CCP’s internal models are not usually
disclosed at a sufficient level of detail, participants are often unable to predict initial margin
requirements, clearing or guaranty fund contributions, or possible loss allocations accurately and,
as a result, cannot anticipate exposures or hedge resulting risks. 535 The commenter also stated
that participants typically do not have sufficient insight into the stress framework and stress
scenarios that are intended to ensure sufficiency of total financial resources and as such are
unable to determine the CCP’s ability to withstand multiple participants’ failures or market
stress. 536 As noted above, the disclosure required by policies and procedures under Rule 17Ad22(e)(23) marks a significant increase in the level and detail of disclosure that a covered clearing
agency will be required to provide to its participants and the public and addresses in significant
portion the commenter’s concerns.
In addition, to promote participants’ ability to identify and evaluate their risks, the
commenter recommended that the Commission clarify that a covered clearing agency must
provide to its participants each fiscal quarter, or at any time upon request, the following
minimum information:

535

See The Clearing House at 15.

536

See id.

236

•

The methodologies for determining initial margin requirements and clearing or guaranty
fund contributions, at a level of detail adequate to enable participants to replicate the
covered clearing agency’s calculations; 537

•

The methodologies for stress testing the adequacy of the clearing or guaranty fund,
including the assumptions and scenarios that formed the basis of the stress test and the
results of the stress test, which shall include but not be limited to an analysis of the
adequacy of the defaulting participant’s resources available to cover losses arising from
the liquidation, transfer or termination of the positions in its portfolio; 538 and

•

The covered clearing agency’s treatment and segregation of participant initial margin and
clearing or guaranty fund contributions. 539

In suggesting that such information be required to be disclosed, the commenter suggested that
members of CCPs should also be able to accurately predict the fees, margin requirements and
guaranty fund contribution requirements associated with participation in the CCP and changes to
the member’s portfolio or clearing activity.
Where the above disclosure is not possible, the commenter stated that the Commission
should instead require a covered clearing agency to develop computational solutions that provide

537

See The Clearing House at 16.

538

See id. The commenter stated that stress frameworks mandated by the Commission
should form the baseline set of assumptions/scenarios for a covered clearing agency, and those
frameworks should be based on sufficiently severe stressed macroeconomic conditions to
provide a consistent initial baseline from which covered clearing agencies can begin to estimate
the extent of their need for loss-absorbing resources. These baseline assumptions/scenarios
should be bolstered by specific scenarios unique to the particular asset class and should include
idiosyncratic stresses on basis and higher order risk exposures embedded in the covered clearing
agency’s portfolio. See id. at 16 n.44.
539

See The Clearing House at 16.

237

its participants with the ability to determine the costs, initial margin, clearing or guaranty fund
contributions, clearing or guaranty fund performance and loss allocations associated with
changes to each respective participant’s portfolio or hypothetical portfolio, participant defaults
and other relevant information. 540 Mandating disclosure of this frequency and granularity would
be inconsistent with the principles-based approach the Commission is taking in Rule 17Ad-22(e),
and Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) addresses in significant portion the commenter’s concerns.
The commenter also stated that CCPs should be required to provide advance notice to
members of any proposed changes to policies, procedures, models, or other elements of the
CCPs’ operations that could have a material adverse economic effect on members. According to
the commenter, such advance notice is necessary to protect members’ ability to manage their risk
by withdrawal from the CCP if necessary, and further CCPs should seek member input on any
such changes through a formal consultation process to the extent possible. 541 The Commission
believes that the rule filing process under Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 19b-4
thereunder, as well as the process for advance notices under Section 806(e) of the Clearing
Supervision Act, address this comment, including by providing the opportunity for member input
upon the proposed rule change.
c. Final Rule
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) with modifications. First, the
Commission is striking the language “maintain clear and comprehensive rules and procedures”
under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) because Rule 17Ad-22(e) already requires that a covered clearing
agency have written policies and procedures reasonably designed to establish, implement,
540

See The Clearing House at 16.

541

See id.

238

maintain and enforce the requirements thereunder. Consistent with this change, the Commission
is also striking “providing” from Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv). Second, the Commission is
modifying paragraph (iv) as described in Part II.C.23.b.i. Third, the Commission is also
modifying paragraph (iv)(D) to correct technical errors in the proposed rule text so that it refers
to the standards set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) through (23) (rather than (e)(1) through (22)). The
Commission believes that providing a summary narrative for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) is appropriate
because Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) requires policies and procedures to (i) publicly disclose all relevant
rules and material procedures, including key aspects of its default rules and procedures; (ii)
provide sufficient information to enable participants to identify and evaluate the risks, fees, and
other material costs they incur by participating in the covered clearing agency; and (iii) publicly
disclose relevant basic data on transaction volume and values, in addition to requiring the
standard-by-standard summary narrative required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv)(D). A summary
narrative for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) would allow for a better understanding of a covered clearing
agency’s policies and procedures for compliance with this rule.
Further, because the Commission recognizes that there may be a number of ways to
address compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23), the Commission is providing the following
guidance that a covered clearing agency generally should consider in establishing and
maintaining policies and procedures that address disclosure of rules, key procedures, and market
data:
•

whether it adopts clear and comprehensive rules and procedures that are fully disclosed to
participants;

239

•

whether it discloses clear descriptions of the system’s design and operations, as well as
its and participants’ rights and obligations, so that participants can assess the risks they
would incur by participating in the covered clearing agency;

•

whether it provides all necessary and appropriate documentation and training to facilitate
participants’ understanding of the covered clearing agency’s rules and procedures and the
risks they face from participating in the covered clearing agency;

•

whether it publicly discloses its fees at the level of individual service it offers as well as
its policies on any available discounts; and

•

whether it completes regularly and discloses publicly responses to the PFMI disclosure
framework.

In addition, the Commission notes that, as with public disclosures contemplated in conjunction
with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23), a covered clearing agency could comply with the proposed
requirement by posting the relevant documentation to its website.
D. Rule 17Ab2-2
1. Proposed Rule
The Commission proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 to establish procedures for the Commission to
make determinations affecting covered clearing agencies. Under the proposed rule, the
Commission would make determinations in three cases, as discussed below. In each case, under
proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(d), the Commission would publish notice of its intention to consider
such determinations, together with a brief statement of the grounds under consideration, and
provide at least a 30-day public comment period prior to any determination. The Commission
may provide the clearing agency subject to the proposed determination opportunity for hearing
regarding the proposed determination. Under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(e), notice of

240

determinations in each case would be given by prompt publication thereof, together with a
statement of written reasons supporting the determination. In proposing Rule 17Ab2-2, the
Commission noted that determinations could be made as part of the registration process upon
receiving an application for registration as a clearing agency or at some point after registration, if
the Commission determines that a clearing agency does not meet the definition of a covered
clearing agency upon registration but does so at a later date, as either market conditions or the
characteristics of the clearing agency itself change. 542
As proposed, Rule 17Ab2-2 provides the Commission with procedures for making
determinations in the following three cases:
•

Pursuant to Rule 17Ab2-2(a), the Commission may, if it deems appropriate, upon
application by any registered clearing agency or member thereof or on its own
initiative, determine whether a registered clearing agency should be considered a
covered clearing agency. In determining whether a registered clearing agency should
be considered a covered clearing agency, the Commission may consider
characteristics such as the clearing of financial instruments that are characterized by
discrete jump-to-default price changes or that are highly correlated with potential
participant defaults or other such factors as it deems appropriate in the
circumstances. 543

•

Pursuant to Rule 17Ab2-2(b), the Commission may, if it deems appropriate, upon
application by any clearing agency or member thereof, or on its own initiative,
determine whether a covered clearing agency meets the definition of “systemically

542

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29557–58.

543

See id. at 29558.

241

important in multiple jurisdictions.” In determining whether a covered clearing
agency is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions, the Commission may
consider (i) whether the covered clearing agency is a designated clearing agency; (ii)
whether the clearing agency has been determined to be systemically important by one
or more jurisdictions other than the United States through a process that includes
consideration of whether the foreseeable effects of a failure or disruption of the
designated clearing agency could threaten the stability of each relevant jurisdiction’s
financial system; 544 or (iii) such other factors as the Commission may deem
appropriate in the circumstances. The Commission also noted that analysis of other
factors could include whether foreign regulatory authorities have designated the
covered clearing agency as systemically important and whether any findings were
made in anticipation of that designation. 545
•

Pursuant to Rule 17Ab2-2(c), the Commission may, if it deems appropriate,
determine whether any of the activities of a clearing agency providing CCP services,
in addition to clearing agencies registered with the Commission for the purpose of
clearing security-based swaps, have a more complex risk profile. In determining
whether a clearing agency’s activity has a more complex risk profile, the Commission
may consider (i) characteristics such as the clearing of financial instruments that are

544

The Commission notes that this provision of proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(b) parallels the
definition of systemic importance in Section 803(9) of the Clearing Supervision Act, which
states that systemic importance means a situation where the failure of or a disruption to the
functioning of an FMU could create, or increase, the risk of significant liquidity or credit
problems spreading among financial institutions or markets and thereby threaten the stability of
the financial system of the United States. See 12 U.S.C. 5462(9).

545

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29558.

242

characterized by discrete jump-to-default price changes or that are highly correlated
with potential participant defaults; or (ii) such other characteristics as it deems
appropriate in the circumstances. 546
2. Comments Received and Commission Response
The Commission received two comments that generally supported the Commission’s
approach in Rule 17Ab2-2 547 However, a number of commenters also raised concerns about
particular procedural and substantive aspects of the Rule 17Ab2-2, and the Commission
discusses each of these in turn below.
a. Determinations Regarding “Covered Clearing Agency” Status
Generally
One commenter argued that Rule 17Ab2-2 lacks clear standards for determining when
and according to which standards a registered clearing agency would be found to be a covered
clearing agency, and further stated that such determinations are based upon factors that may be
entirely defined by the Commission during the determinations process itself. 548 In response to
this comment, and in light of the Commission’s separate proposal to amend the definition of
“covered clearing agency,” 549 the Commission has determined not to adopt Rule 17Ab2-2(a).
Because the Commission had determined not to adopt Rule 17Ab2-2(a), the subsequent
paragraphs in Rule 17Ab2-2 will be renumbered accordingly.

546

See CME at 3.

549

See CCA Definition proposing release, supra note 82, at 25–26.

243

b. Determinations Regarding “Covered Clearing Agency” Status for
Dually Registered Entities
In another commenter’s view, any decision to apply the enhanced standards for covered
clearing agencies should take into account whether, and the extent to which, the clearing agency
is already subject to similar or comparable standards under other regulation. 550 The commenter
noted that the proposed rules take this approach with respect to dually registered SIDCOs for
which the CFTC is the supervisory agency under the Clearing Supervision Act and believed a
similar exclusion would be appropriate for clearing agencies subject to other regulatory
frameworks. 551 The commenter cited as examples regulation by the Bank of England under
existing U.K. legislation and, for those clearing agencies that have been granted authorization as
a CCP under EMIR, the regulations under EMIR. 552
Because the Commission has determined not to adopt Rule 17Ab2-2(a), the commenter’s
concerns regarding determinations under Rule 17Ab2-2(a) for dually registered clearing agencies
have been addressed.
c. Determinations Regarding “Complex Risk Profile”
One commenter expressed concern about the proposed criteria for determining whether a
clearing agency is involved in activities with a more complex risk profile under proposed Rule
17Ab2-2(c), which triggers enhanced requirements for policies and procedures related to credit
and liquidity risk management. 553 The commenter believed that it is necessary to consider
550

See ICEEU at 4–5.

551

See id. at 5.

552

See id.

553

See OCC at 7.

244

additional factors, including the proportion of the covered clearing agency’s clearing activities
involving higher risk products as well as the manner in which it manages those risks. In the
absence of considering such additional factors, the commenter expressed concern that a trivial
amount of clearing of credit default options, in comparison to more standardized options, could
trigger a cover two requirement, when a clearing agency may have other means to address the
added risk, such as through an enhanced margin system. 554 The commenter suggested that the
Commission clarify that it is not its intention to interpret the rules in such a manner. 555 A second
commenter believed that the proposed wording of paragraphs (1) and (2) under proposed Rule
17Ab2-2(c) is vague. 556 The commenter believed it is unclear whether “characteristics such as
the clearing of financial instruments that are characterized by discrete jump-to-default price
changes or that are highly correlated with potential participant defaults” and “such other
characteristics as it deems appropriate in the circumstances” are independent analyses by which a
clearing agency may be judged or whether they should be considered jointly.
In response to these comments, the Commission is modifying the proposed criteria to be
considered in determining whether any of the activities of a clearing agency providing CCP
services have a more complex risk profile in Rule 17Ab2-2 to remove the reference to “[s]uch
other characteristics as it may deem appropriate in the circumstances, as factors supporting a
finding of a more complex risk profile.” 557 Further, the Commission notes that it could, as part
554

See id.

555

See id. at 8.

556

See Joyce.

557

In addition, as noted in Part II.D.2.a, the Commission has determined not to adopt
proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a). The Commission is therefore renumbering Rule 17Ab2-2 so that
proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(c) is being moved to Rule 17Ab2-2(b). See infra Part VI.

245

of its analysis under the rule, also consider the extent to which a clearing agency clears financial
instruments that are characterized by discrete jump-to-default price changes or that are highly
correlated with potential participant defaults. The Commission believes that this approach
mitigates the concern raised by the commenter that a clearing agency clearing only a trivial
amount of credit default options could be subject to the “cover two” requirement in Rule 17Ad22(e)(4).
In addition, in light of the concerns regarding the scope of such other characteristics as
the Commission may deem appropriate in the circumstances, the Commission is also removing
the similar criteria—“such other factors as it may deem appropriate in the circumstances”—from
proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(b). 558
d. Sufficiency of Procedures Generally
One commenter stated that proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 does not provide the subjected
clearing agency with an opportunity for a hearing. 559 The commenter further stated that it is not
apparent under the proposed framework that a registered clearing agency would be able to
meaningfully impact any proceeding in which the Commission seeks to determine that it should
be subject to the requirements for covered clearing agencies, exacerbating regulatory
uncertainty. 560
As discussed above, the Commission has determined not to adopt Rule 17Ab2-2(a), and
therefore no process would exist under Rule 17Ab2-2 by which the Commission could designate
558

As discussed in Part II.D.2.a above, the Commission has determined not to adopt
proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a), and therefore, in adopting proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(b), the
Commission is moving it to Rule 17Ab2-2(a). See infra Part VI.

559

See CME at 3.

560

See id.

246

a registered clearing agency as a covered clearing agency. The Commission notes, nonetheless,
that the procedures set forth in Rule 17Ab2-2, as previously discussed, include provisions for
publishing notice of the Commission’s intention to consider determinations under Rule 17Ab2-2,
including a brief statement of the grounds under consideration, and for providing at least a 30day public comment period. The Commission believes that this should provide a clearing
agency with ample opportunity to present data, views, and arguments supporting why it should
not be subject to the requirements for covered clearing agencies. Nevertheless, the rule also
provides that the clearing agency subject to the proposed determination may be provided an
opportunity for hearing, which provides the possibility of an opportunity for additional input.
e. Procedures for Removing “Covered Clearing Agency” Status
One commenter believed that the Commission should establish a process, including a
public comment period, for determinations regarding covered clearing agency status and
recommends that a process for removing that status (due to, for example, a change in
circumstances such that the clearing agency no longer meets the criteria for designation) also be
established. The commenter stated that it should include a public comment period and advance
notice to clearing members of at least 180 days prior to the effectiveness of such change in
status. 561 The Commission believes that such procedures will ensure that each clearing agency is
subject to the appropriate rule set on an ongoing basis. In response to this comment, the
Commission is adding new paragraph (d) to Rule 17Ab2-2 to provide for a process to rescind
any determination made pursuant to Rule 17Ab2-2(a), (b), or (c). This new rule includes the
same procedural elements as for determinations under Rules 17Ab2-2(b) and (c), including
publication with a 30-day comment period. The commenter requested that clearing members be
561

See ISDA at 2.

247

provided notice at least 180 days prior to the effectiveness of a change in status. The
Commission believes that the effective date for any such determination should be based on the
facts and circumstances of the clearing agency for which removal of covered clearing agency
status is being considered.
3. Final Rule
The Commission has determined not to adopt proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a), as discussed
above. The Commission is adopting proposed Rules 17Ab2-2(b) through (g) with the
modifications described above. Because the Commission is not adopting proposed Rule 17Ab22(a), the Commission is renumbering the remaining paragraphs under Rule 17Ab2-2
accordingly.
E. Rule 17Ad-22(f)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(f) would codify the Commission’s special enforcement
authority over designated clearing agencies for which the Commission acts as the supervisory
agency, pursuant to the Clearing Supervision Act. Under Section 807(c) of the Clearing
Supervision Act, for purposes of enforcing the provisions of the Clearing Supervision Act, a
designated clearing agency is subject to, and the Commission has authority under, the provisions
of subsections (b) through (n) of Section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act in the same
manner and to the same extent as if a designated clearing agency were an insured depository
institution and the Commission were the appropriate Federal banking agency for such insured
depository institution. 562 The Commission received no comments regarding the proposed rule
and is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(f) as proposed.
562

See 12 U.S.C. 5466(c); see also 12 U.S.C. 1818 (relevant provisions under the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act).

248

F. Amendment to Rule 17Ad-22(d)
To facilitate consistency between existing Rule 17Ad-22(d) and proposed Rule 17Ad22(e), the Commission proposed to amend the first paragraph of Rule 17Ad-22(d) so that it
would not apply to covered clearing agencies. Rule 17Ad-22(d) provides that a registered
clearing agency shall establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to fulfill the requirements of Rules 17Ad-22(d)(1) through (15), as
applicable. As proposed, the amended Rule 17Ad-22(d) would instead apply only to a registered
clearing agency other than a covered clearing agency.
The Commission received general comments regarding the overall structure and
application of Rule 17Ad-22 in light of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) and the existing requirements
under Rule 17Ad-22(d), and has addressed those comments in Part I.C.2. The Commission did
not receive any comments addressed to the proposed amendment to the first paragraph of Rule
17Ad-22(d), and the Commission is adopting the amendment as proposed.
G. Effective and Compliance Dates
One commenter believed that a phase-in of Rule 17Ad-22(e) is necessary and
appropriate. 563 The commenter suggested that the implementation phase-in extend to at least one
year following publication of Rule 17Ad-22(e), citing in particular the requirements related to
linkages in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) and views that compliance with such rules will require
extensive cooperation and coordination among the relevant entities. 564 Another commenter
specifically requested sufficient time for covered clearing agencies to implement the

563

See DTCC at 13.

564

See id. at 13–14 & n.46.

249

requirements with respect to equity capital funding pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(15). 565
The amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and new Rule 17Ab2-2 will become effective 60 days
after publication in the Federal Register (“effective date”). As proposed, a covered clearing
agency would have been required to meet the requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e) on the effective
date. However, after consideration of the views of the commenters, the Commission has
determined to adopt a compliance date of 120 days after the effective date (“compliance date”).
The Commission believes it is important to establish enhanced requirements for covered clearing
agencies given the potentially significant risks posed by their size, systemic importance, global
reach, and/or the risks inherent in the products they clear, and therefore continues to believe that
implementation of the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e) should be prompt. The Commission
notes that one commenter requesting a phase-in approach for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) stated it
would be in compliance with the proposed requirements no later than January 1, 2015, 566 which
has already passed. The other commenter raised several concerns regarding the need to review
existing policies and procedures, develop and draft new policies and procedures, submit, where
appropriate, proposed rule changes and advance notices for Commission review, raise additional
capital or qualifying liquid resources, and hire and train additional personnel. 567 The

Commission believes that the additional time it is providing with the compliance date of 120
days after the effective date addresses this concern.
In addition, one commenter requested that the Commission clarify how it intends to apply
the rules to applications for registration as a clearing agency that are pending when the rules are
finalized. 568 The Commission intends to review any application for registration as a clearing
agency pursuant to the requirements of Section 17A of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, including Rule 17Ad-22 and any amendments thereto, and notes that the
compliance date would apply to all covered clearing agencies, including an applicant for
registration as a clearing agency whose application is pending upon the compliance date that
would, if registered, meet the definition of a covered clearing agency. In reviewing such an
application, Section 17A(b)(3) of the Exchange Act requires that a clearing agency shall not be
registered unless the Commission determines that an applicant’s rules and operations satisfy each
of the requirements set forth in Section 17A(b)(3). 569 Following registration, any registered
clearing agency that falls within the definition of a covered clearing agency would need to
address compliance with each of the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e) no later than the
compliance date.
The Commission also notes that the staff regularly conducts examinations, including
those required under Section 807 of the Clearing Supervision Act, 570 and supervisory reviews of

568

See LCH at 3.

569

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3).

570

Section 807 annual examinations of designated clearing agencies are conducted in order
to determine: (1) the nature of the operations of, and the risks borne by, the designated financial
market utility; (2) the financial and operational risks presented by the designated market utility to
financial institutions, critical markets, or the broader financial system; (3) the resources and
capabilities of the designated financial market utility to monitor and control such risks; (4) the
251

registered clearing agencies that are covered clearing agencies. 571 Accordingly, the staff will
periodically evaluate the results of these reviews and examinations of covered clearing agencies
to evaluate the extent to which covered clearing agencies have achieved and maintained
compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e); the various outcomes observed in how the covered clearing
agencies seek to implement the requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e), and possible reasons for such
variations; and any other observations relevant to implementation of Rule 17Ad-22(e).
III. Economic Analysis
As noted above, registered clearing agencies have become an essential part of the
infrastructure of the U.S. securities markets. Many securities transactions are centrally cleared
by clearing agencies, and central clearing has become more prevalent in the market for securitybased swaps. 572 For example, in the cash markets, DTCC processed $1.508 quadrillion in
financial transactions in 2015. Within DTCC, NSCC processed an average daily value of $976.6
billion in equity securities, FICC cleared $917.1 trillion of transactions in government securities
and $48.2 trillion of transactions in agency mortgage-backed securities, and DTC settled $112.3

safety and soundness of the designated financial market utility; and (5) the designated financial
market utility’s compliance with the Clearing Supervision Act and the rules and orders
prescribed under the Clearing Supervision Act. See 12 U.S.C. 5466(a).
571

See supra Part I.A.1.

572

The Commission is using “central clearing” here and below to refer to both the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions. In this regard, “clearing” is performed by a CCP, and
“settlement” is performed for certain securities transactions by a CSD, which then holds those
securities in its role as the central depository. Because clearing agencies can provide either CCP
or CSD services, the Commission uses “clearing agencies” here and below to refer to CCPs and
CSDs collectively. “Registered clearing agencies” are those CCPs and CSDs that are registered
with the Commission.

trillion of securities and held securities valued at $45.4 trillion. 573 In the listed options markets,
OCC cleared more than 4.1 billion contracts and held margin of $98.3 billion at the end of
2015. 574
While central clearing generally benefits the markets in which it is available, clearing
agencies can pose substantial risk to the financial system as a whole, due in part to the fact that
central clearing concentrates risk in the clearing agency. Disruption to a clearing agency’s
operations, or failure on the part of a clearing agency to meet its obligations, could therefore
serve as a potential source of contagion, resulting in significant costs not only to the clearing
agency itself or its members but also to other market participants or the broader U.S. financial
system. 575 As a result, proper management of the risks associated with central clearing is

to losses. Any such failure, moreover, is likely to have been triggered by the failure of one or
more large clearing members, and therefore to occur during a period of extreme market
fragility.”); Pirrong, The Inefficiency of Clearing Mandates, Policy Analysis, No. 655, at 11–14,

clearing may lead speculators and hedgers to take larger positions, that a CCP’s failure to
effectively price counterparty risks may lead to moral hazard and adverse selection problems,
that the main effect of clearing would be to “redistribute losses consequent to a bankruptcy or
run,” and that clearing entities have failed or come close to failing in the past, including in

necessary to ensure the stability of the U.S. securities markets and the broader U.S. financial
system. The mandate in Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act for central clearing of security-based
swaps, wherever possible and appropriate, further reinforces this need. 576 When a clearing
agency provides CCP services, central clearing replaces bilateral counterparty exposures with
exposures against the clearing agency. Consequently, a move from voluntary clearing to
mandatory clearing of security-based swaps, holding the volume of security-based swap
transactions constant, would increase economic exposures against clearing agencies that
centrally clear security-based swaps. Increased exposures in turn raise the possibility that these
clearing agencies may serve as a transmission mechanism for systemic events.
Clearing agencies have incentives to implement a risk management framework that can
effectively manage the risks posed by central clearing. First, the ongoing viability of a clearing
agency depends on its reputation and the confidence that market participants have in its services.
Clearing agencies therefore have an incentive to reduce the likelihood that a member default or
operational outage would disrupt settlement of a particular transaction or set of transactions.
Second, some clearing agencies operate as member-owned utilities and mutualize default risk
across their members, and thus non-defaulting participants are subject to losses that occur above
the defaulter’s margin and clearing fund. Clearing agencies that operate under such models thus
have an economic interest in sound risk management to reduce the expected level of losses that

must be mutualized. Other clearing agencies are publicly traded and therefore could have
different incentives because non-member-owners may have a lower economic stake in the
clearing agency than member-owners under a mutualized structure. Such an ownership structure
could increase the incentive for owners, particularly those that are non-members, to take risks,
though these incentives may be tempered by rules of the clearing agency that are consistent with
Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Exchange Act, which requires that the clearing agency’s rules assure
fair representation of its shareholders and participants in the selection of the clearing agency’s
directors and administration of its affairs. 577
Further, Section 17A of the Exchange Act requires that the rules of a clearing agency
protect investors and the public interest. 578 Nevertheless, incentives for sound risk management
may be tempered by pressures to reduce costs and maximize profits that are distinct from goals
set forth in governing statutes. 579 This tension may result in a clearing agency making decisions
that result in tradeoffs between the costs and benefits of risk management that are not socially
efficient because a clearing agency’s decision-making process may not fully reflect the costs and
benefits that accrue to other financial market participants as a result of its decisions. Further,
even if clearing agencies do internalize costs that they impose on their clearing members, they
may fail to internalize the consequences of their risk management decisions on other entities
within the financial system that are connected to them through relationships with their clearing

members. 580 Such a failure represents a financial network externality imposed by clearing
agencies on the broader financial system and suggests that financial stability, as a public good,
may be under-produced in equilibrium.
As discussed in more detail below, the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and Rule 17Ab2-2
represent a strengthening of the Commission’s regulation of registered clearing agencies. In
particular, Rule 17Ad-22(e) establishes requirements for the operation and governance of
registered clearing agencies that meet the definition of “covered clearing agency.” The
Commission believes that the more specific requirements imposed by Rule 17Ad-22(e) will
further mitigate the potential for moral hazard associated with risk management at a covered
clearing agency. For instance, in the absence of policies and procedures that require periodic
stress-testing and validation of credit and liquidity risk models, a covered clearing agency could
potentially choose to recalibrate models in periods of low volatility and avoid recalibration in
periods of high volatility, causing it to underestimate the risks that it faces during periods of
market stress. The Commission believes that the specific requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e) with
respect to stress testing and validation of credit and liquidity models would be more effective at
mitigating these particular manifestations of incentive misalignments than the requirements in
Rules 17Ad-22(b) or (d).
The Commission believes, as a result, that Rule 17Ad-22(e) provides a general benefit of
reducing the likelihood of a clearing agency failure. This general benefit accrues to the extent
that clearing agencies do not already conform to the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e). Despite
the potential incentive problems noted above, and perhaps in anticipation of regulatory efforts,
580

See Daron Acemoglu, Asuman Ozdaglar & Alireza Tahbaz-Salehi, Systemic Risk and
Stability in Financial Networks (NBER Working Paper No. 18727, Jan. 2013), available at

256

some registered clearing agencies have already taken steps to update their policies and
procedures in manners that may be consistent with the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e). The
Commission also notes that, in some instances, the practices that Rule 17Ad-22(e) codifies as
minimum requirements are current practices at some registered clearing agencies. In these cases,
the Commission believes that imposing these requirements on covered clearing agencies will
have the effect of imposing consistent, higher minimum risk management standards across all
covered clearing agencies. In adopting these rules, the Commission is also mindful of the
benefits that would accrue by adopting regulatory approaches that are generally consistent with
those of the CFTC and FRB.
The Commission is sensitive to the economic consequences and effects of the
amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and Rule 17Ab2-2, including their benefits and costs. The
Commission acknowledges that, since many of these rules require a covered clearing agency to
adopt new policies and procedures, the economic effects and consequences of these rules include
those flowing from the substantive results of those new policies and procedures. Under Section
3(f) of the Exchange Act, whenever the Commission engages in rulemaking under the Exchange
Act and is required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the
public interest, it must consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will
promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 581 Further, as noted above, Section 17A
of the Exchange Act directs the Commission to have due regard for the public interest, the
protection of investors, the safeguarding of securities and funds, and maintenance of fair
competition among brokers and dealers, clearing agencies, and transfer agents when using its
authority to facilitate the establishment of a national system for clearance and settlement

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(f).

257

transactions in securities. 582 Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act also prohibits the
Commission from adopting any rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 583
The Commission has attempted to quantify the benefits and costs anticipated to flow
from the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and Rule 17Ab2-2. In the CCA Standards proposing
release, the Commission requested comment on all aspects of the economic analysis of the
proposed rules, including their benefits and costs, as well as any effect the proposed rules may
have on competition, efficiency, and capital formation, and encouraged commenters to provide
data and analysis to help further quantify or estimate the potential benefits and costs of the
proposed rules. Although it did not receive comments specifically directed at the economic
analysis, the Commission has considered the comments, and, as in some cases indicated below,
certain data needed to quantify the costs and benefits associated with the rules remains
unavailable. For example, implementing policies and procedures that require stress testing of
financial resources available to a covered clearing agency at least once each day may require
additional investment in infrastructure, but the particular infrastructure requirements will depend
on existing systems and a covered clearing agency’s choice of modeling techniques.
As discussed above, 584 the Commission believes that Rule 17Ad-22(e), in requiring
reasonably designed policies and procedures strikes an appropriate balance between directing
covered clearing agencies to engage in specific conduct or practices and allowing each covered
clearing agency to design its own policies and procedures without any framework. In adopting
582

See supra Part I.A.1.

583

See 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).

584

See Part II.B.

258

Rule 17Ad-22(e), the Commission is providing guidance to help covered clearing agencies
identify and develop reasonable policies and procedures. The guidance outlines key issues and
building blocks that a covered clearing agency generally should consider as it develops policies
and procedures in compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e). While this guidance provides covered
clearing agencies with additional information about the types of considerations that may be
relevant to meeting requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e), the Commission does not believe that
considering these issues will entail substantial costs beyond the estimates presented below.
Overall, the Commission believes that the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and Rule
17Ab2-2 should result in improvements in risk management with respect to systemic risk, as
well as with respect to legal, credit, liquidity, general business, custody, investment, and
operational risk. Further, the Commission believes that the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 should
result in an increase in financial stability insofar as they result in minimum standards at covered
clearing agencies that are higher than those standards implied by current practices at covered
clearing agencies. In particular cases, such as requirements for the management of liquidity risk
and general business risk, an increase in financial stability may occur as a result of higher risk
management standards at covered clearing agencies that lower the probability that either covered
clearing agencies or their members default. As explained in Part III.B.2, reduced default
probabilities for covered clearing agencies may, in turn, improve efficiency and capital
formation.
A. Economic Baseline
To consider the effect of the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and Rule 17Ab2-2 on market
activity, including possible effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation, the
Commission is using an economic baseline that considers the current market for central clearing,

259

including the number of registered clearing agencies, the distribution of members across these
clearing agencies, and the volume of transactions these clearing agencies process. As noted
above, there are currently five registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services and one
that provides CSD services, and these entities processed and cleared a large number of contracts
and securities. For example, for 2015 DTCC reported processing over $1.5 quadrillion in
financial market transactions, DTCC cleared over 4.1 billion in contract volume, and ICE cleared
over 6 million futures and OTC contracts each day. 585

membership rates vary.

The Commission notes that registered clearing agencies are currently characterized by
specialization and limited competition. Central clearing exhibits high barriers to entry and
economies of scale. These features of the existing market, and the resulting concentration of
central clearing within a handful of entities, informs the Commission’s examination of the effects
of the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and Rule 17Ab2-2 on competition, efficiency, and capital
formation, as discussed further below. 587
To further assess the economic effects of the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and Rule
17Ab2-2, including possible effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation, the
Commission is also considering as part of the baseline (i) the current regulatory framework for
registered clearing agencies, and (ii) the current practices of registered clearing agencies that
relate to Rule 17Ad-22(e). Each is discussed further below.
1. Regulatory Framework for Registered Clearing Agencies
As previously discussed, the current regulatory framework for registered clearing
agencies begins with Section 17A of the Exchange Act, which directs the Commission to
facilitate the establishment of (i) a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and
settlement of securities transactions and (ii) linked or coordinated facilities for clearance and
settlement of securities transactions. Further, Section 17A and Rule 17Ab2-1 require an entity

587

See infra Part III.B.2 (discussing the effect of the adopted rules on competition,
efficiency, and capital formation).

261

that meets the definition of a clearing agency to register with the Commission or obtain from the
Commission an exemption from registration prior to performing the functions of a clearing
agency. 588 After registration, the Commission supervises registered clearing agencies using
various tools, including (i) the rule filing process for SROs set forth in Section 19(b) of the
Exchange Act and rules thereunder, (ii) examinations of clearing agencies, and (iii) other
provisions of the Exchange Act. 589 Titles VII and VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act have expanded
the Commission’s role with respect to the regulation of clearing agencies. Specifically, Title VII
amended Section 17A of the Exchange Act by adding, among other provisions, new paragraphs
(g) through (j), which provide the Commission with authority to adopt rules governing securitybased swap clearing agencies. 590 The Clearing Supervision Act, adopted in Title VIII, provides
for enhanced regulation of SIFMUs and, more generally, for enhanced coordination between the
Commission and FRB by facilitating regulator on-site examinations and information sharing. It
further provides that the Commission and CFTC shall coordinate with the FRB to jointly develop
risk management supervision programs for SIFMUs and that the Commission and CFTC can
each prescribe risk management standards governing the operations related to the PCS activities
of SIFMUs for which each is the supervisory agency, in consultation with the FSOC and FRB
and taking into consideration relevant international standards and existing prudential
requirements. 591

In 2012, the Commission adopted Rule 17Ad-22 under the Exchange Act to strengthen
the substantive regulation of registered clearing agencies, promote the safe and reliable operation
of registered clearing agencies, and improve efficiency, transparency, and access to registered
clearing agencies. 592 In its economic analysis of the Clearing Agency Standards release, the
Commission noted that the economic characteristics of clearing agencies, including economies of
scale, barriers to entry, and the particulars of their legal mandates, may limit competition and
confer market power on such clearing agencies, which may lead to lower levels of service,
higher prices, or under-investment in risk management systems. 593 The requirements in Rule
17Ad-22 establish an enhanced regulatory framework for clearing agencies that raise systemic
risk concerns due to, among other things, their size, systemic importance, global reach, or the
risks inherent in the products they clear. 594
a. Determinations by the Commission
Among other things, the Commission makes determinations regarding the registration of
clearing agencies and proposed rule changes. Rule 17Ad-22(d) has applied to registered clearing
agencies since January 2013, and no mechanism exists under Rule 17Ad-22 for the Commission
to make determinations of the type that appear in Rule 17Ab2-2. 595
b. BCBS Capital Framework
In addition to requirements under the Exchange Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and Rule
17Ad-22, other regulatory efforts are relevant to the Commission’s analysis of the economic
592

263

effects of Rule 17Ad-22(e). In 2012, the BCBS first published the capital framework, which sets
forth rules governing the capital charges arising from bank exposures to CCPs related to OTC
derivatives, exchange-traded derivatives, and securities financing transactions, and the BCBS
finalized the framework in 2014. 596 The BCBS capital framework is designed to create
incentives for banks to clear derivatives and securities financing transactions with CCPs licensed
in a jurisdiction where the relevant regulator has adopted rules or regulations consistent with the
PFMI. Specifically, the BCBS capital framework introduces new capital charges based on
counterparty risk for banks conducting derivatives transactions or securities financing
transactions through a CCP. 597
Capital charges under the BCBS capital framework relate to a bank’s trade exposure and
default fund exposure to a CCP and are a function of multiplying these exposures by a
corresponding risk weight. Historically, these exposures have carried a risk weight of zero.
These weights have increased as banking regulators have adopted rules consistent with the
BCBS capital framework. The risk weight assigned under the BCBS capital framework varies
depending on whether the counterparty is a QCCP. For example, risk weights for trade
exposures to a CCP generally would vary between twenty and 100 percent depending on the
CCP’s credit quality, while trade exposures to a QCCP would carry only a two-percent risk

596

See supra note 44 and accompanying text.

597

Since the BCBS capital framework applies lower capital requirements only to bank
exposures related to OTC and exchange-traded derivatives activity and securities financing
transactions, the Commission currently expects that, among all registered clearing agencies,
FICC, ICEEU, and OCC would be those affected by the BCBS capital framework. Each would
meet the definition of “covered clearing agency.”

264

weight. 598 In addition, bank exposures to CCP default funds would carry a risk weight of 1250
percent. While bank exposures to QCCP default funds will also carry a 1250 percent risk weight
at low levels, under the BCBS capital framework, default fund exposures’ contribution to a
bank’s risk weighted assets will be limited to at most eighteen percent of the bank’s trade
exposures to a given QCCP.
Many jurisdictions have already adopted rules that implement requirements under the
BCBS capital framework. For example, the BCBS reports that, as of March 2016, all twentyseven member jurisdictions have risk-based capital rules in force, twenty-four have rules for
countercyclical capital buffers, and twenty-three have implemented or drafted rules related to
systematically important banks. 599 In the United States, the FRB and Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency jointly issued regulatory capital rules for U.S. banks consistent with the BCBS
capital framework effective January 1, 2014. The rules subject bank exposures to CCPs and
QCCPs to increased risk weights as specified in the BCBS capital framework. 600 In addition to
specifying risk weights, the rules define the term QCCP for banks supervised by the FRB and the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. According to these rules, QCCP status applies to any
CCP that is a SIFMU or, if not located in the United States, any CCP that is regulated and

598

The BCBS capital framework, as well as the rules adopted by the FRB and Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency consistent with that framework, applies lower risk weights of two or
four percent to indirect exposures of banks to QCCPs. See BCBS capital framework, supra note
44, paras. 114–15; Regulatory Capital Rules, supra note 45, at 62103.

supervised in a manner equivalent to a SIFMU. 601 In addition, a CCP can become a QCCP if it
meets the following standards: it requires all parties to contracts cleared by the CCP to be fully
collateralized on a daily basis; and it is regulated by the FRB and demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the FRB that the CCP is (i) in sound financial condition, (ii) subject to supervision by the
Commission, CFTC, or FRB or, if not located in the United States, subject to effective oversight
by a national supervisory authority in its home country, and (iii) meets or exceeds the risk
management standards for CCPs established under the Dodd-Frank Act or, if not located in the
United States, meets or exceeds similar risk-management standards established under the law of
its home country that are consistent with international standards for CCP risk management as
established by the relevant standard setting body. Under this definition, each covered clearing
agency would be a QCCP either because it is a SIFMU or because it is a CCP that is regulated
and supervised in a manner equivalent to a SIFMU, and therefore U.S. bank clearing members
would be subject to the lower capital requirements on exposures to QCCPs under the BCBS
capital framework.
Within the European Union, EMIR permits legal persons incorporated under the law of
an EU member state to use non-EU CCPs only if those CCPs have been recognized under EMIR.
Further, only non-EU CCPs recognized under EMIR will meet the conditions necessary to be
considered a QCCP for EU bank clearing members. Article 25 of EMIR outlines a recognition
procedure for non-EU CCPs and Article 89 provides a timeline for recognition. 602 FICC, NSCC,

and OCC have applied for recognition under EMIR. 603 In February 2016, the European
Commission and CFTC announced that they will follow a common approach for CCPs. The
European Commission plans to adopt an equivalence decision that will allow ESMA to
recognize U.S. CCPs regulated by the CFTC, such that these entities can provide services in the
EU while complying primarily with CFTC rules and regulations. 604
Additionally, the BCBS capital framework, as adopted by the FRB, Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, and banking regulators in other jurisdictions, impose capital
requirements related to unconditionally cancellable commitments and other off-balance sheet
exposures. For example, the FRB and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency require banks
to include ten percent of the notional amount of unconditionally cancellable commitments in
their calculation of total leverage exposure. 605 The rules place a floor of three percent on the
ratio of tier one capital to total assets for banks subject to advanced approaches to risk-based
capital rules. 606 To the extent that clearing agencies rely on financial resources from banks as
part of their risk management activities, these constraints on off-balance sheet exposures could
raise the cost of such activities.

603

These three clearing agencies agreed to have their names publicly disclosed and do not
necessarily represent the full set of registered clearing agencies that applied for recognition under
EMIR. See ESMA, List of CCPs Established in Non-EEA Countries Which Have Applied for
Recognition Under Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and

267

c. Other Regulatory Efforts
Efforts by the CFTC and FRB to adopt rules that are consistent with the PFMI are also
relevant to the economic analysis of the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22. Both the CFTC and FRB
have indicated publicly that they have completed all measures necessary to incorporate fully the
PFMI into their regulatory frameworks. 607
2. Current Practices
Current industry practices are a critical element of the economic baseline for registered
clearing agencies. Registered clearing agencies must operate in compliance with Rule 17Ad-22,
though they may vary in the particular ways they achieve such compliance. Some variation in
practices across registered clearing agencies derives from the products they clear and the markets
they serve. The Commission also understands that, since it published the CCA Standards
proposing release, some registered clearing agencies have amended their rules with the aim of
achieving consistency with some of the standards in the PFMI. Because the Commission
believes that the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e) are consistent with the PFMI and further the
objectives of Section 17A of the Exchange Act, the Clearing Supervision Act, and Title VII of
the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission also believes that Rule 17Ad-22(e) represents, where it
imposes higher minimum standards on covered clearing agencies, an additional step towards
improved risk management.
An overview of current practices is set forth below and includes discussion of covered
clearing agency policies and procedures regarding general organization and risk management,
including the management of legal, credit, liquidity, business, custody, investment, and
operational risk. This discussion is based on the Commission’s general understanding of current
607

See supra note 43.

268

practices as of the date of this adoption and reflects the Commission’s experience supervising
registered clearing agencies.
a. Legal Risk
Legal risk is the risk that a registered clearing agency’s rules, policies, or procedures may
not be enforceable and concerns, among other things, its contracts, the rights of members, netting
arrangements, discharge of obligations, and settlement finality. Cross-border activities of a
registered clearing agency may also present elements of legal risk.
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(1) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for a wellfounded, transparent, and enforceable legal framework for each aspect of its activities in all
relevant jurisdictions. 608 Each registered clearing agency makes a large portion of these policies
and procedures available to members and participants. In addition, each also publishes their rule
books and other key procedures publicly to promote the transparency of their legal
frameworks. 609
b. Governance
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(8) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to have governance
arrangements that are clear and transparent to fulfill the public interest requirements in Section
17A of the Exchange Act applicable to clearing agencies, to support the objectives of owners and
participants, and to promote the effectiveness of the clearing agency’s risk management
608

The rule book of each registered clearing agency, as well as select policies and
procedures, are publicly available on each registered clearing agency’s website.

269

procedures. 610 Important elements of a registered clearing agency’s governance arrangements
include its ownership structure; its charter, bylaws, and charters for committees of its board and
management committees; its rules, policies, and procedures; the composition and role of its
board, including the structure and role of board committees; reporting lines between
management and the board; and the processes that provide for management accountability with
respect to the registered clearing agency’s performance.
Each registered clearing agency has a board that governs its operations and supervises
senior management. Each registered clearing agency also has an independent audit committee of
the board and has established a board committee or committee of members tasked with
overseeing the clearing agency’s risk management functions. The boards of registered clearing
agencies that would be subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e) as covered clearing agencies currently
include non-management members.
Since the Commission proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), certain registered clearing agencies
have revised their governance policies. For example, some clearing agencies have established
additional committees of the board to focus on risk management and technology issues, 611 and
one clearing agency has modified its nomination process for directors and increased the number
of public directors on its board of directors. 612

c. Framework for the Comprehensive Management of Risks
Rules 17Ad-22(b) and (d) require registered clearing agencies to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to measure and
mitigate credit exposures, identify operational risks, evaluate risks arising in connection with
cross-border and domestic links for the purpose of clearing or settling trades, achieve DVP
settlement, and implement risk controls to cover the clearing agency’s credit exposures to
participants. 613 Rule 17Ad-22(d)(4) requires a registered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
establish business continuity plans setting forth procedures for the recovery of operations in the
event of a disruption. 614 Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11) further requires a registered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to make key aspects of the clearing agency’s default procedures publicly available and establish
default procedures that ensure that the clearing agency can take timely action to contain losses
and liquidity pressures and to continue meeting its obligations in the event of a participant
default. 615
In addition to meeting these requirements, the Commission understands that registered
clearing agencies also specify actions to be taken when their resources are insufficient to cover
governance committee and nominating committee into a single committee, changes to the
nominating process for directors, and increasing the number of public directors on board of
directors).

their losses. 616 These actions may include assessment rights on clearing members, forced
allocation, and contract termination. Since the Commission proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), certain
clearing agencies have modified policies and procedures that address how resources are collected
from members to manage financial risks. For example, one clearing agency has revised its rules
to require that intraday margin be collected and margin assets not withdrawn when a member’s
reasonably anticipated settlement obligations would exceed the liquidity resources available to
the clearing agency to satisfy those clearing obligations. 617
d. Financial Risk Management
Registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services have a variety of options
available to mitigate the financial risks to which they are exposed. While the manner in which a
CCP chooses to mitigate these financial risks depends on the precise nature of the CCP’s
obligations, a common set of procedures have been implemented by many CCPs to manage
credit and liquidity risks. Broadly, these procedures enable CCPs to manage their risks by
reducing the likelihood of member defaults, limiting potential losses and liquidity pressure in the
event of a member default, implementing mechanisms that allocate losses across members, and
providing adequate resources to cover losses and meet payment obligations as required.

616

See David Elliot, Central Counterparty Loss-Allocation Rules, at tbl. 1A (Bank of
England Financial Stability Paper No. 20, Apr. 2013), available at
http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Documents/fspapers/fs_paper20.pdf (noting the lossallocation rules applied at the end of a clearing agency waterfall).

See Exchange Act Release No. 34-72266 (May 28, 2014), 79 FR 32008 (June 3, 2014)
(notice of filing and immediate effectiveness of proposed rule change by OCC to require that
intraday margin be collected and margin assets not be withdrawn when a clearing member’s
reasonably anticipated settlement obligations to the clearing agency would exceed the clearing
agency’s liquidity resources available to satisfy such obligations).

272

Registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services must be able to effectively
measure their credit exposures to properly manage those exposures. A CCP faces the risk that its
exposure to a member can change as a result of a change in prices, positions, or both. CCPs can
ascertain current credit exposures to each member by, in some cases, marking each member’s
outstanding contracts to current market prices and, to the extent permitted by their rules and
supported by law, by netting any gains against any losses. Rule 17Ad-22 includes certain
requirements related to financial risk management by CCPs, including requirements to measure
credit exposures to members and to use margin requirements to limit these exposures. These
requirements are general in nature and provide registered clearing agencies flexibility to measure
credit risk and set margin. Within the bounds of Rule 17Ad-22, CCPs may employ models and
choose parameters that they conclude are appropriate to the markets they serve.
The current practices of registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services generally
include the following procedures: (1) measuring credit exposures at least once a day; (2) setting
margin coverage at a 99% confidence level over some set period; (3) using risk-based models;
(4) establishing a fund that mutualizes losses of defaults by one or more participants that exceed
margin coverage; (5) maintaining sufficient financial resources to withstand the default of at
least the largest participant family; and (6) in the case of security-based swap transactions,
maintaining enough financial resources to be able to withstand the default of their two largest
participant families. 618

618

See, e.g., CFTC-SEC Staff Roundtable on Clearing of Credit Default Swaps, at 123 (Oct.
2010), available at

i. Credit Risk
Rule 17Ad-22(b)(1) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to measure their credit exposures at least once per day. 619 Several CCPs have policies and
procedures designed to require measuring credit exposures multiple times per day.
Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to maintain sufficient financial resources to withstand, at a minimum, a default by the participant
family to which it has the largest exposure in extreme but plausible market conditions. 620 It
further requires CCPs for security-based swaps to establish, implement, maintain and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain additional financial resources
sufficient to withstand, at a minimum, a default by the two participant families to which it has
the largest exposures in extreme but plausible market conditions, in its capacity as a CCP for
security-based swaps. 621 Accordingly, the Commission notes that Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3) imposes a
“cover two” requirement on CCPs for security-based swaps to protect such CCPs from the
extreme jump-to-default risk and nonlinear payoffs associated with the nature of the financial
products they clear and the participants in the markets they serve. Meanwhile, CCPs that clear

products other than security-based swaps are subject to a “cover one” requirement. 622 Rule
17Ad-22(b)(3) also states that such policies and procedures may provide that additional financial
resources be maintained by the CCP in combined or separately maintained funds. 623
Under existing rules, CCPs collect contributions from their members for the purpose of
establishing guaranty or clearing funds to mutualize losses under extreme but plausible market
conditions. Currently, the guaranty funds or clearing funds consist of liquid assets and their sizes
vary depending on a number of factors, including the products the CCP clears and the
characteristics of CCP members. In particular, the guaranty funds for CCPs that clear securitybased swaps are relatively larger, as measured by the size of the fund as a percentage of the total
and largest exposures, than the guaranty or clearing funds maintained by CCPs for other
financial instruments. CCPs generally take the liquidity of collateral into account when
determining member obligations. Applying haircuts to assets posted as margin, among other
things, mitigates the liquidity risk associated with selling margin assets in the event of a
participant default.
Since the Commission proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), certain clearing agencies have
amended some of their policies with regards to credit risk. Such modifications include, for
example, provisions that require real-time submission of all locked-in trade data submitted for
trade recording and prohibit pre-netting and other practices that prevent real-time trade

622

See supra Part II.C.4.a (discussing the requirements for “cover one” and “cover two”).

275

submission. 624 Another clearing agency has made modifications to its policies and procedures
for stress testing frameworks. 625
ii. Collateral and Margin
Rule 17Ad-22(b)(2) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to use margin requirements to limit their exposures to participants. 626 This margin can also be
used to reduce a CCP’s losses in the event of a participant default.
Registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services take positions as substituted
counterparties once their trade guarantee goes into effect. Therefore, if a counterparty whose
obligations the registered clearing agency has guaranteed defaults, the covered clearing agency
may face market risk, which can take one of two forms. First, a covered clearing agency is
subject to the risk of movement in the market prices of the defaulting member’s open positions.
Where a seller defaults and fails to deliver a security, the covered clearing agency may need to
step into the market to buy the security to complete settlement and deliver the security to the
buyer. Similarly, where a buyer defaults, the covered clearing agency may need to meet
payment obligations to the seller. Thus, in the interval between when a member defaults and
when the covered clearing agency must meet its obligations as a substituted counterparty to
complete settlement, market price movements expose the covered clearing agency to market risk.
624

See Exchange Act Release No. 34-69890 (June 28, 2013), 78 FR 40538 (July 5, 2013)
(order approving NSCC’s proposed rule change to require that all locked-in trade data submitted
to it for trade recording be submitted in real-time).
625

See Exchange Act Release No. 34-77982 (June 2, 2016), 81 FR 36979 (June 8, 2016)
(order approving ICE Clear Credit’s proposed rule change to update and formalize its stress
testing framework).
626

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(2).

276

Second, the covered clearing agency may need to liquidate non-cash margin collateral posted by
the defaulting member. The covered clearing agency is therefore exposed to the risk that erosion
in market prices of the collateral posted by the defaulting member could result in the covered
clearing agency having insufficient financial resources to cover the losses in the defaulting
member’s open positions.
To manage their exposure to market risk resulting from fulfilling a defaulting member’s
obligations, registered clearing agencies compute margin requirements using inputs such as
portfolio size, volatility, and sensitivity to various risk factors that are likely to influence security
prices. Moreover, since the size of price movements is, in part, a function of time, registered
clearing agencies may limit their exposure to market risk by marking participant positions to
market daily and, in some cases, more frequently. CCPs also use similar factors to determine
haircuts applied to assets posted by members in satisfaction of margin requirements. To manage
market risk associated with collateral liquidation, CCPs consider the current prices of assets
posted as collateral and price volatility, asset liquidity, and the correlation of collateral assets and
a member’s portfolio of open positions. Further, because CCPs need to value their margin assets
in times of financial stress, their rulebooks may include features such as market-maker
domination charges that increase clearing fund obligations regarding open positions of members
in securities in which the member serves as a dominant market maker. The reasoning behind this
charge is that, should a member default, liquidity in products in which the member makes
markets may fall, leaving these positions more difficult to liquidate for non-defaulting
participants.
Rule 17Ab-22(b)(2) also requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services
to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably

277

designed to use risk-based models and parameters to set margin requirements. 627 The generally
recognized standard for such models and parameters is, under normal market conditions, price
movements that produce changes in exposures that are expected to breach margin requirements
or other risk controls only 1% of the time (i.e., at a 99% confidence interval) over a designated
time horizon. 628 Currently, CCPs use margin models to ensure coverage at a single-tailed 99%
confidence interval. Losses beyond this level are typically covered by the CCP’s guaranty fund.
This standard comports with existing international standards for bank capital requirements,
which require banks to measure market risks at a 99% confidence interval when determining
regulatory capital requirements. 629

627

See id.

628

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(a)(4). The Commission notes that because of modifications to
Rule 17Ad-22(a), the definition of “normal market conditions” is being moved to Rule 17Ad22(a)(11). The Commission is not altering the definition of “normal market conditions.” See
Rule 17Ad-22(a)(11), infra Part VI.

See BCBS, International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A
Revised Framework (June 2004), available at http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs107.pdf; see also
Darryll Hendricks & Beverly Hirtle, New Capital Rule Signals Supervisory Shift (Secondary
Mortgage Mkts, Sept. 1998), available at
http://www.freddiemac.com/finance/smm/july98/pdfs/hen_hirt.pdf.
Prior to this standard, banks measured value-at-risk using a range of confidence intervals
from 90–99%. See BCBS, An Internal Model-Based Approach to Market Risk Capital
Requirements, at 12 (Apr. 1995), available at http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs17.pdf. When
determining the minimum quantitative standards for calculating risk measurements, the BCBS
noted then the importance of specifying “a common and relatively conservative confidence
level,” choosing the 99% confidence interval over other less conservative measures. See id.
Since its adoption in 1998, the standard has become a generally recognized practice of
banks to quantify credit risk as the worst expected loss that a portfolio might incur over an
appropriate time horizon at a 99% confidence interval. See Kenji Nishiguchi, Hiroshi Kawai &
Takanori Sazaki, Capital Allocation and Bank Management Based on the Quantification of
Credit Risk, at 83 (FRBNY Econ. Policy Rev., Oct. 1998), available at
http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/epr/98v04n3/9810nish.pdf; Jeff Aziz & Narat Charupat,
278

Rule 17Ad-22(b)(2) also requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services
to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to review such margin requirements and the related risk-based models and parameters
at least monthly. 630 CCPs are accordingly required to establish a model validation process that
evaluates the adequacy of margin models, parameters, and assumptions. Additionally, CCPs are
required to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to provide for an annual model validation consisting of evaluating the
performance of the CCPs’ margin models and the related parameters and assumptions associated
with such models by a qualified person who is free from influence from the persons responsible
for the development or operation of the models being validated. 631
Certain clearing agencies have amended their policies and procedures governing
collateral and margin requirements since the Commission proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e). For
example, one clearing agency has amended its rules to require that intraday margin be collected
and to prohibit margin from being withdrawn if the agency anticipates that the settlement
obligations would exceed the liquidity resources available to the agency to satisfy such
settlement obligations. 632

intraday margin be collected and margin assets not be withdrawn when a clearing member’s
reasonably anticipated settlement obligations would exceed the clearing agency’s liquidity
resources available to satisfy such settlement obligations).

279

Other revisions include modifications to risk models to monitor margin coverage and risk
exposure. For example, modifications include accounting for factors such as procyclicality or
implied volatility of certain options to reflect future market fluctuations. 633 Amendments to
backtesting procedures are designed to assist clearing agencies in determining the amount of
margin to collect from clearing members. 634
Additionally, certain modifications address exposure to wrong-way risk. For example,
one clearing agency revised its margin methodology as applied to the family-issued securities of
certain members to exclude these securities from the volatility component and then by charging
an amount calculated, in part, by applying a haircut rate to the absolute value of the long net
unsettled positions in the member’s family-issued securities. 635 Other clearing agencies have
adjusted their risk models to account for accumulation of general wrong-way risk at the portfolio
level, while others have modified their policies with respect to the assets accepted as permitted
cover, as well as limits on the value of the collateral that may be accepted as permitted cover. 636
iii. Liquidity Risk
633

See, e.g., Exchange Act Release No. 34-72756 (Aug. 4, 2014), 79 FR 46479 (Aug. 8,

policies); Exchange Act Release No. 34-76781 (December 28, 2015), 81 FR 135 (order

procedures in order to enhance monitoring of margin coverage and model risk exposure).

as applied to family-issued securities of certain members).
636

See, e.g., Exchange Act Release No. 34-75887 (Sept. 10, 2015), 80 FR 55672 (Sept. 16,
2015) (order approving ICE Clear Credit’s proposed rule change to revise its risk management
framework).

280

In addition to credit risk and the aforementioned market risk, registered clearing agencies
also face liquidity or funding risk. Currently, covered clearing agencies have varying degrees of
formality with respect to their standards and practices relating to liquidity shortfalls. To
complete the settlement process, registered clearing agencies that employ netting rely on
incoming payments from participants in net debit positions to make payments to participants in
net credit positions. If a participant does not have sufficient funds or securities in the form
required to fulfill a payment obligation immediately when due (even though it may be able to
pay at some future time), or if a settlement bank is unable to make an incoming payment on
behalf of a participant, a registered clearing agency may face a funding shortfall. Such funding
shortfalls may occur due to a lack of financial resources necessary to meet delivery or payment
obligations, however even registered clearing agencies that do hold sufficient financial resources
to meet their obligations may not carry those in the form required for delivery or payments to
participants.
A registered clearing agency that provides CCP services may hold additional financial
resources to cover potential funding shortfalls in the form of collateral. As noted above, CCPs
may take the liquidity of collateral into account when determining member obligations.
Applying haircuts to illiquid assets posted as margin mitigates the liquidity risk associated with
selling margin assets in the event of participant default. Some registered CCPs also arrange for
liquidity provision from other financial institutions using lines of credit. Additionally, some
registered clearing agencies enter into prearranged funding agreements with their members
pursuant to their rules. For example, members of one registered clearing agency are obligated,
under certain pre-defined circumstances, to enter into repurchase agreements against securities
that would have been delivered to a defaulting member.

281

No rule under the Exchange Act currently requires a registered clearing agency through
its written policies and procedures to address liquidity risk. Since the Commission proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e), certain clearing agencies have amended their policies and procedures
regarding liquidity risk including, for example, through sources such as committed credit
facilities, private placements of debt, and committed securities repurchase agreements. Such
provisions can assist the ability of clearing agencies to complete settlement obligations,
particularly in the instances where a clearing member defaults. Additionally, certain clearing
agencies have clarified certain rules by which they manage liquidity, including how they will
access and use internal liquidity resources. 637
e. Settlement
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(5) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to employ money
settlement arrangements that eliminate or strictly limit the clearing agency’s settlement bank
risks and require funds transfers to the clearing agency to be final when effected. 638 Rule 17Ad22(d)(12) further requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that final settlement
occurs no later than the end of the settlement day. 639 Accordingly, for example, certain
registered clearing agencies provide for final settlement of securities transfers no later than the
end of the day of the transaction. Rule 17Ad-22(d)(15) also requires a registered clearing agency

Since the Commission proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), certain clearing agencies have
amended their policies and procedures governing money settlements. These include, for
example, provisions to convert U.S. Treasuries into cash when the sale of pledged securities
cannot be settled on a same-day basis. 641
f. CSDs
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(10) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CSD services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to maintain securities in an immobilized or dematerialized form for transfer by book entry to the
greatest extent possible. Currently, some securities, such as mutual fund securities and
government securities, are issued primarily or solely on a dematerialized basis. Dematerialized
shares do not exist as physical certificates but are held in book entry form in the name of the
owner (which, where the master security holder file is not maintained on paper due to the use of
technology, is also referred to as electronic custody). Other types of securities may be issued in
the form of one or more physical security certificates, which could be held by the CSD to
facilitate immobilization. Alternatively, securities may be held by the beneficial owner in record
name, in the form of book-entry positions, where the issuer offers the ability for a security holder

640

See Exchange Act Release No. 34-74456 (March 6, 2015), 80 FR 13055 (Mar. 12, 2015)
(order approving ICE Clear Credit’s proposed rule change to revise its Treasury operations
policies and procedures).

283

to hold through the direct registration system. Whether immobilization occurs at the CSD or
through direct registration depends on what is provided for by the issuer.
When a trade occurs, the depository’s accounting system credits one participant account
and debits another participant account. Transactions between counterparties in dematerialized
shares are recorded by the registrar responsible for maintaining the paper or electronic register of
security holders, such as by a transfer agent, and reflected in customer accounts.
Registered CSDs currently reconcile ownership positions in securities against CSD
ownership positions on the security holders list daily, mitigating the risk of unauthorized creation
or deletion of shares.
g. Exchange-of-Value Settlement Systems
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(13) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to eliminate principal
risk by linking securities transfers to funds transfers in a way that achieves delivery versus
payment, 642 which serves to link obligations by conditioning the final settlement of one upon the
final settlement of the other. One registered clearing agency, for example, operates a Model 2
DVP system that provides for gross securities transfers during the day followed by an end-of-day
net funds settlement. Under the rules governing the clearing agency’s system, the delivering
party in a DVP transaction is assured that it will be paid for the securities once they are credited
to the receiving party’s securities account. DVP eliminates the risk that a buyer would lose the
purchase price of a security purchased from a defaulting seller or that a seller would lose the sold
security without receiving payment for a security acquired by a defaulting buyer.
642

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(13); see also Clearing Agency Standards adopting release,
supra note 5, at 66256.

284

For example, one registered clearing agency has rules governing its continuous net
settlement (“CNS”) system, under which it becomes the counterparty for settlement purposes at
the point its trade guarantee attaches, thereby assuming the obligation of its members that are
receiving securities to receive and pay for those securities, and the obligation of members that
are delivering securities to make the delivery. Unless the clearing agency has invoked its default
rules, it is not obligated to make those deliveries until it receives from members with delivery
obligations deliveries of such securities; rather, deliveries that come into CNS ordinarily are
promptly redelivered to parties that are entitled to receive them through an allocation algorithm.
Members are obligated to take and pay for securities allocated to them in the CNS process.
These rules also provide mechanisms to allow receiving members a right to receive high priority
in the allocation of deliveries, and also permit a member to buy-in long positions that have not
been delivered to it by the close of business on the scheduled settlement date.
h. Participant-Default Rules and Procedures
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to make key aspects of
its default procedures publicly available and establish default procedures that ensure it can take
timely action to contain losses and liquidity pressures and to continue meeting its obligations in
the event of a participant default. The rules of registered clearing agencies typically state what
constitutes a default, identify whether the board or a committee of the board may make that
determination, and describe what steps the clearing agency may take to protect itself and its
members. In this regard, registered clearing agencies typically attempt, among other things, to
hedge and liquidate a defaulting member’s positions. Rules of registered clearing agencies also
include information about the allocation of losses across available financial resources.

285

i. Segregation and Portability
No rule under the Exchange Act currently requires a registered clearing agency through
its written policies and procedures to enable the portability of positions of a member’s customers
and the collateral provided in connection therewith. Additionally, no rule under the Exchange
Act currently requires a registered clearing agency through its written policies and procedures to
protect the positions of a member’s customers from the default or insolvency of the member. 643
Since the Commission proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), certain clearing agencies have
modified their policies and procedures on segregation and portability. These amendments include
implementing changes to the structure of customer accounts to enhance segregation options for
customers and establishing new types of individually segregated accounts and omnibus accounts
for cleared transactions, as well as modifications to these frameworks, as well as adopting an
individual client segregation framework and modifications related to the omnibus client
segregation model. 644 There have also been changes specifying certain fees applicable to
segregated customer accounts, margin flow comingled accounts, and individually segregated
sponsored accounts. 645
j. General Business Risk
643

See supra note 434 (discussing existing rules applicable to registered broker-dealers that
address customer security positions and funds in cash securities and listed option markets,
thereby promoting segregation and portability at the broker-dealer level).
644

See, e.g., Exchange Act Release Nos. 34-72755 (Aug. 4, 2014), 79 FR 46481 (Aug. 8,
2014), 34-72754 (Aug.4, 2014), 79 FR46477 (Aug. 8, 2014) (approval orders related to ICE
Clear Europe’s proposed rule changes related to segregation and portability), and 34-73344 (Oct.
14, 2014), 76 FR 62694 (Oct. 20, 2014 ) (notice of filing and immediate effectiveness of
proposed rule change related to segregation and portability).

See, e.g., Exchange Act Release No. 34-75657 (Aug.10, 2015), 80 FR 48937 (Aug. 14,
2015) (notice of filing and immediate effectiveness of ICE Clear Europe’s proposed rule change
to adopt revised fee schedule).

286

Business risk refers to the risks and potential losses arising from a registered clearing
agency’s administration and operation as a business enterprise that are neither related to member
default nor separately covered by financial resources designated to mitigate credit or liquidity
risk. While Rule 17Ad-22 sets forth requirements for registered clearing agencies to identify,
monitor, and mitigate or eliminate a broad array of risks through written policies and procedures,
no rule under the Exchange Act expressly requires a registered clearing agency through its
written policies and procedures to identify, monitor, and manage general business risk or to meet
a capital requirement. Nonetheless, registered clearing agencies currently have certain internal
controls in place to mitigate business risk. Some clearing agencies, for instance, have policies
and procedures that identify an auditor who is responsible for examining accounts, records, and
transactions, as well as other duties prescribed in the audit program. Other registered clearing
agencies allow members to collectively audit the books of the clearing agency on an annual
basis, at their own expense.
Since the Commission proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), certain clearing agencies have revised
their policies and procedures related to general business risk. Such modifications include
amendments to a shareholder agreement that are intended to increase the working capital
available to conduct the business of the operating subsidiaries and allow the clearing agencies to
maintain operations for a longer period during times of financial stress. 646
k. Custody and Investment Risks
Registered clearing agencies face default risk from commercial banks that they use to
effect money transfers among participants, to hold overnight deposits, and to safeguard
646

See Exchange Act Release No. 34-74142 (Jan. 27, 2015), 80 FR 5188 (Jan. 30, 2015)
(notice of no objection to NSCC and FICC advance notices to amend and restate the third and
amended restated shareholders agreement).

287

collateral. Rule 17Ad-22(d)(3) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to (i) hold assets in a
manner that minimizes risk of loss or delay in its access to them; and (ii) invest assets in
instruments with minimal credit, market, and liquidity risks. 647 Registered clearing agencies
currently seek to minimize the risk of loss or delay in access by holding assets that are highly
liquid (e.g., cash, U.S. Treasury securities, or securities issued by a U.S. government agency) and
by engaging banks to custody the assets and facilitate settlement. Typically, registered clearing
agencies take steps to ensure that assets held in custody are protected from claims from the
custodian’s creditors using trust accounts or equivalent arrangements. Additionally, a designated
clearing agency may have or gain access to a Federal Reserve account and services. 648 Since the
Commission proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), certain clearing agencies have made modifications to
the procedures and policies related to custody and investment risks. For example, one clearing
agency adopted rules addressing certain investment losses on margin and guaranty fund
contributions provided by clearing members. 649
l. Operational Risk
Operational risk refers to a broad category of potential losses arising from deficiencies in
internal processes, personnel, and information technology. Registered clearing agencies face
operational risk from both internal and external sources, including human error, system failures,
security breaches, and natural or man-made disasters. Rule 17Ad-22(d)(4) requires a registered
647

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(3).

648

See supra Part II.C.7 (discussing the requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iii)).

See Exchange Act Release No. 34-72551 (July 8, 2014), 79 FR 16361 (July 14, 2014 )

288

clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to identify sources of operational risk and to minimize those risks through
the development of appropriate systems, controls and procedures. 650 It also requires a registered
clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to (i) implement systems that are reliable, resilient, and secure, and have
adequate, scalable capacity; and (ii) have business continuity plans that allow for timely recovery
of operations and fulfillment of a clearing agency’s obligations. 651
As a result, registered clearing agencies have developed and currently maintain plans to
ensure the safeguarding of securities and funds, the integrity of automated data processing
systems, and the recovery of securities, funds, or data under a variety of loss or destruction
scenarios. 652 These plans may include turning operations over to a secondary site that is located
a sufficient distance from the primary location to ensure a distinct geographic risk profile. In
addition, registered clearing agencies generally maintain an internal audit department to review
the adequacy of their internal controls, procedures, and records with respect to operational risks.
Some registered clearing agencies also engage independent accountants to perform an annual
study and evaluation of the internal controls relating to their operations. 653

650

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(4).

651

See id.

652

Many of these practices had been previously developed pursuant to prior Commission
guidelines. See supra Part I.A.4 (discussing related requirements under Regulation SCI).

for Central Counterparties (Nov. 2011), available at http://www.dtcc.com/legal/policy-andcompliance.aspx.

289

As discussed above, the Commission adopted Regulation SCI in November 2014, in part,
to help reduce the occurrence of systems issues, and improve resiliency when systems problems
do occur at certain SROs, such as registered clearing agencies and to enhance the Commission’s
oversight and enforcement of securities market technology infrastructure. Regulation SCI
requires that registered clearing agencies, as SCI entities, have policies and procedures that
include business continuity and disaster recovery plans that include maintaining backup and
recovery capabilities sufficiently resilient and geographically diverse and that are reasonably
designed to achieve two-hour resumption of critical SCI systems following a wide-scale
disruption. In particular, as discussed above, in the Regulation SCI adopting release the
Commission explained its view that for clearance and settlement systems a return to “normal
operations” following a systems disruption would include all steps necessary to effectuate timely
and accurate end of day settlement. 654 Since the Commission proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e),
certain clearing agencies have revised aspects of their operational risk policies and procedures,
including for the purposes of complying with Regulation SCI. For example, one clearing
agency revised its policies and procedures for testing of business continuity and disaster recovery
plans, including with respect to a member’s requirement to participate in such testing. 655
m. Access and Participation Requirements
Rule 17Ad-22(b)(5) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed

654

See supra note 37 and accompanying text.

655

See Exchange Act Release No. 34-76278 (Oct. 27, 2015), 80 FR 67450 (Nov. 2, 2015)
(notice of filing and immediate effectiveness of FICC’s proposed rule change to provide
additional details regarding the requirement that members participate in annual testing of
business continuity and disaster recovery plans).

290

to provide the opportunity for a person that does not perform any dealer or security-based swap
dealer services to obtain membership on fair and reasonable terms at the clearing agency to clear
securities for itself or on behalf of other persons. 656 Rule 17Ad-22(b)(6) requires a registered
clearing agency that provides CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to have membership standards that do not require
participants to maintain a portfolio of any minimum size or a minimum transaction volume. 657
Rule 17Ad-22(b)(7) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to provide a person that maintains net capital equal or greater than $50 million with the ability to
obtain membership at the clearing agency, provided such persons are able to comply with
reasonable membership standards, with higher net capital requirements permissible subject to
Commission approval. 658
In addition, Rule 17Ad-22(d)(2) requires a registered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require
participants to have sufficient financial resources and robust operational capacity to meet
obligations arising from participation in the clearing agency, have procedures in place to monitor
that participation requirements are met on an ongoing basis, and have participation requirements
that are objective and publicly disclosed, and permit fair and open access. 659 Typically, a
registered clearing agency’s rulebook requires applicants for membership to provide certain

financial and operational information prior to being admitted as a member and on an ongoing
basis as a condition of continuing membership. Registered clearing agencies review this
information to ensure that the applicant has the operational capability to meet the other demands
of interfacing with the clearing agency. In particular, registered clearing agencies typically
require that an applicant demonstrate that it has adequate personnel capable of handling
transactions with the clearing agency and adequate physical facilities, books and records, and
procedures to fulfill its anticipated commitments to, and to meet the operational requirements of,
the clearing agency and other members with necessary promptness and accuracy. As a result, an
applicant needs to demonstrate that it has adequate personnel capable of handling transactions
with the clearing agency and adequate physical facilities, books and records, and procedures to
conform to conditions or requirements in these areas that the clearing agency reasonably may
deem necessary for its protection. Registered clearing agencies have published these
requirements on their websites.
Registered clearing agencies use an ongoing monitoring process to help them understand
relevant changes in the financial condition of their members and to mitigate credit risk exposure
of the clearing agency to its members. The risk management staff analyzes financial statements
filed with regulators, as well as information obtained from other SROs and gathered from
various financial publications, so that the clearing agency may evaluate, for instance, whether
members maintain sufficient financial resources and robust operational capacity to meet their
obligations as participants in the clearing agency pursuant to existing Rule 17Ad-22(d)(2)(i).

292

Table 1 contains membership statistics for registered clearing agencies. 660 Current
membership generally reflects features of cleared markets. The decision to become a clearing
member depends on the products being cleared and the structure of these asset markets, as well
as the current state of regulation for cleared markets. For example, the structure of securitybased swap markets and the payoffs to security-based swap contracts differs markedly from that
of equity markets and common stock, which may explain some of the differences between the
concentrated membership of certain clearing agencies and the relatively broader membership of
others.
n. Tiered Participation Arrangements
Tiered participation arrangements occur when clearing members (direct participants)
provide access to clearing services to third parties (indirect participants). No rule under the
Exchange Act currently requires a registered clearing agency through its written policies and
procedures to identify, monitor, and manage material risks arising from tiered participation
arrangements. The Commission understands, however, that certain registered clearing agencies
have policies and procedures currently in place to identify, monitor, or manage such
arrangements. Specifically, such clearing agencies rely on information gathered from, and
distributed by, direct participants to manage these tiered participation arrangements. For
example, under some covered clearing agencies’ rules, direct participants generally have the
responsibility to indicate to the clearing agency whether a transaction submitted for clearing
represents a proprietary or customer position. Such rules further require direct participants to
calculate, and notify the clearing agency of the value of, each customer’s collateral. Direct

660

See supra Part III.A.

293

participants also communicate with indirect participants regarding the clearing agency’s margin
and other requirements.
o. Links
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(7) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to evaluate the
potential sources of risks that can arise when the clearing agency establishes links either crossborder or domestically to clear or settle trades, and ensure that the risks are managed prudently
on an ongoing basis. 661
Each registered clearing agency is linked to other clearing organizations, trading
platforms, and service providers. For instance, a link between U.S. and Canadian clearing
agencies allows U.S. members to clear and settle valued securities transactions with participants
of a Canadian securities depository. The link is designed to facilitate cross-border transactions
by allowing members to use a single depository interface for U.S. and Canadian dollar
transactions and eliminate the need for split inventories. 662 Registered clearing agencies that
provide CCP services currently establish links to allow members to realize collateral and other
operational efficiencies.
p. Efficiency and Effectiveness
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(6) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require the clearing
agency to be cost-effective in meeting the requirements of participants while maintaining safe

661

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(7).

662

See Exchange Act Release No. 52784 (Nov. 16, 2005), 71 FR 70902 (Nov. 23, 2005);
Exchange Act Release No. 55239 (Feb. 5, 2007), 72 FR 6797 (Feb. 13, 2007).

294

and secure operations. 663 Registered clearing agencies have procedures to control costs and to
regularly review pricing levels against operating costs. These clearing agencies may use a
formal budgeting process to control expenditures, and may review pricing levels against their
costs of operation during the annual budget process. Registered clearing agencies also analyze
workflows to make recommendations to improve their operating efficiency.
q. Communication Procedures and Standards
Although no rule under the Exchange Act expressly requires a registered clearing agency
through its written policies and procedures to use or accommodate relevant internationally
accepted communication procedures and standards, the Commission believes that registered
clearing agencies already use these standards. Registered clearing agencies typically rely on
electronic communication with market participants, including members. For example, some
registered clearing agencies have rules in place stating that clearing members must retrieve
instructions, notices, reports, data, and other items and information from the clearing agency
through electronic data retrieval systems. Some registered clearing agencies have the ability to
rely on signatures transmitted, recorded, or stored through electronic, optical, or similar means.
Other clearing agencies have policies and procedures that provide for certain emergency
meetings using telephonic or other electronic notice.
r. Disclosure
Disclosures by registered clearing agencies serve to limit the size of potential information
asymmetries between registered clearing agencies, their members, and market participants. Rule
17Ad-22(d)(9) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide market participants with
663

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(6).

295

sufficient information for them to identify and evaluate risks and costs associated with using the
clearing agency’s services. 664 Information regarding the operations and services of each
registered clearing agency can be viewed publicly either on the clearing agency’s website or a
website maintained by an affiliate of the clearing agency. Because a registered clearing agency
is an SRO, 665 it must file with the Commission any proposed rule or any proposed change in,
addition to, or deletion from its rules, and the Commission reviews all proposed rule changes and
publishes them for comment. 666 Proposed rule changes also are available for public viewing on
each clearing agency’s website.
Besides providing market participants with information on the risks and costs associated
with their services, registered clearing agencies regularly provide information to their members
to assist them in managing their risk exposures and potential funding obligations. Some of these
disclosures may be common to all members—such as information about the composition of
clearing fund assets—while other disclosures that concern particular positions or obligations may
only be made to individual members.
Finally, the Commission notes that most registered clearing agencies currently publish on
their websites their responses to the PFMI quantitative disclosures. 667 These disclosures are to
be updated semi-annually.

664

B. Consideration of Benefits, Costs, and the Effect on Competition, Efficiency, and
Capital Formation
The discussion below sets forth the potential economic effects stemming from the
adopted rules. The section begins by framing more general economic issues related to the
amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and Rule 17Ab2-2. The discussion that follows considers the
effects of the rules on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. The section ends with a
discussion of the benefits and costs flowing from specific provisions of the amendments to Rule
17Ad-22 and Rule 17Ab2-2.
1. General Economic Considerations
This section considers potential impacts of the amendments, as a whole, through their
effects on systemic risk, the discretion with which covered clearing agencies operate, market
integrity, concentration in the market for clearing services and among clearing members, and
QCCP status.
a. Systemic Risk
A large portion of financial activity in the United States ultimately flows through one or
more registered clearing agencies that would become covered clearing agencies under the
amendments to Rule 17Ad-22. These clearing agencies have direct links to members and
indirect links to the customers of members. They are also linked to each other through common
members, operational processes, and in some cases cross-margining and cross-guaranty
agreements. These linkages allow covered clearing agencies to provide opportunities for risksharing but also allow them to serve as potential conduits for risk transmission. Covered clearing
agencies play an important role in fostering the proper functioning of financial markets. If they

297

are not effectively managed, however, they may transmit financial shocks to other financial
market participants through their responses to clearing member default.
The centralization of clearance and settlement activities at covered clearing agencies
allows market participants to reduce costs, increase operational efficiency, and manage risks
more effectively. 668 While providing benefits to market participants, the concentration of these
activities at a covered clearing agency implicitly exposes market participants to the risks faced
by covered clearing agencies themselves, making risk management at covered clearing agencies
a key element of systemic risk mitigation.
b. Discretion
The Commission recognizes that the degree of discretion permitted by the amendments to
Rule 17Ad-22 partially determines their economic effect. Even where current practices at
covered clearing agencies would not need to change significantly to comply with the rules, as
adopted, covered clearing agencies could still potentially face costs associated with the
limitations on discretion that will result from the rules, including costs related to limiting a
clearing agency’s flexibility to respond to changing economic environments. For example, to the
extent that covered clearing agencies currently in compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e) value the
ability to periodically allow net liquid assets to drop below the minimum level specified by the
rules, they may incur additional costs because under Rule 17Ad-22(e) they lose the option to do
so.
Although there may be costs to limiting the degree of discretion covered clearing
agencies have over risk management policies and procedures, the Commission believes there are
also potential benefits. As discussed above, clearing agencies may not fully internalize the social
668

Cf. PFMI, supra note 2, at 9.

298

costs of poor internal controls and thus, given additional discretion, may not craft appropriate
risk management policies and procedures. For example, even if existing regulation provides
clearing agencies with the incentives necessary to manage risks appropriately in a static sense,
they may not provide clearing agencies with incentives to update their risk management
programs in response to dynamic market conditions. Additionally, efforts at cost reduction or
profit maximization could encourage clearing agencies to reduce the quality of risk management
by, for example, choosing to update parameters and assumptions rapidly in periods of low
volatility while maintaining stale parameters and assumptions in periods of high volatility. By
reducing covered clearing agencies’ discretion over their policies and procedures, the
amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 may reduce the likelihood that risk management practices lag
behind changing market conditions by requiring periodic analysis of model performance while
paying particular attention to periods of high volatility or low liquidity.
Subjecting covered clearing agencies to more specific requirements may have other
benefits for cleared markets as well. Academic research has explored the ways in which
regulation affects liquidity in financial markets when participants are “ambiguity averse,” where
ambiguity is defined as uncertainty over the set of payoff distributions for an asset. 669 Such
investors may heavily weigh worst-case scenarios when they decide whether to hold the asset.
The Commission believes that regulation aimed at enhancing standards for covered clearing
agencies while reducing their discretion may reduce the ambiguity associated with holding

669

See e.g., Itzhak Gilboa & David Schmeidler, Maxmin Expected Utility with Non-Unique
Prior, 18 J. Mathematical Econ. 141 (1989) (proposing an axiomatic foundation of a decision
rule based on maximizing expected minimum payoff of a strategy).

299

cleared assets in the presence of credit risk and settlement risk 670 and thus may allow investors to
rule out worst-case states of the world. In this regard, more specific rules may encourage
participation in cleared markets by investors that benefit from resulting risk-sharing
opportunities. 671
c. Market Integrity
The Commission believes that the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 could provide the
benefit of reduced potential for market fragmentation that may arise from different requirements
across regulatory regimes. These benefits would flow to markets that are also supervised by the
CFTC and FRB, and internationally, since cleared markets are global in nature and linked to one
another through common participants.
Failure to maintain consistency with other regulators may disrupt cleared markets in a
number of ways. Significant differences across regulatory regimes may encourage participants
to restructure their operations to avoid a particular regulatory regime. 672 Such differences may
reduce the liquidity of cleared products in certain markets if they result in an undersupply of

670

Specifically, by performing key roles in the transaction process, clearing agencies serve
to maintain higher minimum payoffs in poor states of the world, by, for example, immobilizing
securities or adopting DVP systems.
671

See e.g., David Easley & Maureen O’Hara, Microstructure and Ambiguity, 65 J. Fin.
1817 (2010) (using a theoretical model of trade on venues that differ in rules, the authors show
how rules that reduce market-related ambiguity may induce a participatory equilibrium).
672

See, e.g., Arnoud W.A. Boot, Silva Dezõelan, & Todd T. Milbourn, Regulatory
Distortions in a Competitive Financial Services Industry, 16 J. Fin. Serv. Res. 249 (2000)
(showing that, in a simple industrial organization model of bank lending, a change in the cost of
capital resulting from regulation results in a greater loss of profits when regulated banks face
competition from non-regulated banks than when regulations apply equally to all competitors);
Victor Fleischer, Regulatory Arbitrage, 89 Tex. L. Rev. 227 (2010) (discussing how, when
certain firms are able to choose their regulatory structure, regulatory costs are shifted onto those
entities that cannot engage in regulatory arbitrage).

300

clearing services. Further, inconsistency in regulation across jurisdictions may increase the
likelihood that restructuring by market participants in response such inconsistency results in
concentrating clearing activity in regimes with a weaker commitment to policies and procedures
for sound risk management. Differences across regulatory regimes could also affect the products
that a clearing agency chooses to clear. In turn, a shift in product choice could result in more
concentrated liquidity for certain markets.
In the case of clearing agency standards, there are additional motivations for consistency
with other regulatory requirements. The Commission believes that such consistency would
prevent the application of inconsistent regulation and thereby reduce the likelihood that
participants in cleared markets would restructure and operate in less-regulated markets.
Additionally, such consistency would allow foreign bank clearing members and foreign bank
customers of clearing members of covered clearing agencies to be subject to lower capital
requirements under the BCBS capital framework. 673
Based on its consultation and coordination with other regulators, the Commission
believes Rule 17Ad-22(e) is consistent and comparable, where possible and appropriate, with the
rules and policy statement adopted by the FRB and the rules adopted by the CFTC, as well as the
headline principles in the PFMI. The Commission’s rules differ from those requirements
adopted by the CFTC and FRB in terms of the specific portions of the key considerations and
explanatory text in the PFMI that are, or are not, referenced or emphasized.
Further, CPMI-IOSCO members are also in various stages of implementing the standards
in the PFMI into their own regulatory regimes, and the Commission believes that adopting a set

diminished likelihood that participants in cleared markets would restructure and operate in lessregulated markets. 674 Additionally, international standards such as the BCBS capital framework
could create complications for U.S. clearing agencies not subject to regulations based on the
PFMI as a result of the BCBS capital framework’s treatment of QCCPs. In particular, if U.S.
clearing agencies do not obtain QCCP status from foreign banking regulators who have adopted
rules conforming to the BCBS capital framework because, for instance, the regulatory
framework is not consistent with the PFMI, foreign bank members of U.S. clearing agencies may
have incentives to move their clearing business to clearing agencies in jurisdictions where they
might obtain lower capital requirements under the BCBS capital framework. 675
d. Concentration
The economic effects associated with the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 may also be
partially determined by the economic characteristics of clearing agencies. Generally, the
economic characteristics of FMIs, including clearing agencies, include specialization, economies
of scale, barriers to entry, and a limited number of competitors. 676 Such characteristics, coupled
with the particulars of an FMI’s legal mandate, could result in market power, leading to lower
levels of service, higher prices, and under-investment in risk management systems. 677
The centralization of clearing activities in a relatively small number of clearing agencies
somewhat insulated from market forces may result in a reduction in their incentives to innovate

and to invest in the development of appropriate risk management practices on an ongoing
basis, 678 particularly when combined with the cost reduction pressures noted previously. 679
However, the Commission notes that the inverse may not necessarily hold. In other words,
additional competition in the market for clearing services may not necessarily result in improved
risk management. For instance, aggressive price-cutting in a “race to the bottom” may result in
clearing agencies accepting lower-quality collateral, requiring lower margin and default fund
contributions, lowering access requirements, or holding lower reserves, potentially undermining
their risk management efforts. 680
Market power may raise particular issues with respect to the allocation of benefits and
costs flowing from these amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and precipitate changes in the structure
of the financial networks that are served by covered clearing agencies. For example, as a result
of limited competition, 681 existing covered clearing agencies may easily pass the incremental

678

The Commission notes that this result depends on the relationship between the cost of
innovations in risk management and the private benefits to a clearing agency in terms of reduced
default risk. Absent competitive pressures, a clearing agency may nevertheless invest in the
development of risk management practices so long as the marginal benefits of risk reduction
exceed the marginal cost.

costs associated with enhanced standards on to their members, who may share these costs with
their customers, potentially resulting in increased transaction costs in cleared securities.
If incremental increases in costs lead clearing agencies to charge higher prices for their
services, then certain clearing members may choose to terminate membership and cease to clear
transactions for their customers. Should this situation occur, the result may be further
concentration among clearing members, where each remaining member clears a higher volume
of transactions. In this case, clearing agencies and the financial markets they serve would be
more exposed to these larger clearing members. Moreover, customers would have fewer
resources or options for obtaining such services, clearing agencies would have fewer nondefaulting members to take on defaulting members portfolios, and clearing agencies that rely on
clearing members to participate in default auctions would hold auctions with fewer participants.
The remaining clearing members may, however, each internalize more of the costs their activity
in cleared markets imposes on the financial system.
The increased importance of a small set of clearing members, in turn, may result in firms
not previously systemically important increasing in systemic importance. This is particularly

(concluding in part that the core services offered by the clearance and settlement industry tend
toward natural monopolies because the industry can be characterized as a network industry,
where consumers buy systems rather than single goods, consumption externalities exist, costs
lock-in consumers once they choose a system, and production improves with economies of
scale); Heiko Schmiedel, Markku Malkamäki & Juha Tarkka, Economies of Scale and

true for clearing members that participate in multiple markets, both cleared and not cleared. 682
However, adequate regulation of capital levels and margin amounts at surviving clearing
members could mean that, though shocks to these members may be larger, the propagation of
shocks may be limited to a smaller set of entities and their equity holders.
e. QCCP Status and Externalities on Clearing Members
An effect of the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 is that covered clearing agencies required
to comply with the adopted rules may be more likely to qualify as QCCPs in non-U.S.
jurisdictions that have adopted the BCBS capital framework’s QCCP definition. Under the
BCBS capital framework, a QCCP is defined as an entity operating as a CCP that is prudentially
supervised in a jurisdiction where the relevant regulator has established, and publicly indicated
that it applies to the CCP on an ongoing basis, domestic rules and regulations that are consistent
with the PFMI. 683 Because the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 are consistent with the PFMI, the
Commission believes that foreign bank clearing members of certain covered clearing agencies
and foreign banks clearing indirectly through clearing members of covered clearing agencies
may benefit from covered clearing agencies obtaining QCCP status. In particular, bank clearing
members and bank indirect participants of covered clearing agencies that could attain QCCP
status would face lower capital requirements with respect to cleared derivatives and repurchase
agreement transactions because, under the BCBS capital framework, capital requirements for
bank exposures to QCCPs are lower than capital requirements for bank exposures to non-

682

counterparty risk concentrated within CCPs may be transferred to the broader financial system
through links between clearing members and their clients).

305

qualifying CCPs for these products. Although the FRB and the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency have already adopted rules implementing the BCBS capital framework that would
identify all covered clearing agencies (with the exception of ICEEU) as QCCPs for the purposes
of applying risk weights to assets at U.S. banks, 684 the adopted amendments to Rule 17Ad-22
may result in non-U.S. bank clearing members experiencing lower capital requirements related to
exposures against covered clearing agencies relative to a baseline scenario in which foreign
banking regulators do not determine that a covered clearing agency is a QCCP. 685
The BCBS capital framework affects capital requirements for bank exposures to central
counterparties in two important ways. The first relates to trade exposures, defined under the
BCBS capital framework as the current and potential future exposure of a clearing member or
indirect participant in a CCP arising from OTC derivatives, exchange-traded derivatives
transactions, and securities financing transactions. If these exposures are held against a QCCP,
they will be assigned a risk weight of 2%. In contrast, exposures against non-qualifying CCPs
do not receive lower capital requirements relative to bilateral exposures and are assigned risk
weights between 20% and 100%, depending on counterparty credit risk. Second, the BCBS
capital framework imposes a cap on risk weights applied to default fund contributions, limiting
risk-weighted assets (subject to a 1250% risk weight) to a cap of 20% of a clearing member’s
trade exposures against a QCCP. This is in contrast to treatment of exposures against nonqualifying CCPs, which are uncapped and subject to a 1250% risk weight. Because QCCP status
generally impacts capital treatment, any benefits of attaining QCCP status will likely accrue, at
684

See infra Part III.B.1.e.

685

The Commission notes that benefits to banks that may arise as a result of the rules may
be contingent upon regulators in other jurisdictions taking action to recognize the QCCP status of
covered clearing agencies.

306

least in part, to foreign clearing members or foreign indirect participants subject to the BCBS
capital framework. 686 As a result of lower risk weights applied to exposures and a cap on capital
requirements against default fund obligations, clearing members of QCCPs subject to BCBS
capital framework may experience an improved capital position relative to bank members of
non-QCCPs. This may lower funding costs for bank members of QCCPs. 687
Non-U.S. banks that are constrained by BCBS tier one capital requirements would face a
shock to risk-weighted assets once capital rules come into force. 688 The size of the shock
depends on regulators’ determinations with regard to QCCP status. Regardless of the size of the
shock and to come into compliance with capital rules, however, affected banks will have to raise
capital or reduce leverage. In the absence of perfect markets, these banks may incur ongoing
costs as a result.
In quantifying the benefits of achieving QCCP status, the Commission based its estimate
on publicly available information with regard to OCC. 689 To estimate the upper bound for the

686

For a discussion of the effects of QCCP status on competition between bank and nonbank clearing members, see Part III.B.2.a.

687

See supra note 597 (noting that the Commission currently expects the lower capital
treatment under the BCBS capital framework to affect registered clearing agencies FICC,
ICEEU, and OCC, each of which would meet the definition of a “covered clearing agency”).
688

As discussed above, the FRB and Office of Comptroller of the Currency have adopted
rules implementing capital requirements under the BCBS capital framework that make capital
treatment for exposures to CCPs independent of the adopted rules for U.S. banks regulated by
these two agencies, and therefore the Commission believes no benefits would accrue to U.S.
bank clearing members of FICC and OCC.
689

Under the BCBS capital framework, ICCEU and FICC’s repurchase agreement segment
would also be eligible for QCCP status. However, FICC does not report counterparties to repo
agreements, and ICEEU does not separately report exposures related to security-based swap
clearing, so we are currently unable to quantify potential benefits related to QCCP status for
these entities.

307

potential benefits accruing to bank clearing members at OCC as a result of QCCP status, the
Commission identified a sample of 28 bank clearing members at OCC and, for each bank,
collected information about total assets, risk weighted assets, net income and tier one capital
ratio at the holding company level for 2015. 690 The Commission then allocated trade exposures
and default fund exposures across the sample of bank clearing members based on the level of
risk-weighted assets. 691 The Commission measured the impact on risk-weighted assets for nonU.S. bank clearing members under two different capital treatment regimes. The first regime is in
the absence of QCCP status, assuming a 100% risk weight applied to trade exposures and 1250%
risk weight applied to default fund exposures for non-U.S. members. In the second regime, OCC
obtains QCCP status, and banks are allowed to apply a 2% risk weight applied to trade exposures
and a 1250% risk weight to default fund exposures up to a total exposure cap of 20% of trade

690

The Commission used the set of entities it identified as banks on OCC’s member list,
available at http://www.optionsclearing.com/membership/member-information/. For U.S. bank
holding companies, 2015 total assets, risk weighted assets, net income, and tier 1 capital ratios
were collected from Y-9C reports available at the National Information Center,
https://www.ffiec.gov/nicpubweb/nicweb/nichome.aspx. For non-U.S. bank holding companies,
Commission staff obtained corresponding data from financial statements and supplementary
financial materials posted to bank websites. Where necessary, values were converted back to
U.S. dollars at December 31, 2015 exchange rates obtained from the Federal Reserve, available
at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/hist/.
691

For example, one bank in the sample, with 5.53% of total risk-weighted assets, was
assigned 5.53% of the total trade and default fund exposures while another bank in the sample,
with 4.21% of total risk weighted assets, was assigned 4.21% of these exposures. Because trade
exposures of OCC members against OCC are nonpublic, the Commission used the balance of
OCC margin deposits and deposits in lieu of margin held at OCC, $73.54 billion, as a proxy for
trade exposures. OCC’s 2015 clearing fund deposits were valued at $12.08 billion. See OCC,
2015 Annual Report, available at
http://www.optionsclearing.com/components/docs/about/annual-reports/occ-2015-annualreport.pdf.

308

exposures. 692 If OCC is determined to be a QCCP, then the increase in risk weighted assets will
be smaller in magnitude, implying a smaller adjustment at lower cost. The Commission
estimates that benefits associated with OCC obtaining QCCP status stemming from lower capital
requirements against trade exposures to QCCPs as a result of the adopted rules to have an upper
bound of $1.2 billion per year, or approximately 0.73% of the total 2015 net income reported by
the sample of bank clearing members at OCC.
The Commission’s analysis is limited in several respects and relies on several
assumptions. First, a limitation of our proxy for trade exposures and our use of OCC’s clearing
fund is that the account balances include deposits by bank clearing members, who would
experience lower capital requirements under the BCBS capital framework, and non-bank
clearing members who would not. The Commission assumes, for the purposes of establishing an
upper bound for the benefits to market participants that are associated with QCCP status for
OCC under the adopted rules, that the balance of both OCC’s margin account and OCC’s default
fund are attributable only to bank clearing members. Additionally, we assume an extreme case
where, in the absence of QCCP status, trade exposures against a CCP would be assigned a 100%
risk weight, causing the largest possible shock to risk-weighted assets for affected banks.
Lower capital requirements on trade exposures to OCC would produce effects in the real
economy only under certain conditions. First, agency problems, taxes, or other capital market
imperfections could result in banks targeting a particular capital structure. Second, capital
692

The BCBS capital framework allows banks to compute default fund exposures in two
ways. Method 1 involves computing capital requirements for each member proportional to its
share of an aggregate capital requirement for all clearing members in a scenario where to average
clearing members default. The Commission currently lacks data necessary to compute default
fund exposures under this approach, instead we use Method 2, which caps overall exposure to a
QCCP at 20% of trade exposures. See BCBS capital framework, supra note 44, Annex 4, paras.
121–25 (outlining two methods for computing default fund exposures).

309

constraints on bank clearing members subject to the BCBS capital framework must bind so that
higher capital requirements on bank clearing members subject to the BCBS capital framework in
the absence of QCCP status would cause these banks to exceed capital constraints if they chose
to redistribute capital to shareholders or invest capital in projects with returns that exceed their
cost of capital. Using publicly available data, however, it is not currently possible to determine
whether capital constraints will bind for bank clearing members when rules applying the BCBS
capital framework come into force, so to estimate an upper bound for the effects of QCCP status
on bank clearing members we assume that tier one capital constraints for all bank clearing
members of OCC would bind in an environment with zero weight placed on bank exposures to
CCPs. 693
For the purposes of quantifying potential benefits from QCCP status, the Commission has
also assumed that banks choose to adjust to new capital requirements by deleveraging. In
particular, the Commission assumed that banks would respond by reducing risk-weighted assets
equally across all risk classes until they reach the minimum tier one capital ratio under the Basel
framework of 8.5%. We measure the ongoing costs to each non-U.S. bank by multiplying the

693

The Commission notes that, at present, no bank in its sample of bank clearing members
of OCC is bound by capital requirements under the BCBS capital framework. For U.S. bank
holding companies, tier 1 capital ratios were collected from Y-9C reports available at the
National Information Center, https://www.ffiec.gov/nicpubweb/nicweb/nichome.aspx. For nonU.S. bank holding companies, Commission staff obtained corresponding data from financial
statements and supplementary financial materials posted to bank websites. The Commission
used data from 2013–2016 for its sample of U.S. bank clearing members, and from 2012–2015
for its sample of non-U.S. bank clearing members and assumed no bank-specific countercyclical
capital buffers for these banks. This suggests a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 10.1%, exceeding
the BCBS minimum by 1.6%.

310

implied change in total assets by each bank’s return on assets, estimated using up to 14 years of
annual financial statement data. 694
The BCBS capital requirements for exposures to CCPs yield additional benefits for
QCCPs that the Commission is currently unable to quantify due to lack of data concerning client
clearing arrangements by banks. For client exposures to clearing members, the BCBS capital
framework allows participants to reflect the shorter close-out period of cleared transactions in
their capitalized exposures. The BCBS framework’s treatment of exposures to CCPs also applies
to client exposures to CCPs through clearing members. This may increase the likelihood that
bank clients of bank clearing members that are subject to the BCBS capital framework share
some of the benefits of QCCP status.
Furthermore, the fact that the BCBS capital framework applies to bank clearing members
may have important implications for competition and concentration. While Rule 17Ad-22(e)
may extend lower capital requirements against exposures to CCPs to non-U.S. bank clearing
members of covered clearing agencies, 695 the benefits of QCCP status will still be limited to
bank clearing members. However, the costs associated with compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)
may be borne by all clearing members, regardless of whether or not they are supervised as banks.
A potential consequence of this allocation of costs and benefits may be “crowding out” of
members of QCCPs that are not banks and will not experience benefits with respect to the BCBS
capital framework. This may result in an unintended consequence of increased concentration of
694

This data has been taken from Compustat and from publicly available financial
statements. Due to data limitations, for certain banks a shorter window was used for this
calculation. The minimum sample window was six years.

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would treat covered clearing agencies as QCCPs for
the purposes of calculating regulatory capital ratios).

311

clearing activity among bank clearing members. As noted in Part III.B.1.d, this increased
concentration could mean that each remaining clearing member becomes more important from
the standpoint of systemic risk transmission.
In addition to benefits for bank clearing members, certain benefits resulting from QCCP
status may also accrue to covered clearing agencies. If banks value lower capital requirements
attributable to QCCP status, bank clearing members may prefer membership at QCCPs to
membership at CCPs that are not QCCPs. A flight of clearing members from covered clearing
agencies in the absence of QCCP status would result in default-related losses being mutualized
across a narrower member base. Additionally, if the flight from covered clearing agencies
results in lower transactional volume at these clearing agencies, then economies of scale may be
lost, resulting in higher clearing fees and higher transaction costs in cleared products.
2. Effect on Competition, Efficiency, and Capital Formation
The amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and Rule 17Ab2-2 have the potential to affect
competition, efficiency, and capital formation. As with the rest of the benefits and costs
associated with the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22, the Commission believes that several of the
effects described below only occur to the extent that covered clearing agencies do not already
have operations and governance mechanisms that conform to the requirements in Rule 17Ad22(e). Additionally, the Commission believes that consistency with international regulatory
frameworks, as embodied by the PFMI, which may promote the integrity of cleared markets,
could have substantial effects on competition, efficiency, and capital formation.
a. Competition
Two important characteristics of the market for clearance and settlement services are high
fixed costs and economies of scale. Large investments in risk management and information

312

technology infrastructure costs, such as financial data database and network maintenance
expenses, are components of high fixed costs for clearing agencies. Consequently, the clearance
and settlement industry exhibits economies of scale in that the average total cost per transaction,
which includes fixed costs, diminishes with the increase in transaction volume as high fixed
costs are spread over a larger number of transactions.
Furthermore, high fixed costs translate into barriers to entry that preclude competition.
Lower competition is an important source of market power for clearing agencies. As a result,
clearing agencies possess the ability to exert market power and influence the fees charged for
clearance and settlement services in the markets they serve. 696 Any costs resulting from the
adopted amendments may have the effect of raising already high barriers to entry. As the
potential entry of new clearing agencies becomes more remote, existing clearing agencies may
be able to reduce service quality, restrict the supply of services, or increase fees above marginal
cost in an effort to earn economic rents from participants in cleared markets. 697
Even if they could not take advantage of a marginal increase in market power, clearing
agencies may use their market power to pass any increases in costs that flow from the adopted
amendments to their members. This may be especially true in the cases of member-owned
clearing agencies, such as DTC, FICC, NSCC, and OCC, where members lack the opportunity to
pass costs through to outside equity holders. Allowing clearing members to serve on the board
of directors of a covered clearing agency may align a covered clearing agency’s incentives with
its membership. Certain complications may also arise, however, when clearing members sit on
boards of covered clearing agencies as members of the board and may choose to allocate the
696

See, e.g., CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29593.

697

See id.

313

costs of enhanced risk management inefficiently across potential competitors, in an effort to
reduce their own share of these costs.
Members who are forced to internalize the costs of additional requirements under
Rule17Ad-22(e) may seek to terminate their membership. Additionally, prospective clearing
members may find it difficult to join clearing agencies, given the additional costs they must
internalize. 698 Remaining clearing members may gain market power as a result, enabling them to
extract economic rents from their customers. Rent extraction could take the form of higher
transaction costs in cleared markets, thereby reducing efficiency, as discussed below.
The Commission also acknowledges that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) may affect competition
among firms that choose to become clearing members, and those who provide clearing services
indirectly, through a clearing member. Monitoring and managing the risks associated with
indirect participation in clearing may be costly. If monitoring and managing the risks associated
with indirect participation in clearing proves costly for clearing agencies and if clearing agencies
are able to pass the additional costs related to monitoring and managing risks to clearing
members, it may cause marginal clearing members unable to absorb these additional costs to
exit. While these exits may be socially efficient, since they reflect the internalization of costs
otherwise imposed upon other participants in cleared markets through increased probability of
clearing agency default, they may nevertheless result in lower competition among clearing
members for market share, potentially providing additional market power to the clearing
members that remain. Exits by clearing members could also reduce the resources available for
customers to obtain replacement clearing services.
698

See supra Part III.B.1.d (discussing concentration both in the market for clearing services
and among clearing members).

314

The Commission believes, however, that management of risks from indirect participation
is important in mitigating the risks that clearing agencies pose to financial stability. The tiered
participation risk exposures, including credit, liquidity, and operational risks inherent in indirect
participation arrangements, may present risks to clearing agencies, their members, and to the
broader financial markets. For instance, if the size of an indirect participant’s positions is large
relative to a clearing member’s capacity to absorb risks, this may increase the clearing member’s
default risk. Consequently, a clearing agency with indirect participation arrangements may be
exposed to the credit risk of an indirect participant through its clearing members. Similarly, a
margin call on, or a default by, an indirect participant could constrain liquidity of its associated
clearing members, making it more difficult for these members to manage their positions at the
clearing agency.
The consistency across regulatory frameworks contemplated by the adopted rules may
also affect competition. Financial markets in cleared products are global, encompassing many
countries and regulatory jurisdictions. Consistency with international regulatory frameworks
may facilitate entry of clearing agencies into new markets. By contrast, conflicting or
duplicative regulation across jurisdictions, or even within jurisdictions, may cause competitive
friction that inhibits entry and helps clearing agencies behave like local monopolists.
Consistency in regulation can facilitate competition among clearing agencies so long as
regulation is not so costly as to discourage participation in any market. Additionally, the
Commission believes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) may facilitate competition among clearing
agencies across jurisdictions by requiring public disclosures that enable market participants to
compare clearing agencies more easily.

315

The consistency across regulatory requirements contemplated by the adopted rules may
affect competition among banks in particular. Clearing derivative and repurchase agreement
transactions through QCCPs will result in lower capital requirements for banks under the BCBS
capital framework. Therefore, consistency with the PFMI may allow banks that clear these
products through covered clearing agencies to compete on equal terms with banks that clear
through other clearing agencies accorded QCCP status. This effect potentially countervails
higher barriers to entry that enhanced risk management standards may impose on clearing
members by lowering the marginal cost of clearing these transactions. Furthermore, covered
clearing agencies potentially compete with one another for volume from clearing members.
Since clearing members receive better treatment for exposures against QCCPs, clearing members
will find it less costly to deal with QCCPs. Failure to establish requirements consistent with the
PFMI may place U.S. covered clearing agencies at a competitive disadvantage globally.
The ability of covered clearing agencies to obtain QCCP status may also affect
competition among clearing agencies. Under the BCBS capital framework, QCCP status would
have practical relevance only for covered clearing agencies providing CCP services for
derivatives, security-based swaps, and securities financing transactions. To the extent that the
adopted rules increase the likelihood that banking regulators that have implemented the BCBS
capital framework in their jurisdiction recognize covered clearing agencies as QCCPs, banks that
clear at covered clearing agencies will experience lower capital requirements. Since clearing
agencies may compete for volume from clearing members that are also banks, the adopted rules
may remove a competitive friction between covered clearing agencies and other clearing
agencies that enjoy recognition as QCCPs by banking regulators. As a corollary, the adopted
rules could potentially disadvantage any registered clearing agencies that are not covered

316

clearing agencies. 699 The Commission also notes that the ability of registered clearing agencies
to voluntarily apply for covered clearing agency status under Rule 17Ab2-2(a) may potentially
allow entrants to achieve QCCP status if the Commission determines they should receive
covered clearing agency status and they otherwise meet the requirements of the BCBS capital
framework.
Further competitive effects may flow from the adoption as a result of the determinations
under Rule 17Ab2-2 for clearing agencies engaged in activities with a more complex risk profile
and clearing agencies that are systemically important in multiple jurisdictions. These entities
will be responsible for maintaining additional financial resources sufficient to cover the default
of the two participant families that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposures
in extreme but plausible market conditions as well as undertake an annual feasibility analysis for
extending liquidity risk management from “cover one” to “cover two.” These clearing agencies
will have to collect these resources from participants, either through higher margin requirements
or guaranty fund contributions, or indirectly through third-party borrowing arrangements secured
by member resources. Regardless of how clearing agencies obtain these additional resources, the
requirement to do so potentially raises the costs to use services provided by covered clearing
agencies. Moreover, these additional costs could raise barriers to entry in the market or to opt
out of clearing altogether.
b. Efficiency

699

See supra note 597 (noting that the Commission currently expects the lower capital
treatment under the BCBS capital framework to affect registered clearing agencies FICC,
ICEEU, and OCC, each of which would meet the definition of a “covered clearing agency” in
Rule 17Ad-22(a)(5)).

317

The amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 may affect efficiency in a number of ways, though as
discussed previously, most of these effects will only flow to the extent that covered clearing
agencies do not already comply with the amendments. First, because the amendments result in
general consistency with the PFMI and requirements adopted by the CFTC and FRB, consistency
likely fosters efficiency by reducing the risk that covered clearing agencies will be faced with
conflicting or duplicative regulation when clearing financial products across multiple regulatory
jurisdictions.
Consistency across regulatory regimes in multiple markets may also result in efficiency
improvements. Fully integrated markets would allow clearing agencies to more easily exploit
economies of scale because clearing agencies tend to have low marginal costs and, thus, could
provide clearance and settlement services over a larger volume of transactions at a lower average
cost. Differences in regulation, on the other hand, may result in market fragmentation, allowing
clearing agencies to operate as local monopolists. The resulting potential for segmentation of
clearing and settlement businesses along jurisdictional lines may lead to overinvestment in the
provision of clearing services and reductions in efficiency as clearing agencies open and operate
solely within jurisdictional boundaries. If market segmentation precludes covered clearing
agencies from clearing transactions for customers located in another jurisdiction with a market
too small to support a local clearing agency, fragmentation may result in under-provisioning of
clearing and settlement services in these areas, in turn reducing the efficiency with which market
participants share risk.
The amendments may also affect efficiency directly if they mitigate covered clearing
agencies’ incentives to underinvest in risk management and recovery and wind-down procedures.
CCP default and liquidation is likely a costly event, so to the extent that the rules mitigate the

318

risk of CCP default and prescribe rules for orderly recovery and wind-down, they will produce
efficiency benefits. Another direct effect on efficiency may come if registered clearing agencies
attempt to restructure their operations in ways that would allow them to fall outside of the scope
of Rule 17Ad-22(e).
Finally, price efficiency and the efficiency of risk sharing among market participants may
be affected by the amendments. On one hand, the cost of a transaction includes costs related to
counterparty default that are typically unrelated to fundamental asset payoffs. Academic
research using credit default swap transaction data has revealed a statistically significant, though
economically small, relationship between the credit risk of a counterparty and the spreads
implicit in transaction prices. 700 Enhanced risk management by clearing agencies may reduce
this component of transaction costs. By reducing deviations of prices from fundamental value,
the amendments may increase price efficiency. If lower transaction costs or reduced ambiguity
facilitates participation in cleared markets by investors who would benefit from opportunities for
risk-sharing in these markets, 701 then this transmission channel may result in more efficient
allocation of risk. On the other hand, the amendments may have adverse implications for price
efficiency in cleared markets if they drive up transaction costs as higher costs of risk

700

See e.g., Navneet Arora, Priyank Gandhi & Francis Longstaff, Counterparty Credit Risk
and the Credit Default Swap Market, 103 J. Fin. Econ. 280 (2012). Using transaction prices and
quotes by 14 different CDS dealers, the authors identified how dealers’ credit risk affects
transaction prices. They observed a relationship between spreads and credit risk implying that a
645-basis-point increase in a dealer’s credit spread would produce a one-basis-point increase in
transaction prices. They explain the magnitude of this relationship by noting that their sample
included transactions that were mostly collateralized, which would diminish the sensitivity of
transaction prices to counterparty credit risk.
701

If investors who might benefit from risk-sharing in cleared markets are ambiguity-averse,
then regulation that addresses payoffs in times of financial strain may induce their participation.

management enter asset prices. An increase in transaction costs could cause certain market
participants to avoid trading altogether, reducing liquidity in cleared products and opportunities
for risk sharing among investors in these markets.
c. Capital Formation
The implications for capital formation that flow from the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22
and Rule 17Ab2-2 stem mainly from incremental costs that result from compliance with more
specific standards and benefits in the form of more efficient risk sharing.
In cases where current practice falls short of the amendments, covered clearing agencies
may have to invest in infrastructure or make other expenditures to come into compliance, which
may divert capital from other uses. In line with our previous discussion of cost allocation in the
market for clearing services, these resources may come from clearing members and their
customers. 702
At the same time, the Commission believes that the standards contemplated under the
rules may foster capital formation. As mentioned earlier, clearing agencies that are less prone to
failure may help reduce transaction costs in the markets they clear. 703 Conceptually, the
component of transaction costs that reflects counterparty credit risk insures one counterparty
against the default of another. 704 Reductions in counterparty default risk allow the corresponding
portion of transaction costs to be allocated to more productive uses by market participants who
otherwise would bear these costs.

702

See supra Part III.B.1 (discussing the economic effects of the rules on the market for
clearing services).
703

See supra Part III.B.1.a (discussing the economic effects of the rules on systemic risk).

704

See supra note 700.

320

If, on balance, the adopted amendments cause transaction costs to decrease in cleared
markets, then the expected value of trade may increase. Counterparties that are better able to
diversify risk through participation in cleared markets may be more willing to invest in the real
economy rather than choosing to engage in precautionary savings.
3. Effect of Amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and Rule 17Ab2-2
The discussion below outlines the costs and benefits considered by the Commission as
they relate to the rules being adopted today. These specific costs and benefits are in addition to
the more general costs and benefits anticipated under the Commission’s proposal discussed in
Part III.B.1 and include, in particular, the costs and benefits stemming from the availability of
QCCP status under the BCBS capital framework. Many of the costs and benefits discussed
below are difficult to quantify. This is particularly true where clearing agency practices are
anticipated to evolve and adapt to changes in technology and other market developments. The
difficulty in quantifying costs and benefits of the adopted rules is further exacerbated by the fact
that in some cases the Commission lacks information regarding the specific practices of clearing
agencies that could assist in quantifying certain costs. For example, as noted in Part I.A.1.a.i(4),
without detailed information about the composition of illiquid assets held by clearing agencies
and their members, the Commission cannot provide reasonable estimates of costs associated with
satisfying substantive requirements under Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii). Another example,
discussed in Part I.A.1.a.i(5), is testing and validation of financial risk models, where the
Commission is only able to estimate that costs will fall within a range. In this case, the costs
associated with substantive requirements under the rules may depend on the types of risk models
employed by clearing agencies, which are, in turn, dictated by the markets they serve. As a

321

result, much of the discussion is qualitative in nature, though where possible, the costs and
benefits have been quantified.
a. Rule 17Ad-22(e)
The Commission recognizes that the scope of Rule 17Ad-22(e) is an important
determinant of its economic effect. Having considered the anticipated costs and benefits
associated with Rule 17Ad-22(e), the Commission believes Rule 17Ad-22(e) should apply to a
“covered clearing agency,” as defined in Rule 17Ad-22(a)(5). 705 In particular, as discussed
below, the Commission believes that an important benefit resulting from the enhanced risk
management requirements in the rules is a reduction in the risk of a failure of a covered clearing
agency. For example, these benefits may be significant due to the clearing agencies’ size,
exposure to, and interconnectedness with market participants, and the effect their failure may
have on markets, market participants, and the broader financial system. For complex risk profile
clearing agencies, significant benefits may flow as a result of their higher baseline default risk.
As an alternative, the Commission could have extended the scope of Rule 17Ad-22(e) to
cover all registered clearing agencies. The Commission acknowledges, however, that clearing
agencies are involved in differing products and markets that carry varying levels of risk. Further,
the costs of compliance with the rules may represent barriers to entry for clearing agencies. By
continuing to apply Rule 17Ad-22(d) to registered clearing agencies that are not covered clearing
agencies, the Commission believes that the scope of Rule 17Ad-22(e) appropriately preserves the
potential for the continuing development of the national system for clearance and settlement and

705

See Part II.A.1.

322

maintains innovation in the operation of registered clearing agencies. 706
i. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1): Legal Risk
Because, as noted above, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) would require substantially the same set of
policies and procedures as Rule 17Ad-22(d)(1), 707 the Commission believes that Rule 17Ad22(e)(1) would likely impose limited material additional costs on covered clearing agencies and
produce limited benefits, in line with the general economic considerations discussed in Part
III.B.1.
ii. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2): Governance
Each covered clearing agency has a board of directors that governs its operations and
oversees its senior management. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) would establish more detailed
requirements for governance arrangements at covered clearing agencies relative to those imposed
on registered clearing agencies under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(8). 708
The Commission understands that any covered clearing agency subject to the rule has
policies and procedures in place that clearly prioritize the risk management and efficiency of the
clearing agency. However, the Commission believes that covered clearing agencies do not
already have in place policies and procedures with respect to other requirements under Rule

706

The Commission notes that under Rule 17Ab2-2(a), a registered clearing agency that is
not involved in activities with a more complex risk profile and is not a designated clearing
agency may apply for covered clearing agency status, which would subject them to the
requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e). The Commission believes that this may occur if the registered
clearing agency believes such status may credibly signal the quality of the services it provides or
if it is seeking to obtain QCCP status under the BCBS capital framework.

707

See supra note 179; supra Part II.C.1 (discussing the full set of requirements under Rule
17Ad-22(e)(1)); supra Part III.A.2.a (discussing current practices among registered clearing
agencies regarding legal risk); see also 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(1).
708

See supra Part II.C.2 (discussing the full set of requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)).

323

17Ad-22(e)(2). Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission believes that some
covered clearing agencies may need to update their policies and procedures to comply with Rule
17Ad-22(e)(2)(iv). These updates will entail certain basic compliance costs, and covered
clearing agencies may also incur assessment costs related to analyzing current governance
arrangements to determine the extent to determine which they do not meet the requirements of
the amendments. The estimated costs in terms of paperwork are discussed in Part IV. If, as a
result of new policies and procedures, a covered clearing agency is required to recruit new
directors, the Commission estimates a cost per director of $73,912. 709
While there are potential costs associated with compliance, the Commission believes that
benefits would potentially accrue from these requirements. Specifically, the Commission
believes that enhanced governance arrangements would further promote safety and efficiency at
the clearing agency—motives that may not be part of a clearing agency’s governance
arrangements in the absence of regulation. Policies and procedures required under Rule 17Ad22(e)(2) would also reinforce governance arrangements at covered clearing agencies by requiring
board members and senior management to have appropriate experience and skills to discharge
their duties and responsibilities.
Compliance with these requirements could reduce the risk that insufficient internal
controls within a covered clearing agency endanger broader financial stability. While the
benefits of compliance are difficult to quantify, the Commission believes that they flow
predominantly from a reduced probability of covered clearing agency default.
709

The Commission estimated a cost per director of $68,000 in proposing Regulation MC.
See Exchange Act Release No. 34-63107 (Oct. 14, 2010), 75 FR 65881, 65921 & n.215 (Oct. 26,
2010). The $73,912 estimate reflects this amount in 2015 dollars, using consumer price inflation
data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

324

iii. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3): Comprehensive Framework for the
Management of Risks
The Commission believes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) would aid covered clearing agencies
in implementing a systematic process to examine risks and assess the probability and impact of
those risks. 710 Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(i) specifies that a risk management framework include
policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the range
of risks that arise in or are borne by the covered clearing agency. Critically, these policies and
procedures would be subject to review on a specified basis and approval by the board of directors
annually. A sound framework for comprehensive risk management under regular review would
have the benefits of providing covered clearing agencies with a better awareness of the totality of
risks they face in the dynamic markets they serve. In addition, the requirement to have policies
and procedures that provide for an independent audit committee of the board and that provide
internal audit and risk management functions with sufficient resources, authority, and
independence from management, as well as access to risk and audit committees of the board,
would reinforce governance arrangements directly related to risk management at covered
clearing agencies. A holistic approach to risk management could help ensure that policies and
procedures that covered clearing agencies adopt pursuant to the rules work in tandem with one
another. For example, such an approach could result in risk-based membership standards under
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) that are consistent with policies and procedures related to the allocation of
credit losses under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)(i). The Commission believes ensuring that a covered
clearing agency’s risk management activities fit within a unified framework could mitigate the
risk of financial losses to covered clearing agencies’ members and participants in the markets
710

See supra Part II.C.3 (discussing the full set of requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)).

325

they serve.
Additionally, the rule extends requirements under Rules 17Ad-22(d)(4) and 17Ad22(d)(11) by requiring plans for recovery and orderly wind-down. 711 To the extent that covered
clearing agencies do not already have such plans in place, they would incur incremental costs to
develop such plans. Recovery and resolution planning can benefit both clearing members and,
more generally, participants in markets where products are cleared. Many of the costs and
benefits of such plans depend critically on the specific recovery and wind-down tools that
covered clearing agencies choose to include in their rules. The presence of such plans could
reduce uncertainty over the allocation of financial losses to clearing members in the event that a
covered clearing agency faces losses due to member default or for other reasons that exceed its
prefunded default resources. Further, recovery and orderly wind-down plans that detail the
circumstances under which clearing services may be suspended or terminated may mitigate the
risk of market disruption in periods of financial stress. Market participants who face the
possibility that the assets they trade may no longer be cleared and settled by a CCP may be
unwilling to trade such assets at times when risk sharing is most valuable. While the effects are
difficult to quantify, the Commission believes that recovery and orderly wind-down plans ensure
that a covered clearing agency is able to remain resilient in times of market stress.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission believes that all covered clearing
agencies have an independent audit committee of the board. The Commission further believes
that most covered clearing agencies already have policies or procedures that may be relevant to
issues arising in recovery and/or wind-down of clearing operations. As a result, the benefits and
711

See supra Part II.C.3.b.iii (discussing the requirements for recovery and orderly winddown plans under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(ii)).

326

costs associated with these requirements will likely be limited to incremental changes associated
with covered clearing agencies’ review of such policies and procedures and further development
of plans for recovery and orderly wind-down and to registered clearing agencies that become
covered clearing agencies.
iv. Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) through (7): Financial Risk
Management
(1) Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4): Credit Risk
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) would establish requirements for credit risk management by covered
clearing agencies. 712 Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission believes that all
entities that would be covered clearing agencies are already in compliance with Rules 17Ad22(e)(4)(i) through (iv). Pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3), registered clearing agencies that
provide CCP services currently maintain additional financial resources to meet the “cover one”
requirement, and registered clearing agencies that would be complex risk profile clearing
agencies under the adopted rules currently maintain financial resources to meet the “cover two”
requirement. 713 All covered clearing agencies exclude resources that are not prefunded when
calculating this coverage. 714 As a result, the Commission believes little or no additional direct
costs or benefits will result from these requirements unless registered clearing agencies were to
become covered clearing agencies and include resources that are not prefunded towards their
712

See supra Part II.C.4 (discussing the full set of requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)).

713

The Commission also notes that no covered clearing agency would be systemically
important in multiple jurisdictions unless and until the Commission made such a determination
pursuant to Rule 17Ab2-2. See supra Part II.D (discussing the determinations process under
Rule 17Ab2-2).
714

See supra Part III.A.2.d.i (discussing current practices regarding credit risk management
at registered clearing agencies).

327

resource requirements. The requirement to include only prefunded resources when calculating
the financial resources available to meet the standards under Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii) and (iii)
potentially reduces the risk that covered clearing agencies request financial resources from their
members in times of financial stress, when members are least able to provide these resources.
While requiring “cover two” for complex risk profile clearing agencies and for covered
clearing agencies designated systemically important in multiple jurisdictions would place
additional requirements on the affected clearing agencies, the Commission believes that the
requirement is appropriate because disruption to these entities due to member default carries
relatively higher expected costs than for other covered clearing agencies. These relatively higher
expected costs arise from the fact that covered clearing agencies designated systemically
important in multiple jurisdictions are exposed to foreign financial markets and may serve as a
conduit for the transmission of risk; for complex risk profile clearing agencies, high expected
costs may arise from discrete jump-to-default price changes in the products they clear and higher
correlations in the default risk of members. 715
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi) and (vii) would also impose additional costs by requiring
additional measures to be taken with respect to the testing of a covered clearing agency’s
financial resources and model validation of a covered clearing agency’s credit risk models.
These requirements do not currently exist as part of the standards applied to registered clearing
agencies. 716 Covered clearing agencies may incur additional costs under expanded and more
frequent testing of total financial resources if the formal requirement that results of monthly
715

Cf. PFMI, supra note 2, at 43 (discussing Principle 4, Explanatory Note 3.4.19).

716

Rule 17Ad-22(b)(4) requires a registered clearing agency’s policies and procedures be
reasonably designed to provide for an annual validation of its margin models and the related
parameters and assumptions. See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(4).

328

testing be reported to appropriate decision makers is a practice not currently used by covered
clearing agencies. A range of costs for these new requirements is discussed in Part I.A.1.a.i(5).
Frequent monitoring and stress testing of total financial resources, model validations, and
reporting of results of the monitoring and testing to appropriate personnel within the clearing
agency could help rapidly identify any gaps in resources required to ensure stability, even in
scenarios not anticipated on the basis of historical data. Moreover, the requirement to test and,
when necessary, update the assumptions and parameters supporting models of credit risk will
support the adjustment of covered clearing agency financial resources to changing financial
conditions, and mitigate the risk that covered clearing agencies will strategically manage updates
to their risk models in support of cost reduction or profit maximization.
The Commission believes that most covered clearing agencies will be required to update
their policies and procedures as a result of Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(viii) and (ix). Clearing members
may experience benefits from 17Ad-22(e)(4)(viii), which requires covered clearing agencies to
provide disclosure to members regarding the allocation of default losses when these losses
exceed the level of financial resource it has available. As a result of this additional transparency,
clearing members may experience an improved ability to manage their expectations of potential
obligations against the covered clearing agency, which may increase the likelihood of orderly
wind-downs in the event of member default. Crafting such allocation plans by covered clearing
agencies may entail certain compliance costs, as discussed further in Part III.B.3.d. Further,
covered clearing agencies may allocate default losses in a number of ways that may themselves
have implications for participation, competition, and systemic risk. 717 For example, if, as a part
717

See, e.g., Elliot, supra note 616 (discussing various loss-allocation rules and CCP
recovery and wind-down).

329

of a default resolution plan, selective tear-up is contemplated after a failed position auction, then
clearing members who expect low loss exposure in the tear-up may not have adequate incentives
to participate in the position auction, even if they are better able to absorb losses than clearing
members who expect high exposure in the tear-up plan. This would increase the chances of a
failed auction and the chances of a protracted and more disruptive wind-down. Thus, the total
costs of any loss allocation plan may depend largely on the particular choices embedded in
covered clearing agencies’ plans.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ix) contains new provisions related to the replenishment of financial
resources that do not appear in Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11). The Commission believes that the rules
related to replenishment of financial resources may reduce the potential for systemic risk and
contagion in cleared markets, as they facilitate covered clearing agencies’ prompt access to these
resources in times of financial stress.
(2) Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5): Collateral
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) would require a covered clearing agency to have policies and
procedures reasonably designed to limit the assets it accepts as collateral to those with low credit,
liquidity, and market risks, and to set and enforce appropriately conservative haircuts and
concentration limits. Collateral haircut and concentration limit models would be subject to a notless-than-annual review of their sufficiency. 718 Rule 17Ad-22(d)(3) currently requires registered
clearing agencies to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to hold assets in a manner
that minimizes risk of loss or risk of delay in access to them and invest assets in instruments with
minimal credit, market, and liquidity risk.

718

See supra Part II.C.5 (discussing the full set of requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5)).

330

By focusing on the nature of assets and not on accounts, the Commission believes the
adopted rule may allow covered clearing agencies the ability to manage collateral more
efficiently. In particular, under the adopted rule, a covered clearing agency would have the
option of accepting collateral that is riskier than cash and holding this collateral at commercial
banks, potentially increasing default risk exposure. On the other hand, the requirement to
regularly review concentration limits and haircuts mitigates the risk that a covered clearing
agency’s collateral policies fail to respond to changing economic conditions. Based on its
supervisory experience, the Commission understands that all registered clearing agencies that
would meet the definition of a covered clearing agency already conform to the requirements
under the adopted rule related to the nature of assets they may accept as collateral and the
haircuts and concentration limits they apply to collateral assets, so the associated costs and
benefits that would result from these requirements would apply only if registered clearing
agencies not already in compliance were to become covered clearing agencies.
As a result of the rule, these covered clearing agencies and registered clearing agencies
that become covered clearing agencies may experience additional costs as a result of the annual
review requirements for the sufficiency of collateral haircut and concentration limit models.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission believes that many clearing agencies that
require collateral would need to develop policies and procedures to review haircuts and
concentration limits annually. Enforcement of the haircut requirement would also require
additional resources. A range of costs for these new requirements is discussed in Part
I.A.1.a.i(5). Adherence to these requirements by these entrants could extend the benefits of
prompt loss coverage, incentive alignment, and systemic risk mitigation to a larger volume of
cleared transactions.

331

(3) Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6): Margin
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) would require a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services
to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to require it to cover credit exposures using
a risk-based margin system and to establish minimum standards for such a system. It would
require these policies and procedures to cover daily collection of variation margin. The rule also
requires a set of policies and procedures generally designed to support a reliable margin system.
Among these are policies and procedures to ensure the use of reliable price data sources and
appropriate methods for measuring credit exposure, which could improve margin system
accuracy. Finally, covered clearing agencies would be required to have policies and procedures
related to the testing and verification of margin models. 719 Rules 17Ad-22(a)(6) and (14)
support these requirements by addressing the means of verification for margin models and the
level of coverage required of a margin system against potential future exposures, respectively.
Based on its supervisory experience, however, the Commission understands that all current
covered clearing agencies have policies and procedures that conform to the requirements under
Rules 17Ad-22(e)(6)(i) through (v) and (vii), and some will have to update their policies and
procedures to comply with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi).
Similar to Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) and (7), covered clearing agencies that do not already
engage in backtesting of margin resources at least once each day or engage in a monthly analysis
of assumptions and parameters, as well as registered clearing agencies that become covered
clearing agencies in the future, may incur incremental compliance costs as a result of the adopted
rule. Since margin plays a key role in clearing agency risk management, however, requiring that
margin be periodically verified and modified as a result of changing market conditions may
719

See supra Part II.C.6 (discussing the full set of requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)).

332

mitigate the risks posed by covered clearing agencies to financial markets in periods of financial
stress. Further, periodic review of model specification and parameters reduces the likelihood
that covered clearing agencies opportunistically update margin models in times of low volatility
and fail to update margin models in times of high volatility. A range of costs for verification and
modification of margin models is discussed in Part I.A.1.a.i(5). Further, since risk-based initial
margin requirements may cause market participants to internalize some of the costs borne by the
CCP as a result of large or risky positions, 720 ensuring that margin models are well-specified and
correctly calibrated with respect to economic conditions will help ensure that they continue to
align the incentives of clearing members with the goal of financial stability.
(4) Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7): Liquidity Risk
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) would require a covered clearing agency to have policies and
procedures reasonably designed to effectively monitor, measure, and manage liquidity risk. 721
Parties to securities and derivatives transactions rely on clearing agencies for prompt clearance
and settlement of transactions. Market participants in centrally cleared and settled markets are
often linked to one another through intermediation chains in which one party may rely on
proceeds from sales of cleared products to meet payment obligations to another party. If
insufficient liquidity causes a clearing agency to fail to meet settlement or payment obligations to
its members, consequences could include the default of a clearing member who may be
depending on these funds to make a payment to another market participant, with losses then

720

See, e.g., Philipp Haene & Andy Sturm, Optimal Central Counterparty Risk Management
(Swiss Nat’l Bank Working Paper, June 2009) (addressing the tradeoff between margin and
default fund, considering collateral costs, clearing member default probability, and the extent to
which margin requirements are associated with risk mitigating incentives).
721

See supra Part II.C.7 (discussing the full set of requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)).

333

transmitted to others that carry exposure to this market participant if the market participant is
depending on payments from the clearing members to make said payments to others. Therefore,
the benefits related to liquidity risk management generally flow from the reduced risk of
systemic risk transmission by covered clearing agencies as a result of liquidity shortfalls, either
in the normal course of operation or as a result of member default.
Enhanced liquidity risk management may produce additional benefits. Clearing members
would face less uncertainty over whether a covered clearing agency has the liquidity resources
necessary to make prompt payments which would reduce any need to hedge the risk of
nonpayment. Potential benefits from enhanced liquidity risk management may also extend
beyond members of covered clearing agencies or markets for centrally cleared and settled
securities. Clearing members are often members of larger financial networks, and the ability of a
covered clearing agency to meet payment obligations to its members can directly affect its
members’ ability to meet payment obligations outside of the cleared market. Thus, management
of liquidity risk may mitigate the risk of contagion between asset markets.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission believes that some covered clearing
agencies would need to create new policies and procedures, or update existing policies and
procedures, to meet requirements under the various subsections of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7). These
actions would entail compliance costs, as described in Part III.B.3.d. Further, the Commission
believes that for some covered clearing agencies the adopted requirements would require them to
establish new practices. The cost of adherence to the rule would likely be passed on to market
participants in cleared markets, as discussed in more detail below.
Under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i), a covered clearing agency would be required to have
policies and procedures reasonably designed to require maintaining sufficient resources to

334

achieve “cover one” for liquidity risk. This requirement mirrors the “cover one” requirement for
credit risk in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iii). Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission
believes that many covered clearing agencies do not currently meet a “cover one” requirement
for liquidity and thus will likely incur costs to comply with this rule. As discussed earlier,
whether covered clearing agencies choose to gather liquidity directly from members or instead
choose to rely on third-party arrangements, the costs of liquidity may be passed on to other
market participants, eventually increasing transaction costs. 722 The requirement may, however,
reduce the procyclicality of covered clearing agencies’ liquidity demands, which may reduce
costs to market participants in certain situations. For instance, the requirement would reduce the
likelihood that a covered clearing agency would have to call on its members to contribute
additional liquidity in periods of financial stress, when liquidity may be most costly.
Under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii), a covered clearing agency would be required to have
policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that it meets the minimum liquidity
resource requirement in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) with qualifying liquid resources. 723 Qualifying
liquid resources would include cash held at the central bank or at a creditworthy commercial
bank, assets that are readily converted into cash pursuant to committed lines of credit, committed
foreign exchange swaps, committed repurchase agreements or other highly reliable prearranged
funding agreements, or assets that may be pledged to a central bank in exchange for cash (if the
covered clearing agency has access to routine credit at a central bank). The Commission notes
that the adopted rules allow covered clearing agencies some measure of flexibility, subject to

722

See supra Part III.B.1.d (discussing the effect of the rules on concentration in the market
for clearing services and among clearing members).
723

See Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14), infra Part VI (defining “qualifying liquid resources”).

335

their obligations and responsibilities as SROs under the Exchange Act, to manage their
qualifying liquid resources and that covered clearing agencies would be able to use creditworthy
commercial bank services where appropriate.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission believes that some covered clearing
agencies currently do not meet the liquidity requirements with qualifying liquid resources. As an
alternative to the adopted rules, the Commission could have restricted the definition of qualifying
liquid resources to assets held by covered clearing agencies. These covered clearing agencies
and the markets they serve would benefit from the adopted minimum requirements for liquidity
resources in terms of the reduced risk of liquidity shortfalls and associated contagion risks
described above. However, qualifying liquid resources may be costly for covered clearing
agencies to maintain on their own balance sheets. Such resources carry an opportunity cost.
Assets held as cash are, by definition, not available for investment in less liquid assets that may
be more productive uses of capital. This cost may ultimately be borne by clearing members who
contribute liquid resources to covered clearing agencies to meet minimum requirements under
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii) and their customers.
The Commission notes that, under the adopted rules, covered clearing agencies have
flexibility, subject to their obligations and responsibilities as SROs under the Exchange Act, to
meet their qualifying liquid resource requirements in a number of ways. In perfect capital
markets, maintaining on-balance-sheet liquidity resources should be no more costly than entering
into committed lines of credit or prearranged funding agreements backed by less-liquid assets
that would allow these assets to be converted into cash. However, market frictions, such as
search frictions, may enable banks to obtain liquidity at lower cost than other firms. In the
presence of such frictions, obtaining liquidity using committed and uncommitted funding

336

arrangements provided by banks may prove a less costly option for some covered clearing
agencies than holding additional liquid resources on their balance sheets. In particular, the
Commission believes that requiring covered clearing agencies to enter into committed or
uncommitted funding arrangements would decrease the costs that would be experienced by them
in the event they sought to liquidate securities holdings during periods of market disruptions and
increase the likelihood that they meet funding obligations to market participants by reducing the
risk of delay in converting non-cash assets into cash.
The Commission notes that committed or uncommitted funding arrangements would only
count towards minimum requirements to the extent that covered clearing agencies had securities
available to post as collateral, so use of these facilities may require covered clearing agencies to
require their members to contribute more securities. If these securities are costly for clearing
members to supply, then additional required contributions to meet minimum requirements under
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii) may impose costs on clearing members and their customers. Similarly,
prearranged funding arrangements may entail implicit costs to clearing members. Prearranged
funding arrangements could impose costs on clearing members if they are obligated to contribute
securities towards a collateral pool that the covered clearing agency would use to back
borrowing. Alternatively, clearing members may be obligated under a covered clearing agency’s
rules to act as counterparties to repurchase agreements. Under the latter scenario, clearing
members would bear costs associated with accepting securities in lieu of cash. Additionally, the
Commission notes certain explicit costs specifically associated with these arrangements outlined
below.
Counterparties to committed arrangements allowable under Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14) charge
covered clearing agencies a premium to provide firm liquidity commitments and additional out-

337

of-pocket expenses will be incurred establishing and maintaining committed liquidity
arrangements. The Commission estimates that the total cost of committed funding arrangements
will be approximately 30 basis points per year, including upfront fees, legal fees, commitment
fees, and collateral agent fees. 724 Furthermore, the Commission is aware of other potential
consequences of these arrangements. In some instances, they may cause entities outside of a
covered clearing agency to bear risks ordinarily concentrated within the covered clearing agency,
while, in others, these arrangements may result in increased exposure of covered clearing
agencies to certain members. 725 Financial intermediaries that participate in committed credit
facilities may be those least able to provide liquidity in times of financial stress, so these
commitments may represent a route for risk transmission. 726 Finally, the Commission notes that
covered clearing agencies may face constraints in the size of credit facilities available to them.
Recent market statistics have estimated the total size of the committed credit facility market in
the U.S. at $2.3 trillion with 15 of 3,740 facilities exceeding $10 billion in size. 727 Given the

These estimates are based on the number of deals issued in 2015 as reported by the
DealScan database from Thomson Reuters Markets LLC. Suspended and cancelled deals were

volume of activity at covered clearing agencies, it is possible that they may only be able to use
committed credit facilities to meet a portion of their liquidity requirements under Rule 17Ad22(e)(7)(ii).
A covered clearing agency may alternatively use a prearranged funding arrangement
determined to be highly reliable in extreme but plausible market conditions to raise liquid
resources backed by non-cash assets but that does not require firm commitments from liquidity
providers. This strategy would avoid certain of the explicit fees associated with firm
commitments, while incurring costs related to the annual review and maintenance of such
arrangements. Based on its supervisory experience and discussions with market participants, the
Commission believes the cost associated with commitment fees to be between 5 and 15 basis
points per year. Given the 30 basis point cost associated with committed funding arrangements,
mentioned above, uncommitted facilities could entail costs of between 15 and 25 basis points. 728
Prearranged funding arrangements may ultimately prove less costly than holding cash and may
be more widely available than committed arrangements, while still reducing the likelihood of
delay faced by covered clearing agencies that attempt to market less-liquid assets. As mentioned
above in the context of committed credit facilities, the Commission acknowledges that financial
institutions who offer to provide liquidity to covered clearing agencies on an uncommitted basis
may be least able to do so in times of financial stress, when access to liquidity is most needed by
the covered clearing agency. Without a commitment in place, counterparties retain the option to
fail to provide liquidity during stressed conditions, when liquidity is most valuable to clearing
728

Subtracting the lower bound of commitment fees (5 basis points) from the estimated total
cost of a committed facility (30 basis points) yields an estimate of the upper bound of the fees
associated with an uncommitted facility (30 - 5 = 25 basis points). We estimate the lower bound
of fees associated with an uncommitted facility analogously (30 - 15 = 15 basis points).

339

agencies and the markets they serve. To the extent covered clearing agencies may establish
requirements for clearing members to provide liquidity to ensure compliance with the
Commission’s adopted rules, the costs experienced by members indirectly may exceed those
associated with committed credit facilities.
Finally, covered clearing agencies that have access to routine credit at a central bank
could meet the qualifying liquid resources requirement with assets that are pledgeable to a
central bank, if that jurisdiction permits such pledges or the transactions by the covered clearing
agency. The Commission notes that this may represent the lowest cost option for covered
clearing agencies, but understands that this latter provision would represent an advantage only if
and when a covered clearing agency receives the benefit of access to routine central bank
borrowing. The Commission anticipates that at such future time access to routine credit at a
central bank would provide covered clearing agencies with additional flexibility, subject to their
obligations and responsibilities as SROs under the Exchange Act, with respect to resources used
to comply with the liquidity risk management requirements of Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii).
The total cost of maintaining qualifying liquid resources pursuant to Rules 17Ad22(e)(7)(i) and (ii) is composed of the cost of each liquidity source including assets held by
covered clearing agencies, committed credit facilities and prearranged funding agreements,
multiplied by the quantity of each of these liquidity sources held by covered clearing agencies.
The Commission is unable to quantify the cost of cash held by clearing agencies and securities
required to back credit facilities since such estimates would require detailed information about
additional required contributions of clearing members under the adopted rules, as well as

340

clearing members’ best alternative to holding cash and securities. 729 As mentioned above,
however, the Commission has limited information about the costs associated with committed and
uncommitted credit facilities. Based on this information, we are able to quantify the costs
associated with committed credit facilities that will result from the requirement to maintain
qualifying liquid resources. The Commission estimates that the cost of compliance with the
adopted rules will be between $122 million and $204 million per year as a result of the
requirement to enter into prearranged funding agreements for non-cash assets used to meet
liquidity requirements under Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii). This analysis assumes that covered
clearing agencies will enter into such agreements at arm’s length on an uncommitted basis.
Based on staff discussions with market participants, the Commission understands that alternative
arrangements between covered clearing agencies and their members may be obtained at lower
cost, though these arrangements may come with increased wrong-way risk. 730

729

Covered clearing agencies may choose to allocate the costs associated with increased
liquidity requirements based on a number of factors related to the markets they serve and their
membership. See, e.g., Exchange Act Release No. 34-70999 (Dec. 5, 2013), 78 FR 75400 (Dec.
11, 2013) (Commission order approving NSCC rule change to institute supplemental liquidity
deposits to its clearing fund designed to increase liquidity resources to meet its liquidity needs).
730

To produce this range, the Commission used a combination of publicly available
information from SRO rule filings, comment letters, and 2015 annual financial statements, and
non-public information gathered as a result of its regulatory role. For each covered clearing
agency, the Commission assumed that the covered clearing agency’s guaranty fund represents
the sole source of liquidity used to satisfy its minimum liquidity requirements under the adopted
rules. To compute the level of qualifying liquid resources currently held by each covered
clearing agency, the Commission assumed that cash in the covered clearing agency’s guaranty
fund remains fixed at current levels and added to this any amount from credit facilities that could
be backed by the value of securities held in the covered clearing agency’s guaranty funds.
Taking the sum of these current qualifying liquid resources over all covered clearing
agencies and subtracting this from the sum of the “cover one” guaranty fund requirement over all
covered clearing agencies results in the total shortfall relative to minimum requirements under
Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii). The Commission further assumed that covered clearing
agencies would cover this shortfall using prearranged funding agreements backed by additional
341

U.S. Treasury securities would not fall under the definition of qualifying liquid resources.
The Commission understands that U.S. Treasury markets represent some of the largest and most
liquid markets in the world, see Part III.A.2.k, and that, in “flights to quality” and “flights to
liquidity” in times of financial stress, U.S. Treasuries trade at a premium to other assets. 731 If, as
an alternative to the adopted rules, the Commission included U.S. government securities in the
definition of qualifying liquid resources, the Commission estimates the cost of complying with
requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii) would be reduced by between $32 million and
$204 million per year. 732 The Commission believes, however, that there are benefits to including

securities posted to guaranty funds by clearing members. Finally, the Commission multiplied the
total prearranged funding amount by between 0.15% and 0.25% to arrive at a range of ongoing
costs.
This range estimate has been updated since the proposal. While it relies on the same
methodology, this estimate relies on more recent financial information from covered clearing
agencies. Cf. CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29600.

The Commission re-estimated the level of prearranged funding agreements required to
meet requirements under Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii) using the data and methodology
described in note 730, except in this case the Commission assumed that all non-defaulting
member resources applied to funding obligations were a mix of cash and U.S. Treasuries for a
lower bound, and assumed that all resources applied to funding obligations were a mix of cash
and U.S. Treasuries for an upper bound.
342

government securities only if prearranged funding agreements exist. In particular, given the
quantity of these securities financed by the largest individual dealers, fire-sale conditions could
materialize if collateral is liquidated in a disorderly manner, which could prevent covered
clearing agencies from meeting payment obligations. 733
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iii) requires a covered clearing agency to establish implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure it uses
accounts and services at a Federal Reserve Bank or other relevant central bank, when available
and where determined to be practical by the board of directors, to enhance its management of
liquidity risk. 734 The Commission believes that it may be beneficial for covered clearing
agencies to use central bank account services because doing so would reduce exposure to
commercial bank default risk. Moreover, for some covered clearing agencies, central bank
services may represent the lowest-cost admissible funding arrangement under the adopted rule.
The Commission understands, however, that central bank services may not be practical because

Taking the sum of these current qualifying liquid resources over all covered clearing
agencies and subtracting this from the sum of cover one guaranty fund requirement over all
covered clearing agencies results in the total shortfall relative to minimum requirements under
Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii) if U.S. government and agency securities were considered
qualifying liquid resources. As above, the Commission further assumed that covered clearing
agencies would cover this shortfall using prearranged funding agreements backed by additional
securities posted to guaranty funds by clearing members and multiplied this amount by between
0.15% and 0.25% to arrive at a range of ongoing costs.
As above, this range estimate has been updated since the proposal. While it relies on the
same methodology, this estimate relies on more recent financial information from covered
clearing agencies. Cf. CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29601.

direct access to central bank accounts and services may not be available to all clearing agencies
or members in all circumstances.
Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iv) and (v) address relations between covered clearing agencies and
their liquidity providers. The Commission believes that a key benefit of these adopted rules
would be an increased level of assurance that liquidity providers would be able to supply
liquidity to covered clearing agencies on demand. Such assurance is especially important
because of the possibility that covered clearing agencies may rely on outside liquidity providers
to convert non-cash assets into cash using prearranged funding arrangements or committed
facilities, pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii) and the definition of qualifying liquid resources in
Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14). The required policies and procedures would ensure the covered clearing
agency undertakes due diligence to confirm that it has a reasonable basis to believe each of its
liquidity providers understand the liquidity risk borne by the liquidity provider, and that the
liquidity provider would have the capacity to provide liquidity under commitments to the
covered clearing agency. Finally, covered clearing agencies would be required, under the
adopted rule, to maintain and test the covered clearing agency’s procedures and operational
capacity for accessing liquidity under their agreements. The Commission believes that, besides
the costs associated with new or updated policies and procedures discussed in Part IV.C, covered
clearing agencies and liquidity providers may experience costs associated with the adopted rules
as a result of the requirement to test liquidity resources, such as, for example, fees associated
with conducting test draws on a covered clearing agency’s credit lines. Costs associated with
ongoing monitoring and compliance related to testing are included in the Commission’s estimate
of quantifiable costs presented in Part III.B.3.d.

344

Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi) and (vii) may impose costs on covered clearing agencies as a
result of requirements for testing the sufficiency of liquidity resources and validating models
used to measure liquidity risk. The testing and model validation requirements of these adopted
rules are similar to requirements for testing and model validation for credit risk in Rules 17Ad22(e)(4)(vi) and (vii), and the Commission believes that these adopted rules would yield similar
benefits. Frequent monitoring and testing liquidity resources could help rapidly identify any
gaps in resources required to meet payment obligations. Moreover, the requirement to test and,
when necessary, update the assumptions and parameters supporting models of liquidity risk will
support the adjustment of covered clearing agency liquidity resources to changing financial
conditions and mitigate the risk that covered clearing agencies will strategically manage updates
to their liquidity risk models in support of cost-reduction or profit-maximization.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(viii) addresses liquidity shortfalls at a covered clearing agency, and
the Commission believes the adopted rule would reduce ambiguity related to settlement delays in
the event of liquidity shocks. Among other things, by requiring procedures that seek to avoid
delay of settlement payments, this adopted rule would require covered clearing agencies to
address liquidity concerns in advance rather than relying on strategies of delaying accounts
payable in the event of liquidity shocks. As discussed previously, effective liquidity risk
management by covered clearing agencies that serves to eliminate uncertainty on the part of
clearing members that payments by the covered clearing agency will be made on time may allow
these clearing members to allocate their liquidity resources to more efficient uses than holding
precautionary reserves. 735 The Commission believes the rule may reduce some of the flexibility

735

See supra Part III.B.2.b.

345

covered clearing agencies have in the absence of the rule, which could impose additional costs
on these clearing agencies as discussed in Part III.B.1.b.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ix) would require a covered clearing agency to have policies and
procedures reasonably designed to describe its process for replenishing any liquid resources that
it may employ during a stress event. 736 The ability to replenish liquidity resources is critical to
ensure that covered clearing agencies are able to continue operations after a stress event. Beyond
the general benefits associated with liquidity risk management noted earlier, this adopted rule
would yield particular benefits insofar as it would reduce uncertainty about covered clearing
agency liquidity resources at precisely those times when information about liquidity may be most
important to market participants.
Finally, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(x) would require a covered clearing agency that provides
CCP services and is either systemically important in multiple jurisdictions or is a clearing agency
involved in activities with a more complex risk profile to conduct a feasibility analysis for “cover
two.” 737 The primary cost associated with this rule will be an annual analysis by the affected
covered clearing agencies. Costs associated with a feasibility study would likely include the cost
of staffing and consulting, which will depend on the scope of products cleared and the particular
approach taken by each covered clearing agencies. The costs associated with this requirement are
included in Part III.B.3.d.
(5) Testing and Validation of Risk Models
Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) through (7) include requirements for covered clearing agencies to
have policies and procedures reasonably designed to test and validate models related to financial

risks. Covered clearing agencies may incur additional costs under expanded and more frequent
testing of financial resources if the requirements for testing and validation do not conform to
practices currently used by covered clearing agencies. 738 These costs are composed of two
portions. The first encompasses startup costs related to collection and storage of data elements
necessary to implement testing and validation, along with investments in software tools and
human capital to support these functions. The second portion of costs includes the ongoing,
annual costs of conducting testing and validation under the adopted rules.
Based on its supervisory experience and discussions with industry participants, the
Commission believes that startup costs to support testing and validation of credit risk, margin,
and liquidity risk models at covered clearing agencies could fall in the range of $5 million to $25
million for each covered clearing agency. This range primarily reflects investments in
information technology to process data already available to covered clearing agencies for stress
testing and validation purposes. The range’s width reflects differences in markets served by, as
well as the scope of operations of, each covered clearing agency. Based on its supervisory
experience and discussions with industry participants, the Commission estimates a lower bound
of $1 million per year for ongoing costs related to testing of risk models.
Should each covered clearing agency choose to hire external consultants for the purposes
of performing model validation required under Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) and 17Ad-22(e)(7) through

738

The Commission notes that while the stress testing provisions in Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)
through (7) include new requirements for covered clearing agencies, Rule 17Ad-22(b)(4)
requires registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services for security-based swaps to have
policies and procedures for a general margin model validation requirement. See supra note 716.

347

written policies and procedures, the Commission estimates the ongoing cost associated with
hiring such consultants would be approximately $4,509,120 in the aggregate. 739
The Commission acknowledges that it could have, as an alternative, rules that would
require testing and validation of financial risk models at covered clearing agencies at different
frequencies. For example, the Commission could have required backtesting of margin resources
less frequently than daily. Such a policy could imply less frequent adjustments in margin levels
that may result in over- or under-margining. The Commission believes that the frequencies of
testing and validation of financial risk models that it has adopted are appropriate given the risks
faced by covered clearing agencies and current market practices related to frequency of meetings
of risk management committees and boards of directors at covered clearing agencies.
v. Rules 17Ad-22(e)(8) through (10): Settlement and Physical
Delivery
Rules 17Ad-22(e)(8) through (10) require covered clearing agencies to have policies and
procedures reasonably designed to address settlement risk. Many of the issues raised by
settlement are similar to those raised by liquidity. Uncertainty in settlement may make it
difficult for clearing members to fulfill their obligations to other market participants within their
respective financial networks if they hold back precautionary reserves, as discussed above.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission believes that the benefits and costs for the
739

This figure was calculated as follows: 2 Consultants for 40 hours per week at $653 per
hour = $52,240 x 12 weeks = $644,160 per clearing agency x 7 covered clearing agencies =
$4,509,120. The $671 per hour figure for a consultant was calculated using www.payscale.com,
modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to
account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead.
The Commission previously estimated that ongoing costs associated with hiring external
consultants to fulfill the requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(b)(4) would be approximately $3.9
million per year. See Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 5, at 66261.

348

majority of covered clearing agencies will likely be limited. Registered clearing agencies that
become covered clearing agencies in the future, by contrast, may bear more significant costs as a
result of the enhanced standards.
Settlement finality is important to market participants for a number of reasons. Reversal
of transactions can be costly to participants. For example, if transactions are reversed, buyers
and sellers of securities may be exposed to additional market risk as they attempt to reestablish
desired positions in cleared products. Similarly, reversal of transactions may render participants
expecting to receive payment from the covered clearing agency unable to fulfill payment
obligations to their counterparties, exposing these additional parties to the transmitted credit risk.
Finally, settlement finality can help facilitate default management procedures by covered
clearing agencies since they improve transparency of members’ positions. Unless settlement
finality is established by covered clearing agencies, market participants may attempt to hedge
reversal risk for themselves. This could come at the cost of efficiency if it means that, on the
margin, participants are less likely to use cleared products as collateral in other financial
transactions.
In addition, settlement in central bank money, where available and determined to be
practical by the board of directors of the covered clearing agency, as the adopted rules would
require, greatly reduces settlement risk related to payment agents. Using central bank accounts
to effect settlement rather than settlement banks removes a link from the intermediation chain
associated with clearance and settlement. As a result, a covered clearing agency would be less
exposed to the default risk of its settlement banks. In cases where settlement banks maintain
links to other covered clearing agencies, for example as liquidity providers or as members,
reducing exposure to settlement bank default risk may be particularly valuable.

349

As in the case of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iii), the Commission acknowledges there may be
circumstances where it is appropriate for covered clearing agencies to use commercial banks for
conducting money settlements even when comparable services are available from a central bank.
Accordingly, the Commission believes it is appropriate to allow covered clearing agencies
flexibility, subject to their obligations and responsibilities as SROs under the Exchange Act, to
also use commercial bank account services to effect settlement, subject to a requirement that
covered clearing agencies monitor and manage the risks associated with such arrangements.
vi. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11): CSDs
CSDs play a key role in modern financial markets. For many issuers, many transactions
in their securities involve no transfer of physical certificates.
Paperless trade generally improves transactional efficiency. Book-entry transfer of
securities may facilitate conditional settlement systems required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12). For
example, book-entry transfer in a delivery versus payment system allows securities to be credited
to an account immediately upon debiting the account for the payment amount. Institutions and
individuals may elect to no longer hold and exchange certificates that represent their ownership
of securities. An early study showed that the creation of DTC resulted in a 30–35% reduction in
the physical movement of certificates. 740 Among other benefits, to the extent that delays in
exchanging paper certificates result in settlement failures, immobilization and dematerialization
of shares reduces the frequency of these failures. 741

For markets to realize the transactional benefits of paperless trade, however, requires
confidence that CSDs can correctly account for the number of securities in their custody and for
the book entries that allocate these securities across participant accounts. To realize these
benefits, the rules also require covered CSDs to establish, implement, maintain and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure the integrity of securities issues,
minimize the risks associated with transfer of securities, and protect assets against custody risk.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission believes that registered CSDs already have
infrastructure in place to meet these requirements. However, CSDs may face incremental
compliance costs in instances where they must modify their rules to implement appropriate
controls. Compliance costs may be higher for potential new CSDs that are determined to be
covered clearing agencies in the future.
vii. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12): Exchange-of-Value Settlement
Systems
Clearance and settlement of transactions between two parties to a trade involves an
exchange of one obligation for another. Regarding transactions in securities, these claims can be
securities or payments for securities. A particular risk associated with transactions is principal
risk, which is the risk that only one obligation is successfully transferred between counterparties.
For example, in a purchase of common stock, a party faces principal risk if, despite successfully
paying the counterparty for the purchase, the counterparty may fail to deliver the shares.

process for paper certificates were a principal cause of failures to deliver and receive during the
“paperwork crisis” of the late 1960s).

351

The adopted requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) are substantially the same as those
in Rule 17Ad-22(d)(13). 742 As a result, covered clearing agencies that have been in compliance
with Rule 17Ad-22(d)(13) face no substantially new requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12).
The Commission expects the adopted rule would likely impose limited material additional costs
on covered clearing agencies. It would also produce benefits in line with the general economic
considerations discussed in Part III.B.1. The economic effects may differ for registered clearing
agencies that become covered clearing agencies in the future.
viii. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13): Participant-Default Rules and
Procedures
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) requires covered clearing agencies to have policies and procedures
for participant default with additional specificity relative to current requirements for registered
clearing agencies under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11). In particular, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) requires
policies and procedures that address the testing and review of default procedures.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission believes all covered clearing
agencies currently test and review default procedures at least annually, so the costs of this
requirement would apply only to registered clearing agencies that may become covered clearing
agencies in the future. The Commission also believes that broad-based participation in the
testing of default procedures could reduce disruption to cleared markets in the event of default.
However, to the extent that testing of these procedures requires participation by members of
covered clearing agencies, members’ customers, and other stakeholders, these parties may bear

regarding exchange-of-value settlement systems); see also 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(13).

352

costs under the rules. The Commission is unable to quantify the economic effects of
participation in these tests at this time.
As an alternative to the rules, the Commission could have adopted more prescriptive
requirements for default procedures at covered clearing agencies. The Commission believes that
differences in cleared assets and in the characteristics of clearing members supports allowing
each covered clearing agency flexibility, subject to its obligations and responsibilities as an SRO
under the Exchange Act, to determine its own default procedures pursuant to Rule 17Ad22(e)(13).
ix. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14): Segregation and Portability
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) applies only to a covered clearing agency that is either a securitybased swap clearing agency or a complex risk profile clearing agency. It requires such a covered
clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to enable the segregation and portability of positions of a participant’s
customers and the collateral provided to the covered clearing agency with respect to those
positions, and effectively protect such positions and related collateral from the default or
insolvency of that participant. 743
Segregation and portability of customer positions serves a number of useful purposes in
certain cleared markets. In the normal course of business, the ability to efficiently identify and
move an individual customer’s positions and collateral between clearing members enables
customers to easily terminate a relationship with one clearing member and initiate a relationship
with another. This may facilitate competition between clearing members by ensuring customers

See supra Part II.B.14.a (discussing applicability of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) and the existing
rules for the cash securities and listed options markets applicable to broker-dealers which already
promote segregation and portability to protect customer positions and funds in those markets).

353

are free to move their accounts from one clearing member to another based on their preferences,
without being unduly limited by operational barriers. 744
Segregation and portability may be especially important in the event of participant
default. By requiring that customer collateral and positions remain segregated, covered clearing
agencies can facilitate, in the event of a clearing member’s insolvency, the recovery of customer
collateral and the movement of customer positions to one or more other clearing members.
Further, portability of customer positions may facilitate the orderly wind down of a defaulting
member if customer positions may be moved to a non-defaulting member. Porting of positions
in a default scenario may yield benefits for customers if the alternative is closing-out positions at
one clearing member and reestablishing them at another clearing member. The latter strategy
would cause customers to bear transactions costs, which might be especially high in times of
financial stress.
The Commission notes that, in its view, for those clearing agencies to which Rule 17Ad22(e)(14) applies, these adopted rules are flexible in their approach to implementing segregation
and portability requirements. The most efficient means of implementing these requirements may
depend on the products that a covered clearing agency clears as well as other business practices
at a covered clearing agency. For example, a clearing agency’s decision whether or not to collect
margin on a gross or net basis may bear on its decision to port customer positions and collateral
on an individual or omnibus basis, and while an individual account structure may provide a
higher degree of protection from a default by another customer, it may be operationally and
744

See, e.g., Paul Klemperer, Competition When Consumers Have Switching Costs: An
Overview with Applications to Industrial Organization, Macroeconomics, and International
Trade, 62 Rev. Econ. Stud. 515 (1995) (presenting an overview of switching costs and their
effects on competition).

354

resource intensive for a covered clearing to implement and may reduce the efficiency of its
operations. Moreover, some clearing agencies may already employ the LSOC model for
segregation and portability of customer positions in security-based swaps because of existing
CFTC requirements for swaps.
As a result, the costs and benefits of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) will depend on specific rules
implemented by covered clearing agencies as well as how much these rules differ from current
practice. Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission believes that the current practices
at covered clearing agencies to which the rule would apply already meet segregation
requirements under the rule, so any costs and benefits for covered clearing agencies would flow
from implementing portability requirements, though the rule potentially raises a barrier to entry
for security-based swap clearing agencies or clearing agencies involved in activities with a more
complex risk profile that seek to become covered clearing agencies.
x. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15): General Business Risk
While Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) and 17Ad-22(e)(7) require that covered clearing agencies
have policies and procedures reasonably designed to address credit risk and liquidity risk, Rule
17Ad-22(e)(15) requires that covered clearing agencies have policies and procedures reasonably
designed to address general business risk. The Commission believes that general business losses
experienced by covered clearing agencies represent a distinct risk to cleared markets, given
limited competition and specialization of clearing agencies. In this regard, the loss of clearing
services due to general business losses would likely result in major market disruption. The rule
requires a covered clearing agency to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to
mitigate the risk that business losses result in the disruption of clearing services. Under these
policies and procedures covered clearing agencies would hold sufficient liquid resources funded

355

by equity to cover potential general business losses, which at a minimum would constitute six
months of operating expenses. The Commission believes that the benefits of such policies and
procedures would flow primarily from covered clearing agencies that would be required to
increase their holdings of liquid net assets funded by equity, enabling them to sustain their
operations for sufficient time and achieve orderly wind-down if such action is eventually
necessary.
The Commission could have adopted a higher or lower minimum level of resources, for
example, corresponding to one quarter of operating expenses or one year of operating expenses.
The Commission believes, however, that the rules, as adopted, afford covered clearing agencies
sufficient flexibility, subject to their obligations and responsibilities as SROs under the Exchange
Act, to determine the level of resources to hold while maintaining a minimum standard that
supports continued operations in the event of general business losses. As another alternative, the
Commission could have allowed covered clearing agencies additional flexibility to determine the
nature of the financial resources held to mitigate the effects of general business risk or the means
by which these resources are funded. The Commission believes, however, that by specifying
that these resources be liquid in nature, the rule would limit any delays by covered clearing
agencies that suffer business losses from paying expenses required for continued operations.
Additionally, by specifically requiring that a covered clearing agency draw liquid net resources
from members as equity capital, the rules may also encourage members to more closely monitor
the business operations of a covered clearing agency, which may reduce the likelihood of losses.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission believes that certain covered
clearing agencies would be required to establish and maintain policies and procedures providing
for specified levels of equity capital and higher levels of liquid net assets as a result of Rule

356

17Ad-22(e)(15). 745 However, the Commission believes that based on current market practices,
covered clearing agencies may not bear substantial costs to implement these policies and
procedures. Table 2 contains summary information from five registered clearing agencies
obtained from quantitative disclosures made by these registered clearing agencies pursuant to the
PFMI. 746 These disclosures suggest that all five of these registered clearing agencies each
currently hold more net liquid assets funded by equity than would be required to cover six
months of operating expenses. While similar quantitative disclosures are not currently published
by DTC, DTC does publish an annual disclosure framework pursuant to the PFMI, 747 which
states that as of June 30, 2014, DTC maintained liquid net assets funded by equity in an amount
exceeding six months of its projected operating expenses. 748 This analysis suggests that based
on available information about liquid net assets funded by equity operating expenses, covered
clearing agencies would not be required to raise additional equity capital to implement these
policies and procedures with respect to net liquid assets.

agencies. 749

However, the Commission acknowledges that policies and procedure adopted by covered
clearing agencies pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) may nevertheless result in certain costs for
covered clearing agencies. First, covered clearing agencies would incur ongoing costs to
implement, maintain, and enforce policies and procedures under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15). To the
extent that maintenance and enforcement of these policies and procedures indicate that additional
capital is required to manage a covered clearing agency’s general business risks, it may
determine that it needs to increase liquid net assets. Second, as a result of these new policies and
procedures, covered clearing agencies will have less control over their capital structures, as by
implementing these policies and procedures they would be compelled to maintain a certain
minimum level of liquid net assets despite the availability of new, less liquid, investment
opportunities. Absent market frictions, such a change in capital structure should have no effect
on the value of a covered clearing agency. 750 Nevertheless, the Commission acknowledges that
market imperfections such as asymmetric information, moral hazard, and regulation may imply
that covered clearing agencies that would need to raise additional equity capital incur

358

opportunity costs for holding this additional capital rather than investing it in projects or
distributing it back to equity holders who might, in turn, invest in projects.
Clearing agencies that issue equity to satisfy the new requirements would additionally
face costs related to issuance. The Commission recognizes that the cost of maintaining
additional equity resembles an insurance premium against the losses associated by market
disruption in the absence of clearing services.
xi. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16): Custody and Investment Risks
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) requires a covered clearing agency to have policies and procedures
reasonably designed to safeguard both their own assets as well as the assets of participants,
broadening the requirement applicable to registered clearing agencies in Rule 17Ad-22(d)(3) to
the protection of participants’ assets.
The Commission believes that this may have benefits in terms of protecting against
systemic risk, to the extent that covered clearing agencies to this point have treated their own
assets differently by applying greater safeguards to those assets than with respect to assets of
their members and members’ clients. Protection of member assets is important to cleared
markets because, for example, the assets of a member in default serve as margin and represent
liquidity supplies that a covered clearing agency may access to cover losses. If covered clearing
agencies can quickly access these liquidity sources, they may be able to limit losses to nondefaulting members.
Participants may benefit from Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) in other ways. Requiring a covered
clearing agency’s policies and procedures to safeguard its assets and participant assets and to
invest in assets with minimal credit, liquidity, and market risk may reduce uncertainty in the
value of participant assets and participants’ exposure to mutualized losses. This may allow

359

participants to deploy their own capital more efficiently. Furthermore, easy access to their own
capital enables members to more freely terminate their participation in covered clearing
agencies.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission believes that current practices at
covered clearing agencies meet the requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) in most cases, so
the additional costs and benefits flowing from these requirements would be generally limited to
registered clearing agencies that may enter the set of covered clearing agencies in the future.
xii. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17): Operational Risk Management
Because, as noted above, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) would require substantially the same set
of policies and procedures as Rule 17Ad-22(d)(4), 751 the Commission believes that Rule 17Ad22(e)(17) would likely impose limited material additional costs on covered clearing agencies and
produce limited benefits, in line with the general economic considerations discussed in Part
III.B.1.
xiii. Rules 17Ad-22(e)(18) through (20): Membership
Requirements, Tiered Participation, and Linkages
As discussed earlier, covered clearing agencies play an important role in the markets they
serve. They often enjoy a central place in financial networks that enables risk sharing, but may
also enable them to serve as conduits for the transmission of risk throughout the financial system.
Rules (18) through (20) require covered clearing agencies to have policies and procedures
reasonably designed to explicitly consider and manage the risks associated with the particular
characteristics of their network of direct members, the broader community of customers, and
751

See supra Part II.C.17 (discussing the full set of requirements under Rule 17Ad22(e)(17)); see also 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(4).

360

other parties that rely on the services provided by the covered clearing agencies or other partners
that the covered clearing agency is connected to through relevant linkages. The Commission
believes that these efforts carry benefits insofar as they reduce the extent to which covered
clearing agencies may impose negative externalities on financial markets.
As economies of scale contribute to the business dynamics of clearing and settlement,
there is often only one clearing agency or a small number of clearing agencies for a particular
class of security. Consequently, membership in a clearing agency may influence competitive
dynamics between members and indirect participants, such as intermediaries, in cleared markets.
Members and indirect participants may compete for the same set of customers, but indirect
participants must have relationships with members to access clearing services. Members,
therefore, may have incentives in place to extract economic rents from indirect participants by
imposing higher fees or restricting access to clearing services.
Permitting fair and open access to clearing agencies and their services may promote
competition among market participants and may result in lower costs and efficient clearing and
settlement services. Open access to clearing agencies may reduce the likelihood that credit and
liquidity risk become concentrated among a small number of clearing members, each of which
retain a large number of indirect participants through tiered arrangements. Further, links
between clearing agencies may facilitate risk management across multiple security classes and
improve the efficiency of collateral arrangements.
(1) Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18): Member Requirements
While fair and open access to clearing agencies may promote competition and enhance
the efficiency of clearing and settlement services, these improvements should not come at the
expense of prudent risk management. The soundness of clearing members contributes directly to

361

the soundness of a clearing agency and mutualization of losses within clearing agencies expose
each clearing member to the default risk of every other clearing member. Accordingly, it is
important for clearing agencies to control and effectively manage the risks to which they are
exposed by their direct and indirect participants by establishing risk-related requirements for
participation.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission believes that current practices
among most covered clearing agencies involve a mix of objective financial and business
requirements stipulated in publicly-available rulebooks and discretion exercised by the covered
clearing agency. As a result and based on its supervisory experience, the Commission believes
that some changes to policies and procedures at covered clearing agencies may be required under
the rule.
(2) Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19): Tiered Participation
Arrangements
The Commission believes that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) may improve covered clearing
agencies’ ability to manage their exposure to market participants that are not clearing members,
but access payment, clearing, or settlement facilities through their relationships with clearing
members. A covered clearing agency that is able to effectively manage its exposure to its
members but fails to identify, monitor, and manage its exposures to non-member firms may
overlook dependencies that are critical to the stability of cleared markets. This is particularly
true if indirect participants in the covered clearing agency are large and might potentially
precipitate the default of one or more direct members.
The data necessary to compute summary statistics that would be helpful in quantifying
the costs and benefits of the rule, including those that would indicate the size of indirect

362

participants and the volume of transactions in which they are involved, are not available.
Nevertheless, the Commission is sensitive to the fact that costs associated with the rules may
result in concentration of clearing services among fewer clearing members. Part of this process
of consolidation may mean an increase in the volume of trading activity that involves indirect
members, making identification of risks associated with indirect members even more critical.
Based on its supervisory experience, however, the Commission believes that certain covered
clearing agencies already have policies and procedures in place that would satisfy the
requirements of the rule even in the absence of such explicit requirements under existing rules.
Costs and benefits from the rule would come from those other registered clearing agencies that
require updates to their policies and procedures to come into compliance with the rule.
The Commission is sensitive to the fact that indirect participants play a key role in
maintaining competition in markets for intermediation of trading in securities insofar as they
offer investors a broader choice of intermediaries to deal with in centrally cleared and settled
securities markets. If elements of policies and procedures under this rule make indirect
participation marginally more costly, then transactions costs for investors may increase.
(3) Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20): Links
Links between clearing agencies and their members are only one way that clearing
agencies interface with the financial system. A clearing agency may also establish links with
other clearing agencies and FMUs through a set of contractual and operational arrangements.
For a clearing agency, the primary purpose of establishing a link would be to expand its clearing
and settlement services to additional financial instruments, markets, and institutions. Established
links among clearing agencies and FMUs may enable direct and indirect market participants to
have access to a broader spectrum of clearing and settlement services.

363

Sound linkages between clearing agencies that provide CCP services may also provide
their customers with more efficient collateral arrangements and cross-margining benefits. Crossmargining potentially relaxes liquidity constraints in the financial system by reducing total
required margin collateral. Resources that would otherwise be posted as margin may be
allocated to more productive investment opportunities.
A clearing agency that establishes a link or multiple links may also impose costs on
participants in markets it clears by indirectly exposing them to systemic risk from linked entities.
The Commission acknowledges that clearing agencies that form linkages may be exposed to
additional risks, including credit and liquidity risks, as a consequence of these links. Links may,
however, produce benefits for members to the extent that diversification and hedging across their
combined portfolio reduces their margin requirements. At the same time, because such an
agreement requires the linked clearing agencies to each guarantee cross-margining participants’
obligations to the other clearing agency, cross-margining potentially exposes members of one
clearing agency to default risk from members of the other.
By requiring that covered clearing agencies have policies and procedures reasonably
designed to identify, monitor, and manage risks related to any link, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20), like
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(7), reduces the likelihood that such links serve as channels for systemic risk
transmission. Because Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) differs only marginally from Rule 17Ad-22(d)(7),
the Commission believes that the costs and benefits flowing from the adopted rule will be
incremental, to the extent that the additional specificity in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) causes covered
clearing agencies to modify current practices. The Commission has aggregated these costs
below.
xiv. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21): Efficiency and Effectiveness

364

Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) would impose on covered clearing agencies requirements in
addition to those currently applied to registered clearing agencies under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(6) by
also requiring covered clearing agencies to have policies and procedures that ensure that a
covered clearing agency’s management review efficiency and effectiveness in four key areas:
•

Efficiency and effectiveness in clearing and settlement arrangements may reduce
participants’ transaction costs and enhance liquidity by reducing the amount of
collateral that customers must provide for transactions and the opportunity cost
associated with providing such collateral. Where appropriate, net settlement
arrangements can reduce collateral requirements. Similarly, clearing arrangements
that include a broad scope of products enable clearing members to take advantage
of netting efficiencies across positions.

•

Efficient and effective operating structures, including risk management policies,
procedures, and systems, may reduce the likelihood of failures that may lead to
impairment of a clearing agency’s capacity to complete settlement and interfering
with its ability to monitor and manage credit exposures.

•

An efficient scope of products that a clearing agency clears, settles, or records
may provide its participants and customers with more efficient collateral
arrangements and cross-margining benefits that ultimately reduce transaction
costs and improve liquidity in cleared markets.

•

Efficient and effective use of technology and communication procedures
facilitates effective payment, clearing and settlement, and recordkeeping.

The Commission believes that requirements related to the efficient and effective
operation of covered clearing agencies are appropriate given the market power enjoyed by these

365

entities, as discussed in Part III.B.1.d. Limited competition in the market for clearing services
may blunt incentives for covered clearing agencies to provide high quality services at low cost to
market participants in the absence of regulation.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission believes that some covered clearing
agencies would be required to make updates to their policies and procedures as a result of the
rule. As a result, the Commission expects incremental costs and benefits to flow from the
adopted rule only to the extent that this additional specificity causes covered clearing agencies to
modify current practices.
xv. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22): Communication Procedures and
Standards
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission believes that some changes to
policies and procedures would be necessary to meet requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22). 752
These costs are included as a part of implementation costs, as discussed below. However, the
Commission understands that covered clearing agencies already accommodate internationally
accepted communication procedures and standards and anticipates only incremental costs
resulting from the rule, in addition to the above discussed benefits. Registered clearing agencies
that may become covered clearing agencies in the future may need to conform their practices to
internationally accepted communication procedures and standards, as well as adopt new policies
and procedures as a result of the rule, resulting in more substantial costs.
xvi. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23): Disclosure of Rules, Key Procedures,
and Market Data
752

See supra Part II.C.22 (discussing the full set of requirements under Rule 17Ad22(e)(22)).

366

Enhanced disclosure may also improve the efficiency of transactions in cleared products
and improve financial stability more generally by improving the ability of members of covered
clearing agencies to manage risks and assess costs. Additional information would reduce the
potential for uncertainty on the part of clearing members regarding their obligations to covered
clearing agencies. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) requires a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require
specific disclosures. As in Rules 17Ad-22(d)(9) and (11), covered clearing agencies would be
required under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) to disclose default procedures to the public and disclose
sufficient information to participants to allow them to manage the risks, fees, and other material
costs associated with membership.
Under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23), a covered clearing agency must establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to update, on a
biannual basis, public disclosures that describe the covered clearing agency’s market and
activities, along with information about the agency’s legal, governance, risk management, and
operating frameworks, including specifically covering material changes since the last disclosure,
a general background on the covered clearing agency, a rule-by-rule summary of compliance
with Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1) through (22), and an executive summary. The rule adds a new
requirement, relative to existing requirements for registered clearing agencies under Rule 17Ad22(d)(9), to update the disclosure biannually and to include, among other things, specific data
elements, including details about system design and operations, transaction values and volumes,
average intraday exposure to participants, and statistics on operational reliability.
Additional transparency may have benefits for participants and cleared markets more
generally. For example, if information about the systems that support a covered clearing agency

367

is public, investors may be more certain that the market served by this agency is less prone to
disruption and more accommodating of trade. Furthermore, public disclosure of detailed
operating data may facilitate evaluation of each covered clearing agency’s operating record by
market participants. Further, under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv), these disclosures would be made
about specific categories related to the compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e) that potentially
facilitate comparisons between covered clearing agencies. Additional availability of information
on operations may increase the likelihood that clearing agencies compete to win market share
from participants that value operational stability. This additional market discipline may provide
additional incentives for covered clearing agencies to maintain reliability. Finally, updating the
public disclosure every two years or more frequently following certain changes as required
pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(v) would support the benefits of enhanced public disclosures
by ensuring that information provided to the public remains up-to-date. The Commission
believes this would reduce the likelihood that market participants are forced to evaluate covered
clearing agencies on the basis of stale data.
Clearing members, in particular, may benefit from additional disclosure of risk
management and governance arrangements. These details potentially have significant bearing on
clearing members’ risk management because they may remove uncertainty surrounding
members’ potential obligations to a covered clearing agency. In certain circumstances,
additional disclosures may reveal to members that the expected costs of membership exceed the
expected benefits of membership, and that exit from the clearing agency may be privately
optimal. In addition to the costs of concentration among members discussed in earlier sections,
the Commission also recognizes the potential for systemic benefits from termination. Member
exit on the basis of more precise information may reduce the risk posed to other financial market

368

participants by members who, given additional information, might prefer to terminate their
membership, due to an inability to manage the risks to which a covered clearing agency exposes
them. While exit from clearing agencies may have consequences for competition among
clearing members, the Commission believes that encouraging the participation of firms that are
not able to bear the risks of membership is not an appropriate means of mitigating the effects of
market power on participants in cleared markets.
While it is possible that some covered clearing agencies will require changes to policies
and procedures as a result of the adopted rules, the Commission believes that the effect of Rule
17Ad-22(e)(23) will not have a substantial impact on compliance costs because covered clearing
agencies already gather data and information for preparing their responses to the PFMI
quantitative disclosures, which are updated semiannually.
b. Rule 17Ab2-2
Rule 17Ab2-2 provides procedures for the Commission to determine whether a covered
clearing agency is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions or has a complex risk profile
and therefore should be subject to stricter risk management standards under Rule 17Ad-22(e).
The Commission intends for Rule 17Ab2-2 to provide the Commission with discretion to
consider those criteria relevant to the facts and circumstances of a registered clearing agency
when subject to a determination.
Rule 17Ab2-2(a) includes criteria the Commission may consider in determining whether
a covered clearing agency is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions. These criteria are
based on input from a set of other bodies comprised of FSOC and regulators in other
jurisdictions. As a result, it is possible that the flow of costs and benefits from Rule 17Ad-22(e)
may be partially determined by the decisions of other regulatory bodies.

369

Rule 17Ab2-2(b), includes criteria that the Commission may use to determine that a
clearing agency has a complex risk profile. For example, the Commission may consider the
extent to which the clearing agency clears financial instruments that are characterized by discrete
jump-to-default price changes or that are highly correlated with potential participant defaults.
Indirect effects of the determination process may have important economic effects on the
ultimate volume of clearing activity, beyond the economic effects of the proposed requirements
themselves. An important feature of Rule 17Ab2-2 is providing transparency for the
determinations process. Transparency may allow a registered clearing agency to plan for
resulting obligations under Rule 17Ad-22(e).
To the extent that Rule 17Ad-22(e) may increase costs for a covered clearing agency
relative to its peers, such clearing agency may have incentives to restructure its business to avoid
a Commission determination or otherwise exit any services made prohibitively expensive by
such a determination. Such potential consequential effects would be among the considerations
for the Commission to review in connection with any specific decision under Rule 17Ab2-2.
Restructuring may involve spinning off business lines into separate entities, limiting the scope of
clearing activities to certain markets, or limiting the scale of clearing activities within a single
market. Any of these outcomes could result in inefficiencies. As discussed in Part III.B.1.c,
registered clearing agencies may incur costs as a result of restructuring. Registered clearing
agencies that break up along product lines or fail to consolidate when consolidation is efficient
may fail to take advantage of economies of scope and result in inefficient use of collateral.
Similarly, clearing agencies that limit their scale may provide lower levels of clearing services to
the markets that they serve.
The impact of adopting Rule 17Ab2-2, which can affect the application of Rule 17Ad-

370

22(e), could have direct costs on covered clearing agencies in the form of legal or consulting
costs incurred as a result of seeking a determination from the Commission. In instances where
these clearing agencies choose to apply to the Commission for status under Rule 17Ab2-2, the
Commission believes that a registered clearing agency’s voluntary application would suggest
that the applicant’s private benefits from enhanced requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e) as a
result of the Commission’s determination that it is systemically important in multiple
jurisdictions justify its costs. Quantifiable costs related to determinations under Rule a17Ab2-2
are noted in Part III.B.3.d.
In response to a comment about establishing a process for a covered clearing agency to
be removed from that status, the Commission has decided to adopt such procedures in Rule
17Ab2-2(c). Specifically, if a clearing agency no longer meets the determination of covered
clearing status, it can apply to be removed. This ability to remove the enhanced requirements
can facilitate a clearing agency’s ability innovate or enter new markets. Collectively, this could
support the continued development of the national system for clearance and settlement.
c. Rule 17Ad-22(f)
Rule 17Ad-22(f) includes a provision that specifies Commission authority over
designated clearing agencies for which it is the supervisory agency. Since this provision codifies
existing statutory authority, the Commission does not anticipate any economic effects from this
rule.
d. Quantifiable Costs and Benefits
As discussed above, the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and Rule 17Ab2-2 would impose
certain costs on covered clearing agencies. As discussed in Part III.B.3.a.ii, if a covered clearing
agency is required to recruit new directors, the Commission estimates a cost per director of

371

$73,912. 753 As discussed in Part I.A.1.a.i(4), the Commission estimates costs associated with
liquidity resources under Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7) and (a)(15) would likely fall between $122
million and $204 million per year across all covered clearing agencies. As discussed in Part
I.A.1.a.i(5), the Commission believes that startup costs related to financial risk management
systems for existing covered clearing agencies, related to new testing and model validation
requirements to be between $5 million to $25 million. The Commission also estimates a lower
bound on ongoing costs related to these requirements of $1 million per year. If covered clearing
agencies were to hire external consultants for the purposes of performing model validation
required under Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) and (7) through policies and procedures, the Commission
estimates the ongoing cost associated with hiring such consultants would be about $4,509,120 in
the aggregate. 754
In addition, Rules 17Ad-22(e)(3), (4), (6), (7), (15) and (21) all include elements of
review by either a covered clearing agency’s board or its management on an ongoing basis. The
Commission estimates the cost of ongoing review for these adopted rules at approximately
$39,376 per year. 755 The rules would also impose certain implementation burdens and related

753

See supra note 709.

754

See supra Part I.A.1.a.i(5), in particular note 739.

755

To monetize the cost of board review, the Commission used a recent report by
Bloomberg stating that the average director works 250 hours and earns $251,000, resulting in an
estimated $1000 per hour for board review. As a proxy for the cost of management review, the
Commission is estimating $461 per hour, based upon the Director of Compliance cost data from
the SIFMA table, see infra note 756. The Commission estimates the total cost of review for each
clearing agency as follows: ((Board Review for 32 hours at $1000 per hour) + (Management
Review for 16 hours at $461 per hour)) = $39,376.

costs on covered clearing agencies. 756 These costs generally include assessment costs to
determine compliance with the adopted rules and costs related to new policies and procedures
and updates to existing policies and procedures required by the rules. In Part IV.C, the
Commission estimates the burdens of these implementation requirements for covered clearing
agencies.
For a new entrant into the set of covered clearing agencies from the set of registered
clearing agencies, the Commission estimates the startup compliance costs associated with
policies and procedures to be $592,215, 757 and compliance costs associated with the
determinations process under Rule 17Ab2-2 to be $7,764. 758 Based on its supervisory

756

To monetize the internal costs the Commission staff used data from the SIFMA
publications, Management and Professional Earnings in the Security Industry—2013, and Office
Salaries in the Securities Industry—2013, modified by the Commission staff to account for an
1800 hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 (professionals) or 2.93 (office) to account for
bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and overhead. These figures have been adjusted for
inflation using data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Commission staff also
estimated an hourly rate for a Chief Financial Officer. The website www.salary.com reports that
median CFO annual salaries in 2016 were $306,789. A Grant Thornton LLP survey estimated
that in 2016 public company CFOs will receive an average annual salary of $303,975. Using an
approximate midpoint of these two estimates of $305,000 per year, and dividing by an 1800-hour
work year and multiplying by the 5.35 factor which normally is used to include benefits but here
is used as an approximation to offset the fact that New York salaries are typically higher than the
rest of the country, the result is $906 per hour.
757

The total initial cost for an entrant that is not a CSD and does engage in activities with a
more complex risk profile was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 428 hours
at $440 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney for 365 hours at $334 per hour) + (Administrative
Assistant for 2 hours at $76 per hour) + (Computer Operations Department Manager for 300
hours at $416 per hour) + (Senior Business Analyst for 85 hours at $259 per hour) + (Senior Risk
Management Specialist for 114 hours at $338 per hour) + (Chief Compliance Office for 102
hours at $501 per hour) + (Senior Programmer for 53 hours at $313 per hour) + (Chief Financial
Officer for 50 hours at $906 per hour) + (Financial Analyst for 70 hours at $259 per hour)) =
$626,850.
758

The total cost associated with determinations under Rule 17Ab2-2 was calculated as
follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 2 hours at $440 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney for 3
373

experience, the Commission believes that in many cases registered clearing agencies are already
in compliance with many of the requirements included in the rules, so this cost represents an
upper bound on upfront costs. Conditioned on its current understanding of current market
practice at covered clearing agencies, the Commission estimates that the total costs across all
existing covered clearing agencies will be $4,268,075. 759 The Commission estimates that in the
aggregate existing covered clearing agencies would be subject to ongoing costs associated with
the rule in the amount of approximately $926,603 per year. 760
A benefit of the rules that the Commission is able to quantify is the impact of QCCP
status of OCC to non-U.S. bank clearing members at OCC. This benefit comes as a result of
lower capital requirements against exposures to QCCPs relative to non-qualifying CCPs. In Part
III.B.1.e, the Commission provided an estimate of the upper bound of this benefit, $1.2 billion
per year, or 0.73% of the aggregate 2015 net income reported by bank clearing members at OCC.
The Commission believes that the actual benefits flowing from QCCP status would likely be
higher due to benefits for foreign bank members of FICC and ICEEU, in addition to the benefits
hours at $300 per hour) + (Outside Counsel for 5 hours at $400 per hour)) x 2 registered clearing
agencies = $7,764.
759

The total initial cost was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 2,906
hours at $440 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney for 2,475 hours at $334 per hour) +
(Administrative Assistant for 14 hours at $76 per hour) + (Computer Operations Department
Manager for 2,030 hours at $416 per hour) + (Senior Business Analyst for 565 hours at $259 per
hour) + (Senior Risk Management Specialist for 773 hours at $338per hour) + (Chief
Compliance Office for 699 hours at $501 per hour) + (Senior Programmer for 361 hours at $313
per hour) + (Chief Financial Officer for 350 hours at $906 per hour) + (Financial Analyst for 490
hours at $259 per hour) + (Intermediate Accountant for 15 hours at $162 per hour)) =
$4,268,075.
760

The total ongoing cost was calculated as follows: ((Compliance Attorney for 1,851 hours
at $334 per hour) + (Administrative Assistant for 137 hours at $76 per hour) + (Senior Business
Analyst for 151 hours at $259 per hour) + (Senior Risk Management Specialist for 70 hours at
$338 per hour) + (Risk Management Specialist for 1,251 hours at $188 per hour)) = $926,603.

374

with respect to OCC discussed above. 761
The Commission believes that the rules will result in an increase in financial stability
insofar as they result in minimum standards at covered clearing agencies that are higher than
those standards implied by current practices at covered clearing agencies. Some of this increased
stability may come as a result of lower activity as the adopted rules cause participants to
internalize a greater proportion of the costs that their activity imposes on the financial system,
reducing the costs of default, conditional on a default event occurring. Increased stability may
also come as a result of higher risk management standards at covered clearing agencies that
effectively lower the probability that either covered clearing agencies or their members default.
IV. Paperwork Reduction Act
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”) imposes certain requirements on federal
agencies in connection with the conducting or sponsoring of any “collection of information.” 762
An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of
information unless it displays a currently valid control number. Further, 44 U.S.C. 3507(a)
provides that, before adopting or revising a collection of information requirement, an agency
must, among other things, publish notice in the Federal Register stating that the agency has
submitted the proposed collection of information to the Office of Management and Budget
(“OMB”) and setting forth certain required information, including (i) a title for the collection of
information; (ii) a summary of the collection of information; (iii) a brief description of the need
for the information and the proposed use of the information; (iv) a description of the likely
respondents and proposed frequency of response to the collection of information; (v) an estimate
761

See supra note 689 and accompanying text.

762

See 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.; 44 U.S.C. 3502(3).

375

of the paperwork burden that shall result from the collection of information; and (vi) notice that
comments may be submitted to the agency and director of OMB. 763
Certain provisions of Rule 17Ad-22(e) impose new collection of information
requirements under the PRA. The Commission submitted these collections of information to the
OMB for review in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507 and 5 CFR 1320.11. Because the
Commission is revising the collection of information under Rule 17Ad-22 to account for new
Rule 17Ad-22(e), the Commission will use the same title and control number: “Clearing Agency
Standards for Operation and Governance,” OMB Control No. 3235-0695. Since Rule 17Ab2-2
contains a new collection of information requirement, the title and control number are
“Determinations Affecting Covered Clearing Agencies,” OMB Control No. 3235-0728.
The Commission provided notice of the below PRA estimates in the CCA Standards
proposing release and received no comments in response. 764 As discussed further below, the
Commission has modified the final PRA estimates to account for the modifications to Rules
17Ad-22(e) and 17Ab2-2 described in Part II and to Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1) described in Part I.C.3.
A. Summary of Collection of Information and Use of Information
Below is a summary of the collection of information and the use of information for Rules
17Ad-22(e) and 17Ab2-2. The Commission received no comments regarding the summary or
the use of information. In addition, because the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1) in
response to comments addressed above, Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1) is also discussed below. 765 The
Commission notes that the policies and procedures would also be used by the Commission as
763

See 44 U.S.C. 3507(a)(1)(D); see also 5 CFR 1320.5(a)(1)(iv).

376

part of its ongoing efforts to monitor and enforce compliance with the federal securities laws
through, among other things, examinations and inspections.
1. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
for a well-founded, clear, transparent and enforceable legal basis for each aspect of its activities
in all relevant jurisdictions. The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) as proposed. 766
The purpose of this information collection is to reduce the potential for legal risk at
covered clearing agencies, such as the risk that participants face legal uncertainty due to a lack of
clarity or completeness regarding conflicts with applicable laws.
2. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)
As proposed, Rules 17Ad-22(e)(2)(i) through (iii) would require a covered clearing
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to provide for governance arrangements that are clear and transparent, clearly prioritize
the safety and efficiency of the covered clearing agency, and support the public interest
requirements in Section 17A of the Exchange Act and the objectives of owners and participants.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)(iv) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
for governance arrangements establishing that the board of directors and senior management
have appropriate experience and skills to discharge their duties and responsibilities. 767

766

See supra Part II.C.1.

767

See supra Part II.C.2.

377

The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) with two modifications, as previously
discussed in Part II.C.2.c. First, the Commission is adding new paragraph (v) to require policies
and procedures that specify clear and direct lines of responsibility. The Commission believes
that clearly delineating lines of responsibility will help foster accountability of the board of
directors and senior management, a concern expressed by commenters. The Commission also
believes that this requirement complements the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(iv) addressing
the qualifications of the board and management. 768 Second, the Commission is adopting new
paragraph (vi) to require a covered clearing agency’s governance arrangements to consider the
interests of participants’ customers, securities issuers and holders, and other relevant
stakeholders of the covered clearing agency. The Commission believes that the comments
received in response to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2), at a general level, express concern as to whether a
covered clearing agency will have governance arrangements sufficiently robust to incorporate
the views of the relevant stakeholders and to withstand the influence of potentially improper
incentives. The Commission believes that this modification helps mitigate these concerns by
adding a requirement to consider the interests of the relevant stakeholders. The Commission also
believes that they complement the other requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) and flow from the
existing requirements in Section 17A of the Exchange Act, in particular the fair representation,
investor protection, and public interest requirements discussed previously. 769
The purpose of this information collection is to prioritize the safety and efficiency of
covered clearing agencies, to help ensure that each covered clearing agency’s governance
arrangements consider the interests of the relevant stakeholders, to promote the establishment of
768

See supra Part II.C.2.b.iii.

769

See supra Part II.C.2.c.

378

boards of directors at covered clearing agencies that are composed of qualified members with
clear and direct lines of responsibility, and to promote accountability of the board of directors
and senior management.
3. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain a sound risk management framework for comprehensively managing legal, credit,
liquidity, operational, general business, investment, custody, and other risks that arise in or are
borne by the covered clearing agency. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(i) would require a covered
clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to provide for risk management policies, procedures, and systems designed
to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the range of risks that arise in or are borne by the
covered clearing agency, and subject them to review on a specified periodic basis and approval
by the board of directors annually. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(ii) would require a covered
clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to ensure it establishes plans for the recovery and orderly wind-down of the
covered clearing agency necessitated by credit losses, liquidity shortfalls, losses from general
business risk, or any other losses. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(iii) would require a covered
clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to provide risk management and internal audit personnel with sufficient
authority, resources, independence from management, and access to the board of directors.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(iv) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide

379

risk management and internal audit personnel with oversight by and a direct reporting line to a
risk management committee and an audit committee of the board of directors, respectively.
Proposed Rule 17A-22(e)(3)(v) would require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for an
independent audit committee.
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) with one modification. To make clear
that the audit committee described in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(iv) and the independent audit
committee described in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(v) are not separate audit committees, the
Commission is adding “independent” before audit committee in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(iv). 770
The purpose of this information collection is to enhance each covered clearing agency’s
ability to identify, monitor, and manage the risks that covered clearing agencies face, including
by subjecting the relevant policies and procedures to regular review, and to facilitate an orderly
recovery and wind-down process in the event that a covered clearing agency is unable to
continue operating as a going concern.
4. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
effectively identify, measure, monitor, and manage its credit exposures to participants and those
exposures arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement processes.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain sufficient financial resources to cover its credit exposure to each participant fully with a
770

See supra Part II.C.3.

380

high degree of confidence. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii) would require a covered clearing
agency that provides CCP services, and that is “systemically important in multiple jurisdictions”
or “a clearing agency involved in activities with a more complex risk profile,” to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain additional financial resources, to the extent not already maintained pursuant to
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i), at a minimum level necessary to enable it to cover a wide range
of foreseeable stress scenarios, including but not limited to the default of the two participant
families that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for the covered
clearing agency in extreme but plausible market conditions (hereinafter the “cover two”
requirement). Meanwhile, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iii) would require a covered clearing
agency that is not subject to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii) to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain additional financial
resources, to the extent not already maintained pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i), at
the minimum to enable it to cover a wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios, including the
default of the participant family that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit
exposure for the covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible market conditions (hereinafter
the “cover one” requirement). Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iv) would require a covered
clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to include prefunded financial resources, excluding assessments for
additional guaranty fund contributions or other resources that are not prefunded, when
calculating the financial resources available to meet the standards under proposed Rules 17Ad22(e)(4)(i) through (iii), as applicable. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(v) would require a covered
clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures

381

reasonably designed to maintain the financial resources required under proposed Rules 17Ad22(e)(4)(i) through (iii), as applicable, in combined or separately maintained clearing or guaranty
funds.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to test the
sufficiency of its total financial resources available to meet the minimum financial resource
requirements under proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iii), as applicable, by conducting a
stress test of its total financial resources at least once each day using standard predetermined
parameters and assumptions. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi) would also require a covered
clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to conduct a comprehensive analysis on at least a monthly basis of the
existing stress testing scenarios, models, and underlying parameters and assumptions, and
consider modifications to ensure they are appropriate for determining the covered clearing
agency’s required level of default protection in light of current market conditions. When the
products cleared or markets served by a covered clearing agency display high volatility or
become less liquid, and when the size or concentration of positions held by the entity’s
participants increases significantly, the proposed rule would require a covered clearing agency to
have policies and procedures for conducting comprehensive analyses of stress testing scenarios,
models, and underlying parameters and assumptions more frequently than monthly. Proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi) would also require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for the
reporting of the results of this analysis to the appropriate decision makers at the covered clearing
agency, including its risk management committee or board of directors, and to require the use of

382

the results to evaluate the adequacy of and to adjust its margin methodology, model parameters,
and any other relevant aspects of its credit risk management policies and procedures, in
supporting compliance with the minimum financial resources requirements in proposed Rules
17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iii), as applicable. 771
Finally, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vii) would require a covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to require a conforming model validation for its credit risk models to be performed not less than
annually or more frequently as may be contemplated by the covered clearing agency’s risk
management policies and procedures. The Commission also proposed to define “conforming
model validation” to mean an evaluation of the performance of each material risk management
model used by a covered clearing agency, including initial margin models, liquidity risk models,
and models used to generate guaranty fund requirements, along with the related parameters and
assumptions associated with such models. The proposed definition would further require that the
model validation be performed by a qualified person who is free from influence from the persons
responsible for the development or operation of the models or policies being validated so that
risk models can be candidly assessed. 772
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) with modifications, as previously
discussed in Part II.C.4.c. The Commission is adopting two modifications to Rule 17Ad22(e)(4)(vii). First, because the Commission is modifying the definition of “conforming model
validation” by striking “conforming,” as previously discussed in Part II.C.4.c, the Commission is
modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vii) to conform to the revised definition. Second, to be consistent
771

See id. at 29526–27.

772

See supra Part II.C.4.

383

with the corresponding requirement for model validation of liquidity risk models in Rule 17Ad22(e)(7)(vii), the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vii) by striking “to be
performed.” 773
The Commission is also adopting four other modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4), as
previously discussed in Part II.C.4.c. First, the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(v)
so that it references only paragraphs (e)(4)(ii) and (iii) (and not paragraph (e)(4)(i)), consistent
with the Commission’s discussion of the proposed rule in the CCA Standards proposing release.
Second, to make clear that prefunded financial resources should be exclusive of assessments for
additional guaranty fund contributions or other resources that are not prefunded, the Commission
is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iv) to state “exclusive of” assessments rather than “excluding”
assessments. Third, the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi)(A) to refer to “stress
testing” rather than “a stress test” to improve consistency with the definition of “stress testing” in
Rule 17Ad-22(a)(17). Fourth, the Commission is revising Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi)(C) to replace
“and” with “or” so that the criteria for conducting analysis more frequently than monthly are
disjunctive rather than conjunctive, since the criteria described may not be correlated to each
other. Fifth, the Commission is correcting a technical error in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi)(D):
references to paragraphs (e)(4)(iv)(B) and (C) will be changed to paragraphs (e)(4)(vi)(B) and
(C) respectively. Sixth, the Commission is moving requirements proposed in Rule 17Ad22(e)(13) to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) so that all requirements pertinent to a covered clearing agency’s
management of credit risk are contained in one rule. This modification is discussed below in
Part IV.A.13. 774
773

See supra Part II.C.4.c.

774

See also supra Part II.C.13.c.
384

The purpose of this information collection is to identify and limit credit exposures to
participants and to satisfy all of its settlement obligations in the event of a participant default, to
address the allocation of credit losses if collateral and other resources are insufficient to fully
cover its credit exposures following a participant default, and to describe the covered clearing
agency’s process to replenish financial resources following such a default.
5. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit
the assets it accepts as collateral to those with low credit, liquidity, and market risks, and also
require policies that set and enforce appropriately conservative haircuts and concentration limits
if the covered clearing agency requires collateral to manage its own or its participants’ credit
exposures. In addition, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) would require a covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to include a not-less-than-annual review of the sufficiency of a covered clearing agency’s
collateral haircuts and concentration limits. The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) as
proposed. 775
The purpose of the information collection is to enable a covered clearing agency to be
able to maintain sufficient collateral by using appropriately conservative haircuts and
concentration limits.
6. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) would require a covered clearing agency that provides
CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
775

See supra Part II.C.5.

385

reasonably designed to cover its credit exposures to its participants by establishing a risk-based
margin system that is monitored by management on an ongoing basis and regularly reviewed,
tested, and verified. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(i) would require a covered clearing agency
that provides CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to result in a margin system that, at a minimum, considers and
produces margin levels commensurate with the risks and particular attributes of each relevant
product, portfolio, and market. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(ii) would require a covered
clearing agency that provides CCP services to establish implement, maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the margin system would mark
participant positions to market and collect margin, including variation margin or equivalent
charges if relevant, at least daily, and include the authority and operational capacity to make
intraday margin calls in defined circumstances. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(iii) would require
a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to calculate margin sufficient to
cover its potential future exposure to participants in the interval between the last margin
collection and the close out of positions following a participant default. Proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(6)(iv) would require a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that it uses reliable sources of timely price data and procedures and sound valuation models for
addressing circumstances in which pricing data are not readily available or reliable. Proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(v) would require a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed

386

to ensure the use of an appropriate method for measuring credit exposure that accounts for
relevant product risk factors and portfolio effects across products.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi) would require a covered clearing agency that provides
CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to establish a risk-based margin system that is monitored by management on
an ongoing basis. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi) would also require a covered clearing
agency that provides CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to regularly review, test, and verify its risk-based margin
system by conducting backtests of its margin resources at least once each day using standard
predetermined parameters and assumptions. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi) would require a
covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to regularly review, test, and verify
its risk-based margin system by conducting a conforming sensitivity analysis of its margin
resources and its parameters and assumptions for backtesting on at least a monthly basis, and
considering modifications to ensure the backtesting practices are appropriate for determining the
adequacy of the covered clearing agency’s margin resources. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi)
would require a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to regularly review,
test, and verify its risk-based margin system by conducting a conforming sensitivity analysis of
its margin resources and its parameters and assumptions for backtesting more frequently than
monthly during periods of time when the products cleared or markets served display high
volatility or become less liquid, and when the size or concentration of positions held by the
covered clearing agency’s participants increases or decreases significantly. Proposed Rule

387

17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi) would require a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to regularly review, test, and verify its risk-based margin system by reporting the results of its
analyses above to appropriate decision makers at the covered clearing agency, including but not
limited to, its risk management committee or board of directors, and using these results to
evaluate the adequacy of and adjust its margin methodology, model parameters, and any other
relevant aspects of its credit risk management framework. 776
Finally, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vii) would require a covered clearing agency that
provides CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to require not less than annually a conforming model validation
of the covered clearing agency’s margin system and related models. 777
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) with modifications, as previously
discussed in Part II.C.6.c. First, the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) to remove
references to “conforming” consistent with the modification to the definitions of “sensitivity
“analysis” discussed in Part II.C.6.c and of “model validation” discussed in Part II.C.4.c.
Second, to improve clarity, the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(v) to require
policies and procedures that use reliable sources of timely price data and that “use” procedures
and sound valuation models for addressing circumstances in which pricing data are not readily
available or reliable. Third, because backtests are conducted with respect to the margin model
and not margin resources, the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi)(A) to replace
the phrase “margin resources” with “margin model.” Fourth, to avoid conflating sensitivity

analysis with backtesting, the Commission is modifying Rules 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi)(B) and (C) to
clarify that a sensitivity analysis should be conducted of the margin model and not of margin
resources. Fifth, the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi)(C) to replace “and” with
“or” so that the criteria for conducting analysis more frequently than monthly are disjunctive
rather than conjunctive, since the criteria described may not be correlated to each other.
The purpose of the information collection is to enable a covered clearing agency to be
able to collect sufficient margin subject to regular sensitivity analysis, monthly backtesting, and
an annual model validation.
7. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
effectively measure, monitor, and manage the liquidity risk that arises in or is borne by it, by
meeting, at a minimum, the ten requirements specified in the rule.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) would require that a covered clearing agency’s policies
and procedures be reasonably designed to ensure that it maintains sufficient liquid resources in
all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where appropriate, intraday and multiday
settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of
potential stress scenarios that includes the default of the participant family that would generate
the largest aggregate payment obligation for it in extreme but plausible market conditions.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that it holds qualifying liquid resources sufficient to meet the minimum liquidity resource

389

requirement in each relevant currency for which the covered clearing agency has payment
obligations owed to clearing members.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
it uses accounts and services at a Federal Reserve Bank, pursuant to Section 806(a) of the
Clearing Supervision Act, or other relevant central bank, when available and where determined
to be practical by the board of directors of the covered clearing agency, to enhance its
management of liquidity risk.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iv) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
it undertakes due diligence to confirm that it has a reasonable basis to believe each of its liquidity
providers, whether or not such liquidity provider is a clearing member, has sufficient information
to understand and manage the liquidity provider’s liquidity risks, and the capacity to perform as
required under its commitments to provide liquidity.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(v) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that the covered clearing agency maintains and, on at least an annual basis, tests with each
liquidity provider, to the extent practicable, its procedures and operational capacity for accessing
each type of relevant liquidity resource.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(A) through (C) would require a covered clearing
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to determine the amount and regularly test the sufficiency of the liquid resources held
for purposes of meeting the minimum liquid resource requirement of proposed Rule 17Ad-

390

22(e)(7)(i) by (A) conducting a stress test of its liquidity resources at least once each day using
standard and predetermined parameters and assumptions; (B) conducting a comprehensive
analysis of the existing stress testing scenarios, models, and underlying parameters and
assumptions used in evaluating liquidity needs and resources, and considering modifications to
ensure they are appropriate for determining the covered clearing agency’s identified liquidity
needs and resources in light of current and evolving market conditions at least once each month;
and (C) conducting a comprehensive analysis of the existing stress testing scenarios, models, and
underlying parameters and assumptions used in evaluating liquidity needs and resources more
frequently when products cleared or markets served display high volatility or become less liquid,
when the size or concentration of positions held by participants increases significantly, or in
other circumstances described in the covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(D) would also require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to result in
reporting the results of the analyses performed under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(B) and
(C) to appropriate decision makers, including the risk management committee or board of
directors, at the covered clearing agency for use in evaluating the adequacy of and adjusting its
liquidity risk management framework.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to result in
performing an annual or more frequent conforming model validation of its liquidity risk
models. 778
778

See id.; see also supra notes 275–305 and accompanying text (discussing generally the
requirements accompanying the definition of “model validation”).

391

Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(viii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to address
foreseeable liquidity shortfalls that would not be covered by its liquid resources and seek to
avoid unwinding, revoking, or delaying the same-day settlement of payment obligations.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ix) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to describe
its process for replenishing any liquid resources that it may employ during a stress event.
Finally, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(x) would require a covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to ensure that it, at least once a year, evaluates the feasibility of maintaining sufficient liquid
resources at a minimum in all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where appropriate,
intraday and multiday settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under
a wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios that includes, but is not limited to, the default of the
two participant families that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for the
covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible market conditions if the covered clearing
agency provides CCP services and is either systemically important in multiple jurisdictions or a
clearing agency involved in activities with a more complex risk profile. 779
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) with modifications, as previously
discussed in Part II.C.7.c. First, the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(A) to
refer to “stress testing” rather than “a stress test” to improve consistency with the definition of
“stress testing” in Rule 17Ad-22(a)(17). Second, the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad22(e)(7)(vi)(C) in two ways. To improve consistency with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi)(C), the
779

See supra Part II.C.7.

392

Commission is adding “or” to link “display high volatility” with “become less liquid” because
these concepts are intended to describe events related to the products cleared or markets served.
The Commission is also replacing “and” with “or” in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(C) so that the
criteria for conducting analysis more frequently than monthly are disjunctive rather than
conjunctive, since the list of criteria is open to other appropriate circumstances described in a
covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures and may not be correlated. Third, the
Commission is making two modifications in adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(D) to correct
technical errors in the proposed rule text: (i) references to paragraphs (e)(6)(vii)(B) and (C) will
be changed to paragraphs (e)(7)(vi)(B) and (C) respectively; and (ii) the rule will refer to the
covered clearing agency’s “liquidity” risk management framework, rather than its “credit” risk
management framework. Fourth, the Commission is striking “conforming” from Rule 17Ad22(e)(7)(vii) to be consistent with the modifications to the definition of “model validation”
discussed in Part II.C.4.c.
The purpose of this information collection is to identify and limit liquidity risk so that a
covered clearing agency can satisfy its settlement obligations on an ongoing and timely basis by
holding a sufficient amount of qualifying liquid resources and performing regular stress testing
of its liquid resources. The purpose of this information collection is also to help ensure that a
covered clearing agency addresses foreseeable liquidity shortfalls and can replenish any liquid
resources that it may employ in a stress event. The purpose of this information collection is also
to help ensure that a covered clearing agency manages the risks posed by its liquidity providers.
8. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to define

393

the point at which settlement is final no later than the end of the day on which the payment or
obligation is due and, where necessary or appropriate, intraday or in real time. 780
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) with one modification, as previously
discussed in Part II.C.8.c. To remove potential ambiguity as to the timing of settlement finality
under the rule, the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) to state that the point at which
settlement is final is “to be” no later than the end of the day on which the payment or obligation
is due and, where necessary or appropriate, intraday or in real time.
The purpose of this information collection is to promote consistent standards of timing
and reliability in the settlement process.
9. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to conduct
its money settlements in central bank money, where available and determined to be practical by
the board of directors of the covered clearing agency, and minimizes and manages credit and
liquidity risk arising from conducting its money settlements in commercial bank money if central
bank money is not used by the covered clearing agency. The Commission is adopting Rule
17Ad-22(e)(9) as proposed. 781
The purpose of this information collection is to promote reliability in a covered clearing
agency’s settlement operations.

780

See supra Part II.C.8.

781

See supra Part II.C.9.

394

10. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
establish and maintain transparent written standards that state its obligations with respect to the
delivery of physical instruments and operational practices that identify, monitor, and manage the
risk associated with such physical deliveries. The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10)
as proposed. 782
The purpose of this information collection is to provide a covered clearing agency’s
participants with the information necessary to evaluate the risks and costs associated with
participation in the covered clearing agency.
11. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(i) would require a covered clearing agency that
provides CSD services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to maintain securities in an immobilized or dematerialized form
for their transfer by book entry, ensure the integrity of securities issues, and minimize and
manage the risks associated with the safekeeping and transfer of securities. Proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(11)(ii) would require a covered clearing agency that provides CSD services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to implement internal auditing and other controls to safeguard the rights of securities issuers and
holders and prevent the unauthorized creation or deletion of securities, and conduct periodic and
at least daily reconciliation of securities issues it maintains. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(iii)
would require a covered clearing agency that provides CSD services to establish, implement,
782

See supra Part II.C.10.

395

maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to protect assets
against custody risk through appropriate rules and procedures consistent with relevant laws,
rules, and regulations in jurisdictions where it operates. The Commission is adopting Rule
17Ad-22(e)(11) as proposed. 783
The purpose of this information collection is to reduce securities transfer processing costs
and the risks associated with securities settlement and custody, as well as increase the speed and
efficiency of the settlement process.
12. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) would require a covered clearing agency, for
transactions that involve the settlement of two linked obligations, to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to eliminate principal
risk by conditioning the final settlement of one obligation upon the final settlement of the other,
regardless of whether the covered clearing agency settles on a gross or net basis and when
finality occurs. The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) as proposed. 784
The purpose of this information collection is to promote the elimination of principal risk
in transactions with linked obligations.
13. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that the covered clearing agency has the authority and operational capacity to take timely action
to contain losses and liquidity demands and continue to meet its obligations in the event of a
783

See supra Part II.C.11.

784

See supra Part II.C.12.

396

participant default. Proposed rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)(i) would require a covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to address the allocation of credit losses it may face if its collateral and other resources are
insufficient to fully cover its credit exposures, including the repayment of any funds the covered
clearing agency may borrow from liquidity providers. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)(ii) would
require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to describe its process to replenish any financial resources it
may use following a member default or other event in which use of such resources is
contemplated. Finally, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)(iii) would require a covered clearing
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to require the covered clearing agency’s participants and, when practicable, other
stakeholders to participate in the testing and review of its default procedures, including any
close-out procedures, at least annually and following material changes thereto. 785
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) with modifications, as previously
discussed in Part II.C.13.c and noted in Part IV.A.4. The Commission is moving the
requirements in proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(13)(i) and (ii) to Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(viii) and (ix),
respectively, to consolidate requirements for management of a covered clearing agency’s default
waterfall within a single rule. The Commission believes this modification improves consistency
between Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) and (7). Specifically, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) includes requirements
intended to facilitate the management of credit risk, and proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(13)(i) and
(ii) include requirements to address the allocation of credit losses and the replenishment of funds.
Similarly, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) includes requirements intended to facilitate the management of
785

See supra Part II.C.13.

397

liquidity risk, and Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(viii) and (ix) include requirements to address liquidity
shortfalls and replenish liquid resources. In contrast, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) is intended to ensure
that a covered clearing agency has policies and procedures addressing its authority and
operational capacity to take timely action to contain losses and liquidity demands, and proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)(iii) includes requirements related to the testing of default procedures.
The purpose of this information collection is to facilitate the functioning of a covered
clearing agency in the event that a participant fails to meet its obligations, as well as limit the
extent to which a participant’s failure can spread to other participants or the covered clearing
agency itself.
14. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) would require a covered clearing agency that is a
security-based swap clearing agency or a complex risk profile clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to enable
the segregation and portability of positions of a member’s customers and the collateral provided
to the covered clearing agency with respect to those positions, and effectively protect such
positions and related collateral from the default or insolvency of that member. The Commission
is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) as proposed. 786
The purpose of this information collection is to facilitate the safe and effective holding
and transfer of customers’ positions and collateral in the event of a participant’s default or
insolvency.

786

See supra Part II.C.14.

398

15. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
identify, monitor, and manage its general business risk and hold sufficient liquid net assets
funded by equity to cover potential general business losses so that the covered clearing agency
can continue operations and services as a going concern if those losses materialize. Proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(i) would require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to determine the
amount of liquid net assets funded by equity based upon its general business risk profile and the
length of time required to achieve a recovery or orderly wind-down, as appropriate, of its critical
operations and services if such action is taken. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(ii) would require
a clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to provide for holding liquid net assets funded by equity equal to the greater
of either six months of its current operating expenses or the amount determined by the board of
directors to be sufficient to ensure a recovery or orderly wind-down of critical operations and
services of the covered clearing agency, as contemplated by the plans established under Rule
17Ad-22(e)(3)(ii). Additionally, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(ii) would require a covered
clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to provide for monitoring its business operations and reducing the
likelihood of losses. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(iii) would require a covered clearing agency
to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to provide for maintaining a viable plan, approved by the board of directors and
updated at least annually, for raising additional equity should its equity fall close to or below the

399

amount required by the rule, as discussed above. The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad22(e)(15) as proposed. 787
The purpose of this information collection is to mitigate the potential impairment of a
covered clearing agency as a result of a decline in revenues or increase in expenses.
16. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
safeguard its own and its participants’ assets and minimize the risk of loss and delay in access to
these assets. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) would also require a covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to invest such assets in instruments with minimal credit, market, and liquidity risks. The
Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) as proposed. 788
The purpose of this information collection is to improve the ability of a covered clearing
agency to meet its settlement obligations.
17. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage
the covered clearing agency’s operational risk. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(i) would require
a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to identify the plausible sources of operational risk, both internal
and external, and mitigate their impact through the use of appropriate systems, policies,
787

See supra Part II.C.15.

788

See supra Part II.C.16.

400

procedures, and controls. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(ii) would require a covered clearing
agency to establish, implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to ensure that systems have a high degree of security, resiliency, operational reliability,
and adequate, scalable capacity. Finally, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(iii) would require a
covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to provide for a business continuity plan that addresses events
posing a significant risk of disrupting operations.
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) with one modification: because the
text in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(ii) for “establishing and maintaining policies and procedures
reasonably designed” is duplicative of the requirement under Rule 17Ad-22(e) to have policies
and procedures reasonably designed to establish, maintain, implement, and enforce the
requirements thereunder, the Commission is removing the duplicative text. 789
The purpose of this information collection is to limit operational disruptions that may
impede the proper functioning of a covered clearing agency.
18. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
establish objective, risk-based, and publicly disclosed criteria for participation, which permit fair
and open access by direct and, where relevant, indirect participants and other FMUs. Proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) would also require that a covered clearing agency establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require participants
to have sufficient financial resources and robust operational capacity to meet obligations arising
789

See supra Part II.C.17.

401

from participation in the clearing agency and to monitor compliance with participation
requirements on an ongoing basis. The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) as
proposed. 790
The purpose of this information collection is to enable a covered clearing agency to
ensure that only entities with sufficient financial and operational capacity are direct participants
in the covered clearing agency, while still ensuring that all qualified persons can access a
covered clearing agency’s services. The purpose of this information collection is also to enable a
covered clearing agency to monitor that participation requirements are met on an ongoing basis
and to identify a participant experiencing financial difficulties before the participant fails to meet
its settlement obligations.
19. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
identify, monitor, and manage the material risks to the covered clearing agency arising from
arrangements in which firms that are indirect participants in the covered clearing agency rely on
the services provided by direct participants in the covered clearing agency to access the covered
clearing agency’s payment, clearing, or settlement facilities (hereinafter “tiered participation
arrangements”). In addition, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) would also require that a covered
clearing agency establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to regularly review the material risks to the covered clearing agency arising

790

See supra Part II.C.18.

402

from such tiered participation arrangements. The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19)
as proposed. 791
The purpose of this information collection is to enable a covered clearing agency to
identify and manage risks posed by non-member entities, such as the customers of clearing
members.
20. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
identify, monitor, and manage risks related to any link with one or more other clearing agencies,
FMUs, or trading markets. 792 The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) as proposed.
The purpose of this information collection is to enable a covered clearing agency to
identify and manage risks posed by linkages to other entities, such as other clearing agencies,
FMUs, or trading markets.
21. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that it is efficient and effective in meeting the requirements of its participants and the markets it
serves. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) would also require a covered clearing agency’s
management to regularly review the efficiency and effectiveness of its (i) clearing and settlement
arrangements; (ii) operating structure, including risk management policies, procedures, and

791

See supra Part II.C.19.

792

See supra Part II.C.20.

403

systems; (iii) scope of products cleared, settled, or recorded; and (iv) use of technology and
communication procedures.
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) with one modification: the
Commission is removing reference to “recorded” products under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21)(iii)
because recording products is not a function of covered clearing agencies. . 793
The purpose of this information collection is to ensure that the services provided by a
covered clearing agency do not become inefficient and to promote the sound operation of a
covered clearing agency.
22. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that it uses, or at a minimum accommodates, relevant internationally accepted communication
procedures and standards in order to facilitate efficient payment, clearing, and settlement. The
Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) as proposed. 794
The purpose of this information collection is to ensure the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transactions by enabling participants to communicate with a clearing
agency in a timely, reliable, and accurate manner.
23. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)
As proposed, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain clear and comprehensive rules and procedures that provide for the specific disclosures
793

See supra Part II.C.21.

794

See supra Part II.C.22.

404

enumerated in the rule, as discussed below. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) would require such
policies and procedures to specifically require a covered clearing agency to (i) publicly disclose
all relevant rules and material procedures, including key aspects of its default rules and
procedures; (ii) provide sufficient information to enable participants to identify and evaluate the
risks, fees, and other material costs they incur by participating in the covered clearing agency;
and (iii) publicly disclose relevant basic data on transaction volume and values.
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain clear and comprehensive rules and procedures that provide for a comprehensive public
disclosure of its material rules, policies, and procedures regarding governance arrangements and
legal, financial, and operational risk management, accurate in all material respects at the time of
publication, including (i) a general background of the covered clearing agency, including its
function and the market it serves, basic data and performance statistics on its services and
operations, such as basic volume and value statistics by product type, average aggregate intraday
exposures to its participants, and statistics on the covered clearing agency’s operational
reliability, and a description of its general organization, legal and regulatory framework, and
system design and operations; (ii) a standard-by-standard summary narrative for each applicable
standard set forth in proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1) through (22) with sufficient detail and
context to enable the reader to understand its approach to controlling the risks and addressing the
requirements in each standard; (iii) a summary of material changes since the last update of the
disclosure; and (iv) an executive summary of the key points regarding each. Rule 17Ad22(e)(23)(v) would also require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure the comprehensive public

405

disclosure required under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv) is updated not less than every two
years, or more frequently following changes to its system or the environment in which it operates
to the extent necessary, to ensure statements previously provided remain accurate in all material
respects. 795
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) with three modifications, as
previously discussed in Part II.C.23.c. First, the Commission is striking the language “maintain
clear and comprehensive rules and procedures” under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) because Rule 17Ad22(e) already requires that a covered clearing agency have written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to establish, implement, maintain and enforce the requirements thereunder.
Consistent with this change, the Commission is also striking “providing” from Rule 17Ad22(e)(23)(iv). Second, the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv) so that the
language more closely tracks the categories of requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e). The purpose of
this modification is to make clear that the comprehensive public disclosure is intended to
describe the material rules, policies and procedures of the covered clearing agency related to
compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e), rather than require a complete disclosure of all rules, policies,
and procedures. As adopted, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv) will require policies and procedures
providing for a comprehensive public disclosure that describes the covered clearing agency’s
material rules, policies, and procedures regarding its legal, governance, risk management, and
operating framework, accurate in all material respects at the time of publication. Third, the
Commission is also modifying paragraph (iv)(D) to correct technical errors in the proposed rule
text so that it refers to the standards set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) through (23) (rather than (e)(1)
through (22)). The Commission believes that providing a summary narrative for Rule 17Ad795

See supra Part II.C.23.

406

22(e)(23) is appropriate because Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) requires policies and procedures to (i)
publicly disclose all relevant rules and material procedures, including key aspects of its default
rules and procedures; (ii) provide sufficient information to enable participants to identify and
evaluate the risks, fees, and other material costs they incur by participating in the covered
clearing agency; and (iii) publicly disclose relevant basic data on transaction volume and values,
in addition to requiring the standard-by-standard summary narrative required by Rule 17Ad22(e)(23)(iv)(D).
The purpose of this information collection is to ensure that participants and prospective
participants in a covered clearing agency are provided with a complete picture of the covered
clearing agency’s operations and risk management so that they can understand the risks and
responsibilities of participation in the covered clearing agency.
24. Rule 17Ab2-2
Proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 would establish procedures for the Commission to make
determinations affecting covered clearing agencies in three cases:
•

Pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a), the Commission may, if it deems appropriate,
upon application by any registered clearing agency or member thereof or on its own
initiative, determine whether a registered clearing agency should be considered a
covered clearing agency.

•

Pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(b), the Commission may, if it deems appropriate,
upon application by any clearing agency or member thereof, or on its own initiative,
determine whether a covered clearing agency meets the definition of “systemically
important in multiple jurisdictions.”

407

•

Pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(c), the Commission may, if it deems appropriate,
determine whether any of the activities of a clearing agency providing central
counterparty services, in addition to clearing agencies registered with the
Commission for the purpose of clearing security-based swaps, have a more complex
risk profile.

Under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(e), in each of the above cases, the Commission would
publish notice of its intention to consider such determinations, together with a brief statement of
the grounds under consideration, and provide at least a 30-day public comment period prior to
any determination. The Commission may also provide the clearing agency subject to the
proposed determination opportunity for hearing regarding the proposed determination. Under
proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(f), in each of the above cases, notice of determinations would be given
by prompt publication thereof, together with a statement of written reasons supporting the
determination. 796
The Commission is adopting Rule 17Ab2-2 with modifications. First the Commission
has determined not to adopt proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a). Second, with respect to proposed Rules
17Ab2-2(b) and (c), 797 the Commission is removing the factors that reference such other
characteristics or factors that the Commission deems appropriate in the circumstances. Third,
the Commission is adopting a new paragraph to provide for a process to rescind any
determination made pursuant to Rule 17Ab2-2. This new rule includes the same procedural
elements as for determinations for application of covered clearing agency status, including
796

See supra Part II.D.

797

Because the Commission has determined not to adopt proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a), the
Commission is renumbering Rule 17Ab2-2 accordingly, and proposed Rules 17Ab2-2(b) and (c)
will therefore appear in Rules 17Ab2-2(a) and (b) respectively. See infra Part VI.

408

publication with a 30-day comment period. Because the Commission is not adopting Rule
17Ab2-2(a), the Commission is also renumbering the remaining paragraphs accordingly.
The purpose of this information collection is to enable determinations by the Commission
regarding the status of a registered clearing agency or a covered clearing agency, as applicable
and as described above.
25. Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1)
Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1) requires that, each fiscal quarter (based on calculations made as of
the last business day of the clearing agency’s fiscal quarter), or at any time upon Commission
request, a registered clearing agency that performs CCP services shall calculate and maintain a
record, in accordance with Rule 17a-1 under the Exchange Act, 798 of the financial resources
necessary to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of Rule 17Ad-22, and sufficient
documentation to explain the methodology it uses to compute such financial resource
requirement.
In response to the comments received, 799 the Commission is modifying Rule 17Ad22(c)(1) to require a registered clearing agency that performs CCP services to calculate and
maintain a record of financial and qualifying liquid resources necessary to also meet paragraphs
(e)(4) and (e)(7), as applicable, in addition to paragraph (b)(3). Because calculations under Rule
17Ad-22(b)(3) and (e)(4) would refer to the same financial resources at a covered clearing
agency, the Commission anticipates that the calculations for each would be the same and would
involve adjustments needed to synthesize and format existing information in a manner sufficient
to explain the methodology the clearing agency uses to meet the requirements of the rule.
798

See 17 CFR 240.17a-1.

799

See supra Part I.C.3.
409

The purpose of this information collection is to require a CCP to calculate and document
its financial and qualifying liquid resources necessary under Rules 17Ad-22.
B. Respondents
In the CCA Standards proposing release, the Commission estimated that the majority of
the requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e) would have then applied to five registered clearing
agencies, each of which met the definition of “covered clearing agency.” 800 The Commission
estimated that two additional entities might seek to register with the Commission and that, of
those, one might be a security-based swap clearing agency. The Commission also noted that the
number of covered clearing agencies subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e) could increase further if either
(i) the FSOC were to designate additional clearing agencies as systemically important or (ii)
Commission determinations under Rule 17Ab2-2 found additional clearing agencies to be
covered clearing agencies. The Commission noted, however, that it could not predict whether
the FSOC might exercise such authority or whether such determinations under Rule 17Ab2-2
would be appropriate, and therefore estimated, for PRA purposes, that a majority of the
requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e) would have seven respondents, of which (i) six would be
CCPs and one would be a CSD and (ii) two would be security-based swap clearing agencies.
The Commission then further clarified that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) would only have six respondents
because it only applies to CCPs, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) would only have one respondent because

800

See CCA Standards, supra note 5, at 29566. Specifically, under the definition, four
registered clearing agencies would have been designated clearing agencies for which the
Commission is the supervisory agency, and one registered clearing agency would have been a
security-based swap clearing agency. Because of modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(a), the
definition of “covered clearing agency” is being moved to Rule 17Ad-22(a)(5). See infra Part
VI.

410

it only applies to CSDs, and Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) would only have two respondents because it
only applies to security-based swap clearing agencies.
With regard to Rule 17Ab2-2, the Commission estimated, for PRA purposes, that two
registered clearing agencies or their members on their behalf might apply for a Commission
determination or be subject to a Commission-initiated determination regarding whether the
registered clearing agency is a covered clearing agency, whether the registered clearing agency is
involved in activities with a more complex risk profile, or whether the registered clearing
agency, as a covered clearing agency, is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions. 801
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1), which the Commission is modifying in response to
comments received, 802 the affected respondents would only be covered clearing agencies because
the modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1) refer to requirements that only apply to covered
clearing agencies subject to Rule 17Ad-22(e). Accordingly, the affected respondents are the
same as under Rule 17Ad-22(e).
The Commission received no comment regarding the estimates for Rules 17Ad-22(e) and
17Ab2-2 and continues to believe that the above estimates are appropriate for the below
discussion of total annual reporting and recordkeeping burdens.
C. Total Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens
As described in the CCA Standards proposing release, the Commission believes the
information collected pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e) reflects, to a degree, existing policies and
procedures at covered clearing agencies, but in some instances a covered clearing agency will be
required to develop new policies and procedures. Thus, when a covered clearing agency reviews
801

See id. at 29567.

802

See supra Part I.C.3.

411

and updates its policies and procedures pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e), the Commission believes
that the PRA burden may vary across the requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e), depending on the
complexity of the requirement in question and the extent to which a covered clearing agency
already has policies and procedures consistent with the requirement. As a general matter, the
portions of Rule 17Ad-22(e) for which the Commission expects a higher PRA burden are those
provisions including requirements not comparable to any existing requirements under Rule
17Ad-22(d). Where the requirements do not reflect existing practices or the normal course of a
covered clearing agency’s activity, the PRA burden may entail, in addition to ongoing burdens,
initial one-time burdens to develop new policies and procedures. The Commission received no
comments regarding the accuracy of the estimated annual reporting and recordkeeping burdens
for Rules 17Ad-22(e) or 17Ab2-2.
As described in the CCA Standards proposing release, 803 the Commission continues to
believe that Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1), (8) through (10), (12), (14), (16), and (22) contain
requirements either substantially similar to those in Rule 17Ad-22(d) or reflect current practices
at covered clearing agencies. The Commission believes that a covered clearing agency may need
to make only limited changes to its policies and procedures pursuant to the requirements in these
rules. For example, a covered clearing agency may need to conduct a comparison of its existing
policies and procedures against each rule to confirm that its policies and procedures are
consistent with the requirements therein.
The Commission also continues to believe that Rules 17Ad-22(e)(2), (3), (5), (11), (13),
(17), (18), (20), and (21) contain provisions that are similar to those in Rule 17Ad-22(d) but
would also impose additional requirements not found in Rule 17Ad-22(d). The Commission
803

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29567 & nn.440–443.

412

believes that a covered clearing agency may need to make changes to update its policies and
procedures pursuant to the requirements in these rules. For example, a covered clearing agency
may need to review and amend its existing rules, policies, and procedures but may not need to
develop, design, or implement new operations or practices pursuant to these rules.
For Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4), (6), (7), (15), (19), and (23), for which no comparable preexisting requirements under Rule 17Ad-22 have been identified, the Commission continues to
believe that a covered clearing agency may need to make more extensive changes to its policies
and procedures, may need to implement new policies and procedures, and may need to take other
steps pursuant to the requirements in these rules. For example, a covered clearing agency may
need to develop, design, and implement new operations and practices. In these cases, the PRA
burden is greater since these requirements may not reflect established practices or the normal
course of a covered clearing agency’s activities. Further, the PRA burden for these rules may
entail both initial one-time burdens, such as create new policies and procedures, as well as
ongoing burdens, such as requirements to make certain disclosures or perform certain types of
review, on a periodic basis.
1. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1)
As described in Part IV.A.1, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) as
proposed. The burden estimates for the rule are unchanged from the CCA Standards proposing
release. 804
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) contains substantially similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(1). 805
The Commission therefore expects that a respondent clearing agency has written rules, policies,
804

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29567–68.

805

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(1); see also supra Part II.C.1.
413

and procedures substantially similar to the requirements in the rule and that the PRA burden
includes the incremental burdens of reviewing current policies and procedures and revising them,
where appropriate, pursuant to the rule. Accordingly, based on the similar provisions and the
corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for Rule 17Ad-22(d)(1), 806
the Commission estimates that respondent clearing agencies will incur an aggregate one-time
burden of approximately 56 hours to review and revise existing policies and procedures. 807
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. The
rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 808 the Commission estimates
that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) impose an aggregate annual burden
on respondent clearing agencies of 21 hours. 809
2. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)
As described in Part IV.A.2, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) with
modifications. In consideration of these modifications, the burden estimates for the rule have
been modified from the preliminary estimates in the CCA Standards proposing release, as
described below.

806

See Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 5, at 66260.

807

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 2 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 6 hours)) = 8 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 56 hours.
808

See Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 5, at 66260–63.

809

This figure was calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney for 3 hours) x 7 respondent
clearing agencies = 21 hours.

414

Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) contains similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(8) but also adds
additional requirements that do not appear in Rule 17Ad-22(d). 810 The Commission therefore
expects that a respondent clearing agency may have written rules, policies, and procedures
similar to the requirements in the rule and that the PRA burden includes the incremental burdens
of reviewing and revising current policies and procedures and creating new policies and
procedures, as necessary, pursuant to the rule. Accordingly, based on the similar provisions and
the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for Rule 17Ad22(d)(8), 811 the Commission preliminarily estimated that respondent clearing agencies would
incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 154 hours to review and revise existing
policies and procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as necessary. 812 Because the
modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) noted above will require updating current policies and
procedures or establishing new policies and procedures to ensure compliance, the Commission
estimates that respondent clearing agencies will incur an aggregate one-time burden of
approximately 175 hours to review and revise existing policies and procedures and to create new
policies and procedures, as necessary. 813

810

See 17 CFR 204.17Ad-22(d)(8); see also supra Part II.C.2.

811

See Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 5, at 66260

812

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29568. This figure was calculated
as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 12 hours) + (Compliance Attorney for 10 hours)) =
22 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 154 hours.
The Commission notes that the CCA Standards proposing release correctly identified the
number of initial burden hours as 154 hours but incorrectly stated the burden estimate for
Assistant General Counsel as 24 rather than 12 hours. See id.
813

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 14 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 11 hours)) = 25 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 175 hours.

415

Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. The
rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 814 the Commission
preliminarily estimated that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) would impose
an aggregate annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of 28 hours. 815 Because the
modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) noted above will require updating current policies and
procedures or establishing new policies and procedures to ensure compliance, the Commission
estimates that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) will impose an aggregate
annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of 35 hours. 816
3. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)
As described in Part IV.A.3, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) with one
modification. Because this modification is only technical or clarifying in nature, the
Commission does not believe they will alter the PRA burdens described in the CCA Standards
proposing release. The burden estimates below are unchanged from the CCA Standards
proposing release. 817

814

See Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 5, at 66260–63.

815

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29568. This figure was calculated
as follows: (Compliance Attorney for 4 hours) x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 28 hours.
816

This figure was calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney for 5 hours) x 7 respondent
clearing agencies = 35 hours.
817

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29568.

416

While Rule 17Ad-22(d) requires registered clearing agencies to have policies and
procedures to manage certain risks, 818 Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) requires a comprehensive framework
for risk management, under which policies and procedures for risk management are designed
holistically, are consistent with each other, and work effectively together. Accordingly, the PRA
burden requires a respondent clearing agency to revise its written rules, policies, and procedures
to include, among other things, periodic review and plans for the recovery and orderly winddown of the covered clearing agency. As a result, the Commission estimates that respondent
clearing agencies will incur an aggregate one-time burden of 399 hours to review and revise
existing policies and procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as necessary. 819
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. The
rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures created in response to the rule and activities related to facilitating a periodic review
of the risk management framework. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 820 the Commission estimates
that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad(22)(e)(3) impose an aggregate annual burden
on respondent clearing agencies of 343 hours. 821 Additionally, the Commission notes that the

818

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d).

819

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 25 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 18 hours) + (Senior Risk Management Specialist for 7 hours) +
(Computer Operations Manager for 7 hours)) = 57 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 399
hours.

820

See Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 5, at 66260-63.

821

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Compliance Attorney for 8 hours) +
(Administrative Assistant for 3 hours) + (Senior Business Analyst for 5 hours) + (Risk
Management Specialist for 33 hours)) = 49 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 343 hours.

417

estimated ongoing burden for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) is similar to the initial one-time burden
because the rule requires policies and procedures for review on a specified periodic basis and
approval by the board of directors annually.
4. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)
As described in Part IV.A.4, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) with
modifications. While some of these modifications are only technical or clarifying in nature, the
burden estimates for the rule, as described below, have been modified from the preliminary
estimates in the CCA Standards proposing release to reflect that Rules 17Ad-22(e)(13)(i) and (ii)
are being adopted under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) as new Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(viii) and (ix). 822
The Commission estimates that the PRA burdens for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) are more
significant than in other cases under Rule 17Ad-22(e) and may require a respondent clearing
agency to make substantial changes to its written rules, policies, and procedures pursuant to the
rule. 823 In addition, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) will require a respondent clearing agency to make onetime systems adjustments so that it has the capability to test the sufficiency of its financial
resources and to perform an annual model validation. As a result, the Commission preliminarily
estimated that respondent clearing agencies would incur an aggregate one-time burden of 1,400
hours. 824 Because the modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) noted above will require updating
822

The Commission notes that because the modifications to Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) and (13)
reflect only the moving of requirements from Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4), the
burden hours across the two rules remains unchanged.
823

See supra Part II.C.4.

824

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29568. This figure was calculated
as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 60 hours) + (Compliance Attorney for 40 hours) +
(Senior Risk Management Specialist for 30 hours) + (Computer Operations Manager for 45
hours) + (Chief Compliance Officer for 15 hours) + (Senior Programmer for 10 hours)) = 200
hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 1,400 hours.
418

current policies and procedures or establishing new policies and procedures to ensure
compliance, the Commission estimates that respondent clearing agencies will incur an aggregate
one-time burden of approximately 1,533 hours to review and revise existing policies and
procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as necessary. 825
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. The
rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures developed in response to the rule and ongoing activities with respect to testing the
sufficiency of its financial resources and performing the annual model validation. Based on the
Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance burdens with respect
to Rule 17Ad-22, 826 the Commission preliminarily estimated that the ongoing activities required
by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) would impose an aggregate annual burden on respondent
clearing agencies of 420 hours. 827 Because the modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) noted above
will require updating current policies and procedures or establishing new policies and procedures
to ensure compliance, the Commission estimates that the ongoing activities required by Rule

825

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 74 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 45 hours) + (Senior Risk Management Specialist for 30 hours) +
(Computer Operations Manager for 45 hours) + (Chief Compliance Officer for 15 hours) +
(Senior Programmer for 10 hours)) = 219 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 1,533 hours.
826

See Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 5, at 66260–63.

827

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29569. This figure was calculated
as follows: ((Compliance Attorney for 24 hours) + (Administrative Assistant for 3 hours) +
(Senior Business Analyst for 3 hours) + (Risk Management Specialist for 30 hours)) = 60 hours
x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 420 hours.

419

17Ad-22(e)(4) will impose an aggregate annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of 434
hours. 828
5. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5)
As described in Part IV.A.5, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) as
proposed. The burden estimates for the rule are unchanged from the CCA Standards proposing
release. 829
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) contains similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(3). 830 The
Commission therefore expects that a respondent clearing agency has written rules, policies, and
procedures substantially similar to the requirements in the rule and that the PRA burden includes
the incremental burdens of reviewing current policies and procedures and revising them, where
appropriate, pursuant to the rule. For example, a respondent clearing agency may need to
develop new policies and procedures for an annual review of the sufficiency of its collateral
haircuts and concentration limits. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and procedures
requirements in and the Commission’s previous corresponding burden estimates for Rule 17Ad22(d)(3), 831 the Commission estimates that respondent clearing agencies will incur an aggregate

828

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Compliance Attorney for 26 hours) +
(Administrative Assistant for 3 hours) + (Senior Business Analyst for 3 hours) + (Risk
Management Specialist for 30 hours)) = 62 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 434 hours.

420

one-time burden of approximately 294 hours to review and revise existing policies and
procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as necessary. 832
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. The
rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to the written policies
and procedures created in response to the rule and also requires an annual review of collateral
haircuts and concentration limits. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 833 the Commission estimates
that the ongoing activities required by the rule imposes an aggregate annual burden on
respondent clearing agencies of 252 hours. 834 The Commission notes that the estimated ongoing
burden for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) is similar to the initial one-time burden because the rule requires
policies and procedures for a not-less-than-annual review of the sufficiency of a covered clearing
agency’s collateral haircuts and concentration limits.
6. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)
As described in Part IV.A.6, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) with
modifications. Because these modifications are only technical or clarifying in nature, the
Commission does not believe they will alter the PRA burdens described in the CCA Standards

832

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 16 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 12 hours) + (Senior Risk Management Specialist for 7 hours) +
(Computer Operations Manager for 7 hours)) = 42 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 294
hours.

proposing release. Therefore, the burden estimates described below are unchanged from the
CCA Standards proposing release. 835
The Commission estimates that the PRA burdens for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) are more
significant than in other cases under Rule 17Ad-22(e) and may require a respondent clearing
agency to make substantial changes to its written rules, policies, and procedures pursuant to the
rule. 836 For example, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) requires one-time systems adjustments to perform
daily backtesting and monthly (or more frequent) sensitivity analyses. As a result, the
Commission preliminarily estimated that respondent clearing agencies would incur an aggregate
one-time burden of 1,080 hours to review and revise existing policies and procedures and to
create new policies and procedures, as necessary. 837
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. The
rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to the written policies
and procedures created in response to the rule and activities associated with daily backtesting,
monthly (or more frequent) sensitivity analyses, and annual model validation. Based on the
Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance burdens with respect
to Rule 17Ad-22, 838 the Commission estimates that the ongoing activities required by Rule

(Compliance Attorney for 40 hours) + (Senior Risk Management Specialist for 25 hours) +
(Computer Operations Manager for 40 hours) + (Chief Compliance Officer for 15 hours) +
(Senior Programmer for 10 hours)) = 180 hours x 6 respondent clearing agencies = 1,080 hours.

17Ad-22(e)(6) impose an aggregate annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of 360
hours. 839
7. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)
As described in Part IV.A.7, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) with
modifications. Because these modifications are only technical or clarifying in nature, the
Commission does not believe they will alter the PRA burdens described in the CCA Standards
proposing release. Therefore, the burden estimates described below are unchanged from the
CCA Standards proposing release. 840
The Commission estimates that the PRA burdens for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) are more
significant than in other cases under Rule 17Ad-22(e) and may require a respondent clearing
agency to make substantial changes to its written rules, policies, and procedures pursuant to the
rule. 841 For example, Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) requires one-time systems adjustments to test the
sufficiency of its liquid resources, test its access to liquidity providers, and perform an annual
model validation. As a result, the Commission estimates that respondent clearing agencies will
incur an aggregate one-time burden of 2,310 hours to review and revise existing policies and
procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as necessary. 842

839

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Compliance Attorney for 24 hours) +
(Administrative Assistant for 3 hours) + (Senior Business Analyst for 3 hours) + (Risk
Management Specialist for 30 hours)) = 60 hours x 6 respondent clearing agencies = 360 hours.

(Compliance Attorney for 85 hours) + (Senior Risk Management Specialist for 45 hours) +
(Computer Operations Manager for 60 hours) + (Chief Compliance Officer for 30 hours) +
(Senior Programmer for 15 hours)) = 330 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 2,310 hours.

423

Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. The
rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to policies and
procedures created in response to the rule as well as activities related to testing the sufficiency of
its liquidity resources, testing access to its liquidity providers, and performing an annual model
validation. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and
compliance burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 843 the Commission estimates that the
ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) impose an aggregate annual burden on
respondent clearing agencies of 896 hours. 844
8. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8)
As described in Part IV.A.8, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) with one
modification. Because these modifications are only technical or clarifying in nature, the
Commission does not believe they will alter the PRA burdens described in the CCA Standards
proposing release. Therefore, the burden estimates described below are unchanged from the
CCA Standards proposing release. 845
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) contains substantially similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(12). 846
The Commission therefore expects that a respondent clearing agency has written rules, policies,
and procedures substantially similar to the requirements in the rule and that the PRA burden

where appropriate, pursuant to the rule. Accordingly, based on the similar provisions and the
corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for Rule 17Ad22(d)(12), 847 the Commission estimates that respondent clearing agencies will incur an aggregate
one-time burden of approximately 84 hours to review and revise existing policies and
procedures. 848
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. The
rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 849 the Commission
estimates that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) impose an aggregate annual
burden on respondent clearing agencies of approximately 35 hours. 850
9. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9)
As described in Part IV.A.9, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9) as

Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9) contains substantially similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(5). 852
The Commission therefore expects that a respondent clearing agency has written rules, policies,
and procedures substantially similar to the requirements in the rule and that the PRA burden
includes the incremental burdens of reviewing current policies and procedures and revising them,
where appropriate, pursuant to the rule. Accordingly, based on the similar provisions and the
corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for Rule 17Ad-22(d)(5), 853
the Commission estimates that respondent clearing agencies will incur an aggregate one-time
burden of approximately 84 hours to review and revise existing policies and procedures. 854
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. The
rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 855 the Commission

As described in Part IV.A.10, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10) as
proposed. The burden estimates for the rule are unchanged from the CCA Standards proposing
release. 857
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10) contains substantially similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(15). 858
The Commission therefore expects that a respondent clearing agency has written rules, policies,

one-time burden of approximately 84 hours to review and revise existing policies and
procedures. 860
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.

As described in Part IV.A.11, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) as
proposed. The burden estimates for the rule are unchanged from the CCA Standards proposing
release. 863
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11), a respondent clearing agency is a registered
clearing agencies that provides CSD services. Because Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) contains similar
provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(10), 864 the Commission expects that such clearing agencies
generally have written rules, policies, and procedures similar to the requirements imposed under
the rule. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) also imposes additional requirements that do not appear in Rule
17Ad-22, and accordingly a covered clearing agency providing CSD services may need to
review and revise its policies and procedures or create new policies and procedures, as necessary,
as necessary, pursuant to the rule. Based on the similar policies and procedures requirements
and the corresponding burden estimates made by the Commission for Rule 17Ad-22(d)(10), 865

approximately 55 hours to review and revise existing policies and procedures and create new
policies and procedures, as necessary. 866
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) also imposes ongoing burdens on the respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 867 the Commission
estimates that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) impose a total annual
burden on the respondent clearing agency of approximately 8 hours. 868
12. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12)
As described in Part IV.A.12, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) as
proposed. The burden estimates for the rule are unchanged from the CCA Standards proposing
release. 869
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) contains substantially similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(13). 870
The Commission therefore expects that a respondent clearing agency has written rules, policies,

where appropriate, pursuant to the rule. Accordingly, based on the similar provisions and the
corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for Rule 17Ad22(d)(13), 871 the Commission estimates that respondent clearing agencies will incur an aggregate
one-time burden of approximately 84 hours to review and revise existing policies and
procedures. 872
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 873 the Commission
estimates that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) impose an aggregate
annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of approximately 35 hours. 874
13. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)
As described in Part IV.A.13, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) with
modifications. The burden estimates for the rule, as described below, have been modified from
the preliminary estimates in the CCA Standards proposing release to reflect that Rules 17Ad-

22(e)(13)(i) and (ii) are being adopted under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) as new Rules 17Ad22(e)(4)(viii) and (ix). 875
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) requires a respondent clearing agency to have written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to address participant default and ensure that the clearing agency
can contain losses and liquidity demands and continue to meet its obligations. Rule 17Ad22(e)(13) contains similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11) but also imposes additional
requirements that do not appear in Rule 17Ad-22. 876 The Commission therefore expects that a
respondent clearing agency may have written rules, policies, and procedures similar to some
requirements in the rule and that the PRA burden includes the incremental burdens of reviewing
and revising existing policies and procedures pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) and creating new
policies and procedures, as necessary. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and procedures
requirements and the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11), 877 the Commission preliminarily estimated that respondent clearing
agencies would incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 420 hours to review and
update existing policies and procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as
necessary. 878 Because the modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) noted above will require
updating current policies and procedures or establishing new policies and procedures to ensure
compliance, the Commission estimates that respondent clearing agencies will incur an aggregate

one-time burden of approximately 287 hours to review and revise existing policies and
procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as necessary. 879
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires policies and procedures for the annual review and testing of a clearing agency’s
default policies and procedures. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 880 the Commission
preliminarily estimated that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) would
impose an aggregate annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of approximately 63
hours. 881 Because the modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) noted above will require updating
current policies and procedures or establishing new policies and procedures to ensure
compliance, the Commission estimates that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad22(e)(13) will impose an aggregate annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of 49
hours. 882

879

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 6 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 11 hours) + (Senior Business Analyst for 12 hours) + (Computer
Operations Manager for 12 hours)) = 41 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 287 hours.

14. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14)
As described in Part IV.A.14, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) as
proposed. The burden estimates for the rule are unchanged from the CCA Standards proposing
release. 883
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14), a respondent clearing agency is a registered
clearing agency that provides CCP services for security-based swaps. Such clearing agencies
generally have written policies and procedures regarding the segregation and portability of
customer positions and collateral as a result of applicable rules and regulations notwithstanding
Rule 17Ad-22. 884 The Commission therefore expects that a respondent clearing agency has
written rules, policies, and procedures substantially similar to the requirements in the rule and
that the PRA burden includes the incremental burdens of reviewing current policies and
procedures and revising them, where appropriate, pursuant to the rule. Accordingly, the
Commission estimates that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) imposes on respondent clearing agencies an
aggregate one-time burden of 72 hours to review and revise existing policies and procedures. 885
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29571–72.

884

See, e.g., 77 FR 6336 (Feb. 7, 2012) (CFTC adopting rules imposing LSOC on DCOs for
cleared swaps); see also supra Part II.C.14. Because the respondent clearing agencies are subject
to the CFTC’s segregation and portability requirements for cleared swaps, the Commission
expects that the burden imposed by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) will be limited.
885

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 12 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 10 hours) + (Computer Operations Manager for 7 hours) + (Senior
Business Analyst for 7 hours)) = 36 hours x 2 respondent clearing agency that provide, or would
potentially provide, CCP services with respect to security-based swaps = 72 hours.

burden on respondent clearing agencies of approximately 12 hours. 887
15. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)
As described in Part IV.A.15, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) as
proposed. The burden estimates for the rule are unchanged from the CCA Standards proposing
release. 888
Because Rule 17Ad-22(d) does not include requirements related to general business risk,
the Commission estimates that the PRA burdens for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) are more significant
than in other cases under Rule 17Ad-22(e) and may require a respondent clearing agency to
make substantial changes to its written rules, policies, and procedures pursuant to the rule. 889
The Commission estimates that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) will impose an aggregate one-time burden
on respondent covered clearing agencies of 1,470 hours to review and revise existing policies
and procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as necessary. 890
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.

and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain a viable plan,
approved by its board of directors and updated at least annually, for raising additional equity in
the event that the covered clearing agency’s liquid net assets fall below the level required by the
rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance
burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 891 the Commission estimates that the ongoing
activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) impose an aggregate annual burden on respondent
clearing agencies of 336 hours. 892

The rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and

Commission estimates that respondent clearing agencies will incur an aggregate one-time burden
of 308 hours to review and revise existing policies and procedures and to create new policies and
procedures, as necessary. 908
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 10 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 7 hours) + Computer Operations Manager for 15 hours) + (Senior
Business Analyst for 5 hours) + (Chief Compliance Officer for 5 hours) + (Senior Programmer
for 2 hours)) = 44 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 308 hours.

monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 909 the Commission
estimates that the ongoing activities required by the rule impose an aggregate annual burden on
respondent clearing agencies of 49 hours. 910
19. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19)
As described in Part IV.A.19, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) as
proposed. The burden estimates for the rule are unchanged from the CCA Standards proposing
release. 911
Tiered participation arrangements are not addressed by Rule 17Ad-22(d). The
Commission therefore expects that a respondent clearing agency may need to create policies and
procedures pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19). 912 The Commission estimates that Rule 17Ad22(e)(19) imposes an aggregate one-time burden on respondent clearing agencies of 308 hours to
review and revise existing policies and procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as
necessary. 913
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing

monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 914 the Commission estimates
that the ongoing activities required by the rule impose an annual aggregate burden on respondent
clearing agencies of 49 hours. 915
20. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20)
As described in Part IV.A.13, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) with one
modification. The burden estimates for the rule are unchanged from the CCA Standards
proposing release. 916
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) contains similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(7) but also adds
additional requirements that do not appear in Rule 17Ad-22(d). 917 The Commission therefore
expects that a respondent clearing agency may have written rules, policies, and procedures
similar to the requirements in the rule and that the PRA burden includes the incremental burdens
of reviewing and revising current policies and procedures and creating new policies and
procedures, as necessary, pursuant to the rule. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and
procedures requirements and compliance burdens associated with Rule 17Ad-22(d)(7), 918 the
Commission estimates that respondent clearing agencies will incur an aggregate one-time burden
of approximately 308 hours to review and update existing policies and procedures. 919 Rule

requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and procedures
under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and
compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 920 the Commission estimates that the ongoing
activities required by the rule impose an aggregate annual burden on respondent clearing
agencies of 49 hours. 921
21. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21)
As described in Part IV.A.21, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) with one
modification. Because this modification is only technical or clarifying in nature, the
Commission does not believe they will alter the PRA burdens described in the CCA Standards
proposing release. The burden estimates for the rule are unchanged from the CCA Standards
proposing release. 922
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) contains similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(6) but also adds
additional requirements that do not appear in Rule 17Ad-22(d). 923 The Commission therefore
expects that a respondent clearing agency may have written rules, policies, and procedures
similar to the requirements in the rule and that the PRA burden includes the incremental burdens

of reviewing and revising current policies and procedures and creating new policies and
procedures, as necessary, pursuant to the rule. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and
procedures requirements and the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the
Commission for Rule 17Ad-22(d)(6), 924 the Commission estimates that respondent clearing
agencies will incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 224 hours to review and
revise existing policies and procedures. 925
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 926 the Commission
estimates that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) impose an aggregate
annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of 77 hours. 927
22. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22)
As described in Part IV.A.22, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) as
proposed. The burden estimates for the rule are unchanged from the CCA Standards proposing
release. 928

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 10 hours) +

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29574.

442

Although Rule 17Ad-22(d) does not include any requirements with provisions similar to
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22), the Commission understands that covered clearing agencies currently use
the relevant internationally accepted communication procedures and standards and therefore
expects that a respondent clearing agency may need to make only limited changes to its policies
and procedures under the rule. 929 Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the rule imposes
an aggregate one-time burden on respondent clearing agencies of 168 hours to review and revise
existing policies and procedures. 930
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency. It
requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and procedures
under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and
compliance burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 931 the Commission estimates that the
ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) impose an aggregate annual burden on
respondent clearing agencies of 35 hours. 932
23. Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)
As described in Part IV.A.23, the Commission is adopting Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) with
modifications. Because these modifications are only technical or clarifying in nature, the
Commission does not believe they will alter the PRA burdens described in the CCA Standards
929

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d); see also supra Part II.C.22.

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 2 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 6 hours) + (Computer Operations Manager for 7 hours) + (Senior
Business Analyst for 2 hours) + (Chief Compliance Officer for 5 hours) + (Senior Programmer
for 2 hours)) = 24 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 168 hours.

proposing release. Therefore, the burden estimates described below are unchanged from the
CCA Standards proposing release. 933
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) contains similar requirements to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(9) but also
imposes substantial new requirements. 934 The Commission therefore expects that, although a
respondent clearing agency may have written rules, policies and procedures similar to those
required by some provisions under the rule, a respondent clearing agency will need to create new
policies and procedures to address the other provisions. Accordingly, based on the similar
policies and procedures requirements and the corresponding burden estimates previously made
by the Commission for Rule 17Ad-22(d)(9), 935 the Commission estimates that respondent
clearing agencies will incur an aggregate one-time burden of 966 hours to review and revise
existing policies and procedures and to create policies and procedures, as necessary. 936
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) also imposes ongoing burdens on a respondent clearing agency.
The rule requires ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to its policies and
procedures under the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to Rule 17Ad-22, 937 the Commission estimates

933

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29574.

See Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 5, at 66260-63.

936

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 38 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 24 hours) + (Computer Operations Manager for 32 hours) + (Senior
Business Analyst for 18 hours) + (Chief Compliance Officer for 18 hours) + (Senior Programmer
for 8 hours)) = 138 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 966 hours.

that the ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) impose an aggregate annual burden
on respondent clearing agencies of 238 hours. 938
24. Total Burden for Rule 17Ad-22(e)
The Commission preliminarily estimated that respondent clearing agencies would incur
an aggregate initial burden under Rule 17Ad-22(e) of 10,664 hours and an aggregate ongoing
burden of 3,460 hours. 939 In light of the modifications made by the Commission in adopting
Rule 17Ad-22(e) described above that will require updating current policies and procedures or
establishing new policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the rule, the Commission
estimates that respondent clearing agencies will incur an aggregate initial burden of 10,776 hours
under Rule 17Ad-22(e) and an aggregate ongoing burden of 3,537 hours.
25. Total Burden for Rule 17Ab2-2
As discussed in Part IV.A.24, Rule 17Ab2-2 establishes procedures for the Commission
to make determinations affecting covered clearing agencies in certain circumstances. 940 Because
such determinations may be made upon request of a clearing agency or its members, the
respondents would have the burdens of preparing such requests for submission to the
Commission. To the extent such determinations are carried out by the Commission on its own
initiative under Rule 17Ab2-2, the Commission expects that the PRA burdens on a respondent
clearing agency would be limited. Accordingly, based on the Commission’s previous estimates

938

This figure was calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney for 34 hours) x 7 respondent
clearing agencies = 238 hours.

939

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29574.

940

See supra Part II.D.

445

for ongoing monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 941 the
Commission preliminarily estimated that respondent clearing agencies would incur an aggregate
one-time burden of approximately 24 hours to draft and review a determination request to the
Commission. 942 In consideration of the modifications made by the Commission in adopting Rule
17Ab2-2 as described above, the Commission estimates that respondent clearing agencies will
incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 20 hours to draft and review a
determination request to the Commission. 943
26. Total Burden for Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1)
As discussed in Part IV.A.25, the modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1) impose a
recordkeeping requirement on registered clearing agencies that are covered clearing agencies.
With respect to Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1), a respondent clearing agency is a registered clearing agency
that provides CCP services. In the Clearing Agency Standards release, the Commission
estimated that respondent clearing agencies would incur both initial and ongoing burdens under
Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1). Specifically, the Commission estimated that Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1) would
impose on a respondent clearing agency a one-time burden of 100 hours. 944 In light of the
modifications to Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1) that affect covered clearing agencies, the Commission
941

See Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 5, at 66260.

942

See CCA Standards proposing release, supra note 5, at 29575. This figure was calculated
as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 2 hours) + (Staff Attorney for 4 hours) + (Outside
Counsel for 6 hours)) = 12 hours x 2 respondent clearing agencies = 24 hours.
943

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 2 hours) + (Staff
Attorney for 3 hours) + (Outside Counsel for 5 hours)) = 10 hours x 2 respondent clearing
agencies = 20 hours.
944

See Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 5, 66261–62. This figure
was calculated as follows: ((Chief Compliance Officer at 40 hours) + (Computer Operations
Department Manager at 40 hours) + (Senior Programmer at 20 hours)) = 100 hours.

446

believes that respondent clearing agencies would incur an aggregate one-time burden of 660
hours to perform adjustments needed to synthesize and format existing information in a manner
sufficient to explain the methodology used to meet the requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1). 945
In addition, the Commission estimated that Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1) would impose ongoing
burdens on a respondent clearing agency of three hours per respondent clearing agency per
quarter, amounting to an aggregate annual burden of 12 hours. 946 In light of the modifications to
Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1) that affect covered clearing agencies, the Commission believes that the
ongoing activities required by Rule 17Ad-22(c)(1) will impose an aggregate annual burden on
respondent clearing agencies of 120 hours to perform adjustments needed to synthesize and
format existing information in a manner sufficient to explain the methodology used to meet the
requirements of the rule. 947
D. Collection of Information is Mandatory
The collection of information requirement for Rule 17Ad-22(e) is mandatory. The
collection of information requirement for Rule 17Ab2-2 is voluntary.
E. Confidentiality
The Commission expects that the policies and procedures developed pursuant to Rule
17Ad-22(e) would be communicated to the participants, as applicable, of each respondent
945

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Chief Compliance Officer at 44 hours) +
(Computer Operations Department Manager at 44 hours) + (Senior Programmer at 22 hours)) =
110 hours x 6 respondent clearing agencies = 660 hours.

946

See Clearing Agency Standards adopting release, supra note 5, 66262. This figure was
calculated as follows: ((Compliance Attorney at 1 hour) + (Computer Operations Department
Manager at 2 hours)) = 3 hours per quarter × 4 quarters per year = 12 hours.
947

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Compliance Attorney at 2 hours) + (Computer
Operations Department Manager at 3 hours)) = 5 hours per quarter × 4 quarters per year = 20
hours x 6 respondent clearing agencies = 120 hours.

447

clearing agency and, as applicable, the public. A respondent clearing agency would be required
to preserve such policies and procedures in accordance with, and for the periods specified in,
Rules 17a-1 and 17a-4(e)(7) under the Exchange Act. 948 To the extent that the Commission
receives confidential information pursuant to this collection of information, such information
would be kept confidential subject to the provisions of applicable law. 949
To the extent that the Commission receives confidential information pursuant to the
collection of information under Rule 17Ab2-2, the Commission also expects such information
would be kept confidential subject to the provisions of applicable law. 950
V. Regulatory Flexibility Act
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) requires the Commission, in promulgating rules,
to consider the impact of those rules on small entities. 951 Section 603(a) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 952 as amended by the RFA, generally requires the Commission to undertake a
regulatory flexibility analysis of all proposed rules to determine the impact of such rulemaking
on “small entities.” 953 The Commission certified in the CCA Standards proposing release,

See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act provides an
exemption for trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and
privileged or confidential. See 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). Exemption 8 of the Freedom of Information
Act provides an exemption for matters that are contained in or related to examination, operating,
or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the
regulation or supervision of financial institutions. See 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8).

Section 601(b) of the RFA permits agencies to formulate their own definitions of “small
entities.” See 5 U.S.C. 601(b). The Commission has adopted definitions for the term “small
448

pursuant to Section 605(b) of the RFA, 954 that the proposed rules would not, if adopted, have a
significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Commission received no
comments on this certification.
A. Registered Clearing Agencies
The amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and Rule 17Ab2-2 apply to covered clearing agencies,
which would include registered clearing agencies that are designated clearing agencies, complex
risk profile clearing agencies, or clearing agencies that otherwise have been determined to be
covered clearing agencies by the Commission. For the purposes of Commission rulemaking and
as applicable to the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and new Rule 17Ab2-2, a small entity
includes, when used with reference to a clearing agency, a clearing agency that (i) compared,
cleared, and settled less than $500 million in securities transactions during the preceding fiscal
year, (ii) had less than $200 million of funds and securities in its custody or control at all times
during the preceding fiscal year (or at any time that it has been in business, if shorter), and (iii) is
not affiliated with any person (other than a natural person) that is not a small business or small
organization. 955
Based on the Commission’s existing information about the clearing agencies currently
registered with the Commission, 956 the Commission believes that such registered clearing

entity” for the purposes of rulemaking in accordance with the RFA. These definitions are set
forth in Rule 0-10, 17 CFR 240.0-10.
954

See 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

955

See 17 CFR 240.0-10(d).

956

In 2015, DTCC processed $1.508 quadrillion in financial transactions. Within DTCC,
DTC settled $112.3 trillion of securities and held securities valued at $45.4 trillion, NSCC
processed an average daily value of $976.6 billion in equity securities, and FICC cleared $917.1
trillion of transactions in government securities and $48.2 trillion of transactions in agency
449

agencies exceed the thresholds defining “small entities” set out above. While other clearing
agencies may seek to register as clearing agencies with the Commission, the Commission does
not believe that any such entities would be “small entities” as defined in Exchange Act Rule 010. 957 Further, registered clearing agencies are only subject to the requirements of Rule 17Ad22(e) if they meet the definition of a covered clearing agency, as described in Part II.A.
Accordingly, the Commission believes that any such registered clearing agencies will exceed the
thresholds for “small entities” set forth in Exchange Act Rule 0-10.
B. Certification
For the reasons described above, the Commission certifies that the amendments to Rule
17Ad-22 and new Rule 17Ab2-2 will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.
VI. Statutory Authority and Text of Amended Rule 17Ad-22 and Rule 17Ab2-2
Pursuant to the Exchange Act, particularly Section 17A thereof, 15 U.S.C. 78q-1, and
Section 805 of the Clearing Supervision Act, 12 U.S.C. 5464, the Commission is adopting
amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and new Rule 17Ab2-2.

2. Section 240.17Ab2-2 is added to read as follows:
§ 240.17Ab2-2 Determinations affecting covered clearing agencies.
(a) The Commission may, if it deems appropriate, upon application by any clearing
agency or member of a clearing agency, or on its own initiative, determine whether a covered
clearing agency is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions. In determining whether a
covered clearing agency is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions, the Commission may
consider:
(1) Whether the covered clearing agency is a designated clearing agency; and

451

(2) Whether the clearing agency has been determined to be systemically important by one
or more jurisdictions other than the United States through a process that includes consideration
of whether the foreseeable effects of a failure or disruption of the designated clearing agency
could threaten the stability of each relevant jurisdiction’s financial system.
(b) The Commission may, if it deems appropriate, determine whether any of the activities
of a clearing agency providing central counterparty services, in addition to clearing agencies
registered with the Commission for the purpose of clearing security-based swaps, have a more
complex risk profile. In determining whether a clearing agency’s activity has a more complex
risk profile, the Commission may consider whether the clearing agency clears financial
instruments that are characterized by discrete jump-to-default price changes or that are highly
correlated with potential participant defaults.
(c) The Commission may, if it deems appropriate, upon application by any clearing
agency or member of a clearing agency, or on its own initiative, determine whether to rescind
any determination made pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. In determining whether
to rescind any such determination, the Commission may consider a change in circumstances such
that the covered clearing agency no longer meets the criteria supporting the determination in
effect.
(d) The Commission shall publish notice of its intention to consider making a
determination under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, together with a brief statement of
the grounds under consideration therefor, and provide at least a 30-day public comment period
prior to any such determination, giving all interested persons an opportunity to submit written
data, views, and arguments concerning such proposed determination. The Commission may

452

provide the clearing agency subject to the proposed determination opportunity for hearing
