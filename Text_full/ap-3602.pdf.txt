The Division mailed the OIP to Respondent DCI Telecommunications, Inc., to the address
shown on its most recent EDGAR filing. Decl. at 2, Ex. 4. Due to a misfiled Form 8-K for
another company appearing on DCI’s EDGAR filing list, DCI’s most recent filing appears on the
list as its second most recent filing. Id. at 2, Exs. 2-3.
