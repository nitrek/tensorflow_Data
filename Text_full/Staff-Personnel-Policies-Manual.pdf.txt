FOREWORD

1.1

MISSION OF THE UNIVERSITY*

The mission of American University is to conduct teaching and research designed to
preserve and extend human knowledge. The university is a complex organization engaged in
many different types of activities. It charges persons with a variety of professional and
technical backgrounds – individually and collectively – with diverse responsibilities. Each
person plays a distinct and important role in helping American University to achieve its
goals.
1.2

PURPOSE OF THE MANUAL*

This policy guide contains statements of staff human resources policies and
procedures. It is designed to be a working guide for supervisory and staff personnel in the
day-to-day administration of the university’s human resource program. Its purpose is to
increase understanding of policy, and to ensure uniformity in human resource
administration. This policy guide, however, does not constitute an express or implied
contract in whole or in part.
Every staff member is responsible for following these applicable policies. Every
supervisor of staff personnel is responsible for carrying out these applicable policies in a
consistent and impartial manner. Staff members carry out the mission of the university by
performing their assigned duties with high professional standards. In addition, they must
conduct themselves as responsible and cooperative members of the university community.
The fulfillment of these expectations is a condition of continued employment.
The university encourages responsible and productive working relationships and
respect for the personal integrity and growth of all staff members.
Copies of this publication and the Faculty/Staff Benefits Manual are available to all
staff members on request in human resources. In addition, new full-time staff members will
receive orientation materials at the time of employment.
Every staff member can support the university’s human resource program by letting
human resources know whenever problems arise. They also can help by suggesting
improvements in the administration of these policies and procedures.

EMPLOYMENT POLICIES

2.1

DEFINITION OF FULL-TIME EMPLOYMENT

At American University, a full-time staff employee is one who is appointed to a
position which is formally identified as an authorized full-time position in the personnel
budget of the employing office and is scheduled to work at least 28 hours a week for more
than three consecutive months.
A person who meets these requirements is a full-time employee. Only full-time
employees are entitled to the benefits and privileges of regular employment, regardless of the
nature of the duties performed or the number of hours worked per week.
2.2

DEFINITION OF PART -TIME EMPLOYMENT*

A part-time employee is one who is not assigned to a full-time position in the
personnel budget and works fewer than 28 hours per week or works any number of hours
per week for three consecutive months or less. Part-time employees are not entitled to the
benefits and privileges of full-time staff except as required by law or provided specifically in
writing by university policy.
Part-time staff members are appointed by the issue of a Human Resources Action
Form and approved by human resources. A Human Resources Action Form should be used
to separate employees who leave before their designated end date.
Regular part-time appointments require yearly renewal. Renewals are implemented by
routine completion of the Human Resources Action Form.
2.3

I M M I G R AT I O N A N D N AT U R A L I Z AT I O N S E RV I C E
REQUIREMENTS*

An I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification) Form must be completed for all
employees hired by the university and must accompany the Human Resources Action Form.
2.4

A F F I R M AT I V E A C T I O N R E P O RT

The hiring supervisor must complete an Affirmative Action Report for all full-time
employees hired by the university. The supervisor must send the report to human resources
along with a Human Resources Action Form.

University policy requires that all personnel decisions be made on their merits,
uninfluenced by personal relationships. Therefore, all members of the staff must avoid
personal involvement in decisions concerning those who are relatives, or those with whom
they have a personal living relationship. A “relative” is a person who is related, such as a
father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew, niece,
husband, wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law,
sister-in-law, stepfather, stepmother, stepson, stepdaughter, stepsister, stepbrother, halfbrother, half-sister, or any person an individual has responsibility to support as a dependent.
As a general principle, individuals who are relatives, or who have a personal living
relationship, should not be in a reporting relationship to one another. They also should not
influence the employment status of one another in any way. Specifically, no staff member
who directs or approves personnel actions may appoint, employ, promote, advance (either as
to position or pay) any other person within the university who is a relative of, or who is in a
personal living relationship with, the staff member. Moreover, staff members who advocate,
or seek to advocate, on behalf of relatives, must avoid conflicts of interest.
2.6

EMPLOYMENT OF STUDENTS*

Students of American University employed by the university are subject to the
applicable definitions and limitations noted above, with the following exceptions. AU
students may be employed for 28 hours or more per week, for up to 4 months during the
summer (May 1 – August 31) without being considered a full-time employee. International
students with F-1 or J-1 visa status may be employed for a maximum appointment period of
four months according to the following schedule:
Fall Semester

=

September 1 – December 31

Spring Semester

=

January 1 – April 30

Summer Semester

=

May 1 – August 31

Each semester these students must complete an International Student Employment
Form. The form must be authorized by the Intercultural Student and Scholar Services office
and returned to human resources. Authorization to work may be granted for a maximum of
20 hours a week during fall and spring semesters and for full-time during practical training or
vacation periods (e.g., winter break, and summer sessions).

The policies above may differ for foreign students in other visa categories (for
example, J-2, G-4) whose work authorization is granted directly by the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service. For those students, the appointment limits will be identified on the
Human Resources Action Form and will require completion of a new I-9.
2.7

C AT E G O R I E S O F P O S I T I O N S

For purposes of determining specific applications of these policies, regular staff
positions have been categorized as follows:
Executive staff positions are assistant provosts, vice provosts, vice presidents,
principal academic deans, and other administrators expressly designated by the provost or
the president of the university. Executive staff positions are exempt from the university staff
personnel employment, classification, promotion, and separation procedures, except
provisions relating to Affirmative Action − Equal Employment Opportunity (e.g., posting or
publishing position openings and advising the human resource office before recruitment
begins). Executive staff are also exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor
Standards Act.
Senior staff members manage a substantial academic or administrative program and
usually report to an executive, or they are expressly designated as senior staff by the vice
president of finance and treasurer. Senior staff positions are exempt from university staff
personnel employment, promotion, and separation procedures, except provisions relating to
Affirmative Action − Equal Employment Opportunity (e.g., posting or publishing position
openings and notifying human resources before recruitment begins). Senior staff are also
exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Administrative/professional staff positions require a professional level of training or
administrative responsibilities. Administrative/professional positions are subject to the
university’s staff personnel policies and procedures for employment, classification,
promotion, and separation. Administrative/professional staff members are exempt from the
overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Clerical, secretarial, technical, skilled craft and service positions involve operational
duties in university offices, laboratories, and physical plant. They are subject to the
university’s staff personnel policies and procedures for employment, classification,
promotion, and separation. Staff members in these groups are subject to the overtime
provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Exempt and non-exempt status is determined by human resources on the basis of
detailed descriptions of individual positions, and by regulations published by the United
States Department of Labor governing the administration of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
2.8

JOB POSTING

All regular staff vacancies will be listed for at least four working days before any
recommendation to hire is made. Open positions are listed on the human resources website
and in human resources.
With the agreement of human resources, the posting requirement may be waived
where it is proposed to hire an individual clearly functioning in an “understudy” capacity to
the previous incumbent.
2.9

PROMOTIONS, TRANSFERS, AND DEMOTIONS

Staff members should use their abilities to their greatest benefit. Therefore, vacancies
may be filled by promotion, transfer, or demotion whenever it is in the best interest of the
university and the individual.
A staff member becomes eligible for promotion or transfer after satisfactory
completion of a probationary period. Staff members may apply for promotion or transfer by
submitting an Internal Application Form to human resources. At that time, the staff member
should schedule an appointment with a representative of human resources to discuss
possible promotion and transfer opportunities.
The university recommends that a staff member tell the current supervisor of his or
her intentions when applying for a promotion or transfer. However, staff members are not
required to notify their supervisors when filing such an application.
Whenever possible, qualified transfer or promotional candidates, or recent employees,
whose positions were eliminated due to reorganization or lack of funds, will receive
preferential consideration. However, all hiring processes should be conducted within the
guidelines of the university’s commitment to equal employment opportunity and affirmative
action.
When a transfer or promotion occurs, the current and new supervisors should discuss
and agree upon the timing of the move. Normally, the university requires a two-week period.
Promoted or transferred staff members must serve a probationary period in their new
position.

At any time, a dean, director, or department head may transfer a staff member from
one position to another at the same classification band within the same office or department,
providing the staff member meets the qualifications required by the new position. The
university also reserves the right to transfer any member of its regular staff to another office
or department. In either case, an employee will not be expected to undertake duties for
which he or she is not qualified, and whenever possible will be given at least a week’s notice
of the impending change. Employees transferred at the request of the university will not
serve in probationary status in the new position. The employment of a staff member who is
not willing to accept such a change may be terminated.
An employee may be demoted when:

he or she would otherwise be laid off because the position is being
abolished by reason of lack of work, lack of funds, or other organizational
changes;

•

another employee returns from authorized leave status. When this occurs,
every effort will be made to place the demoted staff member back into a
position at the same level as the one from which he or she was demoted. If
an appropriate vacancy does not exist, the services of the staff member will
be terminated and his or her name will be placed on a priority reemployment list;

•

an employee’s service is not satisfactory. If a promoted staff member does
not meet departmental standards in the higher classification or new
position, he or she may be demoted without prejudice to a position with the
same classification band as the position held before promotion, if such a
vacancy exists. If an appropriate vacancy does not exist, the services of the
staff member will be terminated and his or her name will be placed on a
priority re-employment list;

•

an employee voluntarily requests demotion.

When a demotion is being considered because of inadequate performance, the
affected staff member must receive adequate notice as to the reasons why such action might
become necessary. Sufficient advice must be given to provide the staff member with
reasonable opportunity to meet the performance standards. This advice should be in writing,
with a copy to the staff member’s personnel file in human resources.

TERMS OF SERVICE

Full-time staff members serve a probationary period of four months. During the
probationary period, a staff member may be removed from his or her position at any time
for any reason without prior notice. Staff members will also serve a probationary period
when transferred or promoted to a new position.
At the end of the probationary period, or at any time after three weeks of
employment, an initial performance review conference between the staff member and his or
her supervisor should be held. As a result of this conference, one of three actions will be
taken:
•

probation is concluded and regular status in the position is granted;

•

probation is extended for four months (only one extension may be granted);

•

the staff member is removed from the position.

A completed Probation Form must be sent to human resources at the end of
probation in order for the appropriate action to be taken. If this form is not received by the
probation expiration date, the employee’s probation is automatically completed.
During an extended probationary period, a staff member removed from a position is
entitled to two weeks notice of termination (or pay in lieu of notice). Termination during the
probation period may not be appealed or grieved.
After the completion of a probationary period, regular classified staff members are
appointed on a continuing basis subject to the provisions for termination of appointment
contained in the chapter entitled “Termination.” They also become eligible for promotion,
annual performance-based pay increases, and transfer.

EEO POLICIES*

American University has adopted a formal affirmative action plan. This plan imposes
certain responsibilities on all staff members involved in the employment process, some of
which are referred to in this manual. Actions affecting the employment status of staff
personnel must be coordinated through Human Resources.
All appointments are subject to the approval of authorized university officials. A
regular appointment does not become effective until all required written approvals are
obtained.
2.14

A F F I R M AT I V E A C T I O N P R O G R A M P O L I C Y *

The University maintains an affirmative action program in compliance with the law to
promote equal employment opportunity access for all persons, including women, minorities,
individuals with a disability, and veterans. Such access is based on individual merit and
performance. Contrary to popular belief, the affirmative action plan does not contain quotas
or make other employment decisions based on an individual’s protected status. Rather, the
affirmative action plan is a management tool to identify obstacles that might prohibit certain
groups of individuals from receiving fair consideration and to produce applicant pools of
diverse and qualified individuals from which to select employees. The University assesses the
effectiveness of the affirmative action program through internal monitoring and reporting
systems and updates it on an ongoing basis. If warranted, adjustments are made to recruiting
strategies and other related programs and policies to ensure that all applicants and employees
receive fair consideration and treatment in all employment decisions.

AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT POLICY*

American University supports the policies of the Americans with Disabilities Act and
is completely committed to treating all applicants and employees with disabilities in
accordance with the requirements of that statute. The university judges individuals by their
abilities, not their disabilities, and seeks to give full and equal employment opportunities to
all persons capable of performing successfully in the university’s positions. American
University will provide reasonable accommodations to any qualified persons with disabilities
who require them, and urges employees and applicants who may be disabled and require
accommodation to advise the university of their particular needs. Information concerning
individuals’ disabilities is considered confidential and their need for accommodation will be
handled with the utmost discretion.
When considering a requested accommodation, American University will require
medical certification or information from a health care professional concerning the
requested accommodation. Medical certification or other information may be requested at
the time of the initial request or at any time thereafter, for the purpose of determining
whether the individual still meets the definition of a disabled person or whether an
accommodation is still necessary.
Employees and applicants who want to request a reasonable accommodation should
contact human resources employee relations, extension 2607. Any staff employee or
applicant who believes that they may have been discriminated against based on their
disability should refer to the Discrimination and Sexual Harassment complaint procedures.
Employees or applicants may also contact the Assistance Vice President of Human
Resources to appeal reasonable accommodation decisions.
American University is firmly committed to the principle of equal employment
opportunity. The university recognizes that the implementation of such a policy requires
constant effort and supervision. Every necessary step will be taken to guarantee that this
commitment is honored in principle and in practice.

HOURS OF WORK

4.1

UNIVERSITY SCHEDULE*

The university operates 24 hours a day throughout the year. However, the work
schedule of the university is closely linked to the academic calendar. The beginning of each
semester is a period of high demand upon the university’s faculty and staff. An academic
calendar is posted well in advance of each year for planning and scheduling purposes.
Classes are in session from early morning to late evening, as well as on weekends.
Because of the long hours during which the university operates, some offices must remain
open to provide necessary services during periods when other offices are closed. Therefore,
staff members should be prepared to adjust their working schedules to best meet the needs
of the university.
4.2

WORK SCHEDULES OF EMPLOYEES

All employees are expected to report for duty on time and to work the full number of
hours each day required by the terms of their jobs. The schedules of individual offices, and
of employees in those offices, are determined by the needs of the university.
Most employees work seven hours a day, Monday through Friday (a total of 35 hours
a week), from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. with one hour for lunch. They are expected to make
themselves available for additional hours (including weekends) when required. Several
offices, as determined by human resources, assign employees to a forty-hour workweek
because of continuous operations or contractual requirements.

Employees of American University receive a highly valuable benefit in the form of
remitted tuition. Educational benefits must be used in a manner that does not interfere with
the operation of the university’s offices and programs. Accordingly, employees are not
permitted to take courses during their normal working hours. Normal working hours are
defined by an employee’s department head based on the unit’s mission and the requirements
of the position.
Exceptions to this rule are limited to a narrow set of circumstances and are available
only to those employees admitted to degree and certificate programs. An employee may
request an exception for a given course if it is required by the degree program and
unavailable at any time other than normal working hours.
Employees must request an exception from this rule by completing the Educational
Benefits Exception Form. The employee’s immediate supervisor will review the request. If
the supervisor supports the request and is satisfied that the required conditions are met, he
or she will recommend it for approval to the unit executive. The unit executive will
determine whether the request will be granted. The employee will be provided a written
response to the request. Employees who are granted an exception to this rule will charge the
lost time to annual leave.
Supervisors will notify human resources each time an exception is granted by
providing human resources with the original Educational Benefits Exception Form.
Notwithstanding exceptions granted according to this policy, employees are reminded
that if a conflict occurs between work and a class, work takes precedence.
4.6

CONFLICT OF INTEREST*

A conflict of interest occurs when there is a conflict or an appearance of conflict
between an employee’s private, financial, or business activities and the requirements of the
position he or she occupies at the university. Such conflicts are prohibited.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES

Scope

American University’s staff compensation program aims to:
•

support the ability of the university to offer market competitive salaries that
enable units to attract, motivate and engage talent, without overpaying or
underpaying relative to the market;

•

be internally fair regardless of gender, race, or ethnic background and other
differences and consistently applied throughout the university;

•

link with career levels in a meaningful and motivating way to be able to
show opportunities for career growth;

•

reflect both the market value of staff responsibilities and their internal value
to the university and reward higher levels of performance and contribution
as measured in the performance management program; and

•

be easy to understand and simple to administer.

Inherent in these principles is a desire to encourage and reward staff for acquiring and
applying their knowledge, skills and abilities, and contributing to the ongoing success of the
organization.
5.2

R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y F O R P R O G R A M A D M I N I S T R AT I O N

Human resources is responsible for ongoing administration and maintenance of the
compensation program. Managers and supervisors are responsible for day-to-day
implementation and communication of the program, with assistance provided by human
resources, as necessary.
Human resources reviews the program on an annual basis and recommends
appropriate updates to ensure the program’s integrity. As the program is updated, written
communications will be distributed, as required.
Human resources has the ultimate responsibility for maintaining the compensation
structure. However, many decisions will be made in conjunction with managers and
supervisors, such as:

•

recommendations in compensation bands necessitated by changes in
compensation levels in the market over time are made by human resources;

•

the proper placement of new positions, or positions whose responsibilities
have changed within the compensation structure is the responsibility of
human resources; and

•

the establishment of new positions or changes in position descriptions and
titles should be reviewed with human resources and approved by the
appropriate vice president or their designee.

E L E M E N T S O F T H E C O M P E N S AT I O N S T R U C T U R E

Establishing a set of compensation bands is the first step in developing a systematic
approach to administering salaries for American University. This set of bands is termed the
compensation structure.
The compensation structure at American University consists of eight bands, with each
band containing at least two market clusters. The number is sufficient to support the
compensation levels required for the hierarchy of positions, as well as to allow for job
differentiation. Compensation market clusters overlap, allowing for an individual who is at
the maximum of a cluster in a relatively lower band to have a compensation level at or above
an individual who is near the minimum of a higher market cluster, if appropriate. All
American University full-time staff positions are placed into compensation bands and
market clusters based on:
•

salaries paid to positions with similar responsibilities in the competitive
marketplace; and

•

each position’s impact at American University, both absolute and relative to
other positions.

A market cluster facilitates control over fixed compensation expenses, aids in planning
and budgeting, and provides for compensation growth for an employee commensurate with
performance. American University’s market clusters have been divided into three zones to
enable the university to consider individual performance and experience in managing an
employee’s compensation progression.

P O L I C I E S

First Zone

Salaries within the first third of a market cluster are usually reflective of employees
who are still learning their jobs. These employees may have been newly hired with minimal
prior work experience, newly promoted, or require performance improvement. An
employee’s progression through the first third of the range will depend upon individual
performance versus expectations.
Second Zone

Salaries within the middle third of a market cluster are usually reflective of employees
whose job performance fully meets/sometimes exceeds expectations. These employees will
tend to be fully experienced and trained in their position responsibilities.
Third Zone

Salaries within the top third of a market cluster are usually reflective of employees who
consistently exceed performance expectations, have exceptional skill sets or knowledge, or
jobs that are in high demand in the marketplace.
Each market cluster has a minimum and maximum compensation level. The
minimum represents the minimum compensation amount that American University would
expect to pay an employee whose position is assigned to the range. There is a practical limit
to the economic value of any job, beyond which annual compensation increases are generally
not given. This limit is the maximum compensation level of the market cluster. Where an
individual’s compensation equals or exceeds the maximum compensation for their present
position, the opportunity for continued progress lies primarily in promotion.

STRUCTURE

The process of determining compensation bands and market clusters for positions
involves the following steps:
•

a position description is prepared to document current information on
position purpose, key responsibilities, knowledge/skill requirements and
scope of accountabilities;

•

for jobs commonly found in the market, American University uses available
published compensation surveys to identify base compensation levels for
positions with comparable responsibilities in the competitive market;

P O L I C I E S

5.5

•

American University also considers internal equity, i.e., both the absolute
and relative value/worth of each position. This involves a comparison of
position responsibilities, knowledge/skill requirements, and scope of
accountabilities to establish a position hierarchy that reflects how American
University values positions;

•

when a new position is created or a position has a significant change in
responsibilities, the supervisor needs to update or prepare a position
description. Human resources will then determine a compensation band
and market cluster based on a review of market base compensation levels
and internal equity.

OVERVIEW OF SALARY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS

American University management makes three types of compensation decisions. The
first is the decision upon hiring a new employee. The second (and most frequent) concerns
merit increases by which an employee is rewarded for performance in a given position over a
period of time. The third type is an increase that accompanies either a promotion to
recognize the different responsibilities of the new position, or an “in-band” increase to
recognize job growth.
No type of compensation increase should be considered automatic. The decision must
be made on an individual basis. It should be justified by the employee’s progress and
achievements and by positioning of the employee’s compensation within the band and
cluster.
Salary Decision – Time of Hire

The compensation decision at the time of hire is important. It often is the major factor
in an applicant’s decision to accept the position. In addition, the compensation offer has a
continuing impact on the employee’s future compensation while with the university and on
the university’s employee relations as a whole. Before making a salary offer, the hiring
manager should work with human resources to:
•

confirm the competitive market value of the position, if available;

•

review and verify the candidate’s salary history as stated on their application,
through reference checks or, if an internal candidate, confirming with
human resources;

•

identify the individuals currently in the same position or similar positions
within the band who fully meet/sometimes exceed expectations for the
position;

•

evaluate the candidate’s qualifications for the position against these
incumbents. The qualifications important to determining salary will vary
from job to job. The following are types of individual qualifications that will
be important in many jobs at American University – amount of directly
related job experience, amount of any related education, award of any
necessary or preferred certifications. We would expect that individuals
whose achievements are less than fully competent incumbents should be
offered salaries in the first zone. Similarly, individuals with substantially
greater achievements than fully competent incumbents will be offered
salaries at the high end of the second zone or in the low end of the third
zone; and

•

consider whether the salary to be offered provides the individual with the
opportunity to move appropriately through the band.

Special recruiting situations are those in which market conditions make it necessary to
offer starting salaries that are higher than recommended guidelines. Human resources needs
to coordinate a response to these situations on a case-by-case basis.
Merit Increase Guidelines

Merit increases are awarded to an employee based on the individual’s performance as
demonstrated by the achievement of their goals and demonstration of competencies, the
position of the individual’s compensation within the market cluster, and the departmental
budget allocated for increases. Merit increases are effective September 1 of each year. To be
eligible for a merit increase, the staff member must have been hired, transferred, or
promoted into the position prior to May 1.
Staff who are on leave without pay, leave of absence, continuous FMLA, short term
disability, and military leave are not considered to be actively at work. Employees not
actively at work on the date that an increase in annual salary would otherwise have occurred
(generally September 1), will receive a merit increase effective the date the employee actively
returns to work.
The process for determining a merit increase has four steps:

P O L I C I E S

1. A manager reviews both the employee’s overall performance rating, as
determined in the year-end discussion, and the recommended pay increase
range based on the position of the employee’s current pay.
2. A manager reviews the individual’s performance and pay relative to peers
and market data available for positions in their units.
3. Utilizing the departmental budget available for merit increases, a manager
recommends a merit increase. The manager may need to modify increases
to stay within budget. Managers will be expected to provide some
justification for any recommendations outside of the recommended range
and all zero pay increases.
4. A manager follows the approval process in place in their department to
finalize the merit increases.
All merit increases are subject to review, adjustment and approval up to the provost or
appropriate divisional vice president, or their designee, and review by human resources. All
managers should refrain from discussing merit increase recommendations with their staff
until they have received confirmation of the final approval.
Evaluating and Reviewing Performance

Please refer to Section Six for information about the performance management
program. Generally, managers will assess a staff member’s performance once a year prior to
merit increases.
Exceptions to Policy

On rare occasions, it may be necessary to make decisions that differ from merit
increase guidelines. Human resources will work with the appropriate supervisor in
responding to these situations on a case by case basis.
Promotional Increase/Job Growth Decisions

A promotion results when a person moves to a position that is in a higher
compensation band and assumes increased scope and responsibility. When an employee is
promoted to a new position, the compensation will be reviewed, and consideration will be
given to a promotional increase. Promotional increases should result in a new salary for the
employee that is at least equal to the minimum of the market cluster to which he or she has

been promoted and typically, within the first third of the market cluster to which the
employee has been promoted.
Job growth occurs when an individual is operating in their same position at a
significantly higher level of responsibility or complexity. Increases for job growth typically
occur within the current market cluster.
5.6

SPECIAL SALARY ACTIONS

The following is a description of compensation administration guidelines in
connection with special compensation actions:
Moving to a Position in a Lower Band

If an employee chooses or is required to take a position in a lower compensation band
and the employee’s compensation is at or above the maximum of the cluster for the new
position, the employee will generally not be eligible for a merit increase until adjustments to
the compensation structure result in the employee’s compensation being below the cluster
maximum.
Compensation for Additional Responsibilities

If an employee assumes a temporary assignment of substantial additional
responsibilities or the duties of a higher paid position that exceeds 30 days, he or she may
receive a temporary salary increase (stipend) of 10%. Temporary assignments of this nature
may not exceed one year.
Under extraordinary circumstances, and with advance approval of the provost, the
appropriate vice president or their designee, administrative and professional staff members
may be paid for additional services that are clearly separate from the duties normally
associated with their positions. If the special assignment must be completed during the
normal working hours of the regular position, the supervisor should be prepared to verify
that the responsibilities of the principal position are being met.

was performed. That Act also prohibits the accrual or awarding of compensatory leave
(comp time) instead of recording and paying for actual hours worked exceeding a nonexempt employee’s normal work schedule.
Employees who perform two or more jobs that pay a different hourly rate, overtime
pay will be calculated in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act. Employees who are
paid monthly are exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
They do not receive additional pay for working overtime.

American University is fully committed to complying with its obligations under the
Fair Labor Standards Act, now and in the future. Therefore, it is our policy not to make
deductions from the salary of an exempt employee except for reasons permitted by law.
American University may make deductions from an exempt employee’s salary for the
following reasons: (1) the employee is absent for one or more full days for personal reasons
and does not have accrued paid leave; (2) the employee is absent for one or more full days
due to sickness or disability and does not have accrued paid leave under American
University’s sickness or disability plan; (3) as a penalty imposed in good faith for infractions
of safety rules of major significance; (4) the employee takes unpaid leave under the Family
and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). In the circumstances of (3) and (4) either partial day or full
day deductions may be made.
If an exempt employee believes that an improper deduction has been made from his
or her pay, the employee should immediately contact their direct supervisor or employee
relations (extension 2607), who will promptly and fully investigate the situation. If American
University determines that the deduction was improper for any reason, American University
will reimburse the employee and take steps to ensure that such improper deductions do not
reoccur.

The university maintains a performance management program (PMP) for staff that is
designed to:
•

clearly state performance expectations and set high standards of
performance;

•

ensure that individual goals are aligned with either the university’s goals or
the staff member’s job duties;

•

reinforce the behaviors needed to support the university now and in the
future;

•

support positive relationships between staff and their managers;

•

recognize the contributions and skills of staff; and

•

ensure that staff has the skills necessary to contribute.

American University’s PMP extends through a full year. The PMP includes three
phases – planning, managing, and appraising.
6.1

PERFORMANCE PLANNING

The performance management cycle begins with the planning phase which occurs
between August and September each year, or in the case of a newly hired, transferred or
promoted staff member, within the first 30 days of hire or change in employment status.
In the performance planning phase, staff members utilize the university strategic plan,
any department goals that have been developed, and their own job duties to develop 3-5
goals for the performance period. This cascade and alignment process encourages staff and
their managers to identify ways for each person to best contribute in their jobs and what
must happen at the department and individual levels to support the university’s goals. The
performance goals are recorded in a goals worksheet contained in AsuccessfulU, the online
PMP system.
In addition to goals, each staff member is assigned competencies, that is, observable
behaviors and skills that each staff member is expected to demonstrate in their jobs. A
detailed listing of the competencies is maintained in the Staff Competencies Guide and in
AsuccessfulU. Staff should familiarize themselves with the competencies that apply to their

position during the performance planning phase and may create development goals where
the need for skill improvement is indicated. Please refer to Section 6.6, Development Plans.
6.2

M A N A G I N G P E R F O R M A N C E A N D M I D - Y E A R E VA L U AT I O N

After goals are established and staff review the competencies against which they will
be evaluated, a staff member works to achieve the goals and demonstrate the competencies.
The managing phase of PMP is characterized by frequent two-way communication between
the staff member and their manager to discuss progress and identify difficulties that might
stand in the way of achieving goals. Managers and staff use this time to revise or update
goals as needed.
One formal mid-year evaluation is required during the managing phase and it occurs in
February. Staff members are asked to complete a self-assessment of progress towards goals
and proficiency demonstrating competencies. Managers and staff members then meet to
discuss the status of goals and competencies. Generally the mid-year evaluation does not
include a formal rating of goals or competencies, though the university may on occasion
include a formal rating during this phase. Progress notes for the mid-year evaluation are
recorded in AsuccessfulU and the meeting is acknowledged by electronic signature of both
staff members and their managers.
6.3

APPRAISING PERFORMANCE

A performance appraisal is conducted at the end of July which marks the end of the
annual PMP cycle. The performance appraisal provides an opportunity for managers and
staff to look at the past year and compare the achievement of goals and evaluate the level of
proficiency with each competency.
Staff members and their managers prepare for the discussion by compiling the
tracking sources data gathered throughout the year. Staff complete a self-assessment in
advance of the performance appraisal meeting, and in the meeting staff and their managers
share their assessments for each goal and competency.
The manager is responsible for appraising each goal and competency using a rating
scale. Seventy percent of the overall performance rating is based on the assessment of goals
and thirty percent is based on the assessment of competencies, which results in a single
rating or score. The manager documents the content of the appraisal discussion in
AsuccessfulU, and both staff members and their manager electronically sign the form.

year.
6.4

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLANS

AU is committed to providing all staff with the opportunity to improve their
performance in order to continue successful employment at the university. In the event a
staff member fails to consistently demonstrate the core competencies established for all
staff, fails to meet performance expectations, or demonstrate the skills and functions
required by their position, a manager may elect to place that individual on a performance
improvement plan. This is a short term plan that determines clear milestones for
improvement of work performance within a specified period of time, typically four to eight
weeks. Performance improvement plans may be implemented independently or, if necessary,
in conjunction with disciplinary action. Communication of a performance improvement plan
may replace any warning step under the disciplinary policy. Failure to meet the milestones
established by the performance improvement plan and maintain acceptable performance will
result in termination of employment.
Managers with questions regarding performance improvement plans or seeking
guidance in the design and implementation of such a plan should contact the employee
relations team in human resources.
6.5

REWARDING PERFORMANCE

Several factors are used to determine merit increases. Section 5.0, Compensation
Program, describes these factors and the link between pay and performance.
6.6

DEVELOPMENT PLANS

A development plan is an optional, personal action plan, jointly agreed to by a staff
member and their manager that identifies short and long-term development goals. A
development plan identifies the training and other developmental experiences needed to
achieve those goals. The university benefits from having a competent and engaged
workforce, capable of continuous learning in order to meet the demands placed on it. A staff
member may have a desire to grow in their current job or in other positions at the university,
and may utilize the development plan to identify the specific developmental experiences
necessary to fulfill those goals. Each development plan is uniquely tailored to meet the needs
of the staff member.

Staff members may create a development plan in AsuccessfulU, and are encouraged to
discuss the status of it at least once a year during the mid-year discussion. The development
plans are not rated. However, attainment of new skills, or improving others, may be reflected
in higher levels of performance.
Managers are encouraged to work with their staff to develop development plans. To
that end, managers are evaluated on the degree to which they successfully develop talent of
their direct reports.
6.7

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Several groups are responsible for ensuring the use of the PMP in their units.
The Provost, University Vice Presidents, Deans, Department Heads, Directors,
Managers and Supervisors, including faculty who supervise staff, are responsible for ensuring
that the PMP principles, steps and tools are utilized in their respective units, and that
performance planning, management and appraisals occur for each staff member. They are
responsible for ensuring that the goals of their units are communicated to encourage the
alignment of individuals and university goals, that the performance cycle is completed for
each of their direct reports, and that staff are encouraged to create development plans to
support their professional development.
The Assistant Vice President of Human Resources is responsible for the design and
implementation of the performance management program in accordance with the general
management philosophy of the university. The Assistant Vice President of Human Resource,
or her designee, is responsible for initiating the annual performance planning, mid-year
evaluation and appraisal cycles, and for developing and delivering strategies aimed at
continually communicating, educating, gathering feedback and refining the program as
necessary to meet the needs of the university. The Assistant Vice President is responsible for
reviewing the program to ensure fair and consistent application in accordance with the
university EEO policies.

American University follows a progressive disciplinary policy. Understanding and
accepting of these policies are implied in accepting employment.
Disciplinary action can take one of four forms: oral warning, written warning,
suspension, or dismissal. The degree of disciplinary action is based on the nature of the
offense.
If disciplinary action is taken beyond a verbal warning, that action will be explained in
detail in a written record which will be sent to human resources for inclusion in the
employee’s official personnel file.
If no additional disciplinary actions are recorded after two years, the written record of
disciplinary action will be removed. However, when the disciplinary action is for a violation
of the discrimination or harassment policies, as well as for certain Level III violations, the
written record of the disciplinary action may remain on file beyond two years.
Supervisors are required to take disciplinary action when established procedures are
not followed, or when rules of conduct are ignored to the disadvantage of a working unit or
the university. These guidelines have been set up to prevent misunderstandings when such
occasions arise. It is the university’s intention to be fair and uniform in the handling of these
matters. However, these procedures should not be interpreted as constituting an
employment contract.
At the discretion of the supervisor, a performance improvement plan may be
implemented as part of the progressive discipline process. Communication of a performance
improvement plan may take the place of any warning step in the process. See Section Six:
Performance Management.
In general, the disciplinary process should proceed as follows for offenses at each
level.
Level I Offense:
•

(1) Oral Warning, (2) Written Warning, (3) Final Written Warning, (4)
Dismissal.

Level II Offense:

These policies are not intended to constitute a contract of employment, or to confer
any additional employment rights. Employment may be terminated at any time and for any
reason by either the employee or the university.
Termination of regular staff appointments may occur as outlined below. All
separations must be processed through the human resources, even for those whose terminal
appointments have ended. Be sure to consult the Faculty/Staff Benefits Manual for
information about discontinuation of leave and other benefits.
Voluntary Separation

In cases of voluntary resignation or retirement, notice equivalent to the length of one
pay period is normally expected. A letter of resignation must be sent to the supervisor with a
copy to human resources. During this period, the employee is required to schedule an exit
interview with human resources. Separating employees must complete a Separation
Clearance Form by their last day of work. Salary will be paid through the effective date of
the resignation or retirement. Payment will be made for annual leave accrued as of the
effective date of separation. See the Annual Leave Policy.
Job abandonment is defined as three or more consecutive days of absence from work
without notice of intent to return having been provided to the immediate supervisor. It may
be considered a voluntary separation. No severance pay is due for job abandonment.
Death

In the case of the death of an employee, the employee’s supervisor should contact
human resources.
Long-term Disability

If the university determines that the incumbent is unable to perform the
responsibilities of the position by reason of long-term disability, the employee may be
separated under provisions of the Faculty/Staff Benefits Manual.

Separation While on Probation

During the probationary period, a staff member may be removed from his or her
position at any time, for any reason, and without prior notice. During an extended
probationary period, a staff member removed from a position is entitled to two weeks notice
of termination, or pay in lieu of notice.
Involuntary Separation for Cause

After an employee’s probationary period has been completed, involuntary separation
for cause may be necessary. An involuntary separation for cause includes: the inability,
failure, or refusal of the employee to maintain satisfactory performance of the
responsibilities of the position; conduct which directly and substantially impairs the
effectiveness of the employee in the performance of his or her responsibilities; conduct
which directly and substantially impairs the effectiveness of university operations.
8.2

SUPERVISOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES

Each supervisor should foresee the possibility of a need to remove for cause when the
adequacy of the employee’s performance is in question. It is the supervisor’s responsibility to
give the employee full and timely notice of the problem, and to make full effort, with the
assistance of human resources, to help the employee to maintain or recover his or her
effectiveness or to find a more suitable position.
If the supervisor is unable to prove such efforts in a case in which anticipation was
reasonably possible, the involuntary separation decision may be reversed. There may also be
certain situations requiring involuntary separation where such anticipation is not possible.
Nevertheless, all involuntary separations must be discussed with human resources before the
employee is notified. Except for certain Level III offenses, the supervisor must have issued a
final warning to the employee before termination may be considered, or have communicated
a performance improvement plan in place of a final written warning.
The supervisor, after consulting with human resources and the department head, may
file the Notice of Separation Form. Human resources will review the action and, if the
separation follows policy, approve the form. The signatures of the department head and the
appropriate vice president or executive reporting to the provost must also be obtained on
the form before the employee is separated. The signature of the Vice President of Finance &
Treasurer is required only for the separation of employees who report directly to the Vice

the Notice of Separation.
A staff member who is on probation may be removed from his or her position at any
time, for any reason, and without prior notice. A Notice of Separation and Human
Resources Action Form must be completed to bring about the separation. However, human
resources and department executive signatures are not necessary for probationary employees.
8.3

NOTICE REQUIREMENTS

Except in cases of serious misconduct, the supervisor either must notify the employee
at least two weeks before the effective date of separation or pay the employee for two weeks
in lieu of notice. The separation conference may be held at the work site with the supervisor
and department head present or in human resources with a human resources representative
and supervisor present. At the time of notice of separation or at any time in the notice
period, the supervisor may relieve the employee from the performance of the duties of the
position or change the assignment to other duties. The employee will be paid his or her
salary through the effective date of the separation and for annual leave accrued.
If an employee is removed for cause which requires immediate separation from the
position, the termination of employment may be made effective immediately without a
requirement of severance pay or a notice period. In such a case, salary will cease with
payment only of previous salary due and accrued annual leave.
8.4

A P P E A L S O F S E PA R AT I O N

An employee may file a written appeal to the Staff Personnel Review Board (SPRB)
through the Executive Director of Human Resources. This appeal must state the basis of the
complaint on which it is being filed and must state the remedy sought. The appeal must be
filed within two weeks of the effective date of separation. Request for Appeal Forms are
available to employees in human resources.
The Staff Personnel Review Board, upon receipt of this request, may appoint a
Hearing Panel to hear the issues of fact relating to the appeal of the separation action. The
Hearing Panel will present a written summary of its process and findings to the Staff
Personnel Review Board, which will then prepare and transmit its conclusions and
recommendations to the Vice President of Finance & Treasurer. The decision of the Vice
President of Finance & Treasurer will be final and concludes the appeal.

In the case of abolition of a position by reorganization or by termination of funding, a
written plan and justification must be submitted by the executive in charge of the unit,
through the Executive Director of Human Resources, to the University Counsel, and then to
the President to support the personnel actions being taken. The university will give written
notice at least thirty days prior to the effective date of separation, with payment of salary
through that date and with further payment for annual leave accrued as of that date.
Involuntary terminations due to reorganization or by termination of funding are not subject
to appeal under terms of this chapter, but may be appealed directly to the appropriate vice
president or Executive Director of Human Resources with the possibility of further appeal
to the Vice President for Finance & Treasurer.

In cases of externally funded positions, the university will give written notice at least

appointment has ended as specified on the Human Resources Action Form, payment ceases
automatically unless that appointment is renewed. A request for personnel action stating
either formal separation or renewal of appointment must be submitted. The university will
not pay for accrued annual leave beyond the specified termination date. In cases where
positions have been funded by external agencies, it may be necessary to use all or some of
the 30-day period as annual leave because leave cannot be paid as additional time in these
cases.

Eligibility

Any staff employee may be eligible for severance pay benefits if terminated by or
separated at the request of the university and if not terminated for cause, disability, or death.
Executives and senior staff members have no probationary period and are therefore eligible
for severance pay at any time. For others, eligibility begins after successful completion of the
probationary period for the individual’s first full-time position at the university. Later
probation in other positions do not count towards length of service until successfully
completed. Periods of voluntary unpaid leave do not count towards service.

PURPOSE*

These policies and procedures provide a forum for staff members to express their
complaints. They apply to all matters affecting a staff member’s relationship to the
university, except for discrimination complaints, reasonable accommodation appeals, and
involuntary separation. Procedures for these complaints are in the Employment Policies in
Section Two of this manual. Appeal procedures for involuntary separation are in Section
Eight, Termination. Appeal procedures for disability reasonable accommodation matters are
in the Americans with Disabilities Act Policy. Appeal procedures for discrimination
complaint determinations are described in the Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Policy
section. Retaliation against anyone who files a complaint, who supports or assists an
individual in pursuing a complaint, or who participates in the resolution of a complaint is
prohibited. Any retaliatory action may be the basis for a separate complaint under this policy.
9.2

POLICY*

Clear and open channels for the expression of employee complaints are basic
principles of sound employee relations. Because employees do on occasion differ with
supervisors on important questions, the university has provided subordinates with a
mechanism for appealing the action or decision of a superior to a higher level within the
organization, without fear of retaliation.
Each staff member is responsible for using this procedure in a timely manner
whenever there are unanswered questions or problems which adversely affect any aspect of
the employment relationship. A complaint should be initiated within ten working days of the
circumstances which gave rise to the complaint. Staff members are counseled to avoid
discussing specific problems with members of the university community other than their
supervisor or human resources before making use of this procedure.
Members of human resources are available to any staff member for consultation and
advice about how to resolve problems or file a complaint. They are also available to act as an
intermediary to assist in problem resolution. All conversations between human resources
staff and the staff member may be considered confidential.
9.3

INFORMAL PROCEDURE*

The first step is to report the complaint to the employee’s immediate supervisor or the
supervisor’s immediate supervisor. The staff member should discuss the situation, explain

the nature of the problem, and then suggest a solution, if he or she has one. If it is a group
problem, one or more staff members should represent the group in advising the appropriate
party. Every effort should be made to resolve the problem at this stage. If a satisfactory
solution is not reached, the staff member may proceed to the formal procedure.
9.4

FORMAL PROCEDURE*

The formal procedure should be used if the informal procedure fails to produce a
satisfactory solution. The staff member may use the following formal procedure without fear
of retaliation.
Formal complaints must be filed within 30 calendar days of the event. No more than
ten working days should elapse between steps or between the bringing of the complaint and
the response of each step. Steps I, II, and III may be abbreviated to only one or two steps,
depending on the reporting level of the complainant.
Step I*

The staff member submits a complaint in writing to the supervisor, with a copy to the
Assistant Vice President of Human Resources. The supervisor responds in writing to the
staff member, with a copy to the Assistant Vice President of Human Resources. If the staff
member is dissatisfied with the response, he or she may proceed to the next step. If the
complaint concerns alleged discrimination or denial of equal employment opportunity, the
staff member may initiate the complaint with the Assistant Vice President of Human
Resources.
Step II*

The staff member forwards to the supervisor’s immediate supervisor a written
statement explaining why the first supervisor’s response is not satisfactory, along with a copy
of that response and the original complaint. The supervisor’s immediate supervisor also
responds in writing. If the staff member is dissatisfied with the response, he or she may
proceed to Step III.
Step III*

The staff member refers the entire matter, in writing, for review by the executive
responsible for the office. The staff member’s statement should indicate why the outcome of
Step II was not satisfactory and should be accompanied by copies of all previous
correspondence and pertinent documents. The reviewing executive may make whatever

American University has a sincere interest in the well-being and productivity of its
employees and believes that problems, with early identification and professional treatment,
may be resolved. Therefore, the university has implemented a Faculty and Staff Assistance
Program (FSAP).
The purpose of the FSAP is to assist all full-time employees and members of their
immediate families with professional counseling on any of a broad range of human
problems. Such problems may include:
•

health, physical, or emotional problems;

•

alcohol or other substance abuse problems;

•

financial or legal problems;

•

workplace problems.

The FSAP achieves its purpose through provision of:
•

assessment and referral to prescreened community resources;

•

short term counseling (up to and including six sessions);

•

follow-up contact to assure that assistance received has been effective;

•

education;

•

consultation with managers.

There are no fees for the use of FSAP services. However, the university does not
assume financial responsibility for any other counseling, treatment, hospitalization, or other
fees. These are to be the responsibility of the employee or family member where not covered
by medical/hospitalization insurance.
How an Employee May Use the FSAP

Employees are responsible for maintaining work performance and standards of
conduct. They are encouraged to use the FSAP voluntarily, on a confidential basis, if they
suspect they have a problem, whether or not it is adversely influencing their productivity.

P O L I C I E S

Those individuals who voluntarily access FSAP services, but wish to maintain their
privacy, should make appointments on their own time. Others wishing to have release time
to participate in the FSAP during usual work hours should have advance approval from their
managers. Manager-referred employees will receive the same counseling services as selfreferred employees. Employees are not exempt from existing work policies while
participating in the FSAP. Follow-up interviews are scheduled at appropriate times.
Family problems may also require consultation or counseling. Family members are
encouraged to contact the FSAP if they desire to use its services.
Managers’ Responsibilities

Managers are responsible to assess and evaluate work expectations for employees.
They should advise employees of any deficiencies in performance, document examples of
those behaviors, and allow time for remediation.
If it is determined that usual managerial approaches are not bringing about improved
performance and it is suspected that personal problems may be the cause, the manager is
encouraged to:
•

discuss the situation with an FSAP staff representative;

•

offer the employee referral to the FSAP (this referral should be written as
well as oral);

•

refrain from trying to diagnose the nature of the problem;

•

continue to monitor performance. If improvement in performance does not
take place, appropriate administrative action must be taken.

Managers should also encourage employees who have problems that do not as yet
interfere with work performance to seek assistance on their own by contacting the FSAP
Director’s office.
Participation in the FSAP will not jeopardize the employee’s job security, reputation,
career advancement, or future employment.
Confidentiality

All client information is held in strict confidence in accordance with the Privacy Act of
1974 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Identification of particular employees and the

nature and extent of their problems is communicated only with written consent of the
employees. Similarly, in cases of managerial referral, information is not given to the
participating employee’s manager without written consent from the employee.
FSAP case records are maintained in a secure place and coded in such a manner as to
minimize any possibility of compromise. The maintenance of FSAP records is distinct from
all other employee records.
FSAP staff representatives must operate in conformance to federal, state, and local
laws in obtaining or disclosing information.
Information may be released without written consent in certain cases of medical
emergency, harm to self or others, child abuse, criminal activity, or other cases required by
law. Employees will be advised of this action.
Participation in the FSAP

Participation in the FSAP will not require or result in special regulations, privileges, or
exemption from standard university policies and procedures that apply to work performance
requirements. The FSAP is not intended to be a substitute for or a precondition for, the
administrative action process when managers decide that administrative action is warranted.

EMERGENCY LOAN FUND

American University can provide emergency loans to faculty and staff at no interest
with repayment of the loan amount through scheduled paycheck deductions. The loans will
be initiated through the Faculty/Staff Assistance Program (FSAP), approved by the
Executive Director of Human Resources, and administered by the payroll office.
The Emergency Loan Fund is intended to assist university full-time faculty and staff
who have urgent financial needs. Examples of such emergency needs are as follows:
•

food or shelter (mortgage or rent, groceries, utilities)

•

health/illness care (critical surgery, medical procedures, medications)

•

vehicle repairs (vehicle is essential for work transportation)

•

death of immediate family member (money is needed for transportation to
funeral out of state)

an employee be allowed to borrow from the loan fund until one year has passed since full
repayment of any previous loan.
All loans must be made payable to both the employee and the vendor/creditor. No
funds will be made payable to the employee only. Stop payments initiated by the employee
will not be processed once the employee has received the check.
The loan can be fully prepaid, at any time, without penalty. In the event that the
employee becomes disabled or injured, or leaves the employ of American University for any
reason prior to repayment, he or she will remain fully liable for the full amount of the loan
and, further authorizes American University to deduct any amounts outstanding hereunder
from his or her paycheck. In the event that he or she leaves the employ of American
University, any amounts outstanding under the terms of the agreement will immediately

ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE POLICY*

American University is committed to maintaining a workplace free from illegal drugs
and alcohol or drug abuse. The abuse of alcohol and the use of illegal drugs by members of
the American University community are incompatible with the goals of the institution. In
order to further the university’s commitment to provide a healthy and productive
educational environment, and in compliance with the Drug-Free Schools and Communities
Act Amendments of 1989 and the Drug-Free Work Force rules promulgated by the
Department of Defense and other agencies, the university has established the following
policy on alcohol and other drugs.
As a condition of employment, university employees agree to abide by the terms of
this policy and to notify their supervisor of any criminal drug conviction no later than five
(5) working days after the conviction. For the purposes of this policy “employee” refers to
all full-time faculty and staff, adjunct faculty, and part-time staff.
Employee Misconduct*

Employee misconduct related to alcohol or other drug abuse will not be tolerated.
Violation of the university’s Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy or the Guidelines for Serving
Alcohol at University Events will result in appropriate disciplinary action in accordance with
university policies. Such disciplinary action may include termination of employment and
referral for legal prosecution.
Obvious examples of prohibited conduct include, but are not limited to, the
following:
•

The unauthorized use, possession, manufacture, distribution, dispensation,
or sale of alcohol, drugs, or drug paraphernalia on university premises, on
university business, in university-supplied vehicles, during the employee’s
work hours, or during university sponsored activities. For the purposes of
this policy, “drugs” include marijuana, cocaine, opiates, PCP,
amphetamines, and any other controlled substances. Unauthorized
possession includes on an employee’s person, as well as storage in a locker,
desk, university supplied or personal vehicle, or any other repository on
university premises or while on university business.

•

Coming to work, or performing any job duties while impaired by alcohol or
drugs on university premises, in university-supplied vehicles, in any location
while on university business, or during university sponsored activities.

•

The possession, use, manufacture, distribution, dispensation or sale of
alcohol or drugs off university premises that may adversely affect the
individual’s work performance, his or her own or others’ safety at work, or
the university’s reputation in the community.

•

Failure to adhere to the requirements of any drug treatment or counseling
program in which the employee is enrolled.

•

Conviction under any criminal drug statute for a violation occurring in the
workplace or in another location while on university business or during
university sponsored activities, or conviction under any criminal drug
statute under circumstances that adversely affect the university’s reputation
in the community.

•

Failure to notify the university of any conviction, within five (5) days of the
conviction, under any criminal drug statute for a violation occurring in the
workplace, on university premises, on university business, in university
supplied vehicles, during employee’s work hours, or during university
sponsored activities.

•

Deliberate failure to comply with the requirements of law or federal rules
and regulations under the university’s Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy, or
refusal or failure to follow reasonable instructions issued by a supervisor
implementing this policy.

Improper use of prescription medication is a violation of this policy. Employees are
expected to notify their supervisor if they are taking any prescribed medication that may
adversely impact their job performance. Employees should keep all prescription medication
in its original container bearing a label that shows drug identity; date of prescription, and
name of the prescribing physician.
The university reserves the right to test any employee reasonably believed to be under
the influence of drugs or alcohol while on the job.
In addition, any employee who serves or provides alcoholic beverages in his or her
official capacity is subject to the Guidelines for Serving Alcohol at University Events. These
guidelines should be reviewed by all employees hosting in their official capacities social
events attended by students if alcoholic beverages will be served.

Government Grants and Contracts*

Employees of American University engaged in government grants and contracts may
be subject to additional drug-free workplace compliance requirements where required by
government grant, contract, or law. These requirements may include, but are not limited to,
drug and alcohol testing.
Alcohol and Drug Abuse*

The university provides a Faculty Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) for its faculty and
staff experiencing problems with alcohol or drugs. Faculty or staff members are encouraged
to contact the FSAP for help. Employees who voluntarily disclose their abuse of alcohol or
use of illegal drugs to their supervisor prior to an arrest for an alcohol or drug-related
offense will be referred to the Faculty Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) for assistance and
further referral for treatment.
Additionally, depending upon the nature of their position, an employee’s retention
may be conditioned upon satisfactory completion of a treatment program. Such an employee
may be required to provide proof of compliance with their treatment program throughout
the course of the program. Such proof of compliance may include, but is not limited to,
satisfactory results on random drug/alcohol testing. These provisions do not affect any
disciplinary action for criminal conviction or alcohol/drug-related misconduct on the job.
The employee’s job may be restructured during that time period.
Cooperation with Law Enforcement Authorities*

American University cooperates fully with law enforcement authorities. Violations of
policies which are also violations of federal or local law will be referred to the appropriate
agencies. In such situations, cases may proceed concurrently at the university and in the
criminal justice system as necessary.
Criminal Sanctions*

In addition to the criminal sanctions described below, employees convicted of drugrelated offenses are subject to civil penalties. Such penalties may include suspension or
revocation of professional and occupational licenses, restriction from public employment for
up to five (5) years, and denial of retirement benefits. Workers’ compensation benefits will
also be denied in certain instances where alcohol or other drugs are a cause of injury.

District of Columbia Law*

District of Columbia law prohibits the purchase or possession of alcohol by a person
under the age of 21, or the furnishing of alcohol to such a person. Purposefully
misrepresenting age, possession or presentation of fraudulent identification for the purpose
of procuring alcohol is also prohibited. Additionally, driving under the influence of alcohol
or other drugs is illegal. The punishment for these offenses may include imprisonment,
payment of a fine, mandatory treatment and education programs, community service, and
mandatory loss of one’s driver’s license.
Under District of Columbia law, it is a crime to knowingly or intentionally
manufacture, distribute, or possess, with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled
substance or drug paraphernalia. A conviction under local laws may result in imprisonment,
a fine or both. The length of prison term and the amount of the fine depend upon the
particular type of controlled substances involved. Subsequent convictions and violations
involving distribution to minors carry increased penalties up to twice the usual sanctions.
Federal Law*

Federal laws prohibit possession, use, distribution, manufacture or dispensing
controlled substances. As required by federal regulations, charts accompanying this policy
detail federal penalties for drug trafficking and possession of a Controlled Substance. See
Table 1 “Federal Trafficking Penalties for Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V (except Marijuana)”
and Table 2 “Federal Trafficking Penalties for Marijuana, Hashish, and Hashish Oil,
Schedule I Substances.” Both tables were retrieved April 24, 2013, from
http://www.justice.gov/dea/druginfo/ftp3.shtml.
Counseling and Treatment Resources*

American University has a sincere interest in the well-being and productivity of its
employees and believes that substance abuse problems, with early identification and
professional treatment, may be resolved. The university provides a Faculty and Staff
Assistance Program (FSAP) for its staff and faculty which is available to assist employees
with substance abuse problems. For a detailed description of the FSAP, please see Section
11.1, Faculty and Staff Assistance Program.
In addition, a variety of counseling services and treatment centers are available
throughout the District of Columbia metropolitan area for anyone experiencing problems
related to substance abuse. Although most counseling and treatment centers charge for their

themselves of the FSAP counselor’s referral sources and assistance to identify the services or
programs which most closely meet their specific needs.
For a listing of additional on-campus and off-campus resources please see the Student
Handbook: Section VIII. Alcohol and Other Drugs. Employees are encouraged to avail
themselves of these resources and contact human resources for more information.
Health Risks*

The following information on health risks is from “What Works: Schools Without
Drugs,” U.S. Department of Education (1992) detailing the possible effects and health risks
associated with alcohol consumption.
Alcohol consumption causes a number of marked changes in behavior. Even low
doses significantly impair the judgment and coordination required to drive a car safely,
increasing the likelihood that the driver will be involved in an accident. Low to moderate
doses of alcohol also increase the incidence of a variety of aggressive acts, including spouse
and child abuse. Moderate to high doses of alcohol cause marked impairments in higher
mental functions, severely altering a person’s ability to learn and remember information.
Very high doses cause respiratory depression and death. If combined with other depressants
of the central nervous system, much lower doses of alcohol will produce the effects just
described.
Repeated use of alcohol can lead to dependence. Sudden cessation of alcohol intake is
likely to produce withdrawal symptoms, including severe anxiety, tremors, hallucinations,
and convulsions. Alcohol withdrawal can be life-threatening. Long-term consumption of
large quantities of alcohol, particularly when combined with poor nutrition, can also lead to
permanent damage to vital organs such as the brain and the liver.
Mothers who drink during pregnancy may give birth to infants with fetal alcohol
syndrome. These infants have irreversible physical abnormalities and mental retardation. In
addition, research indicates that children of alcoholic parents are at greater risk than other
youngsters of becoming alcoholics.

Controlled Substances*

Cannabis (Marijuana, Hashish). The use of marijuana may impair or reduce short term
memory and comprehension, alter sense of time, and reduce coordination and energy level.
Users often have a lowered immune system and an increased risk of lung cancer. The active
ingredient in marijuana, THC, is stored in the fatty tissues of the brain and reproductive
system for a minimum of 28 to 30 days.
Hallucinogens. Lysergic acid (LSD), mescaline, and psilocybin cause illusions and
hallucinations. The user may experience panic, confusion, suspicion, anxiety, and loss of
control. Delayed effects, or flashbacks, can occur even when use has ceased. Phencyclidine
(PCP) affects the section of the brain that controls the intellect and keeps instincts in check.
Because the drug blocks pain receptors, violent PCP episodes may result in self-inflicted
injuries.
Cocaine/Crack. Cocaine users often have a stuffy, runny nose and may have a
perforated nasal septum. The immediate effects of cocaine use include dilated pupils and
elevated blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature, followed by
depression. Crack, or freebase rock cocaine, is extremely addictive and can cause delirium,
hallucinations, blurred vision, severe chest pain, muscle spasms, convulsions, and even
death.
Amphetamines. Amphetamines can cause a rapid or irregular heartbeat, tremors, loss of
coordination, collapse, and death. Heavy users are prone to irrational acts.
Heroin. Heroin is an opiate drug that causes the body to have diminished pain
reactions. The use of heroin can result in coma or death due to a reduction in heart rate.
For further information, download Drugs of Abuse 2011 Edition, A DEA Resource
Guide at http://www.justice.gov/dea/docs/drugs_of_abuse_2011.pdf, for additional
possible effects and health risks associated with the use of illicit drugs and controlled
substances.

In addition to any disciplinary action, the university, through its FSAP, may refer the
employee to a treatment and counseling program for alcohol or drug abuse. Employees
referred to such a program by the university must immediately cease any alcohol or drug
abuse, and must comply with all conditions of the treatment and counseling program. The
FSAP shall determine whether an employee it has referred for treatment and counseling
should be temporarily reassigned to another position.
For employees working on any federal grant or contract, the university is required by
federal law to notify the federal government contracting agency within ten days after learning
of an employee’s criminal drug statute conviction in the workplace.

A N N U A L L E AV E

The university endeavors, through its arrangements for earned leave, to provide its
regular full-time staff with the opportunity to absent themselves from their duties for
reasonable periods of time without loss of pay, for vacation purposes and to attend to
personal affairs. Annual leave must be approved in advance by the employee’s supervisor
and must be taken at times when it will not interfere with the ongoing work of the office to
which the employee is assigned. Part-time employees do not accrue annual leave.
No more than 15 days of earned annual leave may be carried forward beyond the end
of the fiscal year (April 30th). The number of hours in a day of carry-over is standardized
based on employment classification and the number of hours worked per week. Annual
leave is not accrued while a staff member is on leave without pay or short term disability.
Staff members receiving Workers’ Compensation Benefits, however, will continue to accrue
annual leave.
At an employee’s effective date of separation, annual leave is converted to terminal
pay and reimbursed to the employee. Leave is not accrued on annual leave converted to
terminal pay. Holiday pay is not provided for holidays that fall after the last actual working
day. The effective date of separation may not be extended beyond the last actual working
day (see “Voluntary Separation” section under Separation Policies, Termination).
Administrators/Staff with Faculty Rank

Administrators/staff with faculty rank who are contracted on a 12-month basis do not
accrue annual leave. Four weeks of leave are granted each fiscal year, to be taken when
conflicts with duties will be minimal; no leave is carried over into the new fiscal year. Deans
of the colleges approve and administer leave for administrators/staff with faculty rank.
Senior Staff and Administrative/Professional Staff

Senior staff and administrative/professional staff who were hired on or after May 1,
1995, earn annual leave at the same rate as clerical, secretarial, technical, skilled craft &
service staff (see chart below). Employees in this category hired before May 1, 1995, earn 21
days of annual leave during each year of service. Leave is accrued for each month worked at
a rate commensurate with the standardized work week for that individual. Employees
beginning active service in this category prior to the 15th of the month will accrue leave for

month. Any employee in this class who is entering a status in which no leave is accruable
(e.g., leave without pay) will be subject to the same guidelines as outlined above.
When a member of one of these employment categories plans to be absent, he or she
must make arrangements with the appropriate supervisor so that another person, who will
be present during the absence, will be fully informed about the work status and be able to
speak authoritatively in an emergency.
Each individual must complete a leave report for the preceding month and return it to
human resources by the due date indicated on it. Failure to do so will result in the paycheck
being held in human resources until the leave report has been submitted.
Clerical, Secretarial, Technical and Service Staff

A member of the clerical, secretarial, technical or service staff earns annual leave in
accordance with the following schedule:
Service Years one and two:

12 working days a year

Service Years three and four:

15 working days a year

Service Years five +:

21 working days a year

Leave is accrued for each hour worked at a rate commensurate with the standardized
workday for the individual. Earned leave with pay must be recorded on the time and
attendance report in periods of no less than one-quarter hour. The time and attendance
report must be completed, signed, and returned to human resources by 4:00 p.m., by the due
date indicated on it. Failure to do so will result in the paycheck being withheld in human
resources until the time and attendance report has been submitted. Staff members who leave
the university voluntarily or as a result of reorganization and return within one/three years
continue to accrue annual leave at their prior rate.

A staff member who spends not more than 15 calendar days during a calendar year in
active duty training with Military Reserve or National Guard components of the Armed
Forces of the United States will be granted a paid leave absence for such training when
documented with appropriate time and attendance sheet.
A faculty member or staff member who is called to active Military Reserve or National
Guard duty will be placed on military leave of absence. The faculty or staff member must
give advance or written notice unless precluded by military necessity or such notice is
unreasonable or impossible. For periods of active duty of 31 days or more, the returning
employee must provide documentation, upon request, that establishes length of and
character of the service and timeliness of the application for reemployment. All National
Guard and Reserve members are encouraged to provide a copy of orders or other type of
documentation as soon as available and if possible before the commencement of military
duty.
An employee on military leave will not receive pay from the university but may elect to
continue to participate in the benefits plans. The benefits office will notify individuals about
the procedures for benefits continuation.
A full-time staff member who has accrued annual leave may elect to take that leave
and delay the effective date of the military leave. While a staff member is receiving accrued
leave, benefits remain active. Some restrictions may apply to these benefits as they
coordinate with military benefits.
An employee who is released from active duty under honorable conditions and applies
for reinstatement within the required time period will be reinstated into the position
previously held or into another position that is of like seniority, status and pay, provided the
employee is qualified to perform the duties of the position.
The period an individual has to make an application for reemployment or report back
to work after military service is based on time spent on military duty. For service of less than
31 days, the service member must return at the beginning of the next regularly scheduled
work period on the first full day after release from service, taking into account safe travel
home plus an eight-hour rest period. Reservists who serve more than 30 days but less than
181 days must submit an oral or written application for reemployment to human resources
within 14 days of release of service. For service of more than 180 days, an application for
reemployment must be made within 90 days of release of service. If there is reasonable

the period of military service, that employee may be rehired at the higher position and/or
pay level. Similarly, if an employee would have been demoted, or received a reduction in pay,
that employee may be rehired at the lower level. The purpose of this reemployment policy is
to ensure that employees are not penalized for taking military leave. Individual situations are
normally reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
In case of a faculty member on military leave, personnel actions will be processed on a
case-by-case basis, after consultation with the Dean of Academic Affairs. The relevant
processes are resumed when the faculty member returns to the university.
Reemployment rights do not apply to employees who occupy a position that is limited
to a specific time period or project. Employees on grants or contracts fall into this category.
However, the university will make an effort to reemploy individuals in this situation.
Upon reinstatement, reservists are entitled to enroll in the insurance programs they
maintained before taking a military leave of absence. The period of time that an individual
was on active duty service will be included as service time at the university in determining
any benefits that use length of service as a determinant in the amount of the benefit.
Reservists who are reinstated are offered job protection for a period of time based on
the length of service. Reservists who are reemployed cannot be discharged, without cause,
from employment within one year after the date of reemployment if the person’s period of
service before reemployment was more than 180 days. If the person’s period of service was
more than 30 days but less than 181 days before reemployment, the person may not be
discharged, without cause, within 180 days after the date of reemployment.
This policy does not apply to state call-ups for National Guard for disaster relief, riots
or circumstances other than call to active duty. Faculty or staff should contact human
resources in these situations.

The purpose of the leave share program is to establish a system for staff to donate or

in conjunction with the university’s short term disability policy and may be used to satisfy
the waiting period for short term disability. This program does not alter the short term
disability or the Family Medical Leave policy.
Definitions

•

Leave transfer is a voluntary transfer of annual leave balance from one
employee to the annual leave account of another employee.

•

Leave donor is a staff member whose written request for the transfer of their
annual leave to the annual leave account of a leave recipient has been
approved by human resources.

•

Leave recipient is a current staff member affected by a serious medical
emergency for whom human resources sends out a request for leave share
donations from one or more leave donors.

•

Serious medical emergency is an acute medical condition of the staff member
whereby the absence is expected to result in a financial hardship to the
employee because of the unavailability of annual or sick leave. Certain
medical conditions are excluded from eligibility for this benefit including,
but not limited to, any occupationally related accident or illness for which
workers’ compensation benefits have been awarded, intentionally selfinflected injuries, elective cosmetic procedures, or injuries occurring in the
course of committing a felony or assault. Employees are also ineligible to
use leave-sharing benefits if the medical emergency is to care for an ill
family member or during the period of any disciplinary suspensions.

Eligibility

To be eligible for donated leave, a leave recipient must have completed six months of
full-time employment and qualify for short term disability.
Leave Recipient Application and Approval

Application for use of the leave sharing benefit is made in conjunction with
applications for short term disability and family and medical leave. Staff members should
contact human resources for a determination of eligibility for FMLA and short term
disability. To become a leave recipient the staff member must have exhausted, or plan to
exhaust, all annual and sick leave and be approved for short term disability.
For medical conditions resulting in an absence or an expected absence of longer than
two weeks, employees must complete a short term disability application. At that time, the
staff member will have the opportunity to receive leave donations to cover the waiting
period for short term disability (currently 15 calendar days). In no case shall the donated
leave exceed the waiting period of the short term disability period.
Human resources will contact all departments through the university’s email system to
publicize anonymously a need for leave donations. The name of the leave recipient will not
be released in this announcement.
Leave recipients will receive salary continuation based on their full-time salary
immediately preceding the commencement of their medical leave. Payments will be made
through regular payroll processing. Leave benefits will be subject to all payroll taxes and
other payroll deductions.

Leave Donor Application and Approval

A staff member may submit a voluntary written request that a specified number of
their accrued annual leave hours be transferred from their annual leave account to the annual
leave account of a specified leave recipient.
The maximum amount of annual leave that a staff member may donate is limited to
the leave donor’s accrued annual leave balance. The minimum amount of annual leave that a
staff member may donate is limited to seven hours.
Termination of Medical Emergency

The leave recipient will keep human resources advised of the status of the medical
emergency through the short term disability process. In no case shall the donated leave
exceed the approved medical emergency or the waiting period for the short term disability
period, whichever is shorter.
Termination of the leave share benefit is determined by the status of the amount of
leave donated to the leave recipient and not necessarily by the employee’s medical condition
or ability to return to work.
Unused leave donated for a specific leave recipient will be returned to the leave donor
only if the Leave Donor Authorization has not yet been processed.
Leave donations are intended to be given freely, without promise of benefit and not
under intimidation, coercion or threat of reprisal for failure to make the donation.
Leave recipients shall be required to reimburse leave hours donated to them if
compensation is received from another source for the same period of time the employee
received donated leave hours, such as worker’s compensation benefits; or if human
resources determines that abuse has occurred. The leave recipient may be required to repay
all donated leave, and or may be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with AU’s
program. If repayment is required, leave payment shall be made at the current rate of the
recipient, not the donor.
The university reserves the right to revise or eliminate this program as necessary.

The university offers faculty and staff members the opportunity to take unpaid leave
for specific family or medical related issues and military-service related events, in compliance
with the District of Columbia Family and Medical Leave Act of 1990, as amended, and the
Federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended. Family Leave refers to leave
taken under specific circumstances that relate to family events. Service Member Leave refers
to leave taken for a qualifying exigency or to care for a covered service member. Medical
Leave refers to leave taken due to a serious health condition of the faculty or staff member.
Collectively, leave under this policy will be referred to as FMLA Leave.
Eligibility*

In general, faculty and staff are eligible for FMLA Leave if they meet certain length of
service and number of hours worked requirements:
Length of service: under the Federal and D.C. laws, a faculty/staff member must have
worked at the university for a period totaling 12 months. Under the D.C. law, the 12-month
period must be without a break in employment.
Hours of work: under the D.C. law, the faculty/staff member must have worked at
least 1,000 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the request for leave.
Under the Federal law, the faculty/staff member must have worked at least 1,250 hours
during the 12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave itself.
Only hours actually worked are counted toward the requirement, excluding paid or unpaid
leave such as annual and sick leave.
However, all periods of absence from work due to covered service under the
Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act are counted in the length
of service and hours of work when calculating a faculty or staff member’s eligibility for
FMLA leave.
Applying for FMLA Leave*

When the need for FMLA Leave is known, such as for an expected birth of a child, or
a planned medical treatment, faculty and staff must submit an application and supporting
documentation at least 30 days in advance of the requested effective date of leave. Faculty
and staff members should inform their supervisors/department chairs of their request for
leave as soon as possible, and should work with human resources to review the process.

When the need for leave is not known, faculty and staff must complete the application
for leave as soon as possible. Staff must use annual leave or leave without pay until the
FMLA Leave application is approved.
Length of Leave*

Length of leaves for the various types of FMLA Leave is a complicated issue due to
different rules between Federal and District of Columbia laws. The amount of leave is
explained in the three sections below on Family Leave, Service Member Leave, and Medical
Leave. In general, under Federal FMLA law, faculty and staff are limited to a total of 12
workweeks of leave (26 workweeks in the case of leave to care for a covered service
member) during any 12-month period. Under D.C. FMLA law, faculty and staff are limited
to a total of 16 workweeks of Family Leave and 16 workweeks of Medical Leave during any
24-month period. In addition, D.C. and Federal FMLA Leave run concurrently with each
other. In evaluating the length of eligible leave, the faculty or staff member will receive the
maximum leave allowed under both laws.

Family Leave*

Eligible faculty and staff members may take unpaid Family Leave for the following
reasons:
•

the birth of the faculty or staff member’s child (leave must be taken within
12 months after birth); or

•

the placement of a child with the faculty or staff member for adoption or
foster care (leave must be taken within 12 months after the placement); or

•

the placement of a child with the faculty or staff member for whom the
faculty or staff member permanently assumes and discharges parental
responsibility (leave must be taken within 12 months after that placement)
(under D.C. Law only); or

A serious health condition for Family Leave is defined as a physical or mental illness,
or an injury or impairment, which requires inpatient care or continuing treatment by a health
care provider.
Family Member for Family Leave*

A family member under DC law includes:
•

a person related by blood, legal custody, or marriage; or

•

a child for whom the faculty/staff member permanently assumes and
discharges parental responsibility; or

•

a person with whom the faculty or staff members shares or has shared
within the last year a mutual residence and maintains a committed
relationship.

A family member under Federal law includes a faculty/staff member's spouse, son,
daughter, or parent.
Length of Family Leave*

Under D.C. law, up to 16 workweeks of unpaid Federal Family Leave may be taken
during a 24-month period. The 12 workweeks of unpaid FMLA leave in any 12-month
period, to which faculty and staff are entitled under Federal law, will run concurrently with
the 16 workweeks entitlement under D.C. law. A rolling 24-month or 12-month, as
applicable, period measured backward from the date a faculty/staff member uses any Family
Leave will be used to calculate the amount of leave a faculty/staff member is eligible for in
any given 24-month or 12-month period. This means that each time a faculty/staff member
takes Family Leave; the remaining leave entitlement would be any balance of the 16 or 12
weeks that have not been used during the prior 24 or 12 months.
Two family members, who work in the same office and have the same or interrelated
duties, may only take a combined total of 16 or 12 weeks of Family Leave.
When medically necessary, a faculty/staff member can take Family Leave for the care
of an ill family member intermittently. Intermittent means leave that is taken to
accommodate conditions requiring periodic absence for medical appointments or
treatments. Alternatively, with the approval of the faculty/staff member’s

Coordination of Family Leave with Paid Leave*

Family Leave is unpaid leave. However, staff may substitute annual leave for their
Family Leave. These days will count towards the total leave entitlement under local and
Federal laws. Staff may use sick leave for Family Leave as stated in the Accrued Sick and
Safe Leave Policy on the University Policies page at http://www.american.edu/policies/.
Unless using paid leave, staff members on Family Leave do not receive paid holidays.
Faculty do not accrue paid leave. Faculty should consult with their dean and

Serious Injury or Illness*

For current members of the Armed Forces, serious illness or injury is defined as a
condition incurred in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces or that existed
before the beginning of the member’s active duty and was aggravated by service in the line
of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces and that may render the service member
medically unfit to perform the duties of the member’s office, grade, rank, or rating.
For covered veterans, a serious injury or illness means an injury or illness that was
incurred or aggravated in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces and manifested
itself before or after the member became and veteran, and is:

member unable to perform the duties of the service member’s office, grade, rank or
rating; or
2. A physical or mental condition for which the covered veteran has received a U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs Service-Related Disability Rating of 50 percent or
greater, and the need for military caregiver leave is related to that condition; or
3. A physical or mental condition that substantially impairs the veteran’s ability to
work because of a disability or disabilities related to military service, or would do so
absent treatment; or
4. An injury that is the basis for the veteran’s enrollment in the Department of
Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers.

weeks that have not been used during the prior 24 or 12 months.
When medically necessary, a faculty/staff member can take Medical Leave
intermittently. Intermittent means leave that is taken to accommodate conditions requiring
periodic absence for medical appointments or treatments. Alternatively, the leave may be
taken on a reduced schedule basis. A reduced leave schedule is a change in the staff
member’s schedule over a period of several weeks or months, normally from full-time to
part-time. Consent of the supervisor and human resources is necessary before a faculty/staff
member may begin a reduced work schedule as an alternative to intermittent medical leave.
Coordination of Medical Leave with Paid Leave*

Medical Leave is unpaid leave. However, staff may substitute accrued sick leave for
their Medical Leave. Staff may also substitute accrued annual leave for Medical Leave, with
permission of their department and human resources. These days will count towards the
total leave entitlement under local and Federal laws. Unless using paid leave, staff on Medical
Leave do not receive paid holidays.
Faculty do not accrue paid leave. Faculty should consult with their dean and
department chair regarding pay while on Family Leave.

Transfer to a Temporary Position*

Where recurring periods of leave are required, the university may transfer a faculty or
staff member temporarily to an available position for which the person is qualified which has
an equivalent pay and benefits, and which better accommodates recurring periods of leave
than the regular employment position.

Extension of Benefits*

Group health insurance benefits may be continued throughout the leave without pay if
the faculty/staff member continues to pay his/her portion of the premiums. All other
benefits cease while a faculty/staff member is on unpaid leave unless they elect to continue
certain benefits through human resources and the faculty/staff member agrees to assume
their full cost. Educational benefits may continue if the faculty/staff member certifies
his/her intention to return to full-time active status immediately for at least 30 days after the
leave has ended and agrees in writing to reimburse the university if he/she does not return to
work.
Return to Work*

Upon return to work from FMLA Leave, faculty/staff members will be restored to
either their original or an equivalent position (unless one of the exceptions in the law
applies). Faculty and staff do not accrue employment benefits during a Family or Medical
Leave. In order to return to work from Medical Leave, the university may require a “fitnessfor-duty” certification from the faculty/staff member’s medical provider. American
University reserves the right to obtain additional medical opinions at the university’s expense
prior to permitting the faculty/staff member to return to work.
Temporary Replacement of Faculty and Staff*

A department may temporarily replace faculty and staff on FMLA Leave. Lapsed
department salary may be used to cover the temporary replacement. Normal budgetary
channels should be followed to determine funding requirements.
Certification of Serious Health Condition, Qualifying Exigency, and Serious Injury or
Illness of Covered Service Member*
In General*

Faculty and staff must provide complete and sufficient medical or military
documentation in support of a request for FMLA Leave. Failure to provide such
documentation may result in the denial or delay of FMLA. The university may seek a second
or third opinion of medical documentation, and may also request reasonable updates of
supporting documentation. The faculty/staff member may also be required to provide
documentation of the familial relationship to support Service Member leave.

The university will promptly notify the faculty/staff member in writing if the
faculty/staff member is eligible for FMLA and, if so, whether the requested leave will be
counted as FMLA leave. In certain circumstances the university may designate an absence as
FMLA even if the faculty/staff member did not request FMLA.
Serious Health Condition*

A faculty/staff member wishing to take leave because of the faculty/staff member’s
own serious health condition or that of a family member must provide human resources
with timely certification of that condition by the treating health care provider. This
certification must include:
1. the date on which the serious health condition began;
2. the probable duration of the condition;
3. appropriate medical facts regarding the condition; and
4. as appropriate, a statement that the faculty/staff member is needed to care
for a family member (along with an estimate of the time required), or that
the faculty/staff member is unable to perform his or her expected functions
at work.
In the case of intermittent or reduced schedule leave due to the faculty/staff member’s
own serious health condition, the certification must specify the medical necessity for
intermittent or reduced schedule leave and the expected duration of the intermittent or
reduced schedule leave. In the case of intermittent leave to care for a family member with a
serious health condition, the certification must state that the intermittent or reduced
schedule leave is necessary or will assist in the family member’s recovery, and must state the
expected duration and schedule of the intermittent or reduced schedule leave. If the
intermittent or reduced schedule leave is for planned medical treatment, the certification
must state the dates on which that treatment is expected and the duration of the treatment.
Failure to provide the required certification may result in the denial or delay of leave. Please
contact human resources for details and to obtain a medical certification form.
Qualifying Exigency and Serious Injury or Illness of Covered Service Member*

The university will require certification of the qualifying exigency and the serious
injury or illness of the covered Service Member for FMLA leave. Failure to provide the
required certification may result in the denial or delay of leave. Please contact human
resources for details and to obtain medical certification form.

No Retaliation or Interference*

The university will not discriminate or retaliate against a faculty/staff member who
exercises his or her rights under the FMLA, or otherwise interfere with those rights.
Interpretation of Policy*

The provisions of this policy are intended to comply with the D.C. and Federal family
and Medical Leave laws and regulations and do not grant rights less than or greater than
required by law. To the extent that this policy is ambiguous or contradicts the laws or
regulations, the language of the laws or regulations will prevail.
