Regulation SBSR—Reporting and Dissemination of Security-Based Swap Information
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: In accordance with Section 763 and Section 766 of Title VII (“Title VII”) of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”) is adopting Regulation
SBSR—Reporting and Dissemination of Security-Based Swap Information (“Regulation SBSR”)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Regulation SBSR provides for
the reporting of security-based swap information to registered security-based swap data
repositories (“registered SDRs”) or the Commission, and the public dissemination of securitybased swap transaction, volume, and pricing information by registered SDRs. Registered SDRs
are required to establish and maintain certain policies and procedures regarding how transaction
data are reported and disseminated, and participants of registered SDRs that are registered
security-based swap dealers or registered major security-based swap participants are required to
establish and maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that they
comply with applicable reporting obligations. Regulation SBSR contains provisions that address
the application of the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements to cross-border
security-based swap activity as well as provisions for permitting market participants to satisfy
1

these requirements through substituted compliance. Finally, Regulation SBSR will require a
registered SDR to register with the Commission as a securities information processor.
DATES: Effective Date: May 18, 2015
Compliance Date: For Rules 900, 907, and 909 of Regulation SBSR, the compliance date is the
effective date. For Rules 901, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, and 908 of Regulation SBSR,
compliance dates are being proposed in a separate release, 34-74245 (February 11, 2015).

Introduction
The Commission is adopting Regulation SBSR, which implements the requirements for

regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swap transactions set forth in
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. 1 The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, among other reasons, to
promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency
in the financial system. 2 The 2008 financial crisis highlighted significant issues in the over-thecounter (“OTC”) derivatives markets, which experienced dramatic growth in the years leading
up to the financial crisis and are capable of affecting significant sectors of the U.S. economy.
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act provides for a comprehensive new regulatory framework for
swaps and security-based swaps, by, among other things: (1) providing for the registration and

comprehensive regulation of swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants,
and major security-based swap participants; (2) imposing clearing and trade execution
requirements on swaps and security-based swaps, subject to certain exceptions; (3) creating
recordkeeping, regulatory reporting, and public dissemination requirements for swaps and
security-based swaps; and (4) enhancing the rulemaking and enforcement authorities of the
Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”).
The Commission initially proposed Regulation SBSR in November 2010. 3 In May 2013,
the Commission re-proposed the entirety of Regulation SBSR as part of the Cross-Border
Proposing Release 4 and re-opened the comment period for all of its other outstanding Title VII
rulemakings. 5
The Commission received 86 comments that were specifically directed to the comment
file (File No. S7-34-10) for the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, of which 38 were
comments submitted in response to the re-opening of the comment period. 6 Of the comments
directed to the comment file (File No. S7-02-13) for the Cross-Border Proposing Release, six
referenced Regulation SBSR specifically, while many others addressed cross-border issues
generally, without specifically referring to Regulation SBSR. The Commission also has
considered other comments germane to regulatory reporting and/or public dissemination of

(December 2, 2010) (“Regulation SBSR Proposing Release”).

However, one comment that was specifically directed to the comment file for the
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release exclusively addressed issues related to clearing
“debt swaps.” See Hamlet Letter. Because the subject matter of this comment letter is
beyond the scope of Regulation SBSR, the Commission is not addressing this comment.

10

security-based swaps that were submitted in other contexts. The comments discussed in this
release are listed in the Appendix to the release.
The Commission is now adopting Regulation SBSR largely as re-proposed, with certain
revisions suggested by commenters or designed to clarify the rules. In addition, in separate
releases, as discussed below, the Commission also is adopting rules relating to SDR registration,
duties, and core principles (the “SDR Adopting Release”) 7 and is proposing certain rules,
amendments, and guidance relating to Regulation SBSR (“Regulation SBSR Proposed
Amendments Release”). 8 The principal aspects of Regulation SBSR—which, as adopted,
consists of ten rules, Rules 900 to 909 under the Exchange Act 9—are briefly described
immediately below. A detailed discussion of each rule within Regulation SBSR, as well as how
these rules interact with the rules in the SDR Adopting Release, follows in the body of this
release. 10
A.

Summary of Final Regulation SBSR

Rule 900, as adopted, sets forth the definitions used throughout Regulation SBSR. The
defined terms are discussed in connection with the rules in which they appear.

7

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 74246 (February 11, 2015).

8

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 74245 (February 11, 2015).

9

15 U.S.C. 78a et seq. All references in this release to the Exchange Act refer to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

10

If any of the provisions of these rules, or the application thereof to any person or
circumstance, is held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or
application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances that can be given effect
without the invalid provision or application.

11

Rule 901(a), as adopted, assigns the reporting obligation for all security-based swaps
except for the following: (1) clearing transactions; 11 (2) security-based swap transactions
executed on a platform 12 that will be submitted to clearing; (3) transactions where there is no
U.S. person, registered security-based swap dealer, or registered major security-based swap
participant on either side; and (4) transactions where there is no registered security-based swap
dealer or registered major security-based swap participant on either side and there is a U.S.
person on only one side. For purposes of this release, the Commission uses the term “covered
transactions” to refer to all security-based swaps other than those listed in the four categories
above; all covered transactions shall be reported in the manner set forth in Regulation SBSR, as
adopted. For covered transactions, Rule 901(a) assigns the duty to report to one side of the
transaction (the “reporting side”). The “reporting hierarchy” established in Rule 901(a) is based,
where possible, on the registration status (e.g., registration as a security-based swap dealer or
major security-based swap participant) of the direct and indirect counterparties to the transaction.
In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission is proposing
amendments to Rule 901(a) that would impose reporting obligations for security-based swaps in
categories one and two above (i.e., clearing transactions and security-based swap transactions
executed on a platform and that will be submitted to clearing).

11

A “clearing transaction” is defined as “a security-based swap that has a registered
clearing agency as a direct counterparty.” See Rule 900(g).

12

A “platform” is defined as a “national securities exchange or security-based swap
execution facility that is registered or exempt from registration.” See Rule 900(v); infra
note 199 and accompanying text (discussing the definition of “platform”).

12

Rule 901(b), as adopted, provides that if there is no registered security-based swap data
repository (“SDR”) that will accept the report, the reporting side must report the transaction to
the Commission.13
Rule 901(c) sets forth the primary trade information and Rule 901(d) sets forth the
secondary trade information that must be reported. For most transactions, the Rule 901(c)
information will be publicly disseminated. Information reported pursuant to Rule 901(d) is for
regulatory purposes only and will not be publicly disseminated.
Rule 901(e) requires the reporting of life cycle events to the entity to which the original
transaction was reported.
Rule 901(i) requires reporting, to the extent the information is available, of security-based
swaps entered into before the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act (“pre-enactment securitybased swaps”) and security-based swaps entered into after the date of enactment but before Rule
901 becomes fully operative (“transitional security-based swaps”).
B.

Role of Registered SDRs

Rule 902(a) requires a registered SDR to publicly disseminate a transaction report
immediately upon receipt of information about a security-based swap, except in certain limited
circumstances. Pursuant to Rule 902(a), the published transaction report must consist of all the
information reported pursuant to Rule 901(c), plus any condition flag contemplated by the
registered SDR’s policies and procedures that are required by Rule 907. Rule 901(f) requires a
registered SDR to timestamp any information submitted to it pursuant to Rule 901(c), (d), (e), or

13

A “registered security-based swap data repository” is defined as “a person that is
registered with the Commission as a security-based swap data repository pursuant to
Section 13(n) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(n)) and any rules or regulations
thereunder.” See Rule 900(ff).

13

(i), and Rule 901(g) requires a registered SDR to assign a transaction ID to each security-based
swap.
Rule 907(a) requires a registered SDR to establish and maintain written policies and
procedures that detail how it will receive and publicly disseminate security-based swap
transaction information. For example, Rule 907(a)(1) requires policies and procedures that
enumerate the specific data elements of a security-based swap that must be reported to the
registered SDR, including the data elements specified in Rules 901(c) and 901(d). Rule
907(a)(2) requires policies and procedures that specify one or more acceptable data formats,
connectivity requirements, and other protocols for submitting information. Rules 907(a)(3) and
907(a)(4) require policies and procedures for assigning condition flags to the appropriate
transaction reports. In addition, Rule 907(c) requires a registered SDR to make its policies and
procedures available on its website.
Rule 907(e) requires a registered SDR to provide to the Commission, upon request,
information or reports related to the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of data reported to it
pursuant to Regulation SBSR and the registered SDR’s policies and procedures established
thereunder.
Finally, Rule 909 requires a registered SDR also to register with the Commission as a
securities information processor (“SIP”).
C.

Unique Identification Codes

Rule 903 requires a registered SDR to use “unique identification codes” (“UICs”) to
specifically identify a variety of persons and things. The following UICs are specifically
required by Regulation SBSR: counterparty ID, product ID, transaction ID, broker ID, branch
ID, trading desk ID, trader ID, platform ID, and ultimate parent ID.

14

Rule 906(b) requires each participant of a registered SDR to provide the registered SDR
with information sufficient to identify the participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any affiliate(s) of
the participant that are also participants of the registered SDR.
Rule 903(a) provides that, if an internationally recognized standards-setting system
(“IRSS”) meeting certain criteria is recognized by the Commission and has assigned a UIC to a
person, unit of a person, or product (or has endorsed a methodology for assigning transaction
IDs), that UIC must be used by all registered SDRs and their participants in carrying out duties
under Regulation SBSR. If the Commission has not recognized an IRSS—or if the Commissionrecognized IRSS has not assigned a UIC to a particular person or thing—the registered SDR is
required to assign a UIC using its own methodology. Additionally, Rule 903(a) provides that, if
the Commission has recognized such a system that assigns UICs to persons, each participant of a
registered SDR shall obtain a UIC from or through that system for identifying itself, and each
participant that acts as a guarantor of a direct counterparty’s performance of any obligation under
a security-based swap that is subject to Rule 908(a) shall, if the direct counterparty has not
already done so, obtain a UIC for identifying the direct counterparty from or through that system,
if that system permits third-party registration without a requirement to obtain prior permission of
the direct counterparty. As discussed further in Section X(B)(2), infra, the Commission
recognizes the Global LEI System (“GLEIS”), administered by the Regulatory Oversight
Committee (“ROC”), as meeting the criteria specified in Rule 903. The Commission may, on its
own initiative or upon request, evaluate other IRSSs and decide whether to recognize such other
systems.

Public Dissemination and Block Trades

15

Section 13(m)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act 14 authorizes the Commission “to make
security-based swap transaction and pricing data available to the public in such form and at such
times as the Commission determines appropriate to enhance price discovery.” Section
13(m)(1)(C) of the Exchange Act 15 identifies four categories of security-based swaps and
authorizes the Commission “to provide by rule for the public availability of security-based swap
transaction, volume, and pricing data.” Section 13(m)(1)(C) further provides that, with respect
to each of these four categories of security-based swaps, “the Commission shall require real-time
public reporting for such transactions.” Section 13(m)(1)(D) of the Exchange Act 16 provides that
the Commission may require registered entities (such as registered SDRs) to publicly
disseminate the security-based swap transaction and pricing data required to be reported under
Section 13(m) of the Exchange Act. Finally, Section 13(n)(5)(D)(ii) of the Exchange Act 17
requires SDRs to provide security-based swap information “in such form and at such frequency
as the Commission may require to comply with public reporting requirements.”
Under Rule 902, as adopted, a registered SDR must, immediately upon receiving a
transaction report of a security-based swap, publicly disseminate the primary trade information
of that transaction, along with any condition flags.
In addition, Section 13(m)(1)(E) of the Exchange Act 18 requires the Commission rule for
real-time public dissemination of cleared security-based swaps to: (1) “specify the criteria for
determining what constitutes a large notional security-based swap transaction (block trade) for

particular markets and contracts”; and (2) “specify the appropriate time delay for reporting large
notional security-based swap transactions (block trades) to the public.” Section 13m(1)(E)(iv) of
the Exchange Act 19 requires the Commission rule for real-time public dissemination of securitybased swaps that are not cleared at a registered clearing agency but reported to a registered SDR
to contain provisions that “take into account whether the public disclosure [of transaction and
pricing data for security-based swaps] will materially reduce market liquidity.”
As discussed in detail below, in response to the comments received and in light of the
fact that the Commission has not yet proposed block thresholds, the Commission is adopting
final rules that require all security-based swaps—regardless of their notional amount—to be
reported to a registered SDR at any point up to 24 hours after the time of execution. 20 The
registered SDR will be required, as with all other dissemination-eligible transactions, to publicly
disseminate a report of the transaction immediately and automatically upon receipt of the
information from the reporting side.
Although the Commission is adopting final rules relating to regulatory reporting and
public dissemination of security-based swaps, it intends for the rules relating to public
dissemination to apply only on an interim basis. This interim approach is designed to address the
concerns of commenters who believed that a public dissemination regime with inappropriately
small block trade thresholds could harm market liquidity, and who argued that market
participants would need an extended phase-in period to achieve real-time reporting. In
connection with its future rulemaking about block thresholds, the Commission anticipates
19

15 U.S.C. 13m(m)(1)(E)(iv).

20

As discussed in more detail in Section VII(B), infra, if reporting would take place on a
non-business day (i.e., a Saturday, Sunday or U.S. federal holiday), reporting would
instead be required by the same time on the next business day.

17

seeking public comment on issues related to block trades. Given the establishment of this
interim phase, the Commission is not adopting any other proposed rules relating to block trades.
E.

Cross-Border Issues

Regulation SBSR, as initially proposed, included Rule 908, which addressed when
Regulation SBSR would apply to cross-border security-based swaps and counterparties of
security-based swaps. The Commission re-proposed Rule 908 with substantial revisions as part
of the Cross-Border Proposing Release. The Commission is now adopting Rule 908
substantially as re-proposed with some modifications, as discussed in Section XV, infra. 21
Under Rule 908, as adopted, any security-based swap involving a U.S. person, whether as
a direct counterparty or as a guarantor, must be reported to a registered SDR, regardless of where
the transaction is executed. 22 Furthermore, any security-based swap involving a registered
security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant, whether as a
direct counterparty or as a guarantor, also must be reported to a registered SDR, regardless of
where the transaction is executed. In addition, any security-based swap that is accepted for
clearing by a registered clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United
States must be reported to a registered SDR, regardless of the registration status or U.S. person
status of the counterparties and regardless of where the transaction is executed.

21

The Commission anticipates seeking further public comment on the application of
Regulation SBSR to: (1) security-based swaps where there is no U.S. person, registered
security-based swap dealer, or registered major security-based swap participant on either
side; and (2) transactions where there is no registered security-based swap dealer or
registered major security-based swap participant on either side and there is a U.S. person
on only one side.

22

See also Section II(B)(3) and note 139, infra (describing the type of guarantees that could
cause a transaction to be subject to Regulation SBSR).

18

In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission proposed a new paragraph (c) to
Rule 908, which contemplated a regime for allowing “substituted compliance” for regulatory
reporting and public dissemination with respect to individual foreign jurisdictions. Under this
approach, compliance with the foreign jurisdiction’s rules could be substituted for compliance
with the Commission’s Title VII rules, in this case Regulation SBSR. Final Rule 908(c) allows
interested parties to request a substituted compliance determination with respect to a foreign
jurisdiction’s regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements, and sets forth the
standards that the Commission would use in determining whether the foreign requirements were
comparable.
F.

Compliance Dates

For Rules 900, 907, and 909 of Regulation SBSR, the compliance date is the effective
date of this release. For Rules 901, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, and 908 of Regulation SBSR, a new
compliance schedule is being proposed in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release.
Accordingly, compliance with Rules 901, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, and 908 is not required until
the Commission establishes compliance dates for those rules.
Rules 910 and 911, as proposed and re-proposed, would have established compliance
dates and imposed certain restrictions, respectively, during Regulation SBSR’s phase-in period.
For reasons discussed in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission
has determined not to adopt Rule 910 or 911. 23

23

Thus, Regulation SBSR, as adopted, consists of Rules 900 through 909 under the
Exchange Act. Conforming changes have been made throughout Regulation SBSR to
replace references to “§§ 242.900 through 242.911” to “§§ 242.900 through 242.909.” In
addition, the defined terms “registration date” and “phase-in period” which appeared in
re-proposed Rules 910 and 911, respectively, are not being defined in final Rule 900.

II.

Information Required To Be Reported
A.

Primary Trade Information—Rule 901(c)
1.

Description of Re-Proposed Rule

Rule 901(c), as re-proposed, would have required the reporting of the following primary
trade information in real time, which information would then be publicly disseminated: (1) the
asset class of the security-based swap and, if the security-based swap is an equity derivative,
whether it is a total return swap or is otherwise designed to offer risks and returns proportional to
a position in the equity security or securities on which the security-based swap is based; (2)
information that identifies the security-based swap instrument and the specific asset(s) or
issuer(s) of any security on which the security-based swap is based; (3) the notional amount(s),
and the currenc(ies) in which the notional amount(s) is (are) expressed; (4) the date and time, to
the second, of execution, expressed using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC); (5) the effective
date; (6) the scheduled termination date; (7) the price; (8) the terms of any fixed or floating rate
payments, and the frequency of any payments; (9) whether or not the security-based swap will be
cleared by a clearing agency; (10) if both counterparties to a security-based swap are registered
security-based swap dealers, an indication to that effect; (11) if applicable, an indication that the
transaction does not accurately reflect the market; and (12) if the security-based swap is
customized to the extent that the information in items (1) through (11) above does not provide all
of the material information necessary to identify such customized security-based swap or does
not contain the data elements necessary to calculate the price, an indication to that effect.
2.

Discussion of Final Rule 901(c) and Response to Comments
a.

General Approach to Required Information

20

Rules 901(c) and 901(d), as adopted, require the reporting of general categories of
information, without enumerating specific data elements that must be reported, except in limited
cases. The Commission has made minor revisions to the introductory language of Rule 901(c). 24
In addition, Rule 907(a)(1), as adopted, requires each registered SDR to establish,
maintain, and make publicly available policies and procedures that, among other things, specify
the data elements that must be reported. 25 Commenters expressed mixed views regarding this
approach. One commenter expressed the view that “any required data should be clearly
established by the Commission in its rules and not decided in part by [SDRs].” 26 This
commenter further asked the Commission to clarify that any additional fields provided by
registered SDRs for reporting would be optional. 27 Two commenters, however, supported the
Commission’s approach of providing registered SDRs with the authority to define relevant fields
on the basis of general guidelines as set by the SEC. 28 One of these commenters noted that it
would be difficult for the Commission to specify the security-based swap data fields because
24

The first sentence of re-proposed Rule 901(c), which would have required real-time
public dissemination of certain data elements, would have stated, in relevant part, “For
any security-based swap that must be publicly disseminated pursuant to §§ 242.902 and
242.908 and for which it is the reporting side, the reporting side shall report the following
information . . .” The information required to be reported pursuant to Rule 901(c) must
be reported for all covered transactions, even though Rule 902(c) provides that certain
security-based swap transactions are not subject to public dissemination. Accordingly,
the Commission is not including in final Rule 901(c) the phrase “For any security-based
swap that must be publicly disseminated pursuant to §§ 242.902 and 242.908 and for
which it is the reporting side . . .” In addition, as discussed in Section VII(B)(1), infra,
Rule 901(c), as adopted, provides that the reporting side shall report the information
specified in Rule 901(c) within the timeframe specified by Rule 901(j).

21

security-based swaps are complex products that may require a large number of data fields to be
electronically confirmed. 29 In addition, the commenter stated that electronic methods for
processing existing and new security-based swaps continue to be developed; accordingly, the
commenter stated that establishing a detailed list of reportable fields for each category of
security-based swap would be impracticable because such a system “will be outdated with every
new product launch or change in market practice,” and would result in a “regulatory scheme that
is continuously lagging behind the market.” 30 The commenter cautioned, however, that the
Commission must assure that there is consistency among the data fields collected and reported
by registered SDRs in the same asset class so that it would be possible to consolidate the data. 31
The Commission shares the commenter’s concerns about the potential difficulties of
consolidating data if there are multiple registered SDRs in the same asset class and each
establishes different data elements for information that must be reported. Enumerating specific
data elements required to be reported could help to promote consistency among the data fields if
there are multiple registered SDRs in the same asset class. In addition, as discussed more fully
below, such an approach would be more consistent with the approach taken by the CFTC’s swap
reporting rules. The Commission also acknowledges the comment that the Commission’s rules,
rather than the policies and procedures of a registered SDR, should specify the information
required to be reported. However, the Commission believes on balance that establishing broad
categories of required information will more easily accommodate new types of security-based
29

See MarkitSERV I at 9-10. The commenter stated, for example, that the confirmation for
a new “standard” credit default swap (“CDS”) would contain 35 to 50 data fields,
depending on the structure of the CDS, and the confirmation for other CDS products and
life cycle events combined would require a total of 160 data fields. See id. at note 37.

22

swaps and new conventions for capturing and reporting transaction data. The Commission
agrees with the commenter who expressed the view that a rule that attempted to enumerate the
required data elements for each category of security-based swap could become outdated with
each new product, resulting in a regulatory framework that constantly lagged the market and
would need to be updated. 32 The Commission believes that a standards-based approach will
more easily accommodate new security-based swap reporting protocols or languages, as well as
new market conventions, including new conventions for describing the data elements that must
be reported.
One group of commenters noted that the CFTC provided greater specificity regarding the
information to be reported. 33 Several commenters generally urged the Commission and the
CFTC to establish consistent reporting obligations to reduce the cost of implementing both
agencies’ reporting rules. 34
The Commission agrees that it would be beneficial to harmonize, to the extent
practicable, the information required to be reported under Regulation SBSR and under the

32

See id.

33

See ISDA/SIFMA I at 6.

34

See Better Markets I at 2; Cleary II at 3, 21 note 61 (noting that a consistent approach
between the two agencies would address the reporting of mixed swaps); ISDA/SIFMA I
at 6; J.P. Morgan Letter at 14; ISDA IV at 1-2 (generally urging that the Commission
align, wherever possible and practical, with the CFTC reporting rules). The last
commenter also noted that reporting of mixed swaps will be difficult if Regulation SBSR
requires a different reporting counterparty from the CFTC’s swap data reporting rules or
if transaction identifiers are not conformed to the CFTC approach, see ISDA IV at 4, 11,
and urged the Commission to coordinate with the CFTC on a uniform approach to the
time of execution for mixed swaps, see id. at 14. A mixed swap is a swap that is subject
to both the jurisdiction of the CFTC and SEC, and, absent a joint order of the CFTC and
SEC with respect to the mixed swap, as described in Rule 3a67-4(c) under the Exchange
Act, is subject to the applicable reporting and dissemination rules adopted by the CFTC
and SEC.

23

CFTC’s swap reporting rules. However, the Commission believes that it is possible to achieve a
significant degree of consistency without including in final Rule 901 a detailed list of required
data elements for each security-based swap. Rather than enumerating a comprehensive list of
required data elements in the rule itself, Rule 901 identifies broad categories of information in
the rule, and a registered SDR’s policies and procedures are required to identify specific data
elements that must be reported. The Commission believes that the flexibility afforded by Rule
901 will facilitate harmonization of reporting protocols and elements between the CFTC and
SEC reporting regimes. In identifying the specific data elements that must be reported, a
registered SDR could, in some instances, require reporting of the same data elements that are
required to be reported pursuant to the CFTC’s swap reporting rules, provided that those data
elements include the information required under Rules 901(c) and 901(d). In some cases,
however, the differences between the asset classes under the Commission’s jurisdiction and
those under the CFTC’s jurisdiction will require a registered SDR’s policies and procedures to
specify the reporting of data elements different from those required under the CFTC’s rules.
The Commission recognizes that enumerating the specific data elements required to be
reported would be more consistent with the approach taken by the CFTC’s swap reporting rules.
Nevertheless, the Commission believes that the flexibility afforded by the category-based
approach in adopted Rule 901(c) could facilitate harmonization. Accordingly, Rule 901(c), as
adopted, continues to require the reporting of broad categories of security-based swap
information to registered SDRs, without enumerating each data element required to be reported
(with a few exceptions, described below).
b.

Rule 901(c)(1)

24

Rule 901(c)(1), as re-proposed, would have required reporting of the asset class of a
security-based swap and, if the security-based swap is an equity derivative, whether it is a total
return swap or is otherwise designed to offer risks and returns proportional to a position in the
equity security or securities on which the security-based swap is based. As described in detail
below, the Commission is making several revisions to Rule 901(c)(1) in response to comments.
Among other things, these revisions clarify the final rules and eliminate certain unnecessary
elements and redundancies. Final Rule 901(c)(1), however, does not expand on the types of data
elements that must be reported.
i.

Elimination of the Reference to Equity Derivatives

The Commission is eliminating the reference to equity derivatives in final Rule 901(c)(1).
Under Regulation SBSR, as proposed and re-proposed, it would have been necessary to identify
total return swaps and other security-based swaps designed to offer risks and returns proportional
to a position in an equity security or securities, because those security-based swaps would not
have been eligible for a block trade exception. 35 However, because the Commission is not
adopting block thresholds or other rules relating to the block trade exception at this time, it is not
necessary to identify security-based swaps that are not eligible for a block trade exception during
the first, interim phase of Regulation SBSR. 36 Accordingly, the Commission is not including in
35

Rule 907(b)(2)(i), as proposed and re-proposed, would have prohibited a registered SDR
from designating as a block trade any security-based swap that is an equity total return
swap or is otherwise designed to offer risks and returns proportional to a position in the
equity security or securities on which the security-based swap is based. As noted in the
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, there is no delay in the reporting of block
transactions for equity securities in the United States. Re-proposed Rule 907(b)(2)(i) was
designed to discourage market participants from evading post-trade transparency in the
equity securities markets by using synthetic substitutes in the security-based swap
market. See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75232.

36

See infra Section VII.

25

final Rule 901(c)(1) any requirement to identify a security-based swap as a total return swap or a
security-based swap otherwise designed to offer risks and returns proportional to a position in the
equity security or securities on which the security-based swap is based.
ii.

Product ID

Final Rule 901(c)(1) requires the reporting of the product ID 37 of a security-based swap,
if one is available. If the security-based swap has no product ID, or if the product ID does not
include the information enumerated in Rule 901(c)(1)(i)-(v), then the information specified in
subparagraphs (i)-(v) of Rule 901(c)(1) (discussed below) must be reported. Rule 901(c)(1) is
designed to simplify the reporting process for security-based swaps that have a product ID by
utilizing the product ID in lieu of each of the categories of data enumerated in Rule 901(c)(1)(i)(v).
The Commission believes that the product ID will provide a standardized, abbreviated,
and accurate means for identifying security-based swaps that share certain material economic
terms. In addition, the reporting and public dissemination of the product ID could enhance
transparency because a transaction report that used a single identifier for the product traded could
be easier to read than a transaction report that identified the product traded through information
provided in numerous individual data fields. For example, market observers would be able to
discern quickly that transaction reports including the same product ID related to trades of the
same product. Product IDs also could facilitate risk management and assist relevant authorities
in analyzing systemic risk and conducting market surveillance. Furthermore, the Commission
believes that the development of security-based swaps with standardized terms could facilitate
the development of product IDs that would readily identify the terms of these transactions.
37

See Rule 900(bb) (defining “product ID” as “the UIC assigned to a product”).

26

Re-proposed Rule 901(c)(2) would have required reporting of information that identifies
the security-based swap instrument and the specific asset(s) or issuer(s) of any security on which
the security-based swap is based. Proposed Rule 900 defined “security-based swap instrument”
to mean “each security-based swap in the same asset class, with the same underlying reference
asset, reference issuer, or reference index.” 38 In the context of final Rule 901(c), the requirement
to report the product ID, if one is available, replaces, among other things, the requirement in reproposed Rule 901(c)(2) to report information that identifies the security-based swap instrument
and the specific asset(s) or issuer(s) of any security on which the security-based swap is based.
For a security-based swap that has no product ID, Rule 901(c)(1)(i), as adopted, requires
reporting of information that identifies the security-based swap, including the asset class of the
security-based swap and the specific underlying reference asset(s), reference issuer(s), or
reference index. Because the information that was included in the definition of security-based
swap instrument—i.e., the asset class and the underlying reference asset, issuer, or index—will
be reported pursuant to adopted Rule 901(c)(1)(i) or included in the product ID, it is no longer
necessary to separately define “security-based swap instrument.” Thus, final Rule 900 no longer
contains a definition of security-based swap instrument.
Although Rule 900, as proposed, defined the term “product ID,” it did not separately
propose to define the term “product.” 39 Moreover, the original definition of the term “unique
38

This definition was re-proposed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release without change
as Rule 900(dd).

39

Rule 900, as proposed, defined “product ID” to mean “the UIC assigned to a securitybased swap instrument.” As discussed above, Rule 900, as proposed, defined “securitybased swap instrument” to mean “each security-based swap in the same asset class, with
the same underlying reference asset, reference issuer, or reference index.” Both of these
definitions were re-proposed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release without change as
Rules 900(x) and 900(dd), respectively.

27

identification code” included the term “product,” again without defining it. 40 The Commission is
now adopting a specific definition of the term “product.” Final Rule 900(aa) defines “product”
as “a group of security-based swap contracts each having the same material economic terms
except those relating to price and size.” Accordingly, the definition of “product ID” in adopted
Rule 900(bb) is revised to mean “the UIC assigned to a product.”
The key aspect of the term “product” is the classifying together of a group of securitybased swap contracts that have the same material economic terms, other than those relating to
price and size. The assignment of product IDs to groups of security-based swaps with the same
material economic terms, other than those relating to price and size, is designed to facilitate more
efficient and accurate transaction reporting by allowing reporting of a single product ID in place
of the separate data categories contemplated by Rule 901(c)(1)(i)-(v). Product IDs also will
make disseminated transaction reports easier to read, and will assist the Commission and other
relevant authorities in monitoring for systemic risk and conducting market surveillance.
Although the price and size of a security-based swap are material terms of the
transaction—and thus must be reported, along with many other material terms, to a registered
SDR pursuant to Rules 901(c) and 901(d)—they do not help distinguish one product from
another. The same product can be traded with different prices and with different notional
amounts. Thus, by way of example and not of limitation, if otherwise materially similar
security-based swaps have different currencies of denomination, underlying assets, or settlement
terms, they are different products for purposes of Regulation SBSR and should have different
product IDs. An indicium of whether two or more security-based swaps between the same direct

Rule 900, as proposed, defined UIC as “the unique identification code assigned to a
person, unit of a person, or product . . .” (emphasis added). This definition was reproposed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release without change as Rule 900(nn).

28

counterparties are the same product is whether they could be compressed or netted together to
establish a new position (e.g., by a clearing agency or portfolio compression service). 41 If they
cannot be compressed or netted, this suggests that there are material differences between the
terms of the security-based swaps that do not permit the risks to be fully offset.
The fact that the Commission is requiring products to be distinguished for purposes of
regulatory reporting and public dissemination even if a single material economic term
differentiates one from another would not prevent the Commission and market participants from
analyzing closely related products on a more aggregate basis. For example, products that were
otherwise identical but for different currencies of denomination could still be grouped together to
understand the gross amount of exposure created by these related products (factoring in
exchange rates). However, a product ID system that was not granular enough to separate
products based on individual material differences would make it difficult or impossible to
analyze positions based solely on those individual differences. For example, if a product ID
system permitted otherwise similar security-based swaps with different currencies of
denomination to be considered as the same product, it would not be possible to observe risk
aggregations according to their particular currencies. 42
Similarly, the Commission believes that otherwise materially identical security-based
swaps with different dates of expiration are different products and therefore must have different
product IDs. Delineating products by, among other things, date of expiration will assist the
Commission and other relevant authorities in developing a more precise analysis of risk exposure

See TriOptima Letter at 2, 5-6 (explaining the portfolio compression process for
uncleared swaps).

See ISDA/SIFMA at 10 (recommending that the definition of “security-based swap
instrument” provide for more granular distinctions between different types of transactions
within a single asset class).

29

over time. This feature of the “product” definition is different from the approach taken in the
originally proposed definition of “security-based swap instrument,” which specifically rejected
distinctions based on tenor. 43
In connection with these requirements, the Commission notes the part of the “product”
definition referring to a product as “a group of security-based swap contracts” (plural). If a
group of security-based swap contracts is sufficiently standardized such that they all share the
same material economic terms (other than price and size), a registered SDR should treat them as
the same product and assign them the same product ID. A product could be evidenced, for
example, by the fact that a clearing agency makes the group of security-based swap contracts
eligible for clearing and will net multiple transactions in that group of contracts into a single
open position. In contrast, a security-based swap that has a combination of material economic
terms unlike any other security-based swap would not be part of a product group, and the
Commission believes that it would be impractical to require registered SDRs to assign a product
ID to each of these unique security-based swaps. For such a security-based swap, the transaction
ID would be sufficient to identify the security-based swap in the registered SDR’s records and
would serve the same purpose as a product ID.
The product ID is one type of UIC. As discussed more fully in Section X, infra, Rule
903(a), as adopted, requires a registered SDR to use a UIC, including a product ID, assigned by
an IRSS, if an IRSS has been recognized by the Commission and issues that type of UIC. If an
IRSS that can issue product IDs has not been recognized by the Commission, Rule 903(a)
43

The Commission is not expressing a view as to whether products with different tenors
might or might not be considered together to constitute a class of securities required to be
registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. See Section 12(a) of the Exchange Act,
15 U.S.C. 78l(a); Section 12(g)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78l(g); Rule 12g-1
under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.12g-1.

30

requires a registered SDR to assign a product ID to that product using its own methodology.
Similarly, final Rule 907(a)(5) requires a registered SDR to establish and maintain written
policies and procedures for assigning UICs in a manner consistent with Rule 903, which
establishes standards for the use of UICs. 44
One commenter noted that, although there likely will be global standards for
identification codes for certain data fields, such as the LEI, some global identifiers will not
exist.45 The commenter believed that requiring registered SDRs to create identifiers would
“result in bespoke implementation among” registered SDRs that would be of limited value
absent an industry standard. 46 The commenter recommended that the Commission consider
postponing a requirement to establish identifiers “until an international taxonomy exists that can
be applied consistently.” 47
The Commission agrees that a system of internationally recognized product IDs would be
preferable to a process under which registered SDRs assign their own product IDs to the same
product. Nonetheless, the Commission believes that the use of product IDs, even product IDs
created by registered SDRs rather than by an IRSS, could simplify security-based swap
transaction reporting and facilitate regulatory oversight of the security-based swap market. In
addition, the Commission believes that the requirement for registered SDRs to assign product

IDs could provide additional incentive for security-based swap market participants to develop
industry-wide product IDs. 48
One commenter stated that “[i]ndustry utilities should be considered for assigning unique
IDs for transactions, products, and legal entities/market participants.” 49 As discussed in Section
X(B)(2), infra, the Commission is recognizing the Global LEI System (“GLEIS”), an industry
utility administered by the Regulatory Oversight Committee (“ROC”), as meeting the criteria
specified in Rule 903, as adopted. The GLEIS and this comment are discussed in Section
X(B)(2), infra.
iii.

Rule 901(c)(1)(i)

Rule 901(c)(1) requires that, if a security-based swap has no product ID, or if the product
ID does not include the information identified in Rule 901(c)(1)(i)-(v), the information specified
in Rule 901(c)(1)(i)-(v) must be reported. Final Rule 901(c)(1)(i)-(v) incorporates, with some

In this regard, the Commission notes that one commenter stated that a “newly formed
ISDA cross-product data working group, with representatives from sell side and buy side
institutions, will look at proposed solutions and the practical implications of unique
identifiers for the derivatives industry.” The commenters stated, further, that “ISDA is
committed to provide product identifiers for OTC derivatives products that reflect the
FpML standard….In the first instance, this work will focus on product identifiers for
cleared products. ISDA/FpML is currently working on a pilot project with certain
derivative clearing houses to provide a normalized electronic data representation through
a FpML document for each OTC product listed and/or cleared. This work will include
the assignment of unique product identifiers.” ISDA/SIFMA I at 8-9. In addition, the
Commission notes that ISDA has issued a white paper that discusses ways of creating
unique identifiers for individual products. See ISDA, “Product Representation for
Standardized Derivatives” (April 14, 2011), available at http://www2.isda.org/functionalareas/technology-infrastructure/data-and-reporting/identifiers/upi-and-taxonomies/ (last
visited September 22, 2014) , at 4 (stating that one goal of the white paper is to
“[s]implif[y] . . . the trade processing and reporting architecture across the marketplace
for the standardized products, as market participants will be able to abstract the trade
economics through reference data instead of having to specify them as part of each
transaction”).

modifications, information that would have been required under paragraphs (c)(1), (2), (5), (6),
(8), and (12) of re-proposed Rule 901, and re-proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(iii).
Rule 901(c)(1)(i), as adopted, generally requires the reporting of information that would
have been required to be reported under re-proposed Rules 901(c)(1) and 901(c)(2). Reproposed Rule 901(c)(1) would have required, in part, reporting of the asset class of a securitybased swap. 50 Re-proposed Rule 901(c)(2) would have required the reporting of information
identifying the security-based swap instrument and the specific asset(s) or issuer(s) on which the
security-based swap is based. Re-proposed Rule 900(dd) would have defined “security-based
swap instrument” as “each security-based swap in the same asset class, with the same underlying
reference asset, reference issuer, or reference index.” Rule 901(c)(1)(i), as adopted, requires the
reporting of information that identifies the security-based swap, including the asset class of the
security-based swap and the specific underlying reference asset(s), reference issuer(s), or
reference index. Although the defined term “security-based swap instrument” is being deleted
from Regulation SBSR for the reasons discussed in Section VII(B)(3), infra, final Rule
901(c)(1)(i) retains the requirement to report the underlying reference asset(s), reference
issuer(s), or reference index for the security-based swap, as well as the asset class of the securitybased swap.

50

“Asset class” is defined as “those security-based swaps in a particular broad category,
including, but not limited to, credit derivatives and equity derivatives.” See Rule 900(b),
as adopted. As proposed and re-proposed, the definition of “asset class” also would have
included loan-based derivatives. However, because loan-based derivatives can be viewed
as a form of credit derivative, the Commission has removed the reference to loan-based
derivatives as a separate asset class and adopted the definition noted above. This revision
aligns the definition of “asset class” used in Regulation SBSR with the definition used in
the SDR Adopting Release.

33

The Commission received no comments regarding the information required to be
reported in Rule 901(c)(1)(i). As stated in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the
Commission believes that the reporting and public dissemination of information relating to the
asset class of the security-based swap would provide market participants with basic information
about the type of security-based swap (e.g., credit derivative or equity derivative) being traded. 51
Similarly, the Commission believes that information identifying the specific reference asset(s),
reference issuer(s), or reference index of any security on which the security-based swap is based
is fundamental to understanding the transaction being reported, and that a transaction report that
lacked such information would not be meaningful. 52 Accordingly, Rule 901(c)(1)(i), as adopted,
includes the requirement to report this information.
iv.

Rules 901(c)(1)(ii) and (iii)

Re-proposed Rules 901(c)(5) and 901(c)(6) would have required the reporting of,
respectively, the effective date of the security-based swap and the scheduled termination date of
the security-based swap. These requirements are incorporated into adopted Rules 901(c)(1)(ii)
and (iii), which require the reporting of, respectively, the effective date of the security-based
swap and the scheduled termination date of the security-based swap. The Commission received
no comments regarding the reporting of this information. As stated in the Regulation SBSR
Proposing Release, the Commission believes that information specifying the effective date and
the scheduled termination date of the security-based swap is fundamental to understanding the
transaction being reported, and that a transaction report that lacked such information would not

51

52

See id. at 75214.

34

be meaningful. 53 Accordingly, final Rules 901(c)(1)(ii) and (iii) include the requirement to
report the effective date and the scheduled termination date, respectively, of the security-based
swap.
v.

Rule 901(c)(1)(iv)

Re-proposed Rule 901(c)(8) would have required the reporting of any fixed or floating
rate payments of a security-based swap, and the frequency of any payments. Re-proposed Rule
901(d)(1)(iii) would have required the reporting of the amount(s) and currenc(ies) of any upfront payment(s) and a description of the terms and contingencies of the payment streams of each
direct counterparty to the other. In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission
noted that the terms of any fixed or floating rate payments and the frequency of any payments
are among the terms that would be fundamental to understanding a security-based swap
transaction. 54 One commenter echoed the importance of information concerning the payment
streams of security-based swaps. 55
Another commenter stated that proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(iii) was unclear about the
proposed form of the description of the terms and contingencies of the payment streams, and that
the requirements of proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(iii) appeared to be duplicative of proposed Rule
901(d)(1)(v), which would have required reporting of the data elements necessary for a person to

See Benchmark Letter at 1 (stating that “[t]he reference data set [for a security-based
swap] must include standard attributes necessary to derive cash flows and any contingent
claims that can alter or terminate payments of these contracts. . . . Without these critical
pieces of information, users of the trade price dissemination service will be unable to
accurately assess reported values”).

35

determine the market value of the transaction. 56 The commenter also suggested that the
Commission consider the utility of requiring reporting of the terms of fixed or floating rate
payments, as required by re-proposed Rule 901(c)(8). 57
The Commission continues to believe that, for a security-based swap that provides for
periodic exchange of cash flows, information concerning those payment streams is fundamental
to understanding the terms of the transaction. The Commission acknowledges, however, that reproposed Rules 901(c)(8), 901(d)(1)(iii), and 901(d)(v) contained overlapping requirements
concerning the payment streams of a security-based swap. Accordingly, the Commission is
revising Rules 901(c) and 901(d) to streamline and clarify the information required to be
reported with respect to the payment streams of a security-based swap.
Specifically, final Rule 901(c)(1)(iv) requires the reporting of any standardized fixed or
floating rate payments, and the frequency of any such payments. As discussed more fully in
Section II(C)(3)(d), infra, final Rule 901(d)(3) requires the reporting of information concerning
the terms of any fixed or floating rate payments, or otherwise customized or non-standardized
payment streams, including the frequency and contingencies of any such payments, to the extent
that this information has not been reported pursuant to Rule 901(c)(1). Thus, Rule 901(c)(1)(iv)
requires the reporting of information concerning standardized payment streams, while Rule
901(d)(3) requires the reporting of information concerning customized payment streams. In
addition, as discussed more fully below, final Rule 901(d)(5) requires reporting of any additional
data elements included in the agreement between the counterparties that are necessary for a
56

See DTCC II at 10. See also DTCC V at 12 (requesting additional clarity with respect to
the requirement to report the contingencies of the payments streams of each direct
counterparty to the other).

36

person to determine the market value of the transaction, to the extent that such information has
not already been reported pursuant to Rule 901(c) or other provisions of Rule 901(d). The
Commission believes that these changes to Rules 901(c) and 901(d) will avoid potential
redundancies in the reporting requirements and will clarify the information required to be
reported with respect to the payment streams of a security-based swap.
Like other primary trade information reported pursuant to Rule 901(c), information about
standardized payment streams reported pursuant to Rule 901(c)(1)(iv) will be publicly
disseminated. The Commission envisions that, rather than disseminating such information as
discrete elements, this information could be inherent in the product ID of a security-based swap
that has a product ID. Information concerning non-standard payment streams that is reported
pursuant to Rule 901(d)(3), like other secondary trade information, will be available for
regulatory purposes but will not be publicly disseminated. Re-proposed Rule 901(c)(8) would
have required reporting of the terms of any fixed or floating rate payments, standardized or nonstandardized, and the frequency of such payments, and re-proposed Rule 902(a) would have
required the public dissemination of that information. In addition, as noted above, one
commenter discussed the importance of the availability of information concerning payment
streams. 58 Nonetheless, the Commission believes that public dissemination of the non-standard
payment terms of a customized security-based swap would be impractical, because a bespoke
transaction by definition could have such unique terms that it would be difficult to reflect the full
material terms using any standard dissemination protocol. In addition, it is not clear that the
benefits of publicly disseminating information concerning these non-standard payment streams
would justify the costs of disseminating the information. However, the Commission will have
58

See supra note 55.

37

access to regulatory reports of such transactions, which should facilitate regulatory oversight and
assist relevant authorities in monitoring the exposures of security-based swap market
participants. Accordingly, Rule 901(d)(3), as adopted, requires the reporting of information
concerning the terms of any non-standard fixed or floating rate payments, or otherwise
customized or non-standardized payment streams, including the frequency and contingencies of
any such payments.
One commenter expressed the view that, without further clarification, market participants
could adopt different interpretations of the requirement in re-proposed Rule 901(c)(8) to report
the terms of fixed or floating rate payments, resulting in inconsistent reporting to registered
SDRs; the commenter recommended, therefore, limiting the reportable fields to tenor and
frequency, where applicable. 59
The Commission shares the commenter’s concerns that, without guidance, market
participants could adopt different interpretations of the requirement to report the terms of fixed
or floating rate payments. The Commission notes, however, that final Rules 907(a)(1) and
907(a)(2) require a registered SDR to establish and maintain written policies and procedures that
enumerate the specific data elements that must be reported and that specify the protocols for
submitting information, respectively. The Commission believes that, read together, Rules
907(a)(1) and 907(a)(2) provide registered SDRs with flexibility to determine the appropriate
conventions for reporting these data elements, including the terms of a security-based swap’s
fixed or floating rate payments. Thus, although Rule 901(c) itself does not specify the precise
manner for reporting a security-based swap’s fixed or floating rate payments, the policies and
procedures of registered SDRs must do so. The Commission notes, further, that final Rule
59

See DTCC V at 11.

38

906(c), among other things, requires SDR participants that are registered security-based swap
dealers and registered major security-based swap participants to establish, maintain, and enforce
written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that they comply with any
obligations to report information to a registered SDR in a manner consistent with Regulation
SBSR.
vi.

Rule 901(c)(1)(v)

Re-proposed Rule 901(c)(12) would have required a reporting side to indicate, if
applicable, that the information reported under subparagraphs (1)-(11) of re-proposed Rule
901(c) for a customized security-based swap does not provide all of the material information
necessary to identify the customized security-based swap or does not contain the data elements
necessary to calculate its price. The Commission is adopting the substance of re-proposed Rule
901(c)(12) and locating it in final Rule 901(c)(1)(v). Rule 901(c)(1)(v), as adopted, provides
that, if a security-based swap is customized to the extent that the information provided in
paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of Rule 901 does not provide all of the material information
necessary to identify such customized security-based swap or does not contain the data elements
necessary to calculate the price, the reporting side must include a flag to that effect. As
discussed more fully in Section VI(G), infra, the registered SDRs should develop a condition flag
to identify bespoke transactions because absent such a flag, users of public reports of bespoke
transactions might receive a distorted impression of the market.
One commenter argued that “publicly disseminated data for trades with a non-standard
feature flag activated will be of limited usefulness and could be misleading.” 60 The commenter
expressed the view that dissemination of information regarding highly structured transactions
60

DTCC II at 9.

39

should not occur until an analysis regarding the impact and potential for misleading the investing
public has been conducted. 61 A second commenter, however, endorsed the approach being
adopted by the Commission. 62 The Commission acknowledges the concerns that the
dissemination of transaction reports for highly customized trades could be misleading or of
limited usefulness. However, as discussed more fully in Section VI(D)(2)(a), infra, the
Commission believes that public dissemination of the key terms of a customized security-based
swap, even without all of the details of the transaction, could provide useful information to
market observers, including information concerning the pricing of similar products and
information relating to the relative number and aggregate notional amounts of transactions in
bespoke products versus standardized products. In addition, the Commission believes that the
condition flag signaling that the transaction is a customized trade, and therefore that the reported
information does not provide all of the details of the transaction, will minimize the potential for
confusion and help to assure that the publicly disseminated reports of these transactions are not
misleading. For these reasons, the Commission is declining, at this time, to undertake the study
recommended by the commenter.
A third commenter indicated that Rule 901 should go further and require reporting of
additional information necessary to calculate the price of a security-based swap that is so
customized that the price cannot be calculated from the reported information. 63 The Commission
generally agrees that transaction reports of customized security-based swaps should be as
informative and useful as possible. However, it is not clear that the benefits of publicly
61

See id.

62

See Cleary II at 16 (recommending “public reporting of a few key terms of a customized
swap . . . [with] some indication that the transaction is customized”).

63

See Better Markets I at 7.

40

disseminating all of the detailed and potentially complex information that would be necessary to
calculate the price of a highly customized security-based swap would justify the costs of
disseminating that information. Accordingly, Rule 901(c)(1)(v), as adopted, does not require
reporting of this information, and it will not be publicly disseminated. 64
This commenter also expressed concern that a “composite” security-based swap
composed of two swaps grafted together could be used to avoid reporting requirements; the
commenter recommended that, if at least one of the transactions could be disaggregated and
reported in a format so that its price could be calculated, Regulation SBSR should require that
the security-based swap be disaggregated and the component parts be reported separately. 65 In
considering the commenter’s concern the Commission notes the following:
To begin, the Commission understands that market participants may execute so-called
“package trades” that are composed of multiple components, or “legs,” some of which may be
64

The Commission notes that Rule 901(d)(5) requires the reporting of any additional data
elements included in the agreement between the counterparties that is necessary to
determine the market value of a transaction. Although this information will not be
publicly disseminated, it will be available to the Commission and other relevant
authorities. Such relevant authorities are enumerated in Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(G), which requires an SDR, upon request, to make
available all data obtained by the SDR, including individual counterparty trade and
position data, to each appropriate prudential regulator, the Financial Stability Oversight
Council, the CFTC, the Department of Justice, and any other person that the Commission
determines to be appropriate, including foreign financial supervisors, foreign central
banks, and foreign ministries.

65

See Better Markets I at 7 (“This enhancement to the Proposed Rules is particularly
important with respect to SBS comprised of two swaps grafted together. Such composite
SBS can be used to avoid reporting requirements. Even worse they can be used to
obfuscate the real financial implications of a transaction. Accordingly, if an SBS can be
disaggregated into two or more transactions, and at least one of those disaggregated
transactions can be reported in a format so that price can be calculated, then the rules
should require that the SBS be disaggregated and reported in that form”); Better Markets
II at 3 (stating that complex transactions must be broken down into meaningful
components); Better Markets III at 4-5 (stating that the Commission should require
reporting of data on disaggregated customized security-based swaps).

41

security-based swaps. Though such package trades are executed at a single price, each leg is
separately booked and processed. In these cases, Regulation SBSR does in fact require a
reporting side to separately report (and for the SDR to separately disseminate) each securitybased swap component of the package trade. 66
However, if a market participant combines the economic elements of multiple
instruments into one security-based swap contract, Regulation SBSR requires a single report of
the transaction. The Commission understands the commenter’s concerns regarding potential
attempts to evade the post-trade transparency requirements. Such efforts could undermine
Regulation SBSR’s goals of promoting transparency and efficiency in the security-based swap
markets and impede the Commission’s ability to oversee those markets. The Commission does
not believe, however, that either a registered SDR or a reporting side should be required to
disaggregate a customized security-based swap if it consists of a single contract incorporating
elements of what otherwise might have been two or more security-based swaps. In the absence
of evidence of a significant amount of such “composite” security-based swap transactions and
structuring other than through package trades, the Commission does not at this time believe that
devising protocols for disseminating them in a disaggregated fashion would be practical.
Importantly, however, and as discussed more fully in Section VI(D)(2)(a), infra, the primary
trade information of any complex or bespoke security-based swap, including “composite”
security-based swaps as described by the commenter, will be publicly disseminated, as required
66

In addition, as discussed more fully in Section VI(G), infra, in developing its policies and
procedures, a registered SDR should consider requiring participants to identify the
individual component security-based swaps of such a trade as part of a package
transaction, and should consider disseminating reports of the individual security-based
swap components of the package trade with a condition flag that identifies them as part of
a package trade. Absent such a flag, observers of public reports of package transactions
might obtain a distorted view of the market.

42

by Rule 902(a), including the specific underlying reference asset(s), reference issuer(s), or
reference index for the transaction, as required by Rule 901(c)(1). 67 The Commission believes
that the public dissemination of the primary trade information, even without all of the material
economic terms of the transaction that could affect its pricing, could provide market observers
with useful information, including information concerning the pricing of similar products and the
relative number and aggregate notional amounts of transactions in complex and other bespoke
transactions versus transactions in standardized products. The Commission further notes that
since all of the material economic terms of a “composite” security-based swap must be reported
to a registered SDR, including the data elements required by Rule 901(d), 68 the Commission
itself will have complete access to these details. 69

67

One commenter stated its view that “proprietary baskets” should qualify as nondisseminated information, and requested that Regulation SBSR specifically recognize this
as an example of non-disseminated information. See ISDA IV at 17 (stating that
reportable security-based swaps may include customized narrow-based baskets that a
counterparty deems proprietary to its business and for which public disclosure would
compromise its anonymity and negatively impact its trading activity). Rule 902(a), as
adopted, requires a registered SDR to publicly disseminate, for each transaction, the
primary trade information required to be reported by Rule 901(c), as adopted, which
includes the specific underlying reference asset(s), reference issuer(s), or reference index.
The Commission continues to believe that the primary trading terms of a security-based
swap should be disseminated to help facilitate price discovery. See infra Section VI(A).

68

See infra Section II(B)(3)(e) (discussing requirement in Rule 901(d)(5) that, to the extent
not provided pursuant to other provisions of Rules 901(c) and 901(d), all data elements
included in the agreement between the counterparties that are necessary for a person to
determine the market value of the transaction must be reported).

69

See infra Section V(B)(1) (noting that the Commission anticipates proposing for public
comment detailed specifications of acceptable formats and taxonomies that would
facilitate an accurate interpretation, aggregation, and analysis by the Commission of
security-based swap data submitted to it by an SDR); supra Section II(A)(2)(b)(v)
(explaining that the Commission will have access to regulatory reports of bespoke
security-based swap transactions, which should facilitate regulatory oversight and assist
relevant authorities in monitoring the exposures of security-based swap market
participants).

43

The commenter also expressed the view that Regulation SBSR should clearly define the
meaning of a security-based swap that is so customized that its price is not ascertainable. 70 The
Commission does not believe that it is necessary to further define the term “customized securitybased swap” for purposes of Rule 901(c)(1)(v). The condition flag required under adopted Rule
901(c)(1)(v) will notify market participants that the security-based swap being reported does not
have a product ID and is customized to the extent that the information provided in Rules
901(c)(1)(i)-(iv) does not provide all of the material information necessary to identify the
security-based swap or does not contain the data elements necessary to calculate the price. Thus,
market participants will know that a customized security-based swap transaction was executed,
and that the information reported pursuant to Rules 901(c)(1)(i)-(iv) provides basic but limited
information about the transaction. The Commission believes, further, that Rule 901(c)(1)(v)
provides clear guidance with respect to when a transaction is customized to the extent that the
reporting side must attach a condition flag that identifies the transaction as a bespoke transaction,
i.e., when the information reported pursuant to Rules 901(c)(1)(i)-(iv) does not provide all of the
material information necessary to identify the security-based swap or does not contain the data
elements necessary to calculate the price. Accordingly, the Commission does not believe that it
is necessary, at this time, to further define what constitutes a customized security-based swap for
purposes of Regulation SBSR.
c.

70

Rule 901(c)(2)

See Better Markets I at 7 (“The Proposed Rules also represent a critically important
opportunity to shed light on the nature of ‘customized’ swaps. Since the inception of the
debate over disclosure and clearing in connection with financial regulation, the concept
of the ‘customized’ or ‘bespoke’ transactions has figured prominently, yet these terms
remain poorly understood in real world terms. The Proposed Rules should clearly define
the meaning of SBS that are so customized that price is not ascertainable”).

44

Re-proposed Rule 901(c)(4) would have required reporting of the date and time, to the
second, of the execution of a security-based swap, expressed using Coordinated Universal Time
(“UTC”). 71 In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated that information
concerning the time of execution would allow security-based swap transactions to be ordered
properly, and would provide the Commission with a detailed record of when a security-based
swap was executed. 72 The Commission further noted that, without the time of execution, market
participants and relevant authorities would not know whether the transaction reports that they are
seeing reflect the current state of the market. 73 In both the proposal and the re-proposal, the
Commission defined “time of execution” to mean “the point at which the counterparties to a
security-based swap become irrevocably bound under applicable law.” 74
One commenter expressed the view that time of execution should be reported at least to
the second, and by finer increments where practicable. 75 A second commenter raised timestamp
issues in connection with proposed Rule 901(f), which would have required a registered SDR to
timestamp transaction information submitted to it under Rule 901. The commenter stated that
especially for markets for which there are multiple security-based swap execution facilities and
markets where automated, algorithmic trading occurs, “the sequencing of trade data for
transparency and price discovery, as well as surveillance and enforcement purposes, will require

much smaller increments of time-stamping.” 76 The commenter urged the Commission to revise
proposed Rule 901(f) to require a registered SDR to time stamp information that it receives in
increments shorter than one second, stating that time stamps shorter than one second are
technologically feasible, affordable, and in use. 77
The Commission understands that trading in the security-based swap market does not yet
occur as fast or as frequently as in the equities market, which makes recording the time of
security-based swap executions in subsecond increments less necessary for surveillance
purposes. While some market participants may have the capacity to record trades in subsecond
intervals, others may not. Given the potential costs of requiring all market participants to utilize
subsecond timestamps, the Commission believes that it is not necessary or appropriate at this
time to require reporting of the time of execution in subsecond increments. 78 Accordingly, the
Commission is adopting Rule 901(c)(4) as proposed and re-proposed, but renumbering it as final
Rule 901(c)(2). The Commission will continue to monitor developments in the security-based
swap market and could in the future reconsider whether reporting time of execution in
subseconds would be appropriate.
One commenter discussed the time of execution for a voice trade in the context of
proposed Rule 910(a), which addressed the reporting of pre-enactment security-based swaps. 79
The commenter noted that in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated
that “proposed Rule 910(a) would not require reporting parties to report any data elements (such

76

77

However, a registered SDR could, in its policies and procedures, allow its participants to
report using subsecond timestamps.

As discussed in Section I(F), supra, the Commission is not adopting Rule 910.

46

as the time of execution) that were not readily available. Therefore, proposed Rule 910(a) would
not require reporting parties to search for or reconstruct any missing data elements.” 80 The
commenter disagreed with this assertion in the context of voice trades, stating that the time of
entry of the voice trade into the system is typically provided, but not the actual execution time of
the trade. The commenter stated that “[p]roviding the actual execution time in the case of voice
trades would then prove extremely challenging and invasive for the marketplace.” 81 Similarly,
one commenter requested that the “Commission clarify that participants are not required to
provide trade execution time information for pre-enactment security-based swap transactions and
that going-forward, such information need only be provided when industry-wide time stamping
practices are implemented.” 82
With respect to these concerns, the Commission notes, first, that it is not adopting Rule
910, but is proposing a new compliance schedule for Rules 901, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, and
908 of Regulation SBSR in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release. The
Commission emphasizes, however, that proposed Rule 910(a) would not have required market
participants to report information for a pre-enactment security-based swap that was not readily
available, or to reconstruct that information. Thus, Rule 910(a), as proposed, would not have
required market participants to provide the time of execution for an orally negotiated preenactment security-based swap, unless such information was readily available. Likewise, final
Rule 901(i) does not require reporting of the date and time of execution for an orally negotiated

pre-enactment or transitional security-based swap, unless such information is readily available. 83
However, for all other security-based swaps, including voice trades, final Rule 901(c)(2) requires
reporting of the date and time of execution, to the second, of the security-based swap. The
Commission noted in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release that trades agreed to over the
phone would need to be systematized by being entered in an electronic system that assigns a time
stamp to report the date and time of execution of a security-based swap. 84 The Commission
continues to believe that it is consistent with Congress’ intent for orally negotiated securitybased swap transactions to be systematized as quickly as possible. 85 The Commission notes,
further, that market participants also must report the time of execution for voice-executed trades
in other securities markets (e.g., equities and corporate bonds). 86 Knowing the date and time of
execution of a security-based swap is important for reconstructing trading activity and for market
surveillance purposes. Accordingly, the Commission continues to believe that the regulatory
interest in having information regarding the date and time of execution for all security-based
swaps, including orally negotiated security-based swaps, justifies the burden on market
participants of recording and reporting this information.
In addition, the Commission is adopting, as proposed and re-proposed, the requirement
for all times of execution reported to and recorded by registered SDRs to be in UTC. In the

83

For pre-enactment and transitional security-based swaps, final Rule 901(i) requires
reporting of the information required under Rules 901(c) and 901(d), including the date
and time of execution, only to the extent that such information is available.

84

86

See, e.g., FINRA Rule 6230(c)(8) (requiring transactions reported to TRACE to include
the time of execution); FINRA Rule 6622(c)(5) (requiring last-sale reports for
transactions in OTC Equity Securities and Restricted Securities to include the time of
execution expressed in hours, minutes, and seconds).

48

Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission explained its reasons for proposing to
require that the date and time of execution be expressed in UTC. 87 The Commission noted that
security-based swaps are traded globally, and expected that many security-based swaps subject
to the Commission’s reporting and dissemination rules would be executed between
counterparties in different time zones. In the absence of a uniform time standard, it might not be
clear whether the date and time of execution were being expressed from the standpoint of the
time zone of the first counterparty, the second counterparty, or the registered SDR. Mandating a
common standard for expressing date and time would alleviate any potential confusion as to
when the security-based swap was executed. The Commission believed that UTC was an
appropriate and well known standard suitable for purposes of reporting the time of execution of
security-based swaps. The Commission received no comments regarding the use of UTC for
reporting the time of execution. For the reasons set out in the Regulation SBSR Proposing
Release, the Commission continues to believe that UTC is appropriate for security-based swap
transaction reporting. Accordingly, the Commission is adopting this requirement as proposed
and re-proposed.
Finally, the Commission is adopting the definition of “time of execution” as proposed
and re-proposed, and renumbering it as final Rule 900(ii). One commenter stated that the time at
which a transaction becomes legally binding may not be the same for all products. 88 The
commenter further noted that, in some cases primary terms are not formed until the securitybased swap is confirmed, and that the full terms of a total return swap might not be formed until
the end of the day “and therefore the [total return swap] is not executed and confirmed until the
87

See 75 FR at 75213.

88

See ISDA/SIFMA I at 7.

49

end of the day.” 89 A second commenter stated that “the obligation to report should not be
triggered until price, size, and other transaction terms required to be reported are available.” 90
The Commission understands the concerns of these commenters and believes that the definition
of “time of execution” provides sufficient flexibility to address these commenters’ concerns. For
example, if the key terms of a security-based swap, such as price or size, are so indefinite that
they cannot be reported to a registered SDR until some time after the counterparties agree to
preliminary terms, the counterparties may not have executed the security-based swap under
applicable law. Alternatively, even if the counterparties determine that their preliminary
agreement constitutes an execution, the reporting timeframe adopted herein, which will allow a
security-based swap to be reported at any point up to 24 hours after the time of execution, should
address the concerns raised by the commenters.
A third commenter urged the Commission to revise the definition to equate time of
execution with “the time of execution of the confirmation.” 91 The Commission declines to do
so. While confirmation is an important aspect of post-trade processing, performance of the
actions necessary to confirm a transaction is within the discretion of the counterparties and their
agents. Defining the “time of execution” to mean the time that a confirmation is issued could
create incentives for counterparties to delay confirmation and thus the reporting of the
transaction. The Commission notes that Section 13(m)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act 92 defines
“real-time public reporting” as reporting certain security-based swap data “as soon as

technologically practicable after the time at which the security-based swap transaction has been
executed.” The Commission believes this provision is most appropriately implemented by
linking obligations to the time at which the counterparties become bound to the terms of the
transaction—i.e., the time of execution—rather than some indefinite point in the future, such as
the time when the confirmation is issued.
d.

Rule 901(c)(3)

Re-proposed Rule 901(c)(7) would have required the reporting of the price of a securitybased swap. Re-proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(iii) would have required the reporting of the
“amount(s) and curren(cies) of any up-front payment(s) and a description of the terms and
contingencies of the payment streams of each direct counterparty to the other.” Final Rule
901(c)(3) combines these elements and requires the reporting of “[t]he price, including the
currency in which the price is expressed and the amount(s) and currenc(ies) of any up-front
payments.” 93 The Commission believes that including in final Rule 901(c)(3) the explicit
requirement to report the currency in which the price is expressed will help to clarify the
information required to be reported. 94 Re-proposed Rule 901(c)(3) is being re-numbered as final
Rule 901(c)(4). 95
Rule 901(c)(3), as adopted, requires the reporting of the amount(s) and currenc(ies) of
any up-front payments, a requirement that was included in re-proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(iii). The
Commission believes that information concerning the amount(s) and currenc(ies) of any up-front
93

Cf. Section II(B)(3)(c), infra (describing Rule 901(d), which enumerates data elements
that will not be subject to public dissemination).

94

The addition of the reference to currency also is consistent with re-proposed Rule
901(c)(3), which would have required reporting of the notional amount(s) of the securitybased swap and the currenc(ies) in which the notional amount(s) is expressed.

95

See infra Section II(B)(2)(b)(vi)(e).

51

payment(s) will help regulators and market observers understand the reported price of a securitybased swap, and that the public dissemination of this information will further the transparency
goals of Title VII. The Commission also believes that Rule 901(c) will be simpler if all
considerations relating to the price are consolidated into a single provision. Accordingly, Rule
901(c)(3), as adopted, requires the reporting and public dissemination of the amount(s) and
currenc(ies) of any up-front payment(s) along with other pricing information for the securitybased swap.
As discussed in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the price of a security-based
swap could be expressed in terms of the commercial conventions used in that asset class. 96 The
Commission recognized that the price of a security-based swap generally might not be a simple
number, as with stocks, but would likely be expressed in terms of the quoting conventions of the
security-based swap. For example, a credit default swap could be quoted in terms of the
economic spread—which is variously referred to as the “traded spread,” “quote spread,” or
“composite spread”—expressed as a number of basis points per annum. Alternately, a credit
default swap might be quoted in terms of prices representing a discount or premium over par. 97
In contrast, an equity or loan total return swap might be quoted in terms of a LIBOR-based
floating rate payment, expressed as a floating rate plus a fixed number of basis points. 98 As
discussed further in Section IV, infra, final Rule 907(a)(1) requires a registered SDR to establish,
maintain, and make publicly available policies and procedures that specify the data elements of a

96

See 75 FR at 75214. Final Rule 900(z) defines “price” to mean “the price of a securitybased swap transaction, expressed in terms of the commercial conventions used in the
asset class.”

97

security-based swap that must be reported, including elements that constitute the price. The
Commission believes that, because of the many different conventions that exist to express the
price in various security-based swap markets and new conventions that might arise in the future,
registered SDRs should have flexibility to select appropriate conventions for denoting the price
of different security-based swap products.
One commenter expressed concern that disseminating prices of margined and
unmargined transactions together could mislead the market about the intrinsic prices of the
underlying contracts. 99 Noting that the CFTC proposed a field for “additional price notation”
that would be used to provide information, including margin, that would help market participants
evaluate the price of a swap, the commenter recommended that the Commission and the CFTC
harmonize their approaches to assure that the market has an accurate picture of prices. 100 The
Commission agrees that publicly disseminated transaction reports should be as informative as
possible. However, the Commission believes, at this time, that it could be impractical to devise
additional data fields for describing the potentially complex margin requirements governing a
security-based swap. Furthermore, it could be difficult if not impossible to attribute a portion of
the price to a particular margin arrangement when the overall price represents the aggregation of
a number of different factors into a single variable. The Commission notes that the bespoke flag
required by Rule 901(c)(1)(v) is designed to inform market observers when a security-based
swap is customized to the extent that the other data elements required by Rule 901(c)(1) do not
provide all of the material information necessary to identify the security-based swap or provide
sufficient information to calculate the price.

See CCMR I at 4.

See id.

53

Another commenter expressed concern that disseminating the terms of the floating rate
payment for an equity swap, which is often comprised of a benchmark rate plus or minus a
spread and thus contains information about the direction of a customer transaction (positive
spreads indicate a customer long swap and negative spreads indicate a customer short swap) may
harm customers by offering other market participants the opportunity to anticipate their
execution strategy. 101 The commenter believes that the spread value should thus be masked for
equity security-based swaps when disclosing the price or terms of the floating rate payment. 102
As noted above, the Commission believes that publicly disseminated transaction reports should
be as informative as possible. The floating rate payment of an equity security-based swap,
including the spread, is an important part of the price of an equity security-based swap, and as
such the Commission continues to believe that it should be disseminated. Not disseminating this
information would undermine one of the key aspects of public dissemination, namely price
discovery. The Commission further understands that in other markets—such as the cash equity
market and the bond market—similar information is publically disclosed or can be inferred from
public market data, which informs on the direction of the customer transaction. 103

many exchanges, provided as a data element on direct data feeds. It can also be inferred

54

Re-proposed Rule 901(c)(3) would have required reporting of the notional amount(s) and
the currenc(ies) in which the notional amount(s) is expressed. The Commission is adopting this
rule as re-proposed, but re-numbering it as Rule 901(c)(4).
The Commission received two comments regarding the reporting and public
dissemination of the notional amount of a security-based swap. One commenter believed that,
“in the case of some asset classes, there is not a universal definition of the notional amount of the
trade. This is particularly the case where the notional amount is not confirmable information.” 104
To address this issue, the commenter recommended that the Commission provide guidelines,
such as those developed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for reporting the notional
amount of a security-based swap. 105
As discussed below, final Rules 907(a)(1) and 907(a)(2) require a registered SDR to
establish and maintain written policies and procedures that enumerate the specific data elements
that must be reported and that specify the protocols for submitting information, respectively.
The Commission believes that, read together, Rules 907(a)(1) and 907(a)(2) provide registered
SDRs with flexibility to determine the appropriate conventions for reporting all required data
elements, including the notional amount. Thus, although Rule 901(c) itself does not specify the
precise manner for reporting a security-based swap’s notional amount, the policies and
procedures of registered SDRs must do so. The Commission believes that a registered SDR

See id. The commenter refers to the guidelines included under “Line Item Instructions
for Derivatives and Off-Balance-Sheet Item Schedule HC-L” in the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System’s “Instructions for Preparation of Consolidated Financial
Statements for Bank Holding Companies Reporting Form FR Y-9C.” See ISDA/SIFMA
I at 12, note 13.

55

could choose to incorporate the guidance noted by the commenter, or other appropriate guidance,
into its policies and procedures for reporting notional amounts.
Another commenter suggested that the Commission, to mitigate adverse impacts on
market liquidity, should—like the CFTC—adopt masking thresholds, rather than requiring public
dissemination of the precise notional amount of a security-based swap transaction. 106 The
commenter noted that FINRA’s Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (“TRACE”) system 107
uses masking conventions, and suggested applying that approach to the swap and security-based
swap markets by “computing how much market risk is represented by the TRACE masking
thresholds and using those numbers to map the masking thresholds into other asset classes.” 108
The Commission appreciates the commenter’s concerns regarding the uncertainty of the
potential effects of public dissemination of security-based swap transaction reports on liquidity
in the security-based swap market. As discussed further in Section VII, infra, the rules adopted
in this release will allow the reporting, on an interim basis, of a security-based swap transaction
at any time up to 24 hours after the time of execution (or, if 24 hours after the time of execution
would fall on a day that is not a business day, by the same time on the next day that is a business
day). This timeframe is designed in part to minimize potential adverse impacts of public
dissemination on liquidity during the interim phase of Regulation SBSR’s implementation, as
market participants grow accustomed to operating in a more transparent environment.

Accordingly, the Commission does not believe that it is necessary at this time to adopt a masking
convention for purposes of reporting and publicly disseminating the notional amount of securitybased swap transactions. 109
f.

Rule 901(c)(5)

Rule 901(c)(10), as proposed and re-proposed, would have required the reporting side to
indicate whether both counterparties to a security-based swap are security-based swap dealers.
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated its preliminary belief that
such an indication would enhance transparency and provide more accurate information about the
pricing of security-based swap transactions. 110 The Commission noted, further, that prices of
security-based swap transactions involving a dealer and non-dealer are typically “all-in” prices
that include a mark-up or mark-down, while interdealer transactions typically do not. Thus, the
Commission believed that requiring an indication of whether a security-based swap was an
interdealer transaction or a transaction between a dealer and a non-dealer counterparty would
enhance transparency by allowing market participants to more accurately assess the reported
price of a security-based swap. 111
Commenters expressed mixed views regarding this proposed requirement. One
commenter supported a requirement to include the counterparty type in security-based swap
transaction reports. 112 Another commenter, however, recommended that the Commission

109

The Commission anticipates soliciting comment on issues relating to block trades,
including the possibility of utilizing masking thresholds, at a later date. See infra Section
VII.

110

See 75 FR at 75214.

111

112

See Benchmark Letter at 2. The commenter also suggested that it would be useful to
include an entry for “end user,” similar to the “Producer/Merchant/Producer/User”
57

eliminate the interdealer indication because “[e]xcluding this field from the information required
to be reported to [a registered SDR] in real time will bring the scope of required data in line with
existing dissemination functionality.” 113 A third commenter expressed concern that
disseminating information that both counterparties are security-based swap dealers would reduce
the anonymity of participants, ultimately resulting in “worse pricing and reduced liquidity for
end-users.” 114
The Commission believes that publicly disseminating an indication of whether both sides
of a security-based swap are registered security-based swap dealers would enhance transparency
in the security-based swap market by helping market participants to assess the reported price of a
security-based swap. Although the Commission understands the concerns about potential
burdens that could result from changes to existing dissemination practices, the required indicator
should not impose significant burdens. Furthermore, the Commission believes that any potential
burden created by requiring the indicator will be justified by the transparency benefits of publicly
disseminating this information. The Commission notes that flagging transactions between two
registered security-based swap dealers does indeed provide information to the public that the
transaction involved two dealers, thus restricting the set of possible counterparties. However,
since a majority of security-based swap transactions presently have a dealer as one of the
counterparties, an interdealer flag is unlikely to enable market observers to identify
designation used in agricultural futures reports. See id. The Commission does not
believe, at this time, that it is necessary to require a specific end-user indication. Under
final Rule 901(c)(5), a transaction involving two registered security-based swap dealers
must have an indication to that effect. An observer of a transaction report without that
indicator will be able to infer that the transaction involved at least one side that does not
have a registered security-based swap dealer.

58

counterparties to particular transactions. Also, although there is a limited group of entities that
likely would be required to register as security-based swap dealers that are currently active in the
security-based swap market, this number is more than two. 115 The Commission also notes that in
the bond market interdealer transactions are flagged as part of TRACE’s public dissemination of
corporate bond trades. Therefore, the Commission does not believe that flagging transactions
between two registered security-based swap dealers would ultimately result in “worse pricing
and reduced liquidity for end-users.” 116
The Commission, therefore, is adopting this requirement as final Rule 901(c)(5), with one
revision. The Commission has added the word “registered” before the term “security-based
swap dealer.” Therefore, the final rule requires an indication only when there is a registered
security-based swap dealer on both sides of the transaction. As discussed further below, the
Commission seeks to avoid imposing costs on market participants for assessing whether or not
they are security-based swap dealers solely for purposes of Regulation SBSR. 117 Therefore,
counterparties would have to be identified for purposes of Rule 901(c)(5), as adopted, only if
they are registered security-based swap dealers.
g.

Rule 901(c)(6)

Re-proposed Rule 901(c)(9) would have required the reporting side to indicate whether or
not a security-based swap would be cleared by a clearing agency. This requirement is being
adopted substantially as proposed but numbered as Rule 901(c)(6), with an additional

115

Historical data reviewed by the Commission suggest that, among an estimated 300
reporting sides, approximately 50 are likely to be required to register with the
Commission as security-based swap dealers. See infra Section XXI(B)(3).

See infra notes 284 to 285 and accompanying text.

59

clarification, described below. In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission
noted that the use of a clearing agency to clear a security-based swap could affect the price of the
security-based swap because counterparty credit risk might be diminished significantly if the
security-based swap were centrally cleared. 118 Thus, the Commission preliminarily believed that
information concerning whether a security-based swap would be cleared would provide market
participants with information that would be useful in assessing the reported price of the securitybased swap, thereby enhancing price discovery. 119 One commenter agreed, stating that it “will
likely also be necessary to identify whether a price is associated with a bilateral trade or a cleared
trade . . . as these distinctions may well have price impacts.” 120
The Commission continues to believe that information concerning whether a securitybased swap will be cleared is useful in assessing the price of the security-based swap and will
facilitate understanding of how risk exposures may change after the security-based swap is
executed. Accordingly, final Rule 901(c)(6) requires the reporting side to indicate “whether the
direct counterparties intend that the security-based swap will be submitted to clearing.”
Reporting of whether the direct counterparties intend that the security-based swap will be
submitted to clearing, rather than whether the security-based swap will be cleared, as originally
proposed, more accurately reflects the process of entering into and clearing a security-based
swap transaction. It may not be known, when the transaction is reported, whether a registered
clearing agency will in fact accept the security-based swap for clearing. The Commission

60

received no comments on this issue. The Commission believes, however, that the modified
language enhances the administration of the rule.
The Commission notes that, in some cases, the identity of the registered clearing agency
that clears a security-based swap could be included in the product ID of a security-based swap.
If the identity of the registered clearing agency is included in the product ID, no information
would have to be separately reported pursuant to Rule 901(c)(6).
h.

Rule 901(c)(7)

Re-proposed Rule 901(c)(11) would have required a reporting side to indicate, if
applicable, that a security-based swap transaction does not accurately reflect the market. In the
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission noted that, in some instances, a securitybased swap transaction might not reflect the current state of the market. 121 This could occur, for
example, in the case of a late transaction report, which by definition would not represent the
current state of the market, or in the case of an inter-affiliate transfer or assignment, where the
new counterparty might not have an opportunity to negotiate the terms, including the price, of
taking on the position. 122 The Commission believed that there might not be an arm’s length
negotiation of the terms of the security-based swap transaction, and disseminating a transaction
report without noting that fact would be inimical to price discovery. Accordingly, Rule
901(c)(11), as proposed and as re-proposed, would have required a reporting side to note such
circumstances in its transaction report to the registered SDR.
Rule 907(a)(4), as proposed and as re-proposed, would have required a registered SDR to
establish and maintain written policies and procedures that describe, among other things, how a
121

122

61

reporting side would report security-based swap transactions that, in the estimation of the
registered SDR, do not accurately reflect the market. The Commission noted its expectation that
these policies and procedures would require, among other things, different indicators being
applied in different situations. 123
One commenter suggested that Rule 901 should require the counterparties to a securitybased swap to disclose specific reasons why a security-based swap does not accurately reflect the
market because it would not be possible to understand the reported prices without that
information. 124 The commenter also stated that the Commission, rather than registered SDRs,
should specify the indicators used for such transaction reports. 125
The Commission agrees in general that an effective regime for public dissemination
should provide market observers with appropriate information to assist them in understanding the
disseminated transaction information. The Commission also agrees with the commenter that it
could be useful to market observers to provide more specific information about particular
characteristics of or circumstances surrounding a transaction that could affect its price discovery
value. Therefore, after careful consideration, the Commission is adopting the substance of reproposed Rule 901(c)(11), but is modifying the rule text to reflect final Rule 907(a)(4), and is
renumbering the requirement as Rule 901(c)(7). Rule 901(c)(7), as adopted, requires reporting
of any applicable flag(s) pertaining to the transaction that are specified in the policies and
procedures of the registered SDR to which the transaction will be reported. Rule 907(a)(4)(i)
requires a registered SDR to establish and maintain written policies and procedures for

“identifying characteristic(s) of a security-based swap, or circumstances associated with the
execution of a security-based swap, that could, in the fair and reasonable estimation of a
registered security-based swap data repository, cause a person without knowledge of these
characteristic(s) or circumstance(s) to receive a distorted view of the market.” A registered SDR
also must establish flags to denote these characteristic(s) or circumstance(s). 126 As discussed in
Section VI(G), infra, the Commission generally believes that a registered SDR should consider
providing condition flags identifying the following: inter-affiliate security-based swaps;
transactions resulting from netting or compression exercises; transactions resulting from a
“forced trading session” conducted by a clearing agency; transactions reported late; transactions
resulting from the default of a clearing member; and package trades. The Commission believes
that these condition flags, and others that registered SDRs may adopt in the future, should
provide additional information that will help to prevent market observers from receiving a
distorted view of the market. The Commission believes, further, that these condition flags
address the commenter’s recommendation that security-based swap transaction reports identify
the specific reasons why a transaction does not accurately reflect the market.
The Commission disagrees, however, with the commenter’s suggestion that a
Commission rule rather than the policies and procedures of a registered SDR should identify the
specific characteristics or circumstances that must be reported to prevent a transaction report
from presenting a distorted view of the market. The Commission continues to believe that
requiring registered SDRs to develop, maintain, and require the use of condition flags, and to
modify them as needed, will facilitate the development of a flexible reporting regime that is
better able to respond quickly to changing conditions in the security-based swap market. This
126

See Rule 907(a)(4)(ii).

63

flexibility will help to assure that reported transaction information remains meaningful as the
security-based swap market evolves over time.
B.

Rule 901(d)—Secondary Trade Information
1.

Description of Proposed and Re-Proposed Rule

Rule 901(d)(1), as proposed and as re-proposed, would have required the reporting of
certain secondary trade information concerning a security-based swap. Information reported
pursuant to Rule 901(d)(1) would be available to regulatory authorities only and would not be
publicly disseminated. Rule 901(d)(1), as re-proposed, would have required the reporting of the
following secondary trade information to a registered SDR: (1) the participant ID of each
counterparty; (2) as applicable, the broker ID, desk ID, and trader ID of the direct counterparty
on the reporting side; (3) the amount(s) and currenc(ies) of any up-front payment(s) and a
description of the terms and contingencies of the payment streams of each direct counterparty to
the other; (4) the title of any master agreement, or any other agreement governing the transaction
(including the title of any document governing the satisfaction of margin obligations),
incorporated by reference and the date of any such agreement; (5) the data elements necessary
for a person to determine the market value of the transaction; (6) if applicable, and to the extent
not provided pursuant to Rule 901(c), the name of the clearing agency to which the securitybased swap will be submitted for clearing; (7) if the security-based swap is not cleared, whether
the exception in Section 3C(g) of the Exchange Act 127 was invoked; (8) if the security-based
swap is not cleared, a description of the settlement terms, including whether the security-based

64

swap is cash-settled or physically settled, and the method for determining the settlement value;
and (9) the venue where the security-based swap was executed. 128
As discussed in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission believed that
the information required to be reported by proposed Rule 901(d) would facilitate regulatory
oversight and monitoring of the security-based swap market by providing comprehensive
information regarding security-based swap transactions and trading activity. 129 The Commission
believed, further, that this information would assist the Commission in detecting and
investigating fraud and trading abuses in the security-based swap market. 130
Re-proposed Rule 901(d)(2) specified timeframes for reporting the secondary trade
information required to be reported under Rule 901(d)(1). Rule 901(d)(2), as re-proposed, would
have required the reporting of secondary trade information promptly, but in no event later than:
(1) 15 minutes after the time of execution of a security-based swap that is executed and
confirmed electronically; (2) 30 minutes after the time of execution for a security-based swap
that is confirmed electronically but not executed electronically; or (3) 24 hours after the time of
execution for a security-based swap that is not executed or confirmed electronically.

Final Rule 901(d)

128

Rule 901(d)(1), as re-proposed, was substantially similar to Rule 901(d)(1), as proposed,
but made several technical changes. Rule 901(d)(1), as re-proposed, revised the rule to
add references to the reporting side, the direct counterparty on the reporting side, and
secondary trade information.

129

See 75 FR at 75217. Furthermore, to the extent that the Commission receives
information that is reported under Rule 901(d), the Commission anticipates that it will
keep such information confidential, to the extent permitted by law. See id. at note 59.

As discussed more fully below, the Commission is adopting Rules 901(d)(1) substantially
as re-proposed, although it is making several clarifying and technical changes to address issues
raised by commenters.
The Commission is not adopting the 15-minute, 30-minute, and 24-hour timeframes in reproposed Rule 901(d)(2). Instead, final Rule 901(d) requires a reporting side to report the
information required under Rule 901(d) within the timeframes specified by Rule 901(j). 131
Because re-proposed Rule 901(d)(2) is not being adopted, re-proposed Rule 901(d)(1) is
renumbered as final Rule 901(d), and re-proposed Rules 901(d)(1)(i)-(ix), which would identify
the categories of secondary trade information required to be reported, are renumbered as final
Rules 901(d)(1)-(9).
Rule 901(d), as adopted, requires the reporting side to report the following secondary
trade information: (1) the counterparty ID or execution agent ID of each counterparty, as
applicable; (2) as applicable, the branch ID, broker ID, execution agent ID, trader ID, and trading
desk ID of the direct counterparty on the reporting side; (3) to the extent not provided pursuant to
Rule 901(c)(1), the terms of any fixed or floating rate payments, including the terms and
contingencies of any such payments; (4) for a security-based swap that is not a clearing
transaction, the title and date of any master agreement, collateral agreement, margin agreement,
or any other agreement incorporated by reference into the security-based swap contract; (5) to
the extent not provided pursuant to Rule 901(c) or other provisions of Rule 901(d), any
additional elements included in the agreement between the counterparties that are necessary for a
person to determine the market value of the transaction; (6) if applicable, and to the extent not

131

Rule 901(j), which specifies the timeframe for reporting of the information enumerated in
Rules 901(c) and 901(d), is discussed in Section VII(B)(1) infra.

66

provided pursuant to Rule 901(c), the name of the registered clearing agency to which the
security-based swap will be submitted for clearing; (7) if the direct counterparties do not intend
to submit the security-based swap to clearing, whether they have invoked the exception in
Section 3C(g) of the Exchange Act; (8) to the extent not provided pursuant to other provisions of
Rule 901(d), if the direct counterparties do not submit the security-based swap to clearing, a
description of the settlement terms, including whether the security-based swap is cash-settled or
physically settled, and the method for determining the settlement value; (9) the platform ID, if
applicable; and (10) if the security-based swap arises from the allocation, termination, novation,
or assignment of one or more existing security-based swaps, the transaction ID of the allocated,
terminated, assigned, or novated security-based swap(s), except in the case of a clearing
transaction that results from the netting or compression of other clearing transactions.

Discussion of Final Rule 901(d) and Response to Comments
a.

Rule 901(d)(1)—Counterparty IDs

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission expressed the view that a
registered SDR “must have a systematic means to identify and track” all persons involved in the
security-based swap transactions reported to that registered SDR. 132 The Commission intended
to accomplish this, in part, through proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(i), which would have required the
reporting party to report the participant ID of each counterparty to a registered SDR. 133 As
proposed in Rule 900, “participant ID” would have been defined as “the UIC assigned to a
participant” 134 and “participant” would have encompassed: (1) a U.S. person that is a
132

75 FR at 75217.

133

See infra Section X (discussing use of LEIs).

134

The definition of “participant ID” was re-proposed, without change, in re-proposed Rule
900(s). The UIC is the unique identification code assigned to a person, unit of a person,
67

counterparty to a security-based swap that is required to be reported to a registered SDR; or (2) a
non-U.S. person that is a counterparty to a security-based swap that is (i) required to be reported
to a registered SDR; and (ii) executed in the United States or through any means of interstate
commerce, or cleared through a clearing agency that has its principal place of business in the
United States.
Re-proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(i) would have required the reporting side to report the
participant ID of each counterparty to a security-based swap. Re-proposed Rule 900(s) would
have defined “participant” as “a person that is a counterparty to a security-based swap that meets
the criteria of § 242.908(b).” Under re-proposed Rule 900(s), the following types of person
would have met the criteria of Rule 908(b): (1) U.S. persons; (2) security-based swap dealers
and major security-based swap participants; and (3) counterparties to a transaction “conducted
within the United States.” 135
The Commission received no comments on re-proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(i), but has
determined to adopt, as final Rule 901(d)(1), a modified rule that will, in the Commission’s
estimation, better accomplish the objective of ensuring that a registered SDR can identify each
counterparty to a security-based swap. As re-proposed, the reporting side would have been
required to report the participant ID of its counterparty only if the counterparty met the definition
of “participant,” which would have been limited by Rule 908(b). Under the re-proposed
definition of “participant,” some counterparties to security-based swaps would not have become
participants of the registered SDRs that receive reports of those security-based swaps under Rule
product, or transaction. See Rule 900(qq). As discussed more fully in Section IV, infra,
final Rule 907(a)(5) requires a registered SDR to establish and maintain policies and
procedures for assigning UICs in a manner consistent with adopted Rule 903.
135

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31065 (discussing re-proposed Rule
908(b)).

68

901(a). For example, if a U.S. person security-based swap dealer entered into a security-based
swap with a non-U.S. person private fund in a transaction that is not conducted within the United
States, the security-based swap dealer would have been a participant of the registered SDR to
which the security-based swap is reported pursuant to Rule 901(a), but the private fund would
not. In this circumstance, Rule 901(d)(1)(i), as re-proposed, would not have provided a
mechanism for the reporting of the private fund’s identity to the registered SDR; because the
private fund would not have been a participant of that registered SDR it would not have received
a “participant ID.”
The Commission believes that it is necessary and appropriate for a registered SDR to
obtain identifying information for all counterparties to security-based swaps that are subject to
Regulation SBSR. Without this information being reported to a registered SDR, the
Commission’s ability to oversee the security-based swap market could be impaired because the
Commission might not be able to determine the identity of each counterparty to a security-based
swap reported to a registered SDR pursuant to Regulation SBSR.
Final Rule 901(d)(1) addresses this concern by requiring the reporting side to report “the
counterparty ID or the execution agent ID of each counterparty, as applicable.” The Commission
is adopting, as Rule 900(j), the term “counterparty ID,” which means “the UIC assigned to a
counterparty to a security-based swap.” 136 A “counterparty” is a person that is a direct or
indirect counterparty of a security-based swap. 137 A “direct counterparty” is a person that is a
primary obligor on a security-based swap, 138 and an “indirect counterparty” is a guarantor of a
136

The Commission is not adopting the re-proposed definition of “participant ID” as this
term is not used in Regulation SBSR, as adopted.

137

See Rule 900(i).

138

See Rule 900(k).
69

direct counterparty’s performance of any obligation under a security-based swap such that the
direct counterparty on the other side can exercise rights of recourse against the indirect
counterparty in connection with the security-based swap; for these purposes a direct counterparty
has rights of recourse against a guarantor on the other side if the direct counterparty has a
conditional or unconditional legally enforceable right, in whole or in part, to receive payments
from, or otherwise collect from, the guarantor in connection with the security-based swap. 139
Thus, the definition of “counterparty ID” encompasses UICs that identify all direct and indirect

139

See Rule 900(p). Re-proposed Rule 900(o) would have defined “indirect counterparty”
to mean “a guarantor of a direct counterparty’s performance of any obligation under a
security-based swap.” The Commission is adopting, consistent with the approach it took
in the cross-border context, a modified definition of “indirect counterparty” to clarify the
type of guarantor relationship that would cause a person to become an indirect
counterparty for purposes of Regulation SBSR. See Securities Exchange Act Release
No.72472 (June 25, 2014), 79 FR 47278, 47316-17 (August 12, 2014) (“Cross-Border
Adopting Release”). Final Rule 900(p) defines “indirect counterparty” to mean a
guarantor of a direct counterparty’s performance of any obligation under a security-based
swap such that the direct counterparty on the other side can exercise rights of recourse
against the indirect counterparty in connection with the security-based swap; for these
purposes, a direct counterparty has rights of recourse against a guarantor on the other side
if the direct counterparty has a conditional or unconditional legally enforceable right, in
whole or in part, to receive payments from, or otherwise collect from, the guarantor in
connection with the security-based swap. Thus, under final Rule 900(p), a person
becomes an indirect counterparty to a security-based swap if the guarantee offered by the
person permits a direct counterparty on the other side of the transaction to exercise rights
of recourse against the person in connection with the security-based swap. The
Commission believes that, if a recourse guarantee exists, it is reasonable to assume that
the other side of the transaction would look both to the direct counterparty and its
guarantor(s) for performance on the security-based swap. If the direct counterparty fails
to fulfill its payment obligations on the security-based swap, its guarantor would be
obligated to make the required payments. As noted in the Cross-Border Adopting
Release, such rights may arise in a variety of contexts. The meaning of the terms
“guarantee,” “recourse,” and any related terms used in Regulation SBSR is the same as
the meaning of those terms in the Cross-Border Adopting Release and the rules adopted
therein.

70

counterparties to a security-based swap, even if a particular counterparty is not a participant of a
registered SDR. 140
The Commission believes final Rule 901(d)(1) will accomplish the Commission’s
objective of obtaining identifying information for all counterparties to a security-based swap and
improve regulatory oversight and surveillance of the security-based swap market. The
counterparty ID will allow registered SDRs, the Commission, and other relevant authorities to
track activity by a particular market participant and facilitate the aggregation and monitoring of
that market participant’s security-based swap positions.
The Commission also is adopting a requirement in Rule 901(d)(1)(i) for the reporting
side to report the “execution agent ID” as applicable. 141 This situation could arise if the identity
of a counterparty is not known at the time of execution. 142 In this circumstance, the reporting
side would report the execution agent ID because it would not know the counterparty ID.
Regulation SBSR requires reporting of the UIC of each counterparty to a security-based
swap. 143 One commenter stated that “each series or portfolio within each trust should be given
its own LEI/UCI number to address possible confusion between series or portfolios within the
same trust. Each portfolio is distinct with its own separate assets and liabilities.” 144 The

140

The process for obtaining UICs, including counterparty IDs, is described in Section X,
infra.

141

See infra Section II(C)(3)(b)(i) (discussing execution agent ID).

142

The Commission believes the reporting side may not know the counterparty ID of the
other side if, for example, the security-based swap will be allocated after execution.
Section VIII describes how Regulation SBSR applies to security-based swaps involving
allocation.

143

See Rule 901(d)(1); Rule 907(a)(5) (requiring a registered SDR to have written policies
and procedures for assigning UICs in a manner consistent with Rule 903).

144

Institutional Investors Letter at 6.

71

Commission agrees with this commenter and notes that Rule 901(d)(1) requires the reporting of
the UIC for each counterparty to a security-based swap, whether not the counterparty is a legal
person. 145 If a counterparty is an entity other than a legal person, such as a series or portfolio
within a trust, or an account, Rule 901(d)(1) requires the reporting of the UIC that identifies that
counterparty.
Finally, the Commission notes that although it is not adopting a definition of “participant
ID,” the concept of a “participant” is still utilized in Regulation SBSR. Rule 900(u), as adopted,
defines “participant,” with respect to a registered SDR, as “a counterparty, that meets the criteria
of § 242.908(b), of a security-based swap that is reported to that registered security-based swap
data repository to satisfy an obligation under § 242.901(a).” 146 The adopted definition makes
clear that a person becomes a participant of a particular registered SDR only if the person meets
the criteria of Rule 908(b) and is a counterparty to a security-based swap that is reported to that
registered SDR on a mandatory basis. A counterparty would not become a participant of all
registered SDRs as a result of being a counterparty to a security-based swap that is subject to
Regulation SBSR and reported to a particular registered SDR as required by Rule 901(a). The
adopted definition also clarifies that a counterparty would not become a participant of a
registered SDR as a result of any non-mandatory report 147 submitted to that registered SDR. 148
145

Consequently, the word “person,” as used in this release, includes any counterparty to a
security-based swap, including a counterparty that is not a legal person. Cf. Cross-Border
Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47312 (providing that an account, whether discretionary or
not, of a U.S. person also is a U.S. person—even though accounts generally are not
considered separate legal persons—and noting that this prong of the “U.S. person”
definition focuses on the party that actually bears the risk arising from a security-based
swap transaction).

146

Re-proposed Rule 900(s) would have defined “participant” as “a person that is a
counterparty to a security-based swap that meets the criteria of § 242.908(b).”

147

See infra Section VI(D)(1) (discussing non-mandatory reports).
72

Similarly, a counterparty that meets the criteria of Rule 908(b) would not become a participant of
any registered SDR if the security-based swap is reported pursuant to a substituted compliance
determination under Rule 908(c), because such a security-based swap would not be reported to a
registered SDR pursuant to Rule 901(a).
The final definition of “participant” is less comprehensive than the re-proposed definition
because Rule 908(b), as adopted, is narrower than Rule 908(b), as re-proposed. As discussed in
Section XV(D), infra, final Rule 908(b) includes U.S. persons, registered security-based swap
dealers, and registered major security-based swap participants. The Commission is not at this
time taking action on the prong of re-proposed Rule 908(b) that would have caused a person to
become a participant solely by being a counterparty to a security-based swap that is a transaction
conducted within the United States. As a result, fewer non-U.S. persons are likely to “meet the
criteria of Rule 908(b),” as adopted, because a non-U.S. person that is a counterparty of a
security-based swap would meet the criteria of final Rule 908(b) only if that counterparty is a
registered security-based swap dealer or a registered major security-based swap participant.
Thus, only a U.S. person, a registered security-based swap dealer, or a registered major securitybased swap participant could be a “participant” under Regulation SBSR.
b.

148

Rule 901(d)(2)—Additional UICs

Assume, for example, that Fund X is a U.S. person and engages in a single uncleared
security-based swap with a registered security-based swap dealer. Further assume that
the registered security-based swap dealer, who has the duty to report the transaction
under the reporting hierarchy, elects to submit the required transaction report to SDR P,
and also submits a non-mandatory report of the transaction to SDR Q. Fund X is now a
participant of SDR P but not of SDR Q. Under Rule 900(u), Fund X would not become a
participant of SDR Q unless and until it enters into a future security-based swap that is
reported on a mandatory basis to SDR Q.

73

Rule 901(d)(1)(ii), as re-proposed, would have required reporting of, as applicable, the
broker ID, desk ID, and trader ID of the direct counterparty on the reporting side. The
Commission preliminarily believed that the reporting of this information would help to promote
effective oversight, enforcement, and surveillance of the security-based swap market by the
Commission and other relevant authorities. 149 The Commission noted, for example, that this
information would allow regulators to track activity by a particular participant, a particular desk,
or a particular trader. In addition, relevant authorities would have greater ability to observe
patterns and connections in trading activity, or examine whether a trader had engaged in
questionable activity across different security-based swap products. Such identifiers also would
facilitate aggregation and monitoring of the positions of security-based swap counterparties,
which could be of significant benefit for systemic risk management. 150
Adopted Rule 901(d)(2) modifies re-proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(ii) in certain respects.
First, final Rule 901(d)(2) replaces the defined term “desk ID” with the defined term “trading
desk ID.” Second, final Rule 901(d)(2) now includes a requirement to report the branch ID and
the execution agent ID of the direct counterparty on the reporting side, in addition to the broker
ID, trading desk ID, and trader ID. In conjunction with this requirement, final Rule 900 includes
the new defined terms “branch ID” and “execution agent ID.” Third, final Rule 900 includes a
revised definition of “trader ID.” Thus, final Rule 901(d)(2) requires reporting of, “[a]s
applicable, the branch ID, broker ID, execution agent ID, trader ID, and trading desk ID of the
direct counterparty on the reporting side.” 151
149

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75217.

150

See id.

151

As discussed in greater detail in Section XIII(A), infra, Rule 906(a), as adopted, requires
reporting to a registered SDR of the branch ID, broker ID, execution agent ID, trader ID,
74

i.

Branch ID and Execution Agent ID

Rule 901(d)(2), as adopted, requires the reporting of, as applicable, the branch ID and
execution agent ID of the direct counterpart on the reporting side, in addition to the broker ID,
trader ID, and trading desk ID of the direct counterparty on the reporting side. The “branch ID”
is the “UIC assigned to a branch or other unincorporated office of a participant.” 152 The
Commission did not include a requirement to report the branch ID in Rule 901(d), as proposed or
as re-proposed. However, the Commission now believes that it is appropriate to include in
Regulation SBSR a new concept of the branch ID and require reporting of the branch ID, when a
transaction is conducted through a branch, as part of Rule 901(d)(2), as adopted. Reporting of
the branch ID, where applicable, will help identify the appropriate sub-unit within a large
organization that executed a security-based swap (if a transaction were in fact conducted through
that sub-unit). This information also will facilitate the aggregation and monitoring of securitybased swap transactions by branch, at the level of the registered SDR and potentially within the
firm itself.
Final Rule 901(d)(2) also includes another UIC, the “execution agent ID,” that was not
included in the proposal or re-proposal. Rule 900(m), as adopted, provides that the execution
agent ID is the “UIC assigned to any person other than a broker or trader that facilitates the
execution of a security-based swap on behalf of a direct counterparty.” The Commission
initially proposed to require reporting of the broker ID in order to obtain a record of an agent that
facilitates a transaction, if there is such an agent. The Commission now recognizes, however,
and trading desk ID, as applicable, of a direct counterparty to a security-based swap that
is not the reporting side. Thus, Rules 901(d)(2) and 906(a) together require reporting, as
applicable, of the branch ID, broker ID, execution agent ID, trader ID, and trading desk
ID of each direct counterparty to a security-based swap.
152

See Rule 900(d).

75

that entities other than registered brokers could act as agents in a security-based swap
transaction. For example, an asset manager could be acting as an agent on behalf of a fund
counterparty but likely would not be a broker-dealer. The definition of “execution agent ID” is
designed to encompass the entities in addition to brokers that may act as agents for securitybased swap counterparties. The broker ID, 153 which also must be reported under final Rule
901(d)(2), will identify a registered broker, if any, that intermediates a security-based swap
transaction between two direct counterparties and itself is not a counterparty to the transaction.
The Commission believes that obtaining information about a broker or execution agent, if
any, involved in the transaction will provide regulators with a more complete understanding of
the transaction and could provide useful information for market surveillance purposes. The
Commission notes that some security-based swap transactions may involve multiple agents. For
example, an asset manager could use a broker to facilitate the execution of a security-based swap
on behalf of one or more of the funds that it advises. In that case, final Rule 901(d) would
require reporting of the counterparty ID of the direct counterparty (the fund), the execution agent
ID (for the asset manager), and the broker ID (of the broker that intermediated the transaction).
ii.

Revised Defined Terms in Rule 901(d)(2)

Rule 901(d)(1)(ii), as re-proposed, would have required the reporting of, among other
things, the desk ID of the direct counterparty on the reporting side. Rule 900(i), as re-proposed,
would have defined “desk ID” as the UIC assigned to the trading desk of a participant or of a
broker of a participant. Rule 900, as re-proposed, did not include a definition of “desk.” Final
Rule 901(d)(2) requires the reporting of the “trading desk ID,” rather than the “desk ID.”

153

“Broker ID” is defined as “the UIC assigned to a person acting as a broker for a
participant.” See Rule 900(e).

76

Accordingly, the defined term “desk ID” is being replaced in Rule 900 with the defined term
“trading desk ID,” which Rule 900(ll) defines as “the UIC assigned to the trading desk of a
participant.” Unlike re-proposed Rule 900, which provided no definition of the term “desk,”
final Rule 900(kk) provides a definition of the term “trading desk.” Specifically, final Rule
900(kk) defines “trading desk” to mean, “with respect to a counterparty, the smallest discrete
unit of organization of the participant that purchases or sells financial instruments for the account
of the participant or an affiliate thereof.” The Commission believes that adding a definition of
“trading desk” will help to clarify the rule by describing the type of structure within an enterprise
that must receive a trading desk ID. The “trading desk ID” concept is designed to identify,
within a large organization, the smallest discrete unit that initiated a security-based swap
transaction. Requiring the reporting of the trading desk ID will assist regulators in monitoring
the activities and exposures of market participants. The trading desk ID could, among other
things, facilitate investigations of suspected manipulative or abusive trading practices. 154
Final Rule 901(d)(2) also requires reporting of, if applicable, the trader ID of the direct
counterparty on the reporting side. Re-proposed Rule 900(gg) would have defined “trader ID” as

154

The trading desk ID also might allow relevant authorities to determine whether a
particular trading desk is engaging in activity that could disrupt the security-based swap
markets. For example, in early 2012, a trading desk of JPMorgan Chase and Company
known as the Chief Investment Office executed transactions in synthetic credit
derivatives that declined in value by at least $6.2 billion later in the year. According to
the report of the United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, these
trades, which were unknown to the bank’s regulators, were “so large in size that they
roiled world credit markets.” Report of the United States Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, JPMorgan Chase Whale Trades: A Case History of
Derivatives Risks and Abuses (March 15, 2013), available at
http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/chase-whale-tradesa-case-history-of-derivatives-risks-and-abuses (last visited October 7, 2014). The
existence of a trading desk ID could, in the future, facilitate the ability of relevant
authorities to detect this type of trading activity.

77

“the UIC assigned to a natural person who executes security-based swaps.” This definition
would encompass a direct counterparty that executed a security-based swap, as well as a trader
acting as agent that executes a security-based swap on behalf of a direct counterparty. The
Commission did not intend for the definition of “trader ID” to include both direct counterparties
(whose counterparty IDs must be provided pursuant to Rule 901(d)(1)) and traders acting in an
agency capacity that execute security-based swaps on behalf of a direct counterparty. To narrow
the definition of “trader ID” so that it includes only traders that execute security-based swaps on
behalf of direct counterparties, final Rule 900(jj) defines “trader ID” as “the UIC assigned to a
natural person who executes one or more security-based swaps on behalf of a direct
counterparty.” The direct counterparty would be the person, account, or fund that is the direct
counterparty to the security-based swap that employs the trader.
iii.

Response to Comments

One commenter supported the proposed requirement for reporting broker ID, desk ID,
and trader ID, stating that these UICs would “give regulators a capability to aggregate position
and trade data in multiple ways including by individual trader to spot concentration risk and
insider trading.” 155 A second commenter argued that desk structures change relatively frequently
and personnel often rotate or transfer to other firms; therefore, the effort to maintain trader ID
and desk ID information in a registered SDR could exceed its usefulness. 156 The commenter also

GS1 Letter at 39 (also stating that these elements “would be most critical for performing
trading oversight and compliance functions such as trading ahead analysis, assessing
trader price collusion, analyzing audit trail data from multiple derivatives markets as well
as underlying cash markets. . . Also, lack of unique, unambiguous and universal
identification of broker, desks and traders was one of the significant deterrents to
analyzing the May 6, 2010 flash crash”). Another commenter generally supported the
information required to be reported pursuant to Rule 901(d). See Barnard I at 2.

78

indicated that information regarding the desk ID and trader ID would be available from a firm’s
audit trail. 157
The Commission questions whether consistent and robust information about a firm’s desk
and trader activity is available from firms’ audit trails. Even if it were, the Commission believes
that reporting of the trader ID and the trading desk ID—as well as the branch ID, broker ID, and
execution agent ID—will help to assure that information concerning the persons involved in the
intermediation and execution of a security-based swap is readily available to the Commission
and other relevant authorities. This information could assist in monitoring and overseeing the
security-based swap market and facilitate investigations of suspected manipulative or abusive
trading practices.
Two other commenters raised issues with requiring reporting of broker, trader, and
trading desk IDs. 158 One of these commenters believed that reporting these UICs would require
“great cost and effort” from firms, including the costs associated with establishing and
maintaining UICs in the absence of a global standard. 159 The commenter also noted that not all
of these identifiers are required to be reported in other jurisdictions. 160 In a joint comment letter
with another trade association, this commenter also stated that, because these UICs are not
currently reported by any participants in the OTC derivatives markets, “[t]he industry will need

See ISDA IV at 8 (stating that “[u]nder EMIR rules, broker ID is required, but not desk
ID or trader ID. In Canada, only broker ID is required, but we note that reporting entities

subject to a mandate to obtain one”). See also ISDA III at 2.

to develop standards and appropriate methodology to effectively report this information.” 161
This comment expressed concern that the proposed requirement “will create significant ‘noise’
as a result of booking restructuring events (due to either technical or desk reorganization
considerations). We therefore recommend that such information be either excluded, or that
participants report the Desk ID and Trader ID associated with the actual trade or lifecycle events,
but not those resulting from internal reorganization events.” 162
The Commission recognizes that, currently, UICs for branches, execution agents, trading
desks, and individual traders are generally not in use. While the Commission agrees with the
commenters that there could be a certain degree of cost and effort associated with establishing
and maintaining UICs, the Commission believes that such costs have already been taken into
account when determining the costs of Regulation SBSR. 163 The costs of developing such UICs
are included in the costs for Rule 901 (detailing the data elements that must be reported) and
Rule 907 (detailing the requirement that SDRs develop policies and procedures for the reporting
of the required data elements).
The Commission confirms that these UICs must be reported pursuant to Rule 901(d)(2)
only in connection with the original transaction. 164

Thus, a participant would not be required to “re-report” a transaction to the registered
SDR if, for example, the trader who executed the transaction leaves the firm some time
afterwards. However, the participant will be subject to the policies and procedures of the
registered SDR for, among other things, assigning UICs in a manner consistent with Rule
903. See infra Section IV. Those policies and procedures could include a requirement

c.

Rule 901(d)(3)—Payment Stream Information

Rule 901(d)(1)(iii), as proposed and re-proposed, would have required the reporting side
to report the amount(s) and currenc(ies) of any up-front payment(s) and a description of the
terms and contingencies of the payment streams of each direct counterparty to the other. The
Commission stated that this requirement would include, for a credit default swap, an indication
of the counterparty purchasing protection, the counterparty selling protection, and the terms and
contingencies of their payments to each other; and, for other security-based swaps, an indication
of which counterparty is long and which is short. 165 The Commission noted that this information
could be useful to regulators in investigating suspicious trading activity. 166
One commenter stated the view that proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(iii) was duplicative of
proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(v), which would require reporting of the data elements necessary to
determine the market value of a transaction. 167 The commenter stated, further, that proposed
Rule 901(d)(1)(iii) was unclear about the required form of the description of the terms and
contingencies of the payment streams, and requested further clarification of this proposed
requirement. 168
The Commission agrees with the commenter’s concerns regarding the need to clarify the
information required to be reported under these provisions of Rule 901. Accordingly, the
Commission is revising adopted Rule 901(d)(3) to require the reporting, to the extent not

for the participant to regularly notify the registered SDR about changes in persons or
business units requiring a UIC.

provided pursuant to Rule 901(c)(1), of the terms of any fixed or floating rate payments, or
otherwise customized or non-standardized payment streams, including the frequency and
contingencies of any such payments. 169 As discussed above, adopted Rule 901(c)(1)(iv) requires
the reporting side to report the terms of any standardized fixed or floating rate payments, and the
frequency of any such payments. 170 To the extent that a security-based swap includes fixed or
floating rate payments that do not occur on a regular schedule or are otherwise customized or
non-standardized, final Rule 901(d)(3) requires the reporting of the terms of those payments,
including the frequency and contingencies of the payments. The Commission believes that the
changes to final Rule 901(d)(3) make clear that Rule 901(d)(3) requires reporting of customized
or non-standardized payment streams, in contrast to the standardized payment streams required
to be reported pursuant to Rule 901(c)(1)(iv). The terms required to be reported could include,
for example, the frequency of any resets of the interest rates of the payment streams. The terms
also could include, for a credit default swap, an indication of the counterparty purchasing
protection and the counterparty selling protection, and, for other security-based swaps, an
indication of which counterparty is long and which counterparty is short. The Commission
believes that information concerning the non-standard payment streams of a security-based swap
could be useful to the Commission or other relevant authorities in assessing the nature and extent
169

As discussed above, the requirement to report the amount(s) and currenc(ies) of any upfront payments now appears in Rule 901(c)(3), rather than in Rule 901(d). Rule
901(c)(3), as adopted, requires reporting of the price of a security-based swap, including
the currency in which the price is expressed and the amount(s) and currenc(ies) of any
up-front payments.

170

If information concerning the terms and frequency of any regular fixed or floating rate
payments is included in the product ID for the security-based swap, the reporting side is
required to report only the product ID, and would not be required to separately report the
terms and frequency of any regular fixed or floating rate payments in addition to the
product ID. See Rule 901(c)(1); Section III(B)(2)(b)(ii), supra.

of counterparty obligations and risk exposures. The Commission believes that the changes made
to Rule 901(d)(3) will help clarify the information required to be reported under the rule and will
eliminate any redundancy between the information required to be reported under Rules
901(c)(1)(iv) and 901(d)(3).
In addition, as discussed more fully below, the Commission is revising re-proposed Rule
901(d)(1)(v), which is renumbered as final Rule 901(d)(5), to indicate that Rule 901(d)(5)
requires the reporting of additional data elements necessary to determine the market value of a
transaction only to the extent that the information has not been reported pursuant to Rule 901(c)
or other provisions of Rule 901(d). The Commission believes that these changes address the
concern that Rule 901(d)(i)(iii) was duplicative of Rule 901(d)(1)(v).
d.

Rule 901(d)(4)—Titles and Dates of Agreements

Rule 901(d)(1)(iv), as proposed, would have required reporting of the title of any master
agreement, or any other agreement governing the transaction (including the title of any document
governing the satisfaction of margin obligations), incorporated by reference and the date of any
such agreement. Rule 901(d)(1)(v), as proposed, would have required reporting of the data
elements necessary for a person to determine the market value of the transaction. The
Commission noted that proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(v) would require, for a security-based swap that
is not cleared, information related to the provision of collateral, such as the title and date of the
relevant collateral agreement. The Commission preliminarily believed that these requirements,
together with other information required to be reported under Rule 901(d), would facilitate
regulatory oversight of counterparties by providing information concerning counterparty

83

obligations. 171 The Commission re-proposed Rules 901(d)(1)(iv) and 901(d)(1)(v) without
revision in the Cross-Border Proposing Release.
In proposing Rules 901(d)(1)(iv) and 901(d)(1)(v), the Commission balanced the burdens
associated with reporting entire agreements against the benefits of having information about
these agreements, and proposed to require reporting only of the title and date of such master
agreements and any other agreement governing the transaction. Similarly, the Commission
indicated that proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(v) would require the reporting of the title and date of any
collateral agreements governing the transaction. 172
One commenter disagreed with the Commission’s proposed approach. This commenter
expressed the view that Regulation SBSR should be more explicit in requiring reports of
information concerning collateral and margin for use by regulators because this information
would be important for risk assessment and other purposes. 173
The Commission agrees that it is important for regulatory authorities to have access to
information concerning the collateral and margin associated with security-based swap
transactions. The Commission also is mindful, however, that requiring the reporting of detailed
information concerning the master agreement and other documents governing security-based
swaps could impose significant burdens on market participants. In addition, the Commission

173

See Better Markets I at 7-8 (arguing that, to facilitate oversight, security-based swap
counterparties should be required to report the core data elements of their collateral
arrangements, including, at a minimum: (1) the parties to the agreement; (2) the
thresholds for forbearance of posted collateral applicable to each party; (3) the triggers
applicable to each party that would require immediate funding (termination of
forbearance); and (4) the methodology for measuring counterparty credit risk); Better
Markets III at 4-5.

84

notes that one commenter on proposed Regulation SBSR stated that it would not be possible, in
all cases, to identify the collateral associated with a particular security-based swap transaction
because collateral is calculated, managed, and processed at the portfolio level rather than at the
level of individual transactions. 174
In light of these considerations, the Commission believes that, for security-based swaps
that are not clearing transactions, requiring reporting of the title and date of any master
agreement, collateral agreement, margin agreement, or any other agreement incorporated by
reference into the security-based swap contract—but not the agreements themselves or detailed
information concerning the agreements—will facilitate regulatory oversight of the security-based
swap market by providing regulators with a more complete understanding of a security-based
swap counterparty’s obligations while not imposing significant burdens on market participants.
The Commission anticipates that, if a situation arose where the Commission or another relevant
authority needed to consult information about a transaction contained in one of the related
agreements, the Commission could request the agreement from one of the security-based swap
counterparties. Knowing the title and date of the agreement will assist relevant authorities in
identifying the agreement and thereby expedite the process of obtaining the necessary
information.

174

See ISDA/SIFMA I at 14-15. Specifically, the commenter stated that the calculation of
exposure collateral “is performed at a netted portfolio level and cannot be broken down to
the transaction level—it is simply not possible to identify the specific exposure collateral
or the ‘exposure’ associated with any particular transaction.” See id. at 14. The
commenter noted, further, that the independent amount, an optional additional amount of
collateral that two counterparties may negotiate, “may be specified at transaction level, at
portfolio level, at some intermediate level (a combination of product type, currency and
maturity, for instance), and possible a hybrid of all three. Therefore it may or may not be
possible to identify the [independent amount] associated with a particular transaction, but
as a general matter this association cannot be reliably made.” See id. at 15.

85

One commenter argued that the “level of change” necessary to incorporate the titles and
dates of master agreements into individual trade messages was excessive and recommended that
the trade level reference continue to follow the current process of referencing the lowest level
governing document, which would permit the identification of all of the other relevant
documents. 175 Another commenter questioned the value of requiring reporting of the title and
date of party level agreements. 176 This commenter stated that, because other jurisdictions do not
require reporting of the “title and date of a Credit Support Agreement or other similar document
(“CSA”) governing the collateral arrangement between the parties . . . global trade repositories
do not currently have fields to support separate reporting of data pertaining to the CSA from
those which define the master agreement. Equally challenging is firms’ ability to report data
pertaining to the CSA as the terms of these agreements are not readily reportable in electronic
format nor could this be easily or accurately achieved.” 177 Noting that other global regulators
have limited their trade reporting requirements to the relevant date and type of the master
agreement, the commenter believed that the information required to be reported should be
limited to the identification of party level master agreements that govern all of the derivatives
transactions between the parties, and should not include master confirmations or other
documentation that is used to facilitate confirmation of the security-based swap. 178
The Commission understands that reporting the titles and dates of agreements for
individual security-based swap transactions may require some modification of current practices.
However, the Commission believes that it is important for regulators to know such titles and

dates so that the Commission and other relevant authorities would know where to obtain further
information about the obligations and exposures of security-based swap counterparties, as
necessary. The Commission believes that requiring reporting of the titles and dates of master
agreements and other agreements governing a transaction—but not the agreements themselves or
detailed information concerning the agreements—would provide regulators with access to
necessary information without creating an unduly burdensome reporting obligation. Therefore,
the Commission is adopting Rule 901(d)(1)(iv) substantially as proposed and re-proposed, while
renumbering it final Rule 901(d)(4). With respect to the commenter’s concern regarding the
difficulty of reporting the terms of the documentation governing a security-based swap, the
Commission emphasizes that final Rule 901(d)(4) requires reporting only of the titles and dates
of the documents specified in Rule 901(d)(4), but not the terms of these agreements.
The commenter also requested additional clarity regarding the proposed requirement
generally. 179 As discussed above, Rule 901(d)(1)(iv), as proposed and re-proposed, would have
required reporting of “the title of any master agreement, or any other agreement governing the
transaction (including the title of any document governing the satisfaction of margin
obligations), incorporated by reference and the date of any such agreement.” The proposed rule
also would have required reporting of the title and date of any collateral agreements governing
the transaction. 180 Although the rule, as proposed and re-proposed, would have required
reporting of the title and date of any master agreement, margin agreement, collateral agreement,
and any other document governing the transaction that is incorporated by reference, the
Commission agrees that it would be useful to state more precisely the information required to be
179

See DTCC V at 12.

180

87

reported and to clarify the scope of the rule. Rule 901(d)(4), as adopted, requires reporting of,
“[f]or a security-based swap that is not a clearing transaction, the title and date of any master
agreement, collateral agreement, margin agreement, or any other agreement incorporated by
reference into the security-based swap contract.” The new language makes clear that Rule
901(d)(4) applies only to security-based swaps that are not clearing transactions (i.e., securitybased swaps that do not have a registered clearing agency as a direct counterparty). Any such
agreements relating to a clearing transaction would exist by operation of the rules of the
registered clearing agency, and therefore do not need to be reported pursuant to Regulation
SBSR because the Commission could obtain information from the registered clearing agency as
necessary.
e.

Rule 901(d)(5)—Other Data Elements

Rule 901(d)(1)(v), as re-proposed, would have required reporting of the data elements
necessary for a person to determine the market value of a transaction. The Commission is
adopting Rule 901(d)(1)(v) substantially as re-proposed, but renumbering it as Rule 901(d)(5)
and making certain technical and clarifying changes in response to comments.
As discussed above, re-proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(iii) would have required reporting of the
amount(s) and currenc(ies) of any up-front payments and the terms and contingencies of the
payment streams of each direct counterparty to the other. One commenter believed that reproposed Rule 901(d)(1)(iii) was duplicative of re-proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(v), 181 and asked the
Commission to provide additional clarity on what re-proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(v) requires. 182 To
address these comments, the Commission is revising adopted Rule 901(d)(5) to require the
181

See DTCC II at 10.

182

See DTCC V at 12.

88

reporting, to the extent not required pursuant to Rule 901(c) or other provisions of Rule 901(d),
of any additional data elements included in the agreement between the counterparties that are
necessary for a person to determine the market value of the transaction.
Another commenter expressed concern that the requirements of re-proposed Rule
901(d)(1)(v) were vague, “leaving reporting parties and trade repositories with the task of
establishing the reportable data with potentially different result.” 183 This commenter
recommended that Commission revise the rule to clarify the requirement to report “(i) the markto-market value and currency code and (ii) the date and time of the valuation in Coordinated
Universal Time . . .” 184 Further, because information necessary to determine the market value of
a transaction “is determined as part of end of day processes,” the commenter requested that the
timeframe for reporting data pertaining to market value be based on the end of the day on which
the relevant data was determined. 185
In response to these concerns, the Commission emphasizes that neither Regulation SBSR,
as proposed and re-proposed, nor Regulation SBSR, as adopted, requires the reporting of the
market value of a security-based swap (although the negotiated price of the actual transaction is
required to be reported), either on a one-time or ongoing basis. 186 As noted above, final Rule
901(d)(5) requires reporting, to the extent not required pursuant to Rule 901(c) or other
provisions of Rule 901(d), of any additional data elements included in the agreement between the
counterparties that are necessary to determine the market value of the transaction. This refers to
183

186

In contrast, the CFTC’s swap data reporting rules require reporting parties to report the
market value of swap transactions to a CFTC-registered swap data repository on a daily
basis. See 17 CFR 45.4(a)(2).

89

all of the contractual terms and conditions of a security-based swap that a party would need to
perform its own calculation of the market value of the security-based swap using its own market
data. Although the reporting side must include, as part of the initial transaction report, the
information necessary to determine the market value of the transaction, Regulation SBSR does
not require the reporting side to take the additional step of calculating and reporting the market
value of the transaction, nor does it require the reporting side to provide any market data that
would be needed to calculate the market value of the transaction.
Rule 901(d)(5) is designed to help to ensure that all of the material terms of the
agreement between the counterparties that is necessary to determine the market value of a
security-based swap are available to the Commission and other relevant authorities. 187 The
Commission continues to believe that this requirement will facilitate regulatory oversight by
giving relevant authorities the information necessary to value an entity’s security-based swap
positions and calculate the exposure resulting from those positions. However, the final language
of Rule 901(d)(5) is designed to eliminate any overlap with other provisions of Rule 901(c) or
901(d). For example, if a security-based swap has a product ID, the Commission presumes that
all information necessary to identify the security-based swap and determine the market value of
the transaction could be derived from the product ID (or the identification information behind
that particular product ID). Therefore, it would not be necessary to report any additional
information pursuant to Rule 901(d)(5) for a security-based swap for which a product ID is
reported.

187

This could include—by way of example and not of limitation—information about interest
rate features, commodities, or currencies that are part of the security-based swap contract.

90

In addition, the Commission is further clarifying the rule by making a technical change to
indicate that final Rule 901(d)(5) requires the reporting only of data elements “included in the
agreement between the counterparties.” The Commission believes that the rule as proposed and
re-proposed—which did not include this phrase—could have been interpreted to require the
reporting of information external to the agreement between the counterparties that could have
helped determine the market value of the security-based swap (e.g., the levels of supply and
demand in the market for the security-based swap). The Commission intended, however, to
require reporting only of information included in the agreement between the counterparties, not
of general market information. Accordingly, final Rule 901(d)(5) requires the reporting only of
data elements “included in the agreement between the counterparties” that are necessary for a
person to determine the market value of the transaction.
Finally, one commenter believed that proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(v) should require
reporting only of the full terms of a security-based swap as laid out in the trade confirmation. 188
Although the Commission agrees that the full terms of a trade confirmation could, in some cases,
provide the data elements included in the agreement between the counterparties that are
necessary to determine the market value of a transaction, the Commission notes that the
information required to be reported pursuant Rule 901(d)(5) would not necessarily be limited to
information included in the trade confirmation. Not all market participants observe the same
conventions for confirming their trades. The Commission understands that confirmations for
some types of trades are significantly more standardized than others. Some trades may have
critical terms included in other documentation, such as master confirmation agreements or credit
support annexes. Moreover, confirmation practices in the future may differ from current
188

See DTCC II at 10.

91

confirmation practices. The Commission believes, therefore, that restricting information
reported in accordance with Rule 901(d)(5) to the information included in the confirmation
would not provide the Commission and other relevant authorities with sufficient information
regarding the market value of a security-based swap.
f.

Rule 901(d)(6)—Submission to Clearing

Rule 901(d)(1)(vi), as re-proposed, would have required reporting of the following data
element: “If the security-based swap will be cleared, the name of the clearing agency.” This
information would allow the Commission to verify, if necessary, that a security-based swap was
cleared, and to identify the clearing agency that cleared the transaction. The Commission
received no comments on this provision and is adopting it substantially as re-proposed, with
minor clarifying changes and renumbered as Rule 901(d)(6). Rule 901(d)(6), as adopted,
requires reporting of the following: “If applicable, and to the extent not provided pursuant to
paragraph (c) of this section, the name of the clearing agency to which the security-based swap
will be submitted for clearing.”
For some security-based swaps, the name of the clearing agency that clears the securitybased swap could be inherent in the product ID. Rule 901(d)(6), as adopted, clarifies that the
name of the clearing agency to which the security-based swap will be submitted for clearing
need not be reported if that information is inherent in the product ID. In addition, the new
language regarding whether the security-based swap will be submitted for clearing reflects the
possibility that a clearing agency could reject the security-based swap for clearing after it has
been submitted. The Commission believes that it would be useful to know the name of the
clearing agency to which the transaction is submitted, even if the clearing agency rejects the
transaction.

92

g.

Rule 901(d)(7)—Indication of Use of End-User Exception

Rule 901(d)(1)(vii), as re-proposed, would have required reporting of whether a party to
the transaction invoked the so-called “end user exception” from clearing, which is contemplated
in Section 3C(g) of the Exchange Act. 189 Section 3C(g)(6) of the Exchange Act 190 provides for
the Commission to request information from persons that invoke the exception. The
Commission preliminarily believed that requiring reporting of whether the exception was
invoked in the case of a particular security-based swap would assist the Commission in
monitoring use of the exception. 191
One commenter argued that the Commission should not use the trade reporting
mechanism “to police the end-user exception.” 192 The commenter expressed concern with an
end user having to certify eligibility with each transaction and stated that “it is illogical that
filings by swap dealers should determine the eligibility of the end user.” 193 The Commission
acknowledges the commenter’s concerns but believes that they are misplaced. Re-proposed Rule
901(d)(1)(vii) would not require reporting of any information as to the end user’s eligibility to

189

15 U.S.C. 78c-3(g). Section 3C(g)(1) of the Exchange Act provides that the general
clearing mandate set forth in Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act will not apply to a
security-based swap if one of the counterparties to the security-based swap: (1) is not a
financial entity; (2) is using security-based swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk;
and (3) notifies the Commission, in a manner set forth by the Commission, how it
generally meets if financial obligations associated with entering into non-cleared
security-based swaps. The application of Section 3C(g)(1) is solely at the discretion of
the security-based swap counterparty that satisfies these conditions. See Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 63556 (December 15, 2010), 75 FR 79992 (December 21,
2010).

invoke the exception for a specific transaction; instead, it would require reporting only of the fact
of the exception being invoked. The Commission could then obtain information from a
registered SDR regarding instances of the exception being invoked and could determine, as
necessary, whether to further evaluate whether the exception had been invoked properly. The
Commission does not believe that it is necessary or appropriate to require information about the
end user’s eligibility to invoke the exception to be reported under Rule 901(d). Therefore, the
Commission has determined to adopt Rule 901(d)(1)(vii) as re-proposed, but is renumbering it as
Rule 901(d)(7).
h.

Rule 901(d)(8)—Description of Settlement Terms

Rule 901(d)(1)(viii), as re-proposed, would have required, for a security-based swap that
is not cleared, a description of the settlement terms, including whether the security-based swap is
cash-settled or physically settled, and the method for determining the settlement value. In the
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated its preliminary belief that this
information would assist relevant authorities in monitoring the exposures and obligations of
security-based swap market participants. 194 One commenter expressed the view that the
settlement terms could be derived from other data fields and thus recommended deletion of this
data element, or in the alternative, requested additional clarity on what would be required
pursuant to this provision. 195
Re-proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(viii) is being adopted substantially as re-proposed but
renumbered as final Rule 901(d)(8) and now includes certain revisions that respond to the
commenter and clarify the operation of the rule. Rule 901(d)(8), as adopted, requires: “[t]o the
194

See 75 FR at 75218.

195

See DTCC V at 12.

94

extent not provide pursuant to other provisions of this paragraph (d), if the direct counterparties
do not submit the security-based swap to clearing, a description of the settlement terms,
including whether the security-based swap is cash-settled or physically settled, and the method
for determining the settlement value.” The Commission believes that the final rule makes clear
that there is no requirement to report information concerning the settlement terms of an
uncleared security-based swap if the information was reported pursuant to another provision of
Rule 901(d). Similarly, there is no requirement to report the settlement terms pursuant to Rule
901(d)(8) if the settlement terms are inherent in the product ID. Final Rule 901(d)(8) is designed
to facilitate regulatory oversight by providing the Commission and other relevant authorities with
information necessary to understand the exposures of security-based swap counterparties.
i.

Rule 901(d)(9)—Platform ID

Rule 901(d)(1)(ix), as re-proposed, would have required reporting of the venue where a
security-based swap was executed. This would include, if applicable, an indication that a
security-based swap was executed bilaterally in the OTC market. 196 This information could be
useful for a variety of purposes, including studying the development of security-based swap
execution facilities (“SB SEFs”) or conducting more detailed surveillance of particular securitybased swap transactions. In the latter case, the Commission or another relevant authority would
find it helpful to know the execution venue, from which it could obtain additional information as
appropriate.
One commenter, in discussing the entity that should assign transaction IDs, suggested
that linking a trade to a particular platform potentially could result in the unintentional disclosure

196

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75218.

95

of the identities of the counterparties. 197 The Commission notes that information concerning the
venue where a security-based swap was executed, like all secondary trade information reported
under Rule 901(d), is not required to be, and thus may not be, publicly disseminated. Because
the platform ID may not be publicly disseminated, there is no potential for it to unintentionally
identify the counterparties to the transaction.
The Commission continues to believe that information identifying the venue where a
security-based swap was executed, whether on a trading platform or in the OTC market, is
necessary information for relevant authorities to conduct surveillance in the security-based swap
market and understand developments in the security-based swap market generally. Therefore,
the Commission is adopting the rule substantially as re-proposed and renumbering it as final
Rule 901(d)(9).
One commenter asked the Commission to clarify that re-proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(ix)
would require reporting only of execution platforms required to register with the Commission or
the CFTC. 198 The Commission believes that final Rule 901(d)(9) largely accomplishes this
result. Specifically, the Commission has revised Rule 901(d)(9) to require reporting, if
applicable, of the “platform ID,” rather than the “execution venue” more broadly. To implement
this requirement, the Commission also is adopting a definition of “platform.” Final Rule 900(v)
defines a “platform” as “a national securities exchange or a security-based swap execution
facility that is registered or exempt from registration.” 199 Rule 900(w) defines “platform ID” as

See ISDA IV at 9.

199

The Commission believes that transactions occurring on a registered SB SEF as well as
an exempt SB SEF should be reported to a registered SDR. Certain entities that currently
meet the definition of “security-based swap execution facility” are not yet registered with
the Commission and will not have a mechanism for registering until the Commission
96

the UIC assigned to the platform on which a security-based swap is executed. The platform ID,
like other UICs, must be assigned as provided in Rule 903. The Commission believes that this
approach makes clear that other entities that may be involved in executing transactions, such as
inter-dealer brokers, are not considered platforms for purposes of this reporting requirement. 200
j.

Rule 901(d)(10)—Transaction ID of Any Related Transaction

Regulation SBSR, as proposed and re-proposed, was designed to obtain complete and
accurate reporting of information regarding a security-based swap from its execution through its
termination or expiration. In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission noted
that maintaining an accurate record of the terms of a security-based swap would require reporting
of life cycle event information to a registered SDR. 201 The term “life cycle event” includes

adopts final rules governing the registration and core principles of SB SEFs. These
entities currently operate pursuant to an exemption from certain otherwise applicable
provisions of the Exchange Act. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-64678
(June 15, 2011), 76 FR 36287, 36292-93 (June 22, 2011) (Temporary Exemptions and
Other Temporary Relief, Together With Information on Compliance Dates for New
Provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Applicable to Security-Based Swaps).
In addition, the Commission has raised the possibility of granting exemptions to certain
foreign security-based swap markets that otherwise would meet the definition of
“security-based swap execution facility.” See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at
31056 (“The Commission preliminarily believes that it may be appropriate to consider an
exemption as an alternative approach to SB SEF registration depending on the nature or
scope of the foreign security-based swap market’s activities in, or the nature or scope of
the contacts the foreign security-based swap market has with, the United States”). The
adopted definition of “platform” requires such entities to be identified in SDR transaction
reports and thus will enable the Commission and other relevant authorities to observe
transactions that occur on such exempt SB SEFs.
200

Consistent with Rule 901(d)(9), a registered SDR could create a single identifier for
transactions that are not executed on a national securities exchange or a SB SEF that is
registered or exempt from registration.

reporting for security-based swaps in the Cross-Border Proposing Release. See 75 FR at

terminations, novations, and assignments of existing security-based swaps. 202 As discussed in
greater detail in Sections V(C)(5) and VIII(A), infra, a new security-based swap may arise
following the allocation, termination, novation, or assignment of an existing security-based
swap, and that the reporting side for the new security-based swap must report the transaction to a
registered SDR. 203 The Commission believes that it should be able to link any new securitybased swaps that arise from the termination, novation, or assignment of an existing securitybased swap to the original transaction. For example, when a single security-based swap is
executed as a bunched order and then allocated among multiple counterparties, the Commission
and other relevant authorities should be able to link the allocations to the executed bunched
order. 204 The ability to link a security-based swap that arises from an allocation, termination,
novation, or assignment back to the original security-based swap(s) will help to assure that the
Commission and relevant authorities have an accurate and current representation of counterparty
exposures.
To facilitate the Commission’s ability to map a resulting security-based swap back to the
original transaction—particularly if the original transaction and the resulting transaction(s) are
reported to different registered SDRs—the Commission is adopting Rule 901(d)(10), which
requires the reporting side for a security-based swap that arises from an allocation, termination,
202

See infra Section XXI(A) (discussing the definition of “life cycle events”).

203

Certain terminations, such as the termination of an alpha upon acceptance for clearing,
result in the creation of new security-based swaps (e.g., the beta and gamma). Similarly,
security-based swaps that are terminated during netting or compression exercises result in
the creation of new security-based swaps. Regardless of the circumstances, if a securitybased swap arises from the termination of an existing security-based swap, the reporting
side for the new security-based swap must report the transaction to a registered SDR as
required by Rule 901(a).

novation, or assignment of one or more existing security-based swaps, to report “the transaction
ID of the allocated, terminated, assigned, or novated security-based swap(s), except in the case of
a clearing transaction that results from the netting or compression of other clearing
transactions.” 205 The Commission does not believe that it is necessary to require reporting of the
transaction ID for clearing transactions that result from other clearing transactions because
clearing transactions occur solely within the registered clearing agency and are used by the
registered clearing agency to manage the positions of clearing members and, possibly their
clients. Thus, it would not be necessary for regulatory authorities to have the ability to link
together clearing transactions that result from other clearing transactions.

Information That Is Not Required by Rule 901(d)

One commenter, responding to a question in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 206
stated that the Commission should not require reporting of the purpose of a security-based swap
because it could reveal proprietary information, and because the parties to a security-based swap
often will have several reasons for executing the transaction. 207 The Commission agrees that
counterparties could have multiple reasons for entering into a security-based swap, and that
requiring reporting of a particular reason could be impractical. Furthermore, different sides to
the same transactions would likely have different reasons for entering into it. The Commission
notes, further, that it did not propose to require reporting of the purpose of the security-based
swap and Rule 901, as adopted, does not include a requirement to report this information.

Two commenters recommended that the Commission require reporting of valuation data
on an ongoing basis. 208 The Commission emphasizes that it did not propose to require the
reporting of valuation data in either the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release or the Cross-Border
Proposing Release, and that it is not adopting such a requirement at this time. 209 However, the
Commission will continue to assess the reporting and public dissemination regime under
Regulation SBSR and could determine to propose additional requirements, such as the reporting
of valuations, as necessary or appropriate. In addition, the Commission notes that the data
elements required under Rules 901(c) and 901(d) are designed to allow the public, the
Commission, other relevant authorities, or a data analytics firm engaged by a relevant authority,
to calculate the market value of a security-based swap at the time of execution of the trade. 210

urged the Commission to provide guidance regarding the methods these entities should
use to produce valuation information). See Levin Letter at 3-4. A fourth commenter

providing for the reporting to a registered SDR or to the Commission of security-based swaps
entered into before the date of enactment of Section 3C (i.e., July 21, 2010). By its terms, this
provision is not limited to security-based swaps that were still open as of the date of enactment
of the Dodd-Frank Act. In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission took the
preliminary view that an attempt to collect many years’ worth of transaction-level security-based
swap data (including data on terminated or expired security-based swaps) would not enhance the
goal of price discovery, nor would it be particularly useful to relevant authorities or market
participants in implementing a forward-looking security-based swap reporting and dissemination
regime. 212 The Commission also took the preliminary view that collecting, reporting, and
processing all such data would involve substantial costs to market participants with little
potential benefit. Accordingly, the Commission proposed to limit the reporting of security-based
swaps entered into prior to the date of enactment to only those security-based swaps that had not
expired as of the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act (“pre-enactment security-based
swaps”).
In addition, Section 3C(e)(2) of the Exchange Act 213 requires the Commission to adopt
rules that provide for the reporting of security-based swaps entered into on or after the date of
enactment of Section 3C (“transitional security-based swaps”). 214
The Commission proposed Rule 901(i) to implement both of these statutory
requirements. Rule 901(i), as proposed, would have required a reporting party to report all of the

information required by Rules 901(c) and 901(d) for any pre-enactment security-based swap or
transitional security-based swap (collectively, “historical security-based swaps”), to the extent
such information was available. Thus, Rule 901(i), as proposed and re-proposed, would have
required the reporting only of security-based swaps that were open on or executed after the date
of enactment (July 21, 2010). The Commission further proposed that historical security-based
swaps would not be subject to public dissemination. In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the
Commission re-proposed Rule 901(i) in its entirety with only one technical revision, to replace
the term “reporting party” with “reporting side.”
2.

Final Rule and Discussion of Comments Received

As adopted, Rule 901(i) states: “With respect to any pre-enactment security-based swap
or transitional security-based swap in a particular asset class, and to the extent that information
about such transaction is available, the reporting side shall report all of the information required
by [Rules 901(c) and 901(d)] to a registered security-based swap data repository that accepts
security-based swaps in that asset class and indicate whether the security-based swap was open
as of the date of such report.” In adopting Rule 901(i), the Commission is making minor
changes to the rule as re-proposed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release. The Commission has
added the clause “in a particular asset class” following “transitional security-based swap” and the
clause “to a registered security-based swap data repository that accepts security-based swaps in
that asset class.” The security-based swap market is segregated into different asset classes, and
an SDR might choose to collect and maintain data for only a single asset class. These new
clauses clarify that a reporting side is not obligated to report historical security-based swaps in a
particular asset class to a registered SDR that does not accept security-based swaps in that asset
class. A reporting side’s duty to report a historical security-based swap in a particular asset class

102

arises only when there exists a registered SDR that accepts security-based swaps in that asset
class.
The Commission also is adopting the definition of “pre-enactment security-based swap”
as proposed and re-proposed. 215 Further, the Commission is adopting the definition of
“transitional security-based swap” substantially as proposed and re-proposed, with one clarifying
change and a technical revision to eliminate the obsolete term “effective reporting date.” 216 Rule
900(nn), as adopted, defines “transitional security-based swap” to mean “a security-based swap
executed on or after July 21, 2010, and before the first date on which trade-by-trade reporting of
security-based swaps in that asset class to a registered security-based swap data repository is
required pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.909.” Thus, only those security-based swaps that
were open as of the date of enactment (July 21, 2010) or opened thereafter must be reported.
The Commission continues to believe that the costs of reporting security-based swaps that
terminated or expired before July 21, 2010, would not justify any potential benefits, particularly
given the difficulty of assembling records concerning these transactions after many years. One
commenter specifically agreed with the Commission’s proposal to limit reporting of security215

See Rule 900(y).

216

The term “effective reporting date” was used in the compliance schedule set out in reproposed Rule 910, which the Commission is not adopting. The “effective reporting
date,” would have been defined to mean, with respect to a registered [SDR], the date six
months after the registration date. The “registration date” would have been defined to
mean, with respect to a registered SDR, “the date on which the Commission registers the
security-based swap data repository, or, if the Commission registers the security-based
swap data repository before the effective date of §§ 242.900 through 242.911, the
effective date of §§ 242.900 through 242.911.” See re-proposed Rules 900(l) and
900(bb), respectively. The Commission is making a conforming change to delete the
defined terms “effective reporting date” and “registration date” from final Rule 900. As
noted in Section I(F) above, the Commission is proposing a new compliance schedule for
Rules 901, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, and 908 of Regulation SBSR in the Regulation SBSR
Proposed Amendments Release.

103

based swaps entered into prior to the date of enactment only to those that had not expired as of
that date. 217
However, this commenter also expressed concern that a blanket requirement to report all
pre-enactment security-based swaps “risks double-counting and presenting a distorted view of
certain markets.” 218 In particular, the commenter indicated that compression exercises and triparty novations raised concerns regarding the potential for double-counting. The Commission
shares the commenter’s concern that double-counting could create a distorted view of the
security-based swap market. Therefore, the Commission is adding new language at the end of
the Rule 901(i) which provides that the reporting side of a pre-enactment or transitional securitybased swap must “indicate whether the security-based swap was open as of the date of such
report.” This information is necessary to allow a registered SDR to calculate a participant’s open
positions established before the time trade-by-trade reporting becomes mandatory for a particular
asset class.
The commenter also stated that “inter-affiliate security-based swaps should not be subject
to reporting.” 219 The Commission disagrees with this suggestion. As described in Section IX,
infra, the Commission believes generally that inter-affiliate security-based swaps should be
subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination. The Commission thus believes that
pre-enactment inter-affiliate security-based swaps also should be subject to regulatory reporting,
assuming that such security-based swaps were opened after the date of enactment or still open as

217

104

of the date of enactment. The Commission notes, however, that no information reported
pursuant to Rule 901(i) will be publicly disseminated.
Having access to information regarding historical security-based swaps will help the
Commission and other relevant authorities continue to develop a baseline understanding of
positions and risk in the security-based swap market, starting on the date of enactment of the
Dodd-Frank Act, which contemplates the regime for regulatory reporting of all security-based
swaps. These transaction reports will provide a benchmark against which to assess the
development of the security-based swap market over time, and help the Commission to prepare
reports that it is required to provide to Congress.
One commenter, while generally supporting the Commission’s proposal to require
reporting of historical security-based swaps to a registered SDR, argued that only open contracts
should be reported. 220 The Commission partially agrees with this comment and thus, as noted
above, is requiring reporting of only pre-enactment security-based swaps that were open as of the
date of enactment. However, the Commission believes that all security-based swaps entered into
on or after the date of enactment should be reported—even if they expired or were terminated
before trade-by-trade reporting becomes mandatory—and that the reporting side should indicate
whether the security-based swap was open as of the date of such report. While reporting of
terminated or expired transitional security-based swaps is not necessary for the calculation of
market participants’ open positions, this information will assist the Commission and other
relevant authorities to create, for surveillance purposes, at least a partial audit trail 221 of

220

See DTCC II at 17.

221

The Commission notes that Rule 901(i) by its terms requires the reporting of historical
security-based swaps only “to the extent such information is available.” Thus, if
105

transactions executed after the date of enactment and, more generally, to analyze market
developments since the date of enactment.
This commenter also argued that security-based swaps “only [in] their current state
should need to be reported, without additional information like execution time.” 222 A second
commenter expressed concern that the reporting requirements for historical security-based swaps
could require parties to modify existing trades that occurred in a heretofore unregulated market
in order to comply with Rule 901(i). 223 A third commenter expressed concern that “[t]he
submission of non-electronic transaction confirmations [for pre-enactment security-based swaps]
will be extremely burdensome for reporting entities,” 224 and recommended instead that the
Commission “permit the reporting in a common electronic format of the principal electronic
terms” of each such pre-enactment security-based swap. 225
For several reasons, the Commission believes that Rule 901(i) strikes a reasonable
balance between the burdens placed on security-based swap counterparties and the policy goal of
enabling the Commission and other relevant authorities to develop a baseline understanding of
counterparties’ security-based swap positions. First, the Commission notes that Rule 901(i)
requires reporting of the data elements set forth in Rules 901(c) and 901(d) only to the extent

information about terminated or expired transitional security-based swaps no longer
exists, it would not be required to be reported under Rule 901(i).

participants are not required to provide trade execution time information for preenactment security-based swap transactions).

of existing swaps would be resource intensive with potentially significant negative
consequences”).

106

such information is available. The Commission does not expect, nor is it requiring, reporting
sides to create or re-create data related to historical security-based swaps. Thus, if the time of
execution of a historical security-based swap was not recorded by the counterparties, it is not
required to be reported under Rule 901(i). Similarly, Rule 901(i) does not require counterparties
to modify existing transactions in any way to ensure that all data fields are complete. By limiting
the reporting requirement to only that information that is available, the Commission is
acknowledging that, for historical security-based swaps, certain information contemplated by
Rules 901(c) and 901(d) may not be available. The Commission generally believes that the
benefits of requiring security-based swap counterparties to reconstruct the missing data
elements—including, for example, the time of execution—potentially several years after the time
of execution—would not justify the costs.
The Commission agrees with the commenter who argued that providing large volumes of
non-electronic confirmations to registered SDRs is not desirable, and that the Commission
instead should require reporting in a “common electronic format.” 226 As discussed in Section
IV, infra, Rules 907(a)(1) and 907(a)(2) require registered SDRs to establish and maintain
policies and procedures that enumerate the specific data elements and the acceptable data
formats for transaction reporting, including of historical security-based swaps. The Commission
expects that registered SDRs and their participants will consult regarding the most efficient and
cost effective ways to report the transaction information required by Rule 901(i). Furthermore,
to the extent that information regarding a historical security-based swap already has been
reported to a person that will register with the Commission as an SDR—or to a person that itself
will not seek registration as an SDR but will transfer the historical security-based swap
226

Deutsche Bank Letter at 2-3.

107

information to an affiliate that registers as an SDR—Rule 901(i) would be satisfied, and would
not require resubmission of that information to the registered SDR. 227
Finally, the Commission notes an issue relating to the reporting of the counterparty ID of
historical security-based swaps. As commenters have discussed, 228 certain foreign jurisdictions
have privacy laws or blocking statutes that may prohibit the disclosure of the identity of a
counterparty to a financial transaction, such as a security-based swap transaction. Thus, the
reporting side of a cross-border security-based swap could face a dilemma: comply with
Regulation SBSR and report the identity of the counterparty and thereby violate the foreign law,
or comply with the foreign law by withholding the identity of the counterparty and thereby
violate Regulation SBSR. As discussed in Section XVI(B), infra, the Commission will consider
requests for exemptions from the requirement under Rule 901(i) to report the identity of a
counterparty with respect to historical security-based swaps.

Where To Report Data
A.

All Reports Must Be Submitted to a Registered SDR

Section 13A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act 229 provides that “[e]ach security-based swap that
is not accepted for clearing by any clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization shall be
reported to—(A) a registered security-based swap data repository described in Section 13(n); or

security-based swap, to the Commission.” Section 13(m)(1)(G) of the Exchange Act 230 provides
that “[e]ach security-based swap (whether cleared or uncleared) shall be reported to a registered
security-based swap data repository.” Rule 901(b) implements these statutory requirements.
Rule 901(b), as re-proposed, would have required reporting of the security-based swap
transaction information required under Regulation SBSR “to a registered security-based swap
data repository or, if there is no registered security-based swap data repository that would accept
the information, to the Commission.” In addition, Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(ii) under the Exchange Act,
adopted as part of the SDR Adopting Release, requires an SDR that accepts reports for any
security-based swap in a particular asset class to accept reports for all security-based swaps in
that asset class that are reported to the SDR in accordance with certain SDR policies and
procedures. In view of this requirement under Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(ii) and the statutory requirement
in Section 13(m)(1)(G) that all security-based swaps, whether cleared or uncleared, must be
reported to a registered SDR, the Commission does not anticipate that any security-based swaps
will be reported directly to the Commission.
Some commenters noted the potential advantages of designating a single registered SDR
for each asset class. 231 Another commenter, however, believed that a diverse range of options
for reporting security-based swap data would benefit the market and market participants. 232

See DTCC II at 14-15 (noting the potential for fragmentation of data and overstatement
of net open interest and net exposure if security-based swaps in the same asset class are
reported to multiple registered SDRs); ISDA/SIFMA I at note 12 (stating that the
designation of a single registered SDR per asset would provide valuable efficiencies
because there would be no redundancy of platforms or need for additional data
aggregation, which would reduce the risk of errors associated with transmitting,
aggregating, and analyzing data from multiple sources).

See MFA I at 6.

109

These comments concerning the development of multiple registered SDRs are discussed in
Section XIX, infra. No commenters opposed Rule 901(b), and the Commission is adopting Rule
901(b) with technical modifications to clarify the rule. 233
B.

Duties of Registered SDR Upon Receiving Transaction Reports
1.

Rule 901(f)—Time Stamps

Rule 901(f), as re-proposed, provided that “[a] registered security-based swap data
repository shall time stamp, to the second, its receipt of any information submitted to it pursuant
to paragraph (c), (d), (e), or (i) of this section.” The Commission preliminarily believed that this
requirement would help regulators to evaluate certain trading activity. 234 For example, a
reporting side’s pattern of submitting late transaction reports could be an indicator of weaknesses
in the reporting side’s internal compliance processes. Accordingly, the Commission
preliminarily believed that the ability to compare the time of execution with the time of receipt of
the report by the registered SDR could be an important component of surveillance activity
conducted by relevant authorities.
One commenter, noting that proposed Rule 901(f) would require time-stamping to the
nearest second, argued that “[t]ime-stamping increment should be as small as technologically
practicable, but in any event no longer than fractions of milliseconds.” 235 The commenter

233

Rule 901(b), as re-proposed, would have required reporting of the security-based swap
transaction information required under Regulation SBSR “to a registered security-based
swap data repository or, if there is no registered security-based swap data repository that
would accept the information, to the Commission.” Final Rule 901(b) provides: “If there
is no registered security-based swap data repository that will accept the report required by
§ 242.901(a), the person required to make such report shall instead provide the required
information to the Commission.”

expressed the view that, especially in markets with multiple SB SEFs or where algorithmic
trading occurs, “the sequencing of trade data for transparency and price discovery, as well as
surveillance and enforcement purposes, will require much smaller increments of timestamping.” 236 The Commission notes, however, that Rule 901(f) is designed to allow the
Commission to learn when a transaction has been reported to a registered SDR, not when the
transaction was executed. The interim phase of applying Regulation SBSR allows transactions
to be reported up to 24 hours after time of execution. The Commission believes that no purpose
would be served by knowing the moment of reporting to the subsecond. Instead, the
Commission believes that this comment is germane instead to the reporting of time of execution.
Therefore, the Commission has considered this comment in connection with Rule 901(c)(2)
rather than with Rule 901(f). 237
The Commission continues to believe that requiring a registered SDR to timestamp, to
the second, its receipt of any information pursuant to paragraphs (c), (d), (e), or (i) of Rule 901 is
appropriate, and is adopting Rule 901(f) as re-proposed. Rule 901(f) will allow the Commission
to compare the time of execution against the time of receipt by the registered SDR to ascertain if
a transaction report has been submitted late.
2.

Rule 901(g)—Transaction IDs

Rule 901(g), as proposed and re-proposed, would have provided that “[a] registered
security-based swap data repository shall assign a transaction ID to each security-based swap.”
The transaction ID was defined in both the proposal and re-proposal as “the unique identification
code assigned by a registered security-based swap data repository to a specific security-based
236

Id.

237

See supra notes 76 and 77 and accompanying text.

111

swap.” The Commission preliminarily believed that a unique transaction ID would allow
registered SDRs, regulators, and counterparties to more easily track a security-based swap over
its duration and would facilitate the reporting of life cycle events and the correction of errors in
previously reported security-based swap information. 238 The transaction ID of the original
security-based swap would allow for the linking of the original report to a report of a life cycle
event. Similarly, the transaction ID would be required to be included on an error report to
identify the transaction to which the error report pertained.
In proposing Rule 901(g), the Commission preliminarily believed that, because each
transaction is unique, it would not be necessary or appropriate to look to an internationally
recognized standards setting body for assigning such identifiers. 239 Instead, proposed Rule
901(g) would have required a registered SDR to use its own methodology for assigning
transaction IDs. 240
Two commenters generally supported use of the transaction ID. 241 One commenter
stated that transaction IDs would allow for a complete audit trail, permit the observation of
concentrations of trading and risk exposure at the transaction level, and facilitate more timely
analysis of market events. 242 The second commenter agreed that a transaction ID would be

essential for reporting life cycle event and secondary trade information, as well as corrections to
reported information. 243
Commenters expressed mixed views regarding the entity that should assign the
transaction ID. One commenter stated that a platform should assign the transaction ID to assure
that the identifier is assigned at the earliest point in the life of a transaction. 244 A second
commenter suggested that registered SDRs should assign transaction IDs, 245 or have the
flexibility to accept transaction IDs already generated by the reporting side or to assign
transaction IDs when requested to do so. 246 A third commenter expressed concern that registered
SDRs would assign transaction IDs in a non-standard manner, which could hinder regulators’
ability to gather transaction data across registered SDRs to reconstruct an audit trail. 247 A fourth
commenter, a trade association, recommended that security-based swaps be identified by a
Unique Trade Identifier (“UTI”) created either by the reporting side or by a platform (including

243

See DTCC II at 15. Another commenter believed that proposed Regulation SBSR would
require public dissemination of the transaction ID, and argued that the transaction ID
should not be publicly disseminated, as it could compromise the identity of the
counterparties to the security-based swap. The commenter suggested instead that an SDR
could create a separate identifier solely for purposes of public dissemination. See ISDA
IV at 17. Under Regulation SBSR, as adopted, the transaction ID is not a data element of
security-based swap transaction that is required to be publicly disseminated. Thus,
registered SDRs must identify transactions in public reports without using the transaction
ID. See infra Section XII(C) (discussing requirement for registered SDRs to establish
and maintain policies and procedures for disseminating life cycle events).

an execution venue or an affirmation or middleware or electronic confirmation platform) on
behalf of the parties. 248 This commenter noted that it has worked with market participants to
develop a standard for creating and exchanging a single unique transaction identifier suitable for
global reporting. 249
After careful consideration, the Commission has determined to adopt Rule 901(g) with
modifications to respond to concerns raised by the commenters. Final Rule 901(g) provides that
a registered SDR “shall assign a transaction ID to each security-based swap, or establish or
endorse a methodology for transaction IDs to be assigned by third parties.” The Commission is
also making a conforming change to the definition of “transaction ID.” Final Rule 900(mm)
defines “transaction ID” as “the UIC assigned to a specific security-based swap transaction.” As
re-proposed, “transaction ID” would have been defined as “the unique identification code
assigned by a registered security-based swap data repository to a specific security-based
swap.” 250 By eliminating the reference to a UIC “assigned by a registered security-based swap
data repository,” the revised definition contemplates that a third party could assign a transaction
ID under Regulation SBSR. However, because the Commission believes that the registered SDR

See id. In a subsequent comment letter, this commenter indicated that it “strongly
believe[s] the party reporting the SBS should assign or provide the Transaction ID” rather
than a registered SDR. ISDA IV at 11 (stating that “many SBS already have been
reported to other global jurisdictions for which a . . . UTI (including a CFTC Unique
Swap Identifier) has already been assigned by one of the parties or a central execution,
affirmation or confirmation platform in accordance with industry standard practices for
trade identifiers that have developed in the absence of a global regulatory standard. For
the sake of efficiency and in consideration of global data aggregation, we recommend
that the Commission allow a reporting party to use the UTI already established for a SBS
for further reporting under SBSR and acknowledge that trades subject to reporting under
SBSR may be assigned a trade identifier in accordance with existing industry UTI
practices”).

is in the best position to promote the necessary uniformity for UICs that will be reported to it, the
reporting side would be permitted to report a transaction ID generated by a third party only if the
third party had employed a methodology for generating transaction IDs that had been established
or endorsed by the registered SDR.
Rule 901(g), as adopted, provides flexibility by requiring a registered SDR either to
assign a transaction ID itself or to establish or endorse a methodology for assigning transaction
IDs. Thus, under adopted Rule 901(g), an SB SEF, a counterparty, or another entity could assign
a transaction ID, provided that it assigned the transaction ID using a methodology established or
endorsed by the registered SDR. This approach will allow market participants to determine the
most efficient and effective procedures for assigning transaction IDs and will accommodate the
use of different processes that might be appropriate in different circumstances. 251 For example,
an SB SEF might generate the transaction ID for a security-based swap executed on its facilities
(provided the SB SEF does so using a methodology established or endorsed by the registered
SDR 252), while a registered SDR or security-based swap dealer counterparty might generate the
transaction ID for a security-based swap that is not executed on an SB SEF.

251

This approach will allow a platform to assign the transaction ID in certain cases, as
recommended by a commenter. See Tradeweb Letter at 5.

252

Thus, the Commission only partially agrees with the commenter who believed that the
registered SDR should assign transaction IDs, in order to “eliminate any unintentional
disclosure issues which stem from linking a trade to a specific SEF, potentially increasing
the instances of unintended identification of the trade parties.” DTCC II at 16. The
Commission shares the commenter’s concern that the transaction ID not result in the
unintended identification of the counterparties. However, this would not require that the
registered SDR itself issue the transaction ID in all cases; the registered SDR could allow
submission of transaction IDs generated by third parties (such as SB SEFs or
counterparties), provided that the registered SDR endorsed the methodology whereby
third parties can generate transaction IDs. Furthermore, the Commission notes that the
transaction ID is not a data element required by Rule 901(c) and thus it should not be

How To Report Data—Rules 901(h) and 907
A.

Introduction

Designing a comprehensive system of transaction reporting and post-trade transparency
for security-based swaps involves a constantly evolving market, thousands of participants, and
potentially millions of transactions. The Commission does not believe that it is necessary or
appropriate to specify by rule every detail of how this system should operate. On some matters,
there may not be a single correct approach for carrying out the purposes of Title VII’s
requirements for regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swap
transactions.
The Commission believes that registered SDRs will play an important role in developing,
operating, and improving the system for regulatory reporting and public dissemination of
security-based swaps. Registered SDRs are at the center of the market infrastructure, as the
Dodd-Frank Act requires all security-based swaps, whether cleared or uncleared, to be reported
to them. 253 Accordingly, the Commission believes that some reasonable flexibility should be
given to registered SDRs to carry out their functions—for example, to specify the formats in
which counterparties must report transaction data to them, connectivity requirements, and other
protocols for submitting information. Furthermore, the Commission anticipates that
counterparties will make suggestions to registered SDRs for altering and improving their
practices, or developing new policies and procedures to address new products or circumstances,
consistent with the requirements set out in Regulation SBSR.

publicly disseminated—so market observers should not be able to learn the transaction ID
in any case.
253

See 15 U.S.C. 13m(m)(1)(G).

116

Accordingly, proposed Rule 907 would have required each registered SDR to establish
and maintain written policies and procedures addressing various aspects of security-based swap
transaction reporting. Proposed Rules 907(a)(1) and 907(a)(2) would have required a registered
SDR to establish policies and procedures enumerating the specific data elements that must be
reported, the acceptable data formats, connectivity requirements, and other protocols for
submitting information; proposed Rule 907(a)(3) would have required a registered SDR to
establish policies and procedures for reporting errors and correcting previously submitted
information; proposed Rule 907(a)(4) would have required a registered SDR to establish policies
and procedures for, among other things, reporting and publicly disseminating life cycle events
and transactions that do not reflect the market; proposed Rule 907(a)(5) would have required a
registered SDR to establish policies and procedures for assigning UICs; proposed Rule 907(a)(6)
would have required a registered SDR to establish policies and procedures for obtaining ultimate
parent and affiliate information from its participants; and proposed Rule 907(b) would have
required a registered SDR to establish policies and procedures for calculating and publicizing
block trade thresholds. The Commission also proposed to require registered SDRs to make their
policies and procedures publicly available on their websites, and to update them at least
annually. 254 Rule 901(h), as proposed and re-proposed, would have required reports to be made
to a registered SDR “in a format required by the registered security-based swap data repository,
and in accordance with any applicable policies and procedures of the registered security-based
swap data repository.”
Furthermore, because all security-based swaps must be reported to a registered SDR,
registered SDRs are uniquely positioned to know of any instances of untimely, inaccurate, or
254

See proposed Rules 907(c) and 907(d).

117

incomplete reporting. Therefore, proposed Rule 907(e) would have required registered SDRs to
have the capacity to provide the Commission with reports related to the timeliness, accuracy, and
completeness of the data reported to them.
The Commission re-proposed Rule 907 as part of the Cross-Border Proposing Release
with only minor conforming changes. 255 Rule 901(h) was re-proposed without revision.
B.

Rules 907(a)(1), 907(a)(2), and 901(h)—Data Elements and Formats

The comments addressing Rule 907 were generally supportive of providing flexibility to
registered SDRs to develop policies and procedures. 256 One commenter stated, for example, that
overly prescriptive rules for how data is reported will almost certainly result in less reliable or
redundant data flowing into an SDR when higher quality data is available. In this commenter’s
view, the Commission should not prescribe the exact means of reporting for SDRs to meet
regulatory obligations, and SDRs should be afforded the flexibility to devise the most efficient,
effective, and reliable methods of furnishing the Commission with the complete set of data
necessary to fulfill regulatory obligations. 257 The Commission is adopting Rule 907 with some
revisions noted below.
Final Rule 907(a)(1) requires a registered SDR to establish and maintain written policies
and procedures that “enumerate the specific data elements of a security-based swap that must be
reported, which shall include, at a minimum, the data elements specified in [Rules 901(c) and
901(d)].” The Commission revised Rule 907(a)(1) to make certain non-substantive changes and

255

As initially proposed, Rule 907 used the term “reporting party.” As described in the
Cross-Border Proposing Release, the term “reporting party” was replaced with “reporting
side” in Rule 907 and throughout Regulation SBSR.

256

118

to move the requirement to establish policies and procedures for life cycle event reporting from
final Rule 907(a)(1) to final Rule 907(a)(3). 258 Final Rule 907(a)(2) requires a registered SDR
to establish and maintain written policies and procedures that “specify one or more acceptable
data formats (each of which must be an open-source structured data format that is widely used by
participants), connectivity requirements, and other protocols for submitting information.” The
Commission is adopting Rule 907(a)(2) as re-proposed.
The Commission continues to believe that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to
mandate a fixed schedule of data elements to be reported, or a single format or language for
reporting such elements to a registered SDR. The Commission anticipates that industry
standards for conveying information about security-based swap transactions will evolve over
time, and the approach taken in Rule 907 is designed to allow Regulation SBSR’s reporting
requirements to evolve with them. The Commission further anticipates that security-based swap
products with novel contract terms could be developed in the future. Establishing, by
Commission rule, a fixed schedule of data elements risks becoming obsolete, as new data
elements—as yet unspecified—could become necessary to reflect the material economic terms of
such products. Final Rules 907(a)(1) and 907(a)(2) give registered SDRs the duty, but also the
flexibility, to add, remove, or amend specific data elements or to adjust the required reporting
protocols over time in a way that captures all of the material terms of a security-based swap
258

As initially proposed, Rule 907(a)(1) would have required policies and procedures that
enumerate the specific data elements of a security-based swap or life cycle event that a
reporting party must report. In addition, proposed Rule 907(a)(4) would have required a
registered SDR to establish policies and procedures for reporting and publicly
disseminating life cycle events, among other things. The Commission is consolidating
the requirements to establish policies and procedures for reporting life cycle events in
final Rule 907(a)(3). See infra Section XII(C). The Commission also revised Rule
907(a)(1) so that the final rule text refers to the data elements “that must be reported,”
rather than the data elements that a reporting side must report.

119

while minimizing the reporting burden on its participants. 259 One commenter supported this
approach, stating that “[a] registered SDR should have the flexibility to specify acceptable
formats, connectivity requirements and other protocols for submitting information.” 260 The
commenter added that “[m]arket practice, including the structure of confirmation messages and
detail of economic fields, evolve over time, and the SDR should have the capability to adopt and
set new formats.” 261 The Commission anticipates that feedback and ongoing input from
participants will help registered SDRs to craft appropriate policies and procedures regarding data
elements and reporting protocols.
The same commenter, in a subsequent comment letter, expressed concern that market
participants could adopt different interpretations of the requirement to report payment stream
information, which could result in inconsistent reporting to registered SDRs. 262 The
Commission notes that final Rule 907(a)(1) requires a registered SDR to enumerate the specific
data elements of a security-based swap that must be reported, and final 907(a)(2) requires a
registered SDR, among other things, to specify acceptable data formats for submitting required
information. Because Rules 907(a)(1) and 907(a)(2) provide a registered SDR with the authority
to identify the specific data elements that must be reported with respect to the payment streams
of a security-based swap and the format for reporting that information, the Commission does not

259

While an SDR would have flexibility regarding the data elements and the protocols for
reporting to the SDR, pursuant to Rule 13n-4(a)(5), which is being adopted in the SDR
Adopting Release, the data provided by an SDR to the Commission must “be in a form
and manner acceptable to the Commission . . . .” The Commission anticipates that it will
specify the form and manner that will be acceptable to it for the purposes of direct
electronic access.

120

believe that market participants will have flexibility to adopt inconsistent interpretations of the
information required to be reported with respect to payment streams. Instead, persons with the
duty to report transactions will be required to provide the payment stream information using the
specific data elements and formats specified by the registered SDR.
One commenter argued that a uniform electronic reporting format is essential, and was
concerned that Rules 901(h) and 907(a)(2) would permit multiple formats and connectivity
requirements for the submission of data to a registered SDR. 263 The Commission considered the
alternative of requiring a single reporting language or protocol for conveying information to
registered SDRs, and three commenters encouraged the use of the FpML standard. 264 While
FpML could be a standard deemed acceptable by a registered SDR pursuant to Rule 907(a)(2),
the Commission does not believe that it is necessary or appropriate at this time for the
Commission itself to require FpML as the only permissible standard by which reporting sides
report transaction data to a registered SDR. 265 The Commission is concerned that adopting a
regulatory requirement for a single standard for reporting security-based swap transaction
information to registered SDRs could result in unforeseen adverse consequences, particularly if
that standard proves incapable of being used to carry information about all of the material data
elements of all security-based swaps, both those that exist now and those that might be created in
the future. Thus, the Commission has adopted an approach that permits registered SDRs to
select their own standards for how participants must report data to those SDRs. The Commission
agrees with the commenter who recommended that all acceptable data formats should be open-

121

source structured data formats. 266 The Commission believes that any reporting languages or
protocols adopted by registered SDRs must be open-source structured data formats that are
widely used by participants, and that information about how to use any such language or protocol
is freely and openly available. 267
The Commission believes that, however registered SDRs permit their participants to
report security-based swap transaction data to the SDRs, those SDRs should be able to provide to
the Commission normalized and uniform data, so that the transaction data can readily be used for
regulatory purposes without the Commission itself having to cleanse or normalize the data. 268

266

See Barnard Letter at 3.

267

One commenter argued that the Commission should not require registered SDRs to
support all connectivity methods, as the costs to do so would be prohibitive. See DTCC
II at 20. Under Rule 907(a)(2), as adopted, a registered SDR need not support all
connectivity methods or data formats. A registered SDR may elect to support only one
data format, provided that it is “an open-source structured data format that is widely used
by participants.”

268

See SDR Adopting Release, Section VI(D)(2)(c)(ii) (“data provided by an SDR to the
Commission must be in a form and manner acceptable to the Commission … [T]he form
and manner with which an SDR provides the data to the Commission should not only
permit the Commission to accurately analyze the data maintained by a single SDR, but
also allow the Commission to aggregate and analyze data received from multiple
SDRs. The Commission continues to consider whether it should require the data to be
provided to the Commission in a particular format. The Commission anticipates that it
will propose for public comment detailed specifications of acceptable formats and
taxonomies that would facilitate an accurate interpretation, aggregation, and analysis of
[security-based swap] data by the Commission. The Commission intends to maximize
the use of any applicable current industry standards for the description of [security-based
swap] data, build upon such standards to accommodate any additional data fields as may
be required, and develop such formats and taxonomies in a timeframe consistent with the
implementation of [security-based swap] data reporting by SDRs. The Commission
recognizes that as the [security-based swap] market develops, new or different data fields
may be needed to accurately represent new types of [security-based swaps], in which case
the Commission may provide updated specifications of formats and taxonomies to reflect
these new developments. Until such time as the Commission adopts specific formats and
taxonomies, SDRs may provide direct electronic access to the Commission to data in the
form in which the SDRs maintain such data”).

122

However, it does not follow that information must be submitted to a registered SDR using a
single electronic reporting format. The Commission believes that a registered SDR should be
permitted to make multiple reporting formats available to its participants if it chooses, provided
that the registered SDR can quickly and easily normalize and aggregate the reported data in
making it accessible to the Commission and other relevant authorities. If a registered SDR is not
willing or able to normalize data submitted pursuant to multiple data formats, then its policies
and procedures under Rule 907(a)(2) should prescribe a single data format for participants to use
to submit data to the registered SDR.
The Commission believes that the policies and procedures of a registered SDR, required
by Rule 907(a)(1), likely will need to explain the method for reporting if all the security-based
swap transaction data required by Rules 901(c) and 901(d) are being reported simultaneously,
and how to report if responsive data are being provided at separate times. 269 One way to
accomplish this would be for the registered SDR to link the two reports by the transaction ID,
which could be done by providing the reporting side with the transaction ID after the reporting
side reports the information required by Rule 901(c). The reporting side would then include the
transaction ID with its submission of data required by Rule 901(d), thereby allowing the

269

Regulation SBSR, as proposed and re-proposed, contemplated two “waves” of reporting:
the Rule 901(c) information would have been required to be reported in real time, while
the Rule 901(d) information could have been provided later (depending on the type of
transaction, perhaps as much as one day after time of execution). However, because
Regulation SBSR, as adopted, requires both sets of information to be reported within 24
hours of execution, the Commission anticipates that many reporting sides will choose to
report both sets of information in only a single transaction report. Under Rule 901, as
adopted, a reporting side is not prohibited from reporting the Rule 901(c) information
before the Rule 901(d) information, provided that the policies and procedures of the
registered SDR permit this outcome, and both sets of information are reported within the
timeframes specified in Rule 901(j).

123

registered SDR to match the report of the Rule 901(c) data and the subsequent report of the Rule
901(d) data.
Finally, Rule 901(h), as re-proposed, would have provided: “A reporting side shall
electronically transmit the information required under this section in a format required by the
registered security-based swap data repository, and in accordance with any applicable policies
and procedures of the registered security-based swap data repository.” The Commission
received only one comment on Rule 901(h), which is addressed above. 270 The Commission is
adopting Rule 901(h) as re-proposed, with two minor revisions to clarify the rule. First, the rule
text has been revised to refer to “A” reporting side instead of “The” reporting side. Accordingly,
the Commission has revised Rule 901(h) to refer to the registered SDR to which a reporting side
reports transactions. Second, Rule 901(h), as adopted, does not include the phrase “and in
accordance with any applicable policies and procedures of the registered security-based swap
data repository.” The Commission believes that it is sufficient for the rule to state that the
reporting side must report the transaction information “in a format required by” the registered
SDR. 271
C.

Rule 907(a)(6)—Ultimate Parent IDs and Counterparty IDs

As originally proposed, Rule 907(a)(6) would have required a registered SDR to establish
and maintain written policies and procedures “[f]or periodically obtaining from each participant
information that identifies the participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any other participant(s) with
which the counterparty is affiliated, using ultimate parent IDs and participant IDs” (emphasis
270

See supra note 263 and accompanying text.

271

As noted above, the Commission anticipates that it will propose for public comment
detailed specifications of acceptable formats and taxonomies that would facilitate an
accurate interpretation, aggregation, and analysis by the Commission of security-based
swap data submitted to it by an SDR. See supra note 268.

124

added). The Commission re-proposed Rule 907(a)(6) with the word “participant” in place of the
word “counterparty.” Re-proposed Rule 907(a)(6) would have required a registered SDR to
establish and maintain written policies and procedures for periodically obtaining from each
participant information that identifies the participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any other
participant(s) with which the counterparty is affiliated, using ultimate parent IDs and participant
IDs. The Commission received one comment relating to Rule 907(a)(6), which suggested that
parent and affiliate information could be maintained by a market utility rather than by one or
more registered SDRs 272
The Commission notes that Regulation SBSR neither requires nor prohibits the
development of a market utility for parent and affiliate information. Regulation SBSR requires a
registered SDR to obtain parent and affiliate information from its participants and to maintain it,
whether or not a market utility exists. Regulation SBSR does not prohibit SDR participants from
storing parent and affiliate information in a market utility or from having the market utility report
such information to a registered SDR as agent on their behalf, so long as the information is
provided to the registered SDR in a manner consistent with Regulation SBSR and the registered
SDR’s policies and procedures.
The Commission is adopting Rule 907(a)(6) substantially as re-proposed, with a technical
change to replace the word “counterparty” with the word “participant” and a conforming change
to replace the reference to “participant IDs” with a reference to “counterparty IDs.” Thus, final
Rule 907(a)(6) requires a registered SDR to establish and maintain written policies and
procedures “[f]or periodically obtaining from each participant information that identifies the

272

125

participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any participant(s) with which the participant is affiliated,
using ultimate parent IDs and counterparty IDs” (emphasis added).
V.

Who Reports—Rule 901(a)
A.

Proposed and Re-proposed Rule 901(a)

Section 13(m)(1)(F) of the Exchange Act 273 provides that parties to a security-based swap
(including agents of parties to a security-based swap) shall be responsible for reporting securitybased swap transaction information to the appropriate registered entity in a timely manner as
may be prescribed by the Commission. Section 13(m)(1)(G) of the Exchange Act 274 provides
that each security-based swap, “whether cleared or uncleared,” shall be reported to a registered
SDR. Section 13A(a)(3) of the Exchange Act 275 specifies the party obligated to report a
security-based swap that is not accepted for clearing by any clearing agency or derivatives
clearing organization. Rule 901(a), as adopted, assigns to specific persons the duty to report
certain security-based swaps to a registered SDR, thereby implementing Sections 13(m)(1)(F),
13(m)(1)(G), and 13A(a)(3) of the Exchange Act. In addition, in the Regulation SBSR Proposed
Amendments Release, the Commission is proposing revisions to Rule 901(a), as adopted, to
further implement these provisions of the Exchange Act as they apply to clearing transactions (as
defined below) and transactions executed on platforms and that will be submitted to clearing.
As originally proposed, Rule 901(a) would have assigned reporting duties exclusively to
one of the direct counterparties to a security-based swap based on the nationality of the
counterparties. The original proposal contemplated three scenarios: both direct counterparties

are U.S. persons, only one direct counterparty is a U.S. person, or neither direct counterparty is a
U.S. person. 276 Under the original proposal, if only one counterparty to a security-based swap is
a U.S. person, the U.S. person would have been the reporting party. If neither counterparty is a
U.S. person (and assuming the security-based swap is subject to Regulation SBSR), the
counterparties would have been required to select the reporting party. Where both counterparties
to a security-based swap are U.S. persons, the reporting party would have been determined
according to the following hierarchy:
(i) If only one counterparty is a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap
participant, the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant would be the
reporting party.
(ii) If one counterparty is a security-based swap dealer and the other counterparty is a
major security-based swap participant, the security-based swap dealer would be the reporting
party.
(iii) With respect to any other security-based swap, the counterparties to the securitybased swap would be required to select the reporting party.
Under Rule 901(a) as originally proposed, for a security-based swap between: (1) a nonregistered U.S. person; and (2) a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap
participant that is a non-U.S. person, the non-registered U.S. person would have been the
reporting party. The Commission preliminarily believed that, as between a U.S. person and a
non-U.S. person, it was more appropriate to assign the duty to report to the U.S. person, even if
the non-U.S. person was a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap

participant. 277
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission revised proposed Rule 901(a) in
two significant ways. First, the Commission proposed to expand the scope of Regulation SBSR
to require reporting (and, in certain cases, public dissemination) of any security-based swap that
has a U.S. person acting as guarantor of one of the direct counterparties, even if neither direct
counterparty is a U.S. person. To effectuate this requirement, the Cross-Border Proposing
Release added the following new defined terms: “direct counterparty,” “indirect counterparty,”
“side,” and “reporting side.” A “side” was defined to mean a direct counterparty of a securitybased swap and any indirect counterparty that guarantees the direct counterparty’s performance
of any obligation under the security-based swap. 278 The Commission revised proposed Rule
901(a) to assign the duty to report to a “reporting side,” rather than a specific counterparty. Reproposed Rule 901(a) generally preserved the reporting hierarchy of Rule 901(a), as originally
proposed, while incorporating the “side” concept to reflect the possibility that a security-based
swap might have an indirect counterparty that is better suited for carrying out the reporting duty
than a direct counterparty. Thus, Rule 901(a), as re-proposed in the Cross-Border Proposing
277

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75211.

278

See re-proposed Rule 900(ee); Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31211. The
Commission is adopting this term in Rule 900(hh) with a minor modification to more
clearly incorporate the definition of “indirect counterparty.” Final 900(hh) defines “side”
to mean “a direct counterparty and any guarantor of that direct counterparty’s
performance who meets the definition of indirect counterparty in connection with the
security-based swap.” Final Rule 900(p) defines “indirect counterparty” to mean “a
guarantor of a direct counterparty’s performance of any obligation under a security-based
swap such that the direct counterparty on the other side can exercise rights of recourse
against the indirect counterparty in connection with the security-based swap; for these
purposes a direct counterparty has rights of recourse against a guarantor on the other side
if the direct counterparty has a conditional or unconditional legally enforceable right, in
whole or in part, to receive payments from, or otherwise collect from, the guarantor in
connection with the security-based swap.”

Release, would have assigned the reporting obligation based on the status of each person on a
side (i.e., whether any person on the side is a security-based swap dealer or major security-based
swap participant), rather than the status of only the direct counterparties. Second, the
Commission proposed to expand the circumstances in which a security-based swap dealer or
major security-based swap participant that is not a U.S. person would incur the duty to report a
security-based swap.
Under Rule 901(a), as originally proposed, a non-U.S. person that is a direct counterparty
to a security-based swap that was not executed in the United States or through any means of
interstate commerce never would have had a duty to report the security-based swap, even if the
non-U.S. person was a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant or
was guaranteed by a U.S. person. As re-proposed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, Rule
901(a) re-focused the reporting duty primarily on the status of the counterparties, rather than on
their nationality or place of domicile. Under re-proposed Rule 901(a), the nationality of the
counterparties would determine who must report only if neither side included a security-based
swap dealer or major security-based swap participant. In such case, if one side included a U.S.
person while the other side did not, the side with the U.S. person would have been the reporting
side. Similar to the original proposal, however, if both sides included a U.S. person or neither
side included a U.S. person, the sides would have been required to select the reporting side.
B.

Final Rule 901(a)

Rule 901(a), as adopted, establishes a “reporting hierarchy” that specifies the side that
has the duty to report a security-based swap. 279 The reporting side, as determined by the

279

However, Rule 901(a) does not address who has the reporting duty for the following
types of security-based swaps: (1) a clearing transaction; (2) a security-based swap that
129

reporting hierarchy, is required to submit the information required by Regulation SBSR to a
registered SDR. 280 The reporting side may select the registered SDR to which it makes the
required report. However, with respect to any particular transaction, all information required to
be reported by Rule 901(a)(2)(ii), as adopted, must be reported to the same registered SDR. In
the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, issued as a separate release, the
Commission is proposing additional provisions of Rule 901(a) that would assign reporting
responsibilities for clearing transactions and platform-executed security-based swaps that will be
submitted to clearing. The Commission also anticipates soliciting further comment on reporting
duties for a security-based swap where neither side includes a registered security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant and neither side includes a U.S. person or only
one side includes a U.S. person. 281

Reporting Hierarchy

is executed on a platform and that will be submitted to clearing; (3) a security-based swap
where neither side includes a registered security-based swap dealer, a registered major
security-based swap participant, or a U.S. person; and (4) a security-based swap where
one side consists of a non-registered U.S. person and the other side consists of a nonregistered non-U.S. person.
280

Final Rule 900(gg) defines “reporting side” to mean “the side of a security-based swap
identified by § 242.901(a)(2).” Rule 900(cc), as re-proposed, would have defined
“reporting side” to mean “the side of a security-based swap having the duty to report
information in accordance with §§ 242.900 through 911 to a registered security-based
swap data repository, or, if there is no registered security-based swap data repository that
would receive the information, to the Commission.” Final Rule 900(gg) modifies the
definition to define the reporting side by reference to final Rule 901(a), which identifies
the person that will be obligated to report a security-based swap to a registered SDR
under various circumstances.

281

The Commission notes that Rule 901(a), as adopted, does address how the reporting duty
is assigned when both sides include a U.S. person and neither side includes a registered
security-based swap dealer or a registered major security-based swap participant. In that
case, the sides would be required to select which is the reporting side. See Rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(1).

130

Final Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) adopts the reporting hierarchy largely as proposed in the CrossBorder Proposing Release, but limits its scope. The reporting hierarchy in Rule 901(a), as
proposed and as re-proposed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, did not contain separate
provisions to address reporting responsibilities for two kinds of security-based swaps that are
described in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release: clearing transactions and
security-based swaps that are executed on a platform and that will be submitted to clearing. The
Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release solicits comment on proposed rules that
address the reporting of these types of security-based swaps. The reporting hierarchy in Rule
901(a)(2)(ii), as adopted, applies to security-based swaps that are covered transactions. 282 The
reporting hierarchy is designed to locate the duty to report with counterparties who are most
likely to have the resources and who are best able to support the reporting function.
Specifically, final Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) provides that, for a covered transaction, the reporting
side will be as follows:
(A) If both sides of the security-based swap include a registered security-based swap
dealer, the sides shall select the reporting side.
(B) If only one side of the security-based swap includes a registered security-based swap
dealer, that side shall be the reporting side.
(C) If both sides of the security-based swap include a registered major security-based
swap participant, the sides shall select the reporting side.
(D) If one side of the security-based swap includes a registered major security-based
swap participant and the other side includes neither a registered security-based swap dealer nor a

282

See supra notes 11-12 and accompanying text.

131

registered major security-based swap participant, the side including the registered major securitybased swap participant shall be the reporting side.
(E) If neither side of the security-based swap includes a registered security-based swap
dealer or registered major security-based swap participant: (1) If both sides include a U.S.
person, the sides shall select the reporting side. (2) [Reserved]. 283
The following examples explain the operation of final Rule 901(a)(2)(ii). For each
example, assume that the relevant security-based swap is not executed on a platform.
•

Example 1. A non-registered U.S. person executes a security-based swap with a
registered security-based swap dealer that is a non-U.S. person. Neither side has a

283

This provision, as set forth in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, would have provided:
“If neither side of the security-based swap includes a security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant: (i) If both sides include a U.S. person or neither side
includes a U.S. person, the sides shall select the reporting side. (ii) If only one side
includes a U.S. person, that side shall be the reporting side.” The Commission anticipates
seeking further comment on how Title VII should apply to non-U.S. persons who engage
in certain security-based swap activities in the United States, particularly dealing
activities. Accordingly, the Commission is not deciding at this time how Regulation
SBSR will apply to (1) transactions where there is no U.S. person, registered securitybased swap dealer, or registered major security-based swap participant on either side; and
(2) transactions where there is no registered security-based swap dealer or registered
major security-based swap participant on either side and there is a U.S. person on only
one side. One commenter recommended that this proposed part of the hierarchy be
revised to refer only to cases where both sides are U.S. persons, as the commenter did not
believe that a security-based swap for which neither party is a security-based swap dealer,
major security-based swap participant, or a U.S. person would be subject to reporting
under Regulation SBSR. See ISDA IV at 19. As discussed, the Commission is not
adopting this provision of proposed Rule 901(a). The Commission anticipates seeking
further comment on how Title VII should apply to non-U.S. persons who engage in
certain security-based swap activities in the United States, particularly dealing activities,
and is not deciding at this time how Regulation SBSR will apply to transactions where
there is no U.S. person, registered security-based swap dealer, or registered major
security-based swap participant on either side. The Commission notes that, under final
Rule 908(a)(1)(ii), a security-based swap is subject to regulatory reporting and public
dissemination if it was accepted for clearing by a clearing agency having its principal
place of business in the United States. See infra Section XV(C)(4).

132

guarantor. The registered security-based swap dealer is the reporting side.
•

Example 2. Same facts as Example 1, except that the non-registered U.S. person
is guaranteed by a registered security-based swap dealer. Because both sides
include a person that is a registered security-based swap dealer, the sides must
select which is the reporting side.

•

Example 3. Two private funds execute a security-based swap. Both direct
counterparties are U.S. persons, neither is guaranteed, and neither is a registered
security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant.
The sides must select which is the reporting side.

In Rule 901(a)(2)(ii), as adopted, the Commission has included the word “registered”
before each instance of the terms “security-based swap dealer” and “major security-based swap
participant.” A person is a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant
if that person meets the statutory definition of that term, regardless of whether the person
registers with the Commission. 284 A person meeting one of those statutory definitions must
register with the Commission in that capacity. However, persons meeting one of the statutory
definitions cannot register in the appropriate capacity until the Commission adopts registration
rules for these classes of market participant. The Commission has proposed but not yet adopted
registration rules for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants.

284

See Section 3(a)(71) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(71) (defining “security-based
swap dealer”); Section 3(a)(67) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(67) (defining
“major security-based swap participant”). See also 17 CFR 240.3a71-2 (describing the
time at which a person will be deemed to be a security-based swap dealer); 17 CFR
240.3a67-8 (describing the time at which a person will be deemed to be a major securitybased swap participant).

133

Thus, currently, there are no registered security-based swap dealers even though many market
participants act in a dealing capacity in the security-based swap market.
Including the word “registered” before each instance of the terms “security-based swap
dealer” and “major security-based swap participant” in final Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) means that it will
not be necessary for a person to evaluate whether it meets the definition of “security-based swap
dealer” or “major security-based swap participant” solely in connection with identifying which
counterparty must report a security-based swap under Regulation SBSR. 285
A result of the Commission’s determination to apply duties in Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) based on
registration status rather than on meeting the statutory definition of “security-based swap dealer”
or “major security-based swap participant” is that, until such persons register with the
Commission as such, all covered transactions will fall within Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E). In other
words, under the adopted reporting hierarchy, because neither side of the security-based swap
includes a registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap
participant, the sides shall select the reporting side.
2.

Other Security-Based Swaps

Rule 901(a), as proposed and re-proposed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, did not
differentiate between platform-executed security-based swaps and other types of security-based
swaps in assigning the duty to report. Similarly, the proposed and re-proposed rule would have

285

As the Commission noted in the Cross-Border Adopting Release, the assessment costs for
making such evaluations are likely to be substantial. See Cross-Border Adopting
Release, 79 FR 47330-34. The Commission’s approach here is consistent with the
approach described in the Cross-Border Adopting Release, where the Commission noted
that security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants “will not be
subject to the requirements applicable to those dealers and major participants until the
dates provided in the applicable final rules.” 79 FR at 47368. See also Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30700.

134

assigned reporting obligations without regard to whether a particular security-based swap was
cleared or uncleared. 286 In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission expressed
a preliminary view that cleared and uncleared security-based swaps should be subject to the same
reporting procedures. 287 The Commission preliminarily believed that security-based swap
dealers and major security-based swap participants generally should be responsible for reporting
security-based swap transactions of all types, because they are more likely than other
counterparties to have appropriate systems in place to facilitate reporting. 288
Commenters raised a number of concerns about the application of the reporting hierarchy
to platform-executed security-based swaps that will be submitted to clearing and clearing
transactions. 289 The Commission has determined that final resolution of these issues would
benefit from further consideration and public comment. Accordingly, in the Regulation SBSR
Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission is proposing amendments to Rule 901(a) that
would assign the reporting obligation for clearing transactions and platform-executed securitybased swaps that will be submitted to clearing.
To differentiate between security-based swaps that are subject to the reporting hierarchy
in Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) and those that are not, the Commission is defining a new term, “clearing
transaction,” in Rule 900(g). A “clearing transaction” is “a security-based swap that has a

registered clearing agency as a direct counterparty.” 290 This definition encompasses all securitybased swaps that a registered clearing agency enters into as part of its security-based swap
clearing business. The definition includes, for example, any security-based swaps that arise if a
registered clearing agency accepts a security-based swap for clearing, as well as any securitybased swaps that arise as part of a clearing agency’s internal processes, such as security-based
swaps used to establish prices for cleared products and security-based swaps that result from
netting other clearing transactions of the same product in the same account into an open
position. 291
Two models of clearing—an agency model and a principal model—are currently used in
the swap markets. In the agency model, which predominates in the U.S. swap market, a swap
that is accepted for clearing—often referred to in the industry as an “alpha”—is terminated and
replaced with two new swaps, known as “beta” and “gamma.” The Commission understands
that, under the agency model, one of the direct counterparties to the alpha becomes a direct
counterparty to the beta, and the other direct counterparty to the alpha becomes a direct
counterparty to the gamma. The clearing agency would be a direct counterparty to each of the
290

In connection with the definition of “clearing transaction,” the Commission is adopting a
definition of “registered clearing agency.” Final Rule 900(ee) defines “registered
clearing agency” to mean “a person that is registered with the Commission as a clearing
agency pursuant to section 17A of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78q-1) and any rules or
regulations thereunder.” In addition, the Commission is not adopting re-proposed Rule
900(h), which would have defined the term “derivatives clearing organization” to have
the same meaning as provided under the Commodity Exchange Act. This term is not
used in Regulation SBSR, as adopted, so the Commission is not including a definition of
the term in Rule 900.

291

Under Rule 900(g), a security-based swap that results from clearing is an independent
security-based swap and not a life cycle event of a security-based swap that is submitted
to clearing. Thus, Rule 901(e), which addresses the reporting of life cycle events, does
not address what person has the duty to report the clearing transactions that arise when a
security-based swap is accepted for clearing.

136

beta and the gamma. 292 This release uses the terms “alpha,” “beta,” and “gamma” in the same
way that they are used in the agency model of clearing in the U.S. swap market. 293 The
Commission notes that, under Regulation SBSR, an alpha is not a “clearing transaction,” even
though it is submitted for clearing, because it does not have a registered clearing agency as a
direct counterparty. 294
292

If both direct counterparties to the alpha are clearing members, the direct counterparties
would submit the transaction to the clearing agency directly and the resulting beta would
be between the clearing agency and one clearing member, and the gamma would be
between the clearing agency and the other clearing member. The Commission
understands, however, that, if the direct counterparties to the alpha are a clearing member
and a non-clearing member (a “customer”), the customer’s side of the trade would be
submitted for clearing by a clearing member acting on behalf of the customer. When the
clearing agency accepts the alpha for clearing, one of the resulting swaps—in this case,
assume the beta—would be between the clearing agency and the customer, with the
customer’s clearing member acting as guarantor for the customer’s trade. The other
resulting swap—the gamma—would be between the clearing agency and the clearing
member that was a direct counterparty to the alpha. See, e.g., Byungkwon Lim and
Aaron J. Levy, “Contractual Framework for Cleared Derivatives: The Master Netting
Agreement Between a Clearing Customer Bank and a Central Counterparty,” 10 Pratt’s
Journal of Bankruptcy Law (October 2014) 509, 515-17 (describing the clearing model
for swaps in the United States).

293

In the principal model of clearing, which the Commission understands is used in certain
foreign swap markets, a customer is not a direct counterparty of the clearing agency.
Under this model, a clearing member would clear a security-based swap for a customer
by entering into a back-to-back swap with the clearing agency: the clearing member
would become a direct counterparty to a swap with the customer, and then would become
a counterparty to an offsetting swap with the clearing agency. In this circumstance,
unlike in the agency model of clearing, the swap between the direct counterparties might
not terminate upon acceptance for clearing.

294

This release does not address the application of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933,
15 U.S.C. 77a et seq. (“Securities Act”), to security-based swap transactions that are
intended to be submitted to clearing (e.g., alpha transactions, in the agency model of
clearing). Rule 239 under the Securities Act, 17 CFR 230.239, provides an exemption for
certain security-based swap transactions involving an eligible clearing agency from all
provisions of the Securities Act, other than the Section 17(a) anti-fraud provisions. This
exemption does not apply to security-based swap transactions not involving an eligible
clearing agency, including a transaction that is intended to be submitted to clearing,
regardless of whether the security-based swaps subsequently are cleared by an eligible
clearing agency. See Exemptions for Security-Based Swaps Issued By Certain Clearing
137

Discussion of Comments and Basis for Final Rule

The Commission requested and received comment on a wide range of issues related to
Rule 901(a), as proposed and re-proposed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release. As described
in more detail below, commenters addressed a number of topics, including the application of
Rule 901(a) to sides rather than direct counterparties, the role of agents in the reporting process,
the application of Rule 901(a) to cleared security-based swaps, and the types of entities that
should be required to report security-based swaps.
1.

Application of the Reporting Hierarchy to Sides

The Commission received a number of comments on the reporting hierarchy in proposed
Rule 901(a). 295 As described in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, a number of commenters
objected to the reporting hierarchy in Rule 901(a), as originally proposed, on the grounds that it
would unfairly impose reporting burdens on non-registered U.S.-person counterparties that enter
into security-based swaps with non-U.S.-person security-based swap dealers or major securitybased swap participants. 296 In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission reproposed a modified reporting hierarchy in response to the commenters’ concerns. 297

Agencies, Securities Act Release No. 33-9308 (March 30, 2012), 77 FR 20536 (April 5,
2012).

See ISDA/SIFMA I at 19; DTCC II at 8; ICI I at 5 (stating that security-based swap
dealers are the only market participants that currently have the standardization necessary
to report the required security-based swap data); SIFMA I at 3 (arguing that an end user
should not incur higher transaction costs or potential legal liabilities depending on the
domicile of its counterparty); Vanguard Letter at 6 (stating that non-U.S. person securitybased swap dealers and major security-based swap participants would be more likely to
have appropriate systems in place to facilitate reporting than unregistered counterparties).

(describing the relevant comments).

See re-proposed Rule 901(a); Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31066, 31212.

138

The Commission believes that a non-registered person should not incur the duty to report
a security-based swap when a registered security-based swap dealer or registered major securitybased swap participant, directly or indirectly, is on the other side of the transaction, and is
adopting the reporting hierarchy in Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) to effect this result. Rule 901(a), as
adopted, is designed to assign reporting duties to the person best positioned to discharge those
duties. The Commission believes that registered security-based swap dealers and registered
major security-based swap participants, regardless of whether they are U.S. persons, will have
greater technological capability than non-registered persons to report security-based swaps as
required by Regulation SBSR. Accordingly, the Commission is adopting the reporting hierarchy
in Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) largely as re-proposed to give registered security-based swap dealers and
registered major security-based swap participants reporting obligations, regardless of whether
they are U.S. persons. Furthermore, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to assign the
duty to report to the side that includes a non-U.S. person registered security-based swap dealer or
major security-based swap participant, even as an indirect counterparty, if neither the direct or
indirect counterparty on the other side includes a registered security-based swap dealer or a
registered major security-based swap participant. The fact that a person is a registered securitybased swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant implies that the person has
substantial contacts with the U.S. security-based swap market and thus would understand that it
could incur significant regulatory duties arising from its security-based swap business, or has
voluntarily registered and chosen to undertake the burdens associated with such registration. The
fact that a person is a registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based
swap participant also implies that the person has devoted substantial infrastructure and

139

administrative resources to its security-based swap business, and thus would be more likely to
have the capability to carry out the reporting function than a non-registered counterparty.
In response to the Cross-Border Proposing Release, one commenter raised concerns about
burdens that the re-proposed reporting hierarchy might place on U.S. persons. 298 This
commenter noted that certain non-U.S. persons might engage in security-based swap dealing
activities in the United States below the de minimis threshold for security-based swap dealer
registration. The commenter expressed the view that an unregistered non-U.S. person that is
acting in a dealing capacity likely would have “greater technological capability and resources
available to fulfill the reporting function” than an unregistered U.S. person that is not acting in a
dealing capacity. 299 The commenter suggested that, when an unregistered U.S. person enters
into a security-based swap with an unregistered non-U.S. person that is acting in a dealing
capacity, it “would be more efficient and fair” to allow the counterparties to choose the reporting
side than to assign the reporting obligation to the unregistered U.S. person. 300
The Commission acknowledges these comments. The Commission did not propose, and
is not adopting, rules that would permit counterparties to choose to impose reporting burdens on
the unregistered non-U.S. person that is acting in a dealing capacity in this scenario. The
Commission believes that the issue of whether the counterparties should be able to choose the
reporting side when an unregistered non-U.S. person acts in a dealing capacity with respect to a
security-based swap involving an unregistered U.S. person would benefit from further comment.

298

See IIB Letter at 26.

140

Accordingly, Rule 901(a)(2)(ii), as adopted, does not assign a reporting side for security-based
swaps involving an unregistered non-U.S. person and an unregistered U.S. person.
Other commenters focused on the Commission’s proposal to introduce the “side” concept
to the reporting hierarchy. In response to the Cross-Border Proposing Release, three comments
recommended that direct counterparties bear reporting duties, rather than sides (i.e., that
guarantors of direct counterparties not incur reporting responsibilities). 301 One of these
commenters recommended that a non-U.S. company that provides its U.S. affiliate with a
guarantee should not be subject to reporting responsibilities because the non-U.S. company
would be outside the Commission’s jurisdiction.302 Another commenter noted that non-U.S.
guarantors should not cause a security-based swap to become reportable. 303 The Commission
generally agrees with these comments. As discussed in more detail in Section XV(C)(5), infra,
Rule 908(a) of Regulation SBSR makes clear that a non-U.S. person guarantor would not cause a
security-based swap to become reportable, unless the guarantor is a registered security-based
swap dealer or a registered major security-based swap participant. 304 Moreover, Rule 908(b)
provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of Regulation SBSR, a non-U.S. person
guarantor of a security-based swap that is reportable would not incur any obligation under
Regulation SBSR, including a reporting obligation under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii), unless the guarantor
is a registered security-based swap dealer or a registered major security-based swap participant.
301

See JSDA Letter at 6; ISDA III; ISDA IV at 3-4.

302

See JSDA Letter at 6.

303

See ISDA IV at 4 (recommending that the Commission should not include non-U.S.
person guarantors in the definition of “indirect counterparty”).

304

Section XV(C)(5), infra, explains why the Commission has determined that securitybased swaps having non-U.S. person guarantors that are registered as security-based
swap dealers or major security-based swap participants should be reportable under
Regulation SBSR.

141

Thus, for a security-based swap involving, on one side, the guaranteed U.S. affiliate of an
unregistered non-U.S. person, only the guaranteed U.S. affiliate could incur reporting obligations
under Regulation SBSR. 305
The Commission disagrees with the broader point made by the commenters, however,
and continues to believe that it is appropriate to adopt a final rule that places the reporting duty
on the reporting side, rather than on a specific counterparty on the reporting side. The
Commission notes that Rule 908(b)—which is discussed in more detail in Section XV, infra—
limits the types of counterparties that incur obligations under Regulation SBSR to U.S. persons,
registered security-based swap dealers, and registered major security-based swap participants. A
person that does not fall within one of the categories enumerated in Rule 908(b) incurs no duties
under Regulation SBSR. Accordingly, there may be situations where the direct counterparty on
the reporting side—rather than the indirect counterparty, as in the commenter’s example—would
not fall within Rule 908(b) and therefore would incur no obligation under Regulation SBSR. 306
There will be cases where all counterparties on the reporting side fall within Rule 908(b). In
these cases, Rule 901(a)(2)(ii), as adopted, provides reasonable flexibility to the counterparties
on the reporting side to determine the specific person who will carry out the function of reporting
the security-based swap on behalf of the reporting side. As stated in the Cross-Border Proposing
Release, the Commission “understands that many reporting parties already have established
linkages to entities that may register as registered SDRs, which could significantly reduce the

If the non-U.S. person guarantor is a registered security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant, the exclusion in Rule 908(b) would not apply, and both
the direct and indirect counterparties would jointly incur the duty to report.

out-of-pocket costs associated with establishing the reporting function.” 307 A reporting side
could leverage these existing linkages, even if the entity that has established connectivity to the
registered SDR is an indirect counterparty to the transaction.
The other commenters argued that incorporating indirect counterparties into current
reporting practices could take considerable effort, because these practices, developed for use
with the CFTC’s swap data reporting regime, do not consider the registration status of indirect
counterparties. 308 The commenter recommended that the industry should be permitted to use
existing reporting party determination logic because negotiating the identity of the reporting side
on a trade-by-trade basis would not be feasible. 309 Furthermore, one commenter noted that there
is no industry standard source for information about indirect counterparties. As a result, “despite
the requirement for participants to [provide] this information to [a registered SDR], there is a
chance that the parties…could come up with a different answer as to which of them is associated
with an indirect counterparty.” 310
The Commission acknowledges these commenters’ concerns, but continues to believe
that it is appropriate for the reporting hierarchy to take into account both the direct and indirect
counterparties on each side. Even without an industry standard source for information about
indirect counterparties, counterparties to security-based swaps will need to know the identity and
status of any indirect counterparties on a trade-by-trade basis to determine whether the

transaction is subject to Regulation SBSR under final Rule 908(a). 311 By considering the status
of indirect counterparties when assigning reporting obligations, Regulation SBSR is designed to
reduce reporting burdens on non-registered persons without imposing significant new costs on
other market participants, even though market participants may need to modify their reporting
workflows. The Commission believes that market participants could adapt the mechanisms they
develop for purposes of adhering to Rule 908(a) to facilitate compliance with the reporting
hierarchy in Rule 901(a)(2)(ii). For example, the documentation for the relevant security-based
swap could alert both direct counterparties to the fact that one counterparty’s obligations under
the security-based swap are guaranteed by a registered security-based swap dealer or registered
major security-based swap participant. The counterparties can use that information to identify
which side would be the reporting side for purposes of Regulation SBSR.
The Commission further believes that incorporating indirect counterparties into current
reporting workflows is unlikely to cause substantial disruption to existing reporting logic because
the status of an indirect counterparty likely will alter reporting practices in few situations. Most
transactions in the security-based swap market today involve at least one direct counterparty who
is likely to be a security-based swap dealer. 312 In such case, the current industry practice of
determining the reporting side based only on the status of direct counterparties is likely to
produce a result that is consistent with Rule 901. 313 The Commission understands that, in the
311

See infra Section XV.

312

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47293 (noting that transactions between
two ISDA-recognized dealers represent the bulk of trading activity in the single-name
credit default swap market).

313

Assume, for example, that a security-based swap dealer executes a transaction with a
non-registered person, and that current industry practices default the reporting obligation
to the security-based swap dealer. This result is consistent with Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(B),
which states that the side including the registered security-based swap dealer will be the
144

current security-based swap market, market participants that are likely to be non-registered
persons transact with each other only on rare occasions. In these circumstances, the status of an
indirect counterparty could cause one side to become the reporting side, rather than leaving the
choice of reporting side to the counterparties. For example, if a registered security-based swap
dealer or registered major security-based swap participant guarantees one side of such a trade,
the side including the non-registered person and the guarantor would, under Rule 901(a)(2), be
the reporting side. The Commission believes that, if a registered security-based swap dealer or
registered major security-based swap participant is willing to accept the responsibility of
guaranteeing the performance of duties under a security-based swap contract, it should also be
willing to accept the responsibility of having to report that security-based swap to satisfy
Regulation SBSR. In any event, the Commission believes that, if a guarantor’s security-based
swap activities are extensive enough that it must register as a security-based swap dealer or
major security-based swap participant, it would have systems in place to ensure that it complies
with the regulatory obligations attendant to such registration, including any reporting obligations
for security-based swaps.
Finally, one commenter requested that the Commission provide guidance that reporting
parties could follow when the reporting hierarchy instructs them to select the reporting side. 314
The Commission does not believe at this time that it is necessary or appropriate for the
Commission itself to provide such guidance, because the determination of which counterparty is
reporting side for such transactions. Assume, however, that the non-registered direct
counterparty is guaranteed by another registered security-based swap dealer. Because
both sides include a registered security-based swap dealer, Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(A) requires
the sides to select the reporting side. Agreeing to follow current industry practices—and
locating the duty on the side that has the direct counterparty that is a registered securitybased swap dealer—would be consistent with Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(A).
314

See Better Markets I at 10.

145

better positioned to report these security-based swaps is likely to depend on the facts and
circumstances of the particular transaction and the nature of the counterparties. Rule
901(a)(2)(ii), as adopted, instructs the sides to select the reporting side only when the two sides
are of equal status (i.e., when both sides include a registered security-based swap dealer or when
neither side includes a registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based
swap participant). The Commission understands that, under existing industry conventions,
market participants who act in a dealing capacity undertake the reporting function. Thus, the
Commission believes that Rule 901(a)(2)(ii), as adopted, is not inconsistent with these current
industry practices. Furthermore, the Commission would not be averse to the development and
use of new or additional industry standards that create a default for which side would become the
reporting side in case of a “tie,” provided that both sides agree to use such standards.
2.

Reporting by Agents

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission noted that Rule 901(a)
would not prevent a reporting party from entering into an agreement with a third party to report a
security-based swap on behalf of the reporting party. 315 Several commenters strongly supported
the use of third-party agents to report security-based swaps. 316
Four commenters addressed the types of entities that may wish to report security-based
swaps on behalf of reporting parties. One commenter stated that platforms, clearing agencies,
brokers, and stand-alone data reporting vendors potentially could provide reporting services to
315

See 75 FR at 75211.

316

See Barnard I at 2; DTCC II at 7; DTCC III at 13 (allowing third-party service providers
to report security-based swaps would reduce the regulatory burden on counterparties and
would assure prompt compliance with reporting obligations); ISDA/SIFMA I at 17
(noting that portions of the OTC derivatives market likely would rely on third-party
agents to meet their reporting obligations); MarkitSERV I at 9; MarkitSERV II at 7-8;
MarkitSERV III at 4-5.

146

security-based swap counterparties. 317 Another commenter requested that the Commission
clarify that a security-based swap counterparty that was not the reporting party under Rule 901(a)
would be able to agree contractually to report a security-based swap on behalf of the reporting
party under Rule 901(a). 318 A third commenter noted that many market participants will look to
third-party service providers to streamline the reporting process. 319 One commenter, however,
recommended that the Commission should consider limiting the use of third-party reporting
service providers to SB SEFs or other reporting market intermediaries, such as exchanges,
because allowing unregulated third parties with potentially limited experience could lead to
incomplete or inaccurate security-based swap reporting. 320
Although the Commission agrees that security-based swap transaction information must
be reported in a timely and accurate manner to fulfill the transparency and oversight goals of
Title VII, the Commission does not believe that it is necessary, at this time, to allow only
regulated intermediaries to perform reporting services on behalf of a reporting side. The
Commission believes that reporting sides have a strong incentive to ensure that agents who
report on their behalf have the capability and dedication to perform this function. In this regard,
the Commission notes that any reporting side who contracts with a third party, including the nonreporting side, to report a security-based swap transaction on its behalf would retain the
obligation to ensure that the information is provided to a registered SDR in the manner and form

317

See ISDA/SIFMA I at 17 (explaining that there likely would be competition to provide
reporting services and that market participants would be able to contract with appropriate
vendors to obtain the most efficient allocation of reporting responsibilities).

147

required under Regulation SBSR. Thus, a reporting side could be held responsible if its agent
reported a security-based swap transaction to a registered SDR late or inaccurately.
In addition, the Commission believes that allowing entities other than regulated
intermediaries to provide reporting services to reporting persons could enhance competition and
foster innovation in the market for post-trade processing services. This could, in turn, encourage
more efficient reporting processes to develop over time as technology improves and the market
gains experience with security-based swap transaction reporting. Accordingly, Rule 901(a), as
adopted, does not limit the types of entities that may serve as reporting agents on behalf of
reporting sides of security-based swaps. Furthermore, nothing in Rule 901(a), as adopted,
prohibits the reporting side from using the non-reporting side to report as agent on its behalf. 321
3.

Reporting Clearing Transactions

In establishing proposed reporting obligations, Regulation SBSR, as proposed and as reproposed, did not differentiate between cleared and uncleared security-based swaps.
Accordingly, cleared and uncleared security-based swaps would have been treated in the same
manner for purposes of reporting transactions to a registered SDR. Multiple commenters
addressed the reporting of cleared and uncleared security-based swaps. Two commenters
supported the Commission’s proposal to assign reporting obligations for cleared security-based
swaps through the reporting hierarchy in all circumstances. 322 These commenters noted that the
321

See SIFMA I at 2, note 3.

322

See DTCC VI at 8-9; MarkitSERV III at 4-5. See also DTCC VII passim (suggesting
operational difficulties that could arise if a person who is not a counterparty to a securitybased swap has the duty to report); DTCC VIII (noting that “there has been a long held
view that the SEC proposed model [for security-based swap data reporting] provides for a
better defined process flow approach that achieves data quality, assigns proper ownership
of who should report, and provides the most cost efficiencies for the industry as a
whole”).

148

Commission’s proposal would allow security-based swap counterparties, rather than clearing
agencies, to choose the registered SDR that receives data about their security-based swaps. 323
Other commenters objected to the proposal on statutory and operational grounds. 324 Two
commenters argued that Title VII’s security-based swap reporting provisions and Regulation
SBSR should not extend to clearing transactions. 325 In the alternative, they argued that, if the
Commission requires clearing transactions to be reported to a registered SDR, the clearing
agency that clears a security-based swap should have the duty to report the associated clearing
transactions to a registered SDR of its choice because, “in contrast to uncleared [security-based
swaps], the Clearing Agency is the sole party who holds the complete and accurate record of
transactions and positions for cleared [security-based swaps] and in fact is the only entity capable
of providing accurate and useful positional information on cleared [security-based swaps] for
systemic risk monitoring purposes.” 326
After careful consideration of the comments, the Commission has determined not to
apply the reporting hierarchy in Rule 901(a)(2)(ii), as adopted, to clearing transactions. 327 In the
Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the Commission is proposing to revise Rule

323

DTCC X (arguing for allowing the reporting side to determine which SDR to report to for
cleared security-based swaps); ISDA IV at 5 (expressing the view that “the clearing
agency is best-positioned to report cleared [security-based swaps] timely and accurately
as an extension of the clearing process”).

As stated above, a clearing transaction is a security-based swap that has a registered

149

901(a) to assign reporting duties for clearing transactions. 328 However, the reporting hierarchy
in Rule 901(a)(2)(ii), as adopted, applies to alpha transactions that are not executed on a
platform. 329
One commenter expressed the view that reporting the alpha “adds little or no value to an
analysis of market exposure since it is immediately replaced by the beta and gamma and cannot
exist unless the swap is cleared.” 330 This commenter argued, therefore, that alpha transactions
should not be reported to registered SDRs. The Commission disagrees with this comment, and
believes instead that having a record of all alphas at registered SDRs will ensure that registered
SDRs receive complete information about security-based swap transactions that are subject to the
Title VII reporting requirement. This requirement is designed, in part, to provide valuable
information about the types of counterparties active in the security-based swap market.
Reconstructing this information from records of betas and gammas would be less efficient and
potentially more prone to error than requiring reports of the alpha in the first instance.
Furthermore, requiring reporting of the alpha transaction eliminates the need to address issues
that would arise if there is a delay between the time of execution of the alpha and the time that it
is submitted to clearing, or if the transaction is rejected by the clearing agency.
This commenter also stated that, if the alpha is reported, the “key to improving data
quality is to have a single party responsible for reporting a cleared transaction, and thus with
respect to whether reporting for purposes of public dissemination and/or reporting to a

328

Rule 901(a), as adopted, reserves Rule 901(a)(2)(i) for assigning reporting obligations for
clearing transactions.

infra, and in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release.

150

[registered SDR], the clearing agency should be responsible for the alpha once it is accepted for
clearing.” 331 This commenter believed that this approach allows the data pertaining to the
execution of the alpha to be more easily and accurately linked to the resulting beta and
gamma. 332 The Commission also sees the importance in being able to link information about the
alpha to a related beta and gamma. However, the Commission does not believe that relying
solely on the clearing agency to report transaction information is the only or the more
appropriate way to address this concern. As discussed in Section II(B)(3)(j), supra, the
Commission is adopting in Rule 901(d)(10) a requirement that the reports of new security-based
swaps (such as a beta and gamma) that result from the allocation, termination, novation, or
assignment of one or more existing security-based swaps (such as an alpha) must include the
transaction ID of the allocated, terminated, assigned, or novated security-based swap(s). This
requirement is designed to allow the Commission and other relevant authorities to link related
transactions across different registered SDRs.
4.

Reporting by a Platform

Commenters expressed mixed views regarding reporting by platforms. Some
commenters, addressing Rule 901(a) as originally proposed, recommended that the Commission
require a platform to report security-based swaps executed on or through its facilities. 333 One of
these commenters stated that a platform would be in the best position to ensure the accurate and
timely reporting of a transaction executed on its facilities. 334 Another commenter expressed the

334

See Tradeweb Letter at 3. This commenter also stated that the counterparties to a
transaction executed on a platform should be relieved of any reporting obligations
151

view that having platforms report security-based swaps would facilitate economies in the
marketplace by reducing the number of reporting entities. 335
Four commenters, however, recommended that the Commission not impose reporting
requirements on platforms. 336 Three of these commenters argued that certain practical
considerations militate against assigning reporting duties to platforms. 337 Specifically, these
commenters believed that a platform might not have all of the information required to be
reported under Rules 901(c) and 901(d). 338 These commenters further noted that, even if a
platform could report the execution of a security-based swap, it would lack information about
life cycle events. 339 The third commenter stated that it could be less efficient for a platform to
report than to have counterparties report. 340
After careful consideration of the issues raised by the commenters, the Commission has
determined not to apply the reporting hierarchy in Rule 901(a)(2)(ii), as adopted, to platform-

because they would not be in a position to control or confirm the accuracy of the
information reported or to control the timing of the platform’s reporting. See id. at 3-4.

security-based swap submitted for clearing had been accepted for clearing); ISDA IV at 7
(noting that certain aspects of the CFTC regime for reporting bilateral swaps executed on
facility have been challenging due to the difficulty for SEFs to know and report certain
trade data that is not essential to the trade execution, and because of the shared

reporting and the SD/MSP is responsible for the continuation data reporting).

executed transactions that will be submitted to clearing. In the Regulation SBSR Proposed
Amendments Release, the Commission is proposing to assign reporting duties for platformexecuted security-based swaps that will be submitted to clearing. 341 If the security-based swap
will not be submitted to clearing, the platform would have no reporting obligation, and the
reporting hierarchy in final Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) would apply. 342 The Commission notes that
Section 13A(a)(3) of the Exchange Act provides that, for a security-based swap not accepted by
any clearing agency, one of the counterparties must report the transaction. The reporting
hierarchy of final Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) implements that provision and clarifies which side has the
duty to report. The Commission believes that, in the case of security-based swaps that will not
be submitted to clearing, the counterparties either will know each other’s identity at the time of
execution or the they will learn this information from the platform immediately or shortly after
execution, 343 which will allow them to determine which side will incur the duty to report under

341

Rule 901(a), as adopted, reserves Rule 901(a)(1) for assigning reporting obligations for
platform-executed security-based swaps that will be submitted to clearing.

342

See ISDA IV at 7 (recommending that for a bilateral transaction executed on a platform
that is not intended for clearing, one of the counterparties should be responsible for
reporting, per the proposed reporting hierarchy).

343

Market participants typically are unwilling to accept the credit risk of an unknown
counterparty and therefore generally would not execute a security-based swap
anonymously, unless the transaction would be cleared. Based on discussions with market
participants, however, the Commission understands that certain temporarily registered
CFTC SEFs offer “work-up” sessions that allow for anonymous execution of uncleared
swaps in a limited circumstance. In a “work-up” session, after a trade is executed, other
SEF participants may be given the opportunity to execute the same product at the same
price. In a typical work-up session, the SEF would “flash” the execution to other SEF
participants, who could then submit long or short interest to trade at the same price. The
Commission understands that such interest could be submitted anonymously, and that a
participant in a work-up session must agree to accept the credit risk of any other
participant, if the work-up is conducted in a product that is not cleared. The Commission
understands that the platform will inform each participant that executes a trade of the
identity of its counterparty shortly after completion of the work-up session.

153

Rule 901(a)(2)(ii), as adopted.

Reporting of a Security-Based Swap Resulting from a Life Cycle Event

Rule 901(e)(1)(i) requires the reporting side for a security-based swap to report a life
cycle event of that security-based swap—such as a termination, novation, or assignment—to the
registered SDR to which it reported the original transaction. 344 Certain life cycle events may
result in the creation of a new security-based swap. The Commission is modifying Rule 901(a)
to identify the reporting side for this new security-based swap. 345
Rule 901(e), as adopted, identifies the reporting side for a life cycle event. Rule 901(e)
does not, however, address who will be the reporting side for a new security-based swap that
arises from a life cycle event (such as a termination) of an existing security-based swap. 346 To
identify the reporting side for the new security-based swap, the Commission is modifying the
introductory language of final Rule 901(a) to provide that a “security-based swap, including a
security-based swap that results from the allocation, termination, novation, or assignment of

344

However, a reporting side is not required to report whether or not a security-based swap
has been accepted for clearing. See infra Section XII(A) (discussing life cycle event
reporting).

345

Security-based swaps resulting from an allocation are discussed in greater detail in
Section VIII(A) infra.

346

As re-proposed, paragraphs (1) and (2) of Rule 901(e) would have identified the reporting
side for a security-based swap resulting from a life cycle event, if the reporting side for
the initial security-based swap ceased to be a counterparty to the security-based swap
resulting from the life cycle event. The Commission believes that these proposed
provisions are unnecessary in light of the reporting hierarchy in Rule 901(a). Therefore,
as described above, the Commission has determined that security-based swap
counterparties should use the reporting hierarchy in Rule 901(a) to determine the
reporting side for all security-based swaps, including security-based swaps that result
from a life cycle event to another security-based swap.

154

another security-based swap, shall be reported” as provided in the rest of the rule. 347 This
change responds to a commenter who suggested that reporting obligations be reassessed upon
novation based on the current registration status of the remaining party and the new party to the
security-based swap. 348 The reporting side designated by Rule 901(a) for the new transaction
could be different from the reporting side for the original transaction. 349 The reporting side for
the new security-based swap would be required to report the transaction within 24 hours of the
time of creation of the new security-based swap. 350
Rule 901(d)(10) requires the reporting side for the new security-based swap to report the
transaction ID of the original security-based swap as a data element of the transaction report for

347

As proposed, this introductory language read “[t]he reporting party shall be as follows.”
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission proposed to modify this
language to be “[t]he reporting side for a security-based swap shall be as follows.”

348

See ISDA IV at 7.

349

Assume, for example, that a registered security-based swap dealer and a hedge fund
execute a security-based swap. The execution does not occur on a platform and the
transaction will not be submitted to clearing. Under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(B), as adopted,
the registered security-based swap dealer is the reporting side for the transaction.
Assume further that three days after execution the registered security-based swap dealer
and the hedge fund agree that the registered security-based swap dealer will step out of
the trade through a novation and will be replaced by a registered major security-based
swap participant. Pursuant to Rule 901(e), as adopted, the registered security-based swap
dealer would be required to report the novation to the same registered SDR that received
the initial report of the security-based swap. At this point, the transaction between the
registered security-based swap dealer and the hedge fund is complete and the registered
security-based swap dealer would have no further reporting obligations with respect to
the transaction. Under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(D), as adopted, the registered major securitybased swap participant is the reporting side for the security-based swap that results from
the novation of the transaction between the registered security-based swap dealer and the
hedge fund. The registered major security-based swap participant is the reporting side for
the resulting transaction.

350

If the time that is 24 hours after the time of the creation of the new security-based swap
would fall on a day that is not a business day, the report of the new security-based swap
would be due by the same time on the next day that is a business day. See Rule 901(j).

the new security-based swap. 351 The Commission believes that this requirement will allow the
Commission and other relevant authorities to link the report of a new security-based swap that
arises from the allocation, termination, novation, or assignment of an existing security-based
swap to the original security-based swap. As a result of these links, the Commission believes
that it is not necessary or appropriate to require that a security-based swap that arises from the
allocation, termination, novation, or assignment of an existing security-based swap be reported to
the same registered SDR that received the transaction report of the original transaction. Thus,
the reporting side for a security-based swap that arises as a result of the allocation, termination,
novation, or assignment of an existing security-based swap could report the resulting new
security-based swap to a registered SDR other than the registered SDR that received the report of
the original security-based swap.

Public Dissemination—Rule 902
A.

Background

In addition to requiring regulatory reporting of all security-based swaps, Regulation
SBSR seeks to implement Congress’s mandate for real-time public dissemination of all securitybased swaps. Section 13(m)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission “to make
security-based swap transaction and pricing data available to the public in such form and at such

351

Rule 901(d)(10) provides that if a “security-based swap arises from the allocation,
termination, novation, or assignment of one or more existing security-based swaps,” the
reporting side must report “the transaction ID of the allocated, terminated, assigned, or
novated security-based swap(s), except in the case of a clearing transaction that results
from the netting or compression of other clearing transactions.” See supra Section
II(C)(3)(k) (discussing Rule 901(d))(10)).

156

times as the Commission determines appropriate to enhance price discovery.” 352 Section
13(m)(1)(C) of the Exchange Act 353 authorizes the Commission to provide by rule for the public
availability of security-based swap transaction, volume, and pricing data as follows:
(1) With respect to those security-based swaps that are subject to the mandatory clearing
requirement described in Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act (including those security-based
swaps that are excepted from the requirement pursuant to Section 3C(g) of the Exchange Act), 354
the Commission shall require real-time public reporting for such transactions; 355
(2) With respect to those security-based swaps that are not subject to the mandatory
clearing requirement described in Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, but are cleared at a
registered clearing agency, the Commission shall require real-time public reporting for such
transactions;

352

15 U.S.C. 78m(m)(1)(B). Section 13m(1)(E) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
78m(m)(1)(E), requires the Commission rule for real-time public dissemination of
security-based swap transactions to: (1) “specify the criteria for determining what
constitutes a large notional security-based swap transaction (block trade) for particular
markets and contracts” and (2) “specify the appropriate time delay for reporting large
notional security-based swap transactions (block trades) to the public.” The treatment of
block trades is discussed in Section VII, infra.

unlawful for any person to engage in a security-based swap unless that person submits
such security-based swap for clearing to a clearing agency that is registered under the
Exchange Act or a clearing agency that is exempt from registration under the Exchange
Act if the security-based swap is required to be cleared. Section 3C(g)(1) of the
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(g)(1), provides that requirements of Section 3C(a)(1) will
not apply to a security-based swap if one of the counterparties to the security-based swap
(1) is not a financial entity; (2) is using security-based swaps to hedge or mitigate
commercial risk; and (3) notifies the Commission, in a manner set forth by the
Commission, how it generally meets its financial obligations associated with entering into
non-cleared security-based swaps.

157

(3) With respect to security-based swaps that are not cleared at a registered clearing
agency and which are reported to a SDR or the Commission under Section 3C(a)(6), 356 the
Commission shall require real-time public reporting for such transactions, in a manner that does
not disclose the business transactions and market positions of any person; and
(4) With respect to security-based swaps that are determined to be required to be cleared
under Section 3C(b) of the Exchange Act but are not cleared, the Commission shall require realtime public reporting for such transactions. 357
Furthermore, Section 13(m)(1)(D) of the Exchange Act 358 authorizes the Commission to
require registered entities (such as registered SDRs) to publicly disseminate the security-based
swap transaction and pricing data required to be reported under Section 13(m) of the Exchange
Act. Finally, Section 13(n)(5)(D)(ii) of the Exchange Act 359 requires SDRs to provide securitybased swap information “in such form and at such frequency as the Commission may require to
comply with public reporting requirements.”
In view of these statutory provisions, the Commission proposed Rule 902—Public
Dissemination of Transaction Reports. In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the
Commission expressed its belief that the best approach would be to require market participants to

356

The reference in Section 13(m)(1)(C)(iii) of the Exchange Act to Section 3C(a)(6) of the
Exchange Act is incorrect. Section 3C of the Exchange Act does not contain a paragraph
(a)(6). See generally Am. Petroleum Institute v. SEC, 714 F.3d 1329, 1336-37 (D.C. Cir
2013) (explaining that “[t]he Dodd Frank Act is an enormous and complex statute, and it
contains” a number of “scriveners’ errors”).

357

Section 3C(b)(1) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission to review on an ongoing
basis each security-based swap, or any group, category, type, or class of security-based
swap to make a determination that such security-based swap, or group, category, type, or
class of security-based swap should be required to be cleared.

report transaction information to a registered SDR and require registered SDRs to disseminate
that information to the public. 360 Many commenters expressed general support for public
dissemination of security-based swap information. 361 In addition, as discussed more fully below,
the Commission received a large number of comments addressing specific aspects of public
dissemination of transaction reports. 362
The current market for security-based swaps is opaque. Dealers know about order flow
that they execute, and may know about other dealers’ transactions in certain instances, but
information about executed transactions is not widespread. Market participants—particularly

non-dealers—have to rely primarily on their understanding of the market’s fundamentals to
arrive at a price at which they would be willing to assume risk. The Commission believes that,
by reducing information asymmetries between dealers and non-dealers and providing more equal
access to all post-trade information in the security-based swap market, post-trade transparency
could help reduce implicit transaction costs and promote greater price efficiency. 363 The
availability of post-trade information also could encourage existing market participants to
increase their activity in the market and encourage new participants to join the market—and, if
so, increase liquidity and competition in the security-based swap market. In addition, all market
participants will have more comprehensive information with which to make trading and
valuation determinations.
Security-based swaps are complex derivative products, and there is no single accepted
way to model a security-based swap for pricing purposes. The Commission believes that posttrade pricing and volume information will allow valuation models to be adjusted to reflect how
other market participants have valued a security-based swap product at a specific moment in
time. Public dissemination of last-sale information also will aid dealers in deriving better
quotations, because they will know the prices at which other market participants have traded.
Last-sale information also will aid end users and other non-registered entities in evaluating
current quotations by allowing them to request additional information if a dealer’s quote differs
from the prices of the most recent transactions. Furthermore, smaller market participants that
view last-sale information will be able to test whether quotations offered by dealers before the
last sale were close to the price at which the last sale was executed. In this manner, post-trade

costs).

160

transparency will promote price competition and more efficient price discovery in the securitybased swap market.
The Commission is adopting Rule 902 with certain modifications and technical changes
discussed in more detail below. Final Rule 902(a) sets forth the basic duty of a registered SDR
to publicly disseminate transaction reports. Final Rule 902(c) sets forth certain types of securitybased swaps and certain other information about security-based swaps that a registered SDR
shall not publicly disseminate. Final Rule 902(d), the so-called “Embargo Rule,” is designed to
promote fair access to information about executed security-based swaps. 364
Rule 902(b), as proposed and re-proposed, would have established a mechanism for
registered SDRs to publicly disseminate transaction reports of block trades. As discussed in
more detail in Section VII, infra, the Commission is not adopting thresholds for determining
what constitutes a block trade. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is not necessary or
appropriate at this time to adopt rules specifically addressing the public dissemination of block
trades.
B.

Registered SDR’s Duty to Disseminate—Rule 902(a)

Rule 902(a), as proposed and re-proposed, would have required a registered SDR to
publicly disseminate a transaction report of any security-based swap immediately upon receipt of
transaction information about the security-based swap, except in the case of a block trade. 365

364

Final Rule 902(d) provides that “[n]o person shall make available to one or more persons
(other than a counterparty or post-trade processor) transaction information relating to a
security-based swap before the primary trade information about the security-based swap
is submitted to a registered security-based swap data repository.”

365

The Commission recognized, however, that there may be circumstances when a
registered SDR’s systems might be unavailable for publicly disseminating transaction
data. In such cases, proposed Rule 902(a) would have required a registered SDR to
disseminate the transaction data immediately upon its re-opening. See Regulation SBSR
161

Further, Rule 902(a), as initially proposed, provided that the transaction report would consist of
“all the information reported by the reporting party pursuant to § 242.901, plus any indicator or
indicators contemplated by the registered security-based swap data repository’s policies and
procedures that are required by § 242.907.” Rule 902(a) was revised and re-proposed as part of
the Cross-Border Proposing Release to add that a registered SDR would not have an obligation
to publicly disseminate certain types of cross-border security-based swaps that are required to be
reported but not publicly disseminated. 366
Commenters generally were supportive of the Commission’s approach of requiring
registered SDRs to be responsible for public dissemination of security-based swap transaction
reports. 367 One commenter, for example, stated that allowing other types of entities to have the
regulatory duty to disseminate data could lead to undue complications for market participants. 368
In addition, the commenter expressed the view that real-time public dissemination of securitybased swap data is a “core function” of registered SDRs, and that permitting only registered
SDRs to publicly disseminate security-based swap data would help to assure the accuracy and
completeness of the data. 369 However, one commenter appeared to recommend that a clearing

operation of registered SDRs and related operational procedures. See infra Section XI.
366

This carve-out was necessitated by re-proposed Rule 908(a), which contemplated
situations where a security-based swap would be required to be reported to a registered
SDR but not publicly disseminated. See 78 FR 31060.

367

See FINRA Letter at 5; DTCC II at 18 (stating that SDRs should be able to disseminate
data effectively and should be the sole source of data dissemination); DTCC IV at 4;
MarkitSERV I at 7-8 (stating that only registered SDRs, or their agents, should be
permitted to disseminate security-based swap data); Thomson Reuters Letter at 6-7
(stating that publication and dissemination of security-based swap transaction
information should be the responsibility of registered SDRs rather than SB SEFs).

368

162

agency should be responsible for public dissemination of “relevant pricing data for a securitybased swap subject to clearing.” 370
The Commission has carefully analyzed the comments and is adopting the approach of
requiring public dissemination through registered SDRs. The Commission believes that this
approach will promote efficiency in the security-based swap market, or at least limit
inefficiency. 371 Section 13(m)(1)(G) of the Exchange Act 372 provides that “[e]ach security-based
swap (whether cleared or uncleared) shall be reported to a registered security-based swap data
repository.” Thus, security-based swaps would have to be reported to registered SDRs
regardless of the mechanism that the Commission chooses for public dissemination. By
requiring registered SDRs to carry out the task of public dissemination, the Commission will not
require reporting steps beyond those already required by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, the
Commission believes that assigning registered SDRs the duty to publicly disseminate will help
promote efficiency and consistency of post-trade information. Market observers will not have to
obtain market data from potentially several other sources —such as SB SEFs, clearing agencies,
or the counterparties themselves—to have a full view of security-based swap market activity.
1.

Format of Disseminated Data

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission acknowledged that multiple
uniquely formatted data feeds could impair the ability of market participants to receive,

370

See ISDA IV at 6 (stating that “as regards public dissemination of relevant pricing data
for a SBS subject to clearing, such reporting should be done by the clearing agency when
a SBS is accepted for clearing and the clearing agency reports for the beta and gamma”).

163

understand, or compare security-based swap transaction data and thus undermine its value. 373
Furthermore, the Commission suggested that one way to address that issue would be to dictate
the exact format and mode of providing required security-based swap data to the public, while
acknowledging various problems with that approach. 374 The Commission proposed, however, to
identify in proposed Rules 901(c) and 901(d) the categories of information that would be
required to be reported, and to require registered SDRs to establish and maintain policies and
procedures that, among other things, would specify the data elements that would be required to
be reported. 375 The Commission preliminarily believed that this approach would promote the
reporting of uniform, material information for each security-based swap, while providing
flexibility to account for changes to the security-based swap market over time. 376
Two commenters generally supported the Commission’s approach of providing registered
SDRs with the flexibility to define the relevant data fields. 377 However, one commenter stated
that the final rules should clearly identify the data fields that will be publicly disseminated. 378
Another commenter emphasized the importance of presenting security-based swap information
in a format that is useful for market participants, and expressed concern that proposed Regulation
SBSR did “nothing to ensure that the data amassed by individual SDRs is aggregated and

the Commission’s “proposal to provide [registered] SDRs with the authority to define the
relevant fields on the basis of general guidelines as set out by the SEC”).

disseminated in a form that is genuinely useful to traders and regulators and on a
nondiscriminatory basis.” 379 This commenter further believed that to provide meaningful price
discovery, data must be presented in a format that allows market participants to view it in nearreal time, fits onto the limited space available on their trading screens, and allows them to view
multiple markets simultaneously. 380
The Commission has carefully considered these comments and continues to believe that it
is not necessary or appropriate at this time for the Commission to dictate the format and mode of
public dissemination of security-based swap transaction information by registered SDRs.
Therefore, Rule 902(a), as adopted, provides registered SDRs with the flexibility to set the
format and mode of dissemination through its policies and procedures, as long as the reports of
security-based swaps that it publicly disseminates include the information required to be reported
by Rule 901(c), plus any “condition flags” contemplated by the registered SDR’s policies and
procedures under Rule 907. 381 The Commission notes that it anticipates proposing for public
comment detailed specifications of acceptable formats and taxonomies that would facilitate an
accurate interpretation, aggregation, and analysis by the Commission of security-based swap data
submitted to it by an SDR. The Commission intends to maximize the use of any applicable
current industry standards for the description of security-based swap data, and build upon such
standards to accommodate any additional data fields as may be required.

Timing of Public Dissemination

the component parts of a complex transaction to prevent market participants from
avoiding transparency by creating complex composite transactions).

380

See Better Markets I at 3; Better Markets II at 4.

381

The Commission notes that final Rule 902(a) references “condition flags,” rather than
“indicator or indicators,” as was proposed, to conform with Rule 907, as adopted.

165

Rule 902(a), as re-proposed, would have required a registered SDR to publicly
disseminate a transaction report of a security-based swap immediately upon (1) receipt of
information about the security-based swap from a reporting side, or (2) re-opening following a
period when the registered SDR was closed, unless the security-based swap was a block trade or
a cross-border security-based swap that was required to be reported but not publicly
disseminated. One commenter agreed with the proposed requirement, stating that reported
security-based swap transaction information “should be made available on a non-delayed basis to
the public, media, and data vendors.” 382
The Commission is adopting the requirement contained in Rule 902(a), as re-proposed,
that a registered SDR must disseminate a transaction report of a security-based swap
“immediately upon receipt of information about the security-based swap, or upon re-opening
following a period when the registered security-based swap data repository was closed.” 383
“Immediately,” as used in this context, implies a wholly automated process to accept the
incoming information, process the information to assure that only information required to be
disseminated is disseminated, and disseminate a trade report through electronic means.
3.

Dissemination of Life Cycle Events

Rule 902(a), as adopted, provides that, in addition to transaction reports of security-based
swaps, a registered SDR “shall publicly disseminate … a life cycle event or adjustment due to a
life cycle event.” Rule 902(a), as proposed and re-proposed, did not specifically refer to such
information, but, as noted in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, proposed Rule 907(a)(4)
would have required a registered SDR to “establish and maintain written policies and procedures
382

383

See infra Section XI (discussing Rule 904, which deals with hours of operation of
registered SDRs and related operational procedures).

166

describing how reporting parties shall report—and, consistent with the enhancement of price
discovery, how the registered SDR shall publicly disseminate—reports of, and adjustments due
to, life cycle events.” 384 One commenter argued that the Commission should limit public
dissemination to new trading activity and should exclude maintenance or life cycle events. 385
The Commission disagrees, and believes instead that, if information about a security-based swap
is publicly disseminated but subsequently one or more of the disseminated data elements is
revised due to a life cycle event (or an adjustment due to a life cycle event), the revised
information would provide market observers a more accurate understanding of the market. The
Commission, therefore, is clarifying Rule 902(a) to make clear the requirement to disseminate
life cycle events. Final Rule 902(a) provides, in relevant part, that a registered SDR “shall
publicly disseminate a transaction report of the security-based swap or a life cycle event or
adjustment due to a life cycle event immediately upon receipt.” 386
4.

Correction of Minor Drafting Error

Rule 902(a), as initially proposed and re-proposed, provided that the transaction report
that is publicly disseminated “shall consist of all the information reported pursuant to Rule 901,
plus any indicator or indicators contemplated by the registered security-based swap data

that result in a change to the price of a security-based swap should be subject to public
dissemination, and requesting that “any activity on a [security-based swap] that does not
affect the price of the reportable [security-based swap]” be excluded from public
dissemination).

386

To enhance the usefulness of a public transaction report of a life cycle event, final Rule
907(a)(3) requires a registered SDR to have policies and procedures for appropriately
flagging public reports of life cycle events. See infra Section XII(C). This requirement
is designed to promote transparency by allowing market observers to distinguish original
transactions from life cycle events.

repository’s policies and procedures that are required by Rule 907” (emphasis added). However,
in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission specified that the transaction report
that is disseminated should consist of all the information reported pursuant to Rule 901(c). 387
The statement from the preamble of the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release is correct. The
Commission did not intend for all of the information reported pursuant to Rule 901 to be publicly
disseminated; 388 this would include, for example, regulatory data reported pursuant to Rule
901(d) and information about historical security-based swaps reported pursuant to Rule 901(i).
The Commission is correcting this drafting error so that final Rule 902(a) explicitly states that
the “transaction report shall consist of all the information reported pursuant to § 242.901(c), plus
any condition flags contemplated by the registered security-based swap data repository’s policies
and procedures that are required by § 242.907” (emphasis added).
5.

Use of Agents by a Registered SDR to Carry Out the Public Dissemination
Function

One commenter discussed the appropriateness of third-party service providers carrying
out the public dissemination function on behalf of registered SDRs. 389 The Commission believes
that, in the same way that reporting sides may engage third-party agents to report transactions on
their behalf, registered SDRs may engage third-party providers to carry out the public
dissemination function on their behalf. In both cases, the entity with the legal duty would remain
responsible for compliance with Regulation SBSR if its agent failed to carry out the function in a
manner stipulated by Regulation SBSR. Thus, reporting sides and registered SDRs should

168

engage only providers that have the capacity and reliability to carry out those duties.
C.

Definition of “Publicly Disseminate”

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission defined “publicly
disseminate” in Rule 900 to mean “to make available through the Internet or other electronic data
feed that is widely accessible and in machine-readable electronic format.” The Commission reproposed this definition renumbering it Rule 900(y), in the Cross-Border Proposing Release.
The Commission received no comment letters directly discussing the proposed definition,
although as noted above many commenters commented on various other aspects of public
dissemination, including the format of disseminated data 390 and timing of public
dissemination. 391 The Commission is adopting the definition of “publicly disseminate” as
proposed and re-proposed. The Commission continues to believe that, to satisfy the statutory
mandate for public dissemination, security-based swap transaction data must be widely
accessible in a machine-readable electronic format. These data are too numerous and complex
for direct human consumption and thus will have practical use only if they can be downloaded
and read by computers. The definition of “publicly disseminate” recognizes the Internet as one,
but not the only, possible electronic medium to make these data available to the public.
D.

Exclusions from Public Dissemination—Rule 902(c)
1.

Discussion of Final Rule

Rule 902(c), as proposed and re-proposed, set forth three kinds of information that a
registered SDR would be prohibited from disseminating. First, in Rule 902(c)(1), the
Commission proposed that a registered SDR would be prohibited from disseminating the identity
390

See supra Section VII(B)(1).

391

See supra Section VII(B)(2).

169

of any counterparty to a security-based swap. This would implement Section 13(m)(1)(E)(i) of
the Exchange Act, 392 which requires the Commission’s rule providing for the public
dissemination of security-based swap transaction and pricing information to ensure that “such
information does not identify the participants.” The Commission received three comments that
generally urged the Commission to ensure the anonymity of security-based swap counterparties,
either through non-dissemination of the identity of any counterparty or by limiting public
dissemination of other data elements they believed could lead to disclosure of counterparties’
identities. 393 To address the commenters’ concerns, the Commission is adopting Rule 902(c)(1)
as proposed and re-proposed, with one conforming change. 394 Final Rule 902(c)(1) explicitly
prohibits a registered SDR from disseminating the identity of any counterparty. Further, Rule
902(a) explicitly provides for the public dissemination of a transaction report that consists only

392

15 U.S.C. 13m(m)(1)(E)(i). This section is applicable to security-based swaps that are
subject to Sections 13(m)(1)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Exchange Act—i.e., security-based
swaps that are subject to the mandatory clearing requirement in Section 3C(a)(1) and
security-based swaps that are not subject to the mandatory clearing requirement in
Section 3C(a)(1) but are cleared.

393

See Deutsche Bank Letter at 6 (asking the SEC and CFTC to impose strict requirements
on an SDR’s handling, disclosure, and use of identifying information); DTCC II at 9
(noting that trading volume in most single name credit derivatives is “extremely thin” and
disclosing small data samples, particularly from narrow time periods, may not preserve
the anonymity of the trading parties); ISDA/SIFMA I at 12; MFA I at 2 (arguing that
participant IDs should not be included in any publicly disseminated transaction report to
protect identities and proprietary trading strategies of security-based swap market
participants).

394

Re-proposed Rule 902(c)(1) would have prohibited a registered SDR from publicly
disseminating the identity of either counterparty to a security-based swap. Final Rule
902(c)(1) prohibits a registered SDR from publicly disseminating the identity of any
counterparty to a security-based swap. Final Rule 900(i) defines counterparty to mean “a
person that is a direct counterparty or indirect counterparty of a security-based swap.”
This conforming change to Rule 902(c)(1) makes clear that a registered SDR may not
publicly disseminate the identity of any counterparty—direct or indirect—of a securitybased swap.

170

of “the information reported pursuant to § 242.901(c), plus any condition flags contemplated by
the registered security-based swap data repository’s policies and procedures that are required by
§ 242.907.” Limiting the publicly disseminated trade report to these specific data elements is
designed to further avoid disclosure of any counterparty’s identity, including the counterparty ID
of a counterparty, even in thinly-traded markets. 395
Second, the Commission proposed in Rule 902(c)(2) that, with respect to a security-based
swap that is not cleared at a clearing agency and that is reported to a registered SDR, a registered
SDR would be prohibited from disseminating any information disclosing the business
transactions and market positions of any person. This would implement Section 13(m)(1)(C)(iii)
of the Exchange Act, 396 which provides that, with respect to the security-based swaps that are not
cleared and which are reported to an SDR or the Commission, “the Commission shall require
real-time public reporting… in a manner that does not disclose the business transactions and
market positions of any person.” The Commission received no comments that directly addressed
proposed Rule 902(c)(2), although one commenter noted that “all market participants have
legitimate interests in the protection of their confidential and identifying financial
information.” 397 By prohibiting a registered SDR from disseminating any information disclosing
the business transactions and market positions of any person, the Commission believes that Rule
902(c)(2) will help preserve the confidential information of market participants, in addition to
implementing Section 13(m)(1)(C)(iii) of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Commission is
adopting Rule 902(c)(2) as proposed and re-proposed.

171

Third, the Commission preliminarily believed that it would be impractical and
unnecessary for a registered SDR to publicly disseminate reports of historical security-based
swaps reported pursuant to Rule 901(i), and therefore included this exclusion in proposed Rule
902(c)(3). 398 The Commission received no comments regarding proposed Rule 902(c)(3). The
Commission continues to believe that it would be impractical for a registered SDR to publicly
disseminate reports of historical security-based swaps reported pursuant to Rule 901(i).
Accordingly, the Commission is adopting Rule 902(c)(3) as proposed and re-proposed.
The Commission calls particular attention to the relationship between Rules 901(i),
901(e), and 902. Rule 901(i) requires reporting of historical security-based swaps to a registered
SDR. Rule 902(c)(3) provides that the initial transaction reported pursuant to Rule 901(i) shall
not be publicly disseminated. A historical security-based swap might remain open after market
participants are required to begin complying with the requirement in Rule 901(e) to report life
cycle events. 399 If a life cycle event of a historical security-based swap relating to any of the
primary trade information—i.e., the data elements enumerated in Rule 901(c)—occurs after
public dissemination is required for security-based swaps in a particular asset class, Rule 902(a)
would require the registered SDR to publicly disseminate a report of that life cycle event, plus
any condition flags required by the registered SDR’s policies and procedures under Rule 907. In
other words, Rule 902(c)(3)’s exclusion from public dissemination for historical security-based
swaps applies only to the initial transaction, not to any life cycle event of that historical securitybased swap relating to the primary trade information that occurs after public dissemination in
that asset class is required. Therefore, life cycle events relating to the primary trade information

of historical security-based swaps must, after the public dissemination requirement goes into
effect, be publicly disseminated. 400
At the same time, correcting an error in the Rule 901(c) information relating to a
historical security-based swap would not trigger public dissemination of a corrected report. Rule
905 applies to all information reported pursuant to Regulation SBSR, including historical
security-based swaps that must be reported pursuant to Rule 901(i). Rule 905(b)(2) requires the
registered SDR to publicly disseminate a correction of a transaction only if the corrected
information falls within Rule 901(c) and the transaction previously was subject to a public
dissemination requirement. Historical security-based swaps are not subject to the public
dissemination requirement; therefore, corrections to Rule 901(c) information in historical
security-based swaps are not subject to public dissemination either.
Rule 902(a), as proposed, would have provided that a registered SDR shall publicly
disseminate a transaction report of a security-based swap reported to it, “[e]xcept in the case of a
block trade.” Rule 902(a), as re-proposed, would have retained the exception for block trades
and added a second exception, for “a trade that is required to be reported but not publicly
disseminated.” 401 In final Regulation SBSR, the Commission is revising Rules 902(a) and
902(c) to consolidate into a single rule—Rule 902(c)—all the types of security-based swaps and
400

For example, a termination of a historical security-based swap—occurring after public
dissemination in that asset class becomes required—would have to be publicly
disseminated. A termination represents the change in the notional amount of the
transaction from a positive amount to zero. Because the notional amount is a Rule 901(c)
element, the termination of the historical security-based swap would have to be publicly
disseminated.

401

This second exception was necessitated by revisions to Rule 908 made in the CrossBorder Proposing Release that would have provided that certain cross-border securitybased swaps would be subject to regulatory reporting but not public dissemination. See
78 FR at 31215.

173

the kinds of information that a registered SDR is prohibited from disseminating. Therefore, Rule
902(a), as adopted, now provides that a registered SDR shall publicly disseminate a transaction
report of a security-based swap “except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.”
In addition to adopting subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of Rule 902(c), as proposed and reproposed, the Commission is modifying Rule 902(c) to expand the number of exclusions from
public dissemination from three to seven. First, the Commission is adding Rule 902(c)(4), which
prohibits a registered SDR from disseminating a non-mandatory report, and is adding a new Rule
900(r) to define “non-mandatory report” as any information provided to a registered SDR by or
on behalf of a counterparty other than as required by Regulation SBSR. Situations may arise
when the same transaction may be reported to two separate registered SDRs. This could happen,
for example, if the reporting side reports a transaction to one registered SDR, as required by Rule
901, but the other side elects to submit the same transaction information to a second registered
SDR. The Commission has determined that any non-mandatory report should be excluded from
public dissemination because the mandatory report of that transaction will have already been
disseminated, and the Commission seeks to avoid distorting the market by having two public
reports issued for the same transaction. 402
Second, the Commission is adding Rule 902(c)(5), which prohibits a registered SDR
from disseminating any information regarding a security-based swap that is subject to regulatory
reporting but not public dissemination under final Rule 908(a) of Regulation SBSR. 403 Rule
902(a), as re-proposed, would have prohibited a registered SDR from publicly disseminating
information concerning a cross-border security-based swap that is required to be reported but not
402

See infra Section XIX (explaining how a registered SDR can determine whether the
report it receives is a non-mandatory report).

403

See infra Section XV(A).

174

publicly disseminated. The Commission received no comments on this specific provision, and is
relocating it from re-proposed Rule 902(a) to final Rule 902(c)(5). Rule 902(c)(5), as adopted,
will prohibit a registered SDR from disseminating “[a]ny information regarding a security-based
swap that is required to be reported pursuant to §§ 242.901 and 242.908(a)(1) but is not required
to be publicly disseminated pursuant to § 242.908(a)(2).”
Third, the Commission is adding Rule 902(c)(6), which prohibits a registered SDR from
disseminating any information regarding certain types of clearing transactions. 404 Regulation
SBSR, as proposed and re-proposed, did not provide any exemption from public dissemination
for clearing transactions. However, the Commission has determined that publicly disseminating
reports of clearing transactions that arise from the acceptance of a security-based swap for
clearing by a registered clearing agency or that result from netting other clearing transactions
would be unlikely to further Title VII’s transparency objectives. Any security-based swap
transaction, such as an alpha, that precedes a clearing transaction must be publicly disseminated.
Clearing transactions, such as the beta and the gamma, that result from clearing a security-based
swap or from netting clearing transactions together do not have price discovery value because
they are mechanical steps taken pursuant to the rules of the clearing agency. Therefore, the
Commission believes that non-dissemination of these clearing transactions is appropriate in the
public interest and consistent with the protection of investors.
Fourth, the Commission is adding Rule 902(c)(7), which prohibits a registered SDR from
disseminating any information regarding the allocation of a security-based swap. As discussed
in more detail in Section VIII, infra, the Commission has determined that, to comply with this

404

Rule 900(f) defines “clearing transaction” as “a security-based swap that has a registered
clearing agency as a direct counterparty.”

175

prohibition, a registered SDR will satisfy its public dissemination obligations for a securitybased swap involving allocation by disseminating only the aggregate notional amount of the
executed bunched order that is subsequently allocated. The Commission believes that this is an
appropriate means of public dissemination, because the price and size of the executed bunched
order were negotiated as if the transaction were a single large trade, rather than as individual
smaller trades. In the Commission’s view, public dissemination of the allocations would not
enhance price discovery because the allocations are not individually negotiated. 405 Furthermore,
although the Commission has taken the approach in other situations of requiring public
dissemination of the transaction but with a condition flag to explain the special circumstances
related to the transaction, 406 for the reasons stated above, the Commission does not believe that
this approach is appropriate here. Rule 902(c)(7)’s exception to public dissemination for the
individual allocations also is designed to address commenter concerns that publicly
disseminating the sizes of individual allocations could reveal the identities or business strategies
of fund groups that execute trades on behalf of multiple client funds. 407 For similar reasons,
405

The size in which a transaction is executed could significantly affect the price of the
security-based swap. Thus, all other things being equal, the price negotiated for a large
trade could be significantly different from the price negotiated for a small trade. Publicly
disseminating the prices of small trades that are allocated from the bunched order
execution might not provide any price discovery value for another small trade if it were
to be negotiated individually. Nor does the Commission believe that publicly
disseminating the prices and sizes of the allocations would provide any more price
discovery than a single print of the bunched order execution, because the allocations
result from a single negotiation for the bunched order size. However, if “child”
transactions of a larger “parent” transaction are priced differently from the parent
transaction, these child transactions would not fall within the exclusion in Rule 902(c)(7).

406

See infra Section IX (discussing requirements for public dissemination of inter-affiliate
security-based swaps).

407

See MFA I at 2-3 (“we are concerned that post-allocation [security-based swap] data, if
publicly disseminated, will allow any of the fund’s counterparties to identify transactions
that the fund executed with others. Counterparties are often aware of an investment
176

Rule 902(c)(7), as adopted, prohibits a registered SDR from publicly disseminating the fact that
an initial security-based swap has been terminated and replaced with several smaller securitybased swaps as part of the allocation process. 408 The Commission believes that any marginal
benefit of publicly disseminating this type of termination event would not be justified by the
potential risk to the identity or business strategies of fund groups that execute trades on behalf of
multiple client funds. 409
Registered SDRs will need to rely on the information provided by reporting sides to
determine whether Rule 902(c) excludes a particular report from public dissemination. As
described in more detail in Section VI(G), Rule 907(a)(4)(iv) requires a registered SDR, among
other things, to establish and maintain written policies and procedures directing its participants to
apply to the transaction report a condition flag designated by the registered SDR to indicate
when the report of a transaction covered by Rule 902(c) should not be publicly disseminated. 410
A registered SDR would not be liable for a violation of Rule 902(c) if it disseminated a report of
a transaction that fell within Rule 902(c) if the reporting side for that transaction failed to
appropriately flag the transaction as required by Rule 907(a)(4).
manager’s standard fund allocation methodology and therefore, reporting transactions at
the allocated level with trade execution time will make evident an allocation scheme that
other participants can easily associate with a particular investment manager”).
408

Ordinarily, the termination of a security-based swap that has been publicly disseminated
would itself be an event that must be publicly disseminated. See Rule 902(a) (generally
providing that a registered SDR shall publicly disseminate a transaction report of a
security-based swap “or a life cycle event or adjustment due to a life cycle event”
immediately upon receiving an appropriate transaction report).

409

For the reasons noted above, the Commission believes that it is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors, to exclude these
types of information from public dissemination under Regulation SBSR.

410

Rule 907(a)(4) provides registered SDRs with some discretion in determining how a
reporting side must flag reported data that will be excluded from public dissemination.
See infra Section VI(G).

2.

Other Exclusions from Public Dissemination Sought by Commenters

Several commenters advanced arguments against public dissemination of various types of
security-based swaps. The Commission notes at the outset that the statutory provisions that
require public dissemination of security-based swap transactions state that all security-based
swaps shall be publicly disseminated.
a.

Customized Security-Based Swaps

Several commenters expressed the view that transaction information regarding
customized security-based swaps should not be publicly disseminated because doing so would
not enhance price discovery, would be of limited use to the public, or could be confusing or
misleading to market observers. 411 However, one commenter urged the Commission to require
public dissemination of all of the information necessary to calculate the price of a customized
security-based swap. 412

411

See Barclays Letter at 3; Cleary II at 6, 16 (stating that public reporting of customized
security-based swaps would not aid price discovery, and that the Commission should
require the public dissemination of key terms of a customized transaction and an
indication that it is customized); DTCC II at 9 (noting the difficulty of comparing price
data across transactions that are non-standard and have different terms); ISDA/SIFMA I
at 11 (stating that customized security-based swaps provide little to no price discovery
value and should not be subject to public dissemination); MFA I at 3 (arguing that
Congress did not intend to require public dissemination of comprehensive information for
customized security-based swaps and that price discovery serves a purpose only if there
is a broad market for the relevant transaction, which is not the case with customized
security-based swaps).

412

See Better Markets I at 7; Better Markets II at 3 (stating that many transactions
characterized as too complex for reporting or dissemination are, in fact, composites of
more straightforward transactions, and that there should be disclosure of information
concerning these components to provide meaningful transparency and to prevent market
participants from avoiding disclosure by creating composite transactions).

178

Section 13(m)(1)(C) of the Exchange Act 413 authorizes the Commission to provide by
rule for the public availability of security-based swap transaction, volume, and pricing data for
four types of security-based swaps, which together comprise the complete universe of potential
security-based swaps. With respect to “security-based swaps that are not cleared at a registered
clearing agency and which are reported to a security-based swap data repository”—which
category would include customized or bespoke security-based swaps—Section 13(m)(1)(C)
provides that “the Commission shall require real-time public reporting for such transactions, in a
manner that does not disclose the business transactions and market positions of any person”
(emphasis added).
The Commission does not believe that the commenters who argued against disseminating
reports of bespoke transactions have provided sufficient justification for an exception to public
dissemination. To the contrary, the Commission believes that dissemination of transaction
reports of customized security-based swaps could still provide useful information to market
observers. Although all of the material elements of a bespoke transaction necessary to
understand the market value might not be publicly disseminated, it is an overstatement to argue
categorically that bespoke transactions would have no price discovery value, as certain
commenters suggested. 414 The disseminated price could, for example, still have an anchoring
effect on price expectations for future negotiations in similar or related products, even in thinlytraded markets. Furthermore, even if it is difficult to compare price data across customized
transactions, by disseminating reports of all bespoke transactions, market observers can

413

15 U.S.C. 13(m)(1)(C)(iii).

414

See supra note 411.

179

understand the relative number and aggregate notional amounts of transactions in bespoke
products versus standardized products.
The Commission recognizes, however, that market observers should have information
that permits them to readily distinguish transactions in standardized products from transactions in
bespoke security-based swaps. Accordingly, Rule 901(c)(1)(v) provides that, when reporting a
transaction to a registered SDR, the reporting side must attach a flag to indicate whether a
security-based swap is customized to the extent that the other information provided pursuant to
Rule 901(c) does not provide all of the material information necessary to identify the securitybased swap or does not contain the data elements necessary to calculate the price of the securitybased swap. In addition, final Rule 907(a)(4) requires a registered SDR to establish policies and
procedures concerning the use of appropriate flags on disseminated transaction reports that are
designed to assist market observers in interpreting the relevance of a transaction.
b.

Inter-Affiliate Transactions

Several commenters argued that the Commission should not require public dissemination
of inter-affiliate security-based swaps. Issues relating to regulatory reporting and public
dissemination of inter-affiliate transactions are discussed in Section IX, infra.
c.

Security-Based Swaps Entered into in Connection with a Clearing
Member’s Default

One commenter argued that reports of security-based swaps effected in connection with a
clearing agency’s default management processes following the default of a clearing member
should not be publicly disseminated in real time. 415 This commenter believed that public

415

See LCH.Clearnet Letter at 2 (explaining that, to manage a defaulting clearing member’s
portfolio, a clearing agency would rely on its non-defaulting members to provide
liquidity for a small number of large transactions that would be required to hedge the
180

dissemination of these transactions could undermine a clearing agency’s default management
processes and have a negative effect on market stability, particularly because a default likely
would occur during stressed market conditions. Accordingly, the commenter recommended that
reports of security-based swaps entered into in connection with a clearing agency’s default
management processes be made available to the Commission in real time but not publicly
disseminated until after the default management processes have been completed, as the
Commission determines appropriate.
The Commission believes that, at present, the commenter’s concerns are addressed by the
Commission’s approach for the interim phase of Regulation SBSR, which offers reporting sides
up to 24 hours after the time of execution to report a security-based swap. 416 The Commission
believes that this approach strikes an appropriate balance between promoting post-trade
transparency and facilitating the default management process, and is broadly consistent with the
commenter’s suggestion to allow for public dissemination after the default management process
has been completed. Further, the commenter suggested that such transactions typically occur in
large size; thus, transactions entered into by surviving clearing members might qualify for any
block exception, if the Commission were to promulgate such an exception in the future. The
Commission intends to revisit the commenter’s concern in connection with its consideration of
block thresholds and other potential rules relating to block trades.
d.

Total Return Security-Based Swaps

defaulting member’s portfolio, and the ability of non-defaulting members to provide
liquidity for these transactions would be impaired if the transactions were reported
publicly before the members had an opportunity to mitigate the risks of the transactions).
416

See Rule 901(j); Section VII(B), infra. If 24 hours after the time of execution would fall
on a day that is not a business day, reporting would be required by the same time on the
next day that is a business day.

181

Three commenters argued that there should be no public dissemination of total return
security-based swaps (“TRSs”), which offer risks and returns proportional to a position in a
security, securities, or loan(s) on which a TRS is based. 417 One of these commenters argued that
“TRS pricing information is of no value to the market because it is driven by many
considerations including the funding levels of the counterparties to the TRS and therefore may
not provide information about the underlying asset for the TRS.” 418 Another commenter
suggested that the fact that TRSs are hedged in the cash market, where trades are publicly
disseminated, would mitigate the incremental price discovery benefit of public dissemination of
the TRSs. 419 Similarly, a third commenter argued that requiring public dissemination of an
equity TRS transaction would not enhance transparency, and could confuse market participants,
because the hedging transactions are already publicly disseminated. 420
The Commission has carefully considered these comments but believes that these
commenters have not provided sufficient justification to support a blanket exclusion from public
dissemination for TRSs. The Commission believes, rather, that market observers should be
given an opportunity to decide how to interpret the relevance of a disseminated trade to the state
of the market, and reiterates that relevant statutory provisions state that all security-based swaps
417

See Barclays Letter at 2-3; Cleary II at 13-14; ISDA/SIFMA I at 13.

418

ISDA/SIFMA I at 13.

419

See Cleary II at 13-14. The primary concern of this commenter with respect to equity
TRSs was the proposed exclusion of equity TRSs from the reporting delay for block
trades. See id. The Commission expects to consider this comment in connection with its
consideration of rules for block trades.

420

See Barclays Letter at 3. The commenter also expressed more general concerns
regarding the potential consequences of reduced liquidity in the equity TRS market,
noting that if liquidity in the equity TRS market is impaired, liquidity takers could
migrate away from a diversified universe of security-based swap counterparties to a more
concentrated group of prime brokers, which could increase systemic risk by concentrating
large risk positions with a small number of prime brokers. See Barclays Letter at 8.

182

shall be publicly disseminated. These statutory provisions do not by their terms distinguish such
public dissemination based on particular characteristics of a security-based swap.
The Commission also has considered the argument advanced by one of the commenters
that requiring instantaneous public dissemination of an equity TRS transaction could confuse
market participants, because the hedging transactions are already publicly disseminated. 421 The
Commission disagrees that dissemination of both transactions (i.e., the initial transaction and the
hedge) would cause confusion. In other securities markets, public dissemination of initial
transactions and their hedges occur on a regular basis. 422 Valuable information could be
obtained by observing whether transactions in related products executed close in time have the
same or different prices. 423 The commenter who expressed concerns about potential negative
consequences of reduced liquidity in the equity TRS market provided no evidence to support its
claim. 424
e.

Transactions Resulting from Portfolio Compression

One group of commenters argued that transactions resulting from portfolio compression
exercises do not reflect trading activity, contain no market information, and thus should be
excluded from public dissemination. 425 One member of that group requested clarification that

421

See Barclays Letter at 3.

422

For example, a trade in a listed single-stock option is frequently hedged by a trade in the
underlying stock. Each trade is disseminated via the relevant consolidated tape.

423

For example, a difference in prices between an equity TRS and the underlying securities
might suggest mispricing of either leg of the trade, signaling to market participants the
existence of economic rents they could subsequently compete away. Additionally, price
discrepancies also could be related to fees or liquidity premiums charged by equity TRS
dealers. See infra Section XXII(B)(2)(a).

424

See Barclays Letter at 8.

425

See ISDA/SIFMA I at 12. See also DTCC II at 20 (stating, with respect to portfolio
compression activities, that “an exact pricing at individual trade level between parties is
183

only trades representing the end result of a netting or compression would need to be reported.
This commenter expressed the view that publicly disseminating original transactions as well as
the transactions that result from netting or compression would result in double-counting and
could present a distorted view of the market. 426
The Commission recognizes that portfolio compression is designed to mitigate risk
between counterparties by reducing gross exposures, and any new security-based swaps executed
as a result reflect existing net exposures and might not afford market participants an opportunity
to negotiate new terms. Nevertheless, there may be some value in allowing market observers to
see how often portfolio compressions occur and how much net exposure is left after much of the
gross exposure is terminated. Furthermore, it is possible that new positions arising from a
compression exercise could be repriced, and thus offer new and useful pricing information to
market observers. Therefore, the Commission is not convinced that there would be so little value
in disseminating such transactions that they all should be excluded from public dissemination,
even though the original transactions that are netted or compressed may previously have been
publicly disseminated. With respect to the commenter’s concern regarding double-counting, the
Commission notes that Rule 907(a)(4) requires a registered SDR to have policies and procedures
for flagging special circumstances surrounding certain transactions, which could include
transactions resulting from portfolio compression. The Commission believes that market
observers should have the ability to assess reports of transactions resulting from portfolio
compressions, and that a condition flag identifying a transaction as the result of a portfolio
compression exercise would help to avoid double-counting.
not meaningful and, therefore, these transactions should not be disseminated”); ISDA IV

426

See ISDA I at 4-5.

184

f.

Thinly Traded Products

Three commenters expressed concern about the potential impact of real-time public
dissemination on thinly traded products. 427 One of these commenters suggested that “securitybased swaps traded by fewer than ten market makers per month should be treated as illiquid and
subject to public reporting only on a weekly basis.” 428 The Commission disagrees with this
suggestion. In other classes of securities—e.g., listed equity securities, OTC equity securities,
listed options, corporate bonds, municipal bonds—all transactions are disseminated in real time,
and there is no delayed reporting for products that have only a limited number of market makers.
The Commission is not aware of characteristics of the security-based swap market that are
sufficiently different from those other markets to warrant delayed reporting because of the
number of market makers. Furthermore, given the high degree of concentration in the U.S.
security-based swap market, many products have fewer than ten market makers. Thus, the
commenter’s suggestion—if accepted by the Commission—could result in delayed reporting for
a substantial percentage of security-based swap transactions, which would run counter to Title
VII’s goal of having real-time public dissemination for all security-based swaps (except for
block trades). Finally, as noted above, the Title VII provisions that mandate public
dissemination on a real-time basis do not make any exception for security-based swaps based on
the number of market makers.
Another commenter expressed concern that mandating real-time reporting of thinlytraded products and illiquid markets could increase the price of entering into a derivatives

427

discussed in Section VII(B) infra.

185

contract to hedge risk by facilitating speculative front-running. 429 Another commenter expressed
concern about the impact of real-time post-trade transparency for illiquid security-based swaps
on pre-trade transparency that currently exists in the form of indicative prices provided by
dealers to their clients (known as “runs”). 430 This commenter requested that the Commission
provide illiquid security-based swaps with an exception from real-time reporting and instead
allow for delays roughly commensurate with the trading frequency of the security-based swap. 431
Under the adopted rules, counterparties generally will have up to 24 hours after the time of
execution to report security-based swap transactions. This reporting timeframe is designed, in
part, to minimize the potential for market disruption resulting from public dissemination of any
security-based swap transaction during the interim phase of Regulation SBSR. The Commission
anticipates that, during the interim period, it will collect and analyze data concerning the sizes of
transactions that potentially affect liquidity in different segments of the market in connection
with considering block thresholds.
E.

Dissemination of Block Transactions—Rule 902(b)

Rule 902(b), as proposed and re-proposed, would have required a registered SDR to
publicly disseminate a transaction report for a block trade (except for the notional amount of the
transaction) immediately upon receipt of the information about the block trade from the reporting
party, along with the transaction ID and an indicator that the report represented a block trade.

429

See Bachus/Lucas Letter at 2.

430

See ISDA IV at 14 (expressing concern that the combination of name-attributed runs and
a rapidly disseminated set of post-trade information would make it relatively easy for
many participants to reconstruct the identity of parties to a particular transaction, which
may reduce dealers’ willingness to disseminate pre-trade price information in the form of
runs, thereby reducing pre-trade transparency).

431

See id.

186

Rule 902(b) would further have required the registered SDR to disseminate a complete
transaction report for the block trade, including the full notional amount of the transaction,
within specified timeframes ranging from eight to 26 hours after execution, depending on the
time when the security-based swap was executed. Thus, under Rule 902(b), as proposed and reproposed, market participants would learn the price of a security-based swap block trade in real
time, and would learn the full notional amount of the transaction on a delayed basis. 432
For the reasons discussed in detail in Section VII(B), infra, the Commission is not
adopting Rule 902(b).
F.

The Embargo Rule—Rule 902(d)

Rule 902(d), as proposed, would have provided that “[n]o person other than a registered
security-based swap data repository shall make available to one or more persons (other than a
counterparty) transaction information relating to a security-based swap before the earlier of 15
minutes after the time of execution of the security-based swap; or the time that a registered
security-based swap data repository publicly disseminates a report of that security-based swap.”
In other words, the information about the security-based swap transaction would be “embargoed”
until a registered SDR has in fact publicly disseminated a report of the transaction (or until such
time as a transaction should have been publicly disseminated). Rule 902(d) is also referred to as
the “Embargo Rule.” Rule 902(d) was not revised as part of the Cross-Border Proposing
Release, and was re-proposed in exactly the same form as had been initially proposed.
Under Regulation SBSR, only registered SDRs must publicly disseminate security-based
swap transaction data to the public. However, other persons with knowledge of a transaction—

432

The only difference between Rule 902(b) as proposed and as re-proposed was that the
term “reporting party” was changed to “reporting side.”

187

the counterparties themselves or the venue on which a transaction is executed—also might wish
to disclose information about the transaction to third parties (whether for commercial benefit or
otherwise). An unfair competitive advantage could result if some market participants could
obtain security-based swap transaction information before others. Regulation SBSR, by carrying
out the Congressional mandate to publicly disseminate all security-based swap transactions, is
intended to reduce information asymmetries in the security-based swap market and to provide all
market participants with better information—and better access to information—to make
investment decisions. Therefore, the Commission proposed Rule 902(d), which would have
imposed a partial and temporary restriction on sources of security-based swap transaction
information other than registered SDRs.
Three commenters supported the view that market participants (including SB SEFs)
should not be permitted to distribute their security-based swap transaction information before
such information is disseminated by a registered SDR. 433 However, three other commenters
strongly opposed the proposed Embargo Rule. 434 Other commenters expressed a concern that
the proposed Embargo Rule would make it more difficult for SB SEFs to offer “work-up” 435
433

See Markit II at 4 (stating that if SB SEFs were permitted to disseminate data elements of
a security-based swap transaction, confusion and data fragmentation would inevitably
result, which would ultimately undermine the goal of increased transparency); Barnard I
at 4 (stating that market participants should be prohibited from distributing their market
data prior to the dissemination of that data by a registered SDR to prevent the
development of a two-tier market); ISDA IV at 17 (stating that “it is unclear why any
person should be allowed to make the data available to another market data source ahead
of the time that [an SDR] is allowed to publicly disseminate such transaction,” and
recommending that proposed Rule 902(d) be revised to refer only to the time that an SDR
disseminates a report of the security-based swap).

188

functionality. 436 This “work-up” process, according to one of the commenters, is designed to
foster liquidity in the security-based swap market and to facilitate the execution of larger-sized
transactions. 437
The Commission has carefully reviewed the comments received and has determined to
revise the Embargo Rule to provide that the act of sending a report to a registered SDR—not the
act of the registered SDR actually disseminating it—releases the embargo. Rule 902(d), as
adopted, provides: “No person shall make available to one or more persons (other than a
counterparty or a post-trade processor) transaction information relating to a security-based swap
before the primary trade information about the security-based swap is sent to a registered
security-based swap data repository” (emphasis added).
The Commission agrees with the majority of commenters that it would be beneficial for
security-based swap market participants to have the ability to disseminate and receive transaction
data without being constrained by the time when a registered SDR disseminates the transaction
information. The Commission understands that, in some cases, entities that are likely to become
volume at the already-established price. Thereafter, other market participants may join
the trade and transact with either the original counterparties to the trade or with other
firms if they agree to trade further volume at the established price”); SDMA II at 3
(“Trade work ups are a common practice in which the broker looks for additional trading
interest at the same time a trade is occurring—or “flashing” on the screen—in the same
security at the same price. The ability to view the price of a trade as it is occurring is
critical to broker’s ability to locate additional trading interest. The immediate flash to the
marketplace increases the probability that additional buyers and sellers, of smaller or
larger size, will trade the same security at the same time and price”); WMBAA II at 3

decisions on trading activity, without the fear of moving the market one way or another”).

See GFI Letter at 3; SDMA II at 3 (if “the SB SEF is prohibited from ‘flashing’ the price
of a trade as it occurs and the brokers must wait until after the SB SDR has disclosed the
price, the broker’s window of opportunity to locate additional trading interest will
close”); WMBAA II at 3.

SB SEFs may want to broadcast trades executed electronically across their platforms to all
subscribers, because knowing that two counterparties have executed a trade at a particular price
can, in some cases, catalyze trading by other counterparties at the same price. Allowing
dissemination of transaction information to occur simultaneously with transmission to a
registered SDR will allow SB SEF participants to see last-sale information for the particular
markets on which they are trading, which could facilitate the work-up process and thus enhance
price discovery.
One commenter expressed concern, however, that permitting the distribution of market
data prior to dissemination of the information by a registered SDR could result in the
development of a two-tier market. 438 Although the Commission generally shares the
commenter’s concern about information asymmetries, the Commission does not believe that
Rule 902(d), as adopted, raises that concern. Certain market participants might learn of a
completed transaction before others who rely on public dissemination through a registered SDR.
However, the time lag is likely to be very small because Rule 902(a) requires a registered SDR to
publicly disseminate a transaction report “immediately upon receipt of information about the
security-based swap.” The Commission understands that, under the current market structure,
trading in security-based swaps occurs for the most part manually (rather than through
algorithmic means) and infrequently. Thus, obtaining knowledge of a completed transaction
through private means a short time before others learn of the transaction from a registered SDR
is unlikely, for the foreseeable future, to provide a significant advantage. Furthermore, as
discussed above regarding the “work-up” process, the most likely recipients of direct information
about the completed transaction are other participants of the SB SEF. Thus, an important
438

190

segment of the market—i.e., competitors of the counterparties to the original transaction in the
work up who are most likely to have an interest in trading the same or similar products—are still
benefitting from post-trade transparency, even if it comes via the work-up process on the SB SEF
rather than through a registered SDR.
Two commenters raised arguments related to the ownership of the security-based
swap transaction data and were concerned that the proposed Embargo Rule would place
improper restrictions on the use of security-based swap market data. 439 One of these
commenters recommended that the Commission revise the Embargo Rule “in such a way
that . . . the security-based swap counterparties and SB SEFs [would] continue to have the
ability to market and commercialize their own proprietary data.” 440 The other commenter
recommended that the Commission make clear that nothing in the final rules is intended “to
impose or imply any limit on the ability of market participants . . . to use and/or
commercialize data they create or receive in connection with the execution or reporting of
swap data.” 441
The Commission declines to revise Rule 902(d) in the manner suggested by these
commenters. As the Commission notes in the SDR Adopting Release, “the issue of who
owns the data is not particularly clear cut, particularly when value is added to it.” 442 If the

determining ownership of data as one of several reasons for not adopting, at this time, a
rule prohibiting an SDR and its affiliates from using, for commercial purposes, securitybased swap data that the SDR maintains without obtaining express written consent from

Commission were to revise the rule in the manner suggested by commenters, it would seem
to make a presumption about who owns the data, which may be viewed as the Commission
favoring one business model over another. As further noted in the SDR Adopting Release,
the Commission does not support any particular business model 443 and, therefore, does not
believe it is necessary or appropriate to revise the rule as suggested by these commenters.
As originally proposed, the Embargo Rule had an exception for disseminating the
transaction information to counterparties, as the counterparties to the transaction should be
allowed to receive information about their own security-based swap transactions irrespective
of whether such information has been reported to or disseminated by a registered SDR.
However, two commenters noted that SB SEFs also will need to provide transaction data to
entities involved in post-trade processing, irrespective of whether the embargo has been
lifted. 444 The Commission recognizes that, after a trade is executed, there are certain entities
that perform post-trade services—such as matching, confirmation, and reporting—that may
need to receive the transaction information before it is sent to a registered SDR. For
example, a third party could not act as agent in reporting a transaction to a registered SDR
on behalf of a reporting side if it could not receive information about the executed
transaction before it was submitted to the registered SDR. In the Regulation SBSR
Proposing Release, the Commission stated that counterparties to a security-based swap

include the public dissemination of security-based swap data).

192

could rely on agents to report security-based swap data on their behalf. 445 Without an
exception, such use of agents could be impeded, an action the Commission did not intend.
Accordingly, the Commission is revising the Embargo Rule to add an explicit exception for
“post-trade processors.” The Commission is also adding a new paragraph (x) to final Rule
900, which defines “post-trade processor” as “any person that provides affirmation,
confirmation, matching, reporting, or clearing services for a security-based swap
transaction.”
Finally, one commenter recommended a carve-out from Rule 902(d) not only for
counterparties, but also for their affiliates, “to allow for internal communication of SBS
data.” 446 Rule 902(d)—as proposed, re-proposed, and adopted—includes a carve-out for
counterparties, which could include affiliates, to the extent that an affiliate is an indirect
counterparty as defined in Rule 900. The Commission continues to believe that it is
necessary for counterparties to know when they have executed a trade. The Commission
further notes that Rule 902(d), as adopted, contains an exception for post-trade
processors, 447 which could include post-trade processors that are affiliates of the
counterparties. Thus, Rule 902(d) would not prohibit a counterparty to a security-based
swap transaction from providing the transaction information to an affiliate before providing
it to a registered SDR, if that affiliate will serve as the counterparty’s agent for reporting the
transaction to the registered SDR. However, Rule 902—as proposed, re-proposed, and

See Rule 900(x) (defining “post-trade processor” as “any person that provides

swap transaction”).

193

adopted—includes no broad carve-out for all affiliates of the counterparties. The
Commission does not see a basis for allowing such a broad exception for all affiliates, which
could undermine the purpose of Rule 902(d), as discussed above.
G.

Condition Flags—Rule 907(a)(4)

Rule 907(a)(4), as originally proposed, would have required a registered SDR to establish
and maintain written policies and procedures “describing how reporting parties shall report and,
consistent with the enhancement of price discovery, how the registered security-based swap
depository shall publicly disseminate, reports of, and adjustments due to, life cycle events;
security-based swap transactions that do not involve an opportunity to negotiate any material
terms, other than the counterparty; and any other security-based swap transactions that, in the
estimation of the registered security-based swap data depository, do not accurately reflect the
market.” The Commission re-proposed Rule 907(a)(4) in the Cross-Border Proposing Release
with only minor technical revisions. 448
One commenter expressed the view that a registered SDR should have the flexibility to
determine and apply special indicators. 449 Another commenter suggested that, to be
meaningfully transparent, security-based swap transaction data should include “condition flags”
comparable to those used in the bond market. 450 As discussed more fully below, the
Commission agrees that such “condition flags” could provide additional transparency to the
security-based swap market. The Commission believes that the condition flags that registered
SDRs will develop pursuant to final Rule 907(a)(4) could provide information similar to the
448

The Commission changed the words “reporting parties” to “reporting sides” and
“depository” to “repository.”

449

194

information provided by the condition flags used in the bond market. The registered SDR’s
condition flags could include, for example, flags indicating that a security-based swap was an
inter-affiliate transaction or a transaction entered into as part of a trade compression.
A third commenter suggested that a registered SDR should not have discretion to
determine whether a particular transaction reflects the market, as the registered SDR may not
have sufficient information to make such a determination. 451 The Commission agrees with the
commenter that a registered SDR may not have sufficient information to ascertain whether a
particular transaction “do[es] not accurately reflect the market,” as would have been required
under Rule 907(a)(4), as originally proposed. Therefore, the Commission will not require the
registered SDR to have policies and procedures for attaching an indicator that merely conveys
that the transaction, in the estimation of the registered SDR, does not accurately reflect the
market.
Instead, the Commission believes that requiring the registered SDR to provide
information about any special circumstances associated with a transaction report could help
market observers better understand the report and enhance transparency. For example, Rule
901(c)(1)(v), as adopted, requires a reporting side to attach a flag if a security-based swap is
customized to the extent that other information provided for the swap does not provide all of the
material information necessary to identify the customized security-based swap or does not
contain the data elements necessary to calculate the price. 452 In addition, Rule 905(b)(2), as
adopted, requires a registered SDR that receives a correction to information that it previously

451

See DTCC II at 20.

452

See supra Section II(B)(2)(b)(vi).

195

disseminated publicly to publicly disseminate a corrected transaction report with an indication
that the report relates to a previously disseminated transaction. 453
The Commission, therefore, is adopting Rule 907(a)(4) with certain additional language
to respond to the comments and to clarify how Rule 907(a)(4) should apply in circumstances
contemplated by but not fully addressed in the original proposal or the re-proposal. The
Commission has revised Rule 907(a)(4) as follows: new subparagraph (i) requires the registered
SDR to have policies and procedures for “identifying characteristic(s) of a security-based swap,
or circumstances associated with the execution or reporting of the security-based swap, that
could, in the fair and reasonable estimation of the registered security-based swap data repository,
cause a person without knowledge of these characteristic(s) or circumstances to receive a
distorted view of the market.” This language retains the idea that the appropriate characteristics
or circumstances remain “in the estimation of” the registered SDR, but requires the SDR’s
exercise of this discretion to be “fair and reasonable” to emphasize that the estimation should not
result in flags that would not allow market observers to better understand the transaction reports
that are publicly disseminated. Rule 907(a)(4)(i), as adopted, also widens the scope of
transactions to which the provision applies. 454 This provision grants a registered SDR the

453

See infra Section XX(B).

454

This revision to Rule 907(a)(4) also removes the references to public dissemination of
life cycle events that were proposed and re-proposed. These references have been
relocated to final Rule 907(a)(3). Rule 907(a)(3), as proposed and re-proposed,
addressed only the reporting and public dissemination of error reports. Life cycle events
are similar to error reports in that they reflect new information that relates to a previously
executed security-based swap. Therefore, Rule 907(a)(3), as adopted, now requires a
registered SDR to have policies and procedures for “specifying procedures for reporting
life cycle events and corrections to previously submitted information, making
corresponding updates or corrections to transaction records, and applying an appropriate
flag to the transaction report to indicate that the report is an error correction required to
196

flexibility to determine which special circumstances require flags and to change that
determination over time, if warranted. 455 Subparagraph (ii) provides that the registered SDR’s
policies and procedures must “establish[] flags to denote such characteristic(s) or
circumstance(s),” explicitly incorporating the concept of condition flags suggested by the
commenter. 456 Subparagraph (iii) requires policies and procedures “directing participants to
apply such flags, as appropriate, in their reports” to the registered SDR. Finally, subparagraph
(iv) requires these policies and procedures to address, in part, “applying such flags to
disseminated reports to help to prevent a distorted view of the market.”
The Commission also is adopting Rule 907(a)(4) with certain additional language in
subparagraph (iv) that clarifies the handling of security-based swap information that is required
to be reported under Rule 901 but which a registered SDR is required by Rule 902(c) not to
publicly disseminate. As noted above, even in the initial proposal, the Commission
contemplated that certain information would fall into this category. 457 Rule 907(a), as originally
proposed, would have required a registered SDR to establish and maintain policies and
procedures that addressed, among other things, the public dissemination of security-based swap
data. Carrying out that duty in a manner consistent with Rule 902—and, in particular, with Rule
902(c)—will necessarily require a registered SDR to differentiate reported information that is
required to be publicly disseminated from reported information that is required not to be publicly

be disseminated by [Rule 905(b)(2)] or is a life cycle event, or any adjustment due to a
life cycle event, required to be disseminated by [Rule 902(a)].” See infra Section XII(C).

disseminated. 458 The new language in final Rule 907(a)(4)(iv)(B) calls attention to this
particular requirement. Rule 907(a)(4)(iv)(B), as adopted, requires the registered SDR to have
policies and procedures for suppressing from public dissemination a transaction referenced in
Rule 902(c). 459
In addition to the requirements for indications in the case of error reports or bespoke
transactions, the Commission believes that registered SDRs generally should include the
following in its list of condition flags:
•

Inter-affiliate security-based swaps. As discussed in detail in Section VI(D), infra,
the Commission is not exempting inter-affiliate transactions from public

458

One commenter noted its view that Rule 907(a)(4), as proposed, seemed to delegate to
the discretion of the SDR whether and how certain security-based swap activity would be
publicly disseminated, and requested that the Commission clearly establish in Regulation
SBSR that certain security-based swap activity is not subject to public dissemination.
See ISDA IV at 13. The Commission believes that the rules as adopted do clearly
establish what security-based swap activity is not subject to public dissemination. Rule
902(a), as adopted, requires the registered SDR to publicly disseminate a transaction
report of a security-based swap, or a life cycle event or adjustment due to a life cycle
event, immediately upon receipt of information about the security-based swap, except as
provided in Rule 902(c). Rule 902(c) provides a list of information and types of securitybased swap transactions that a registered security-based swap shall not disseminate. See
supra Section VI(D).

459

Under Rule 907(a)(4)(iv), the registered SDR’s policies and procedures must direct the
reporting side to apply appropriate flags to transaction reports. In the case of a report
falling within Rule 902(c), the reporting side for the relevant transaction is required to
use the flag that signals to the registered SDR that the report should not be publicly
disseminated. The Commission notes that Rule 907(a)(4) affords registered SDRs some
discretion to determine precisely how a reporting side must flag reported data that will be
excluded from public dissemination under Rule 902(c). For example, a registered SDR
may determine not to require a specific “do not disseminate” tag for historical securitybased swaps if it is clear from context that they are historical security-based swaps and
not current transactions. As described in Section VI(D) above, the Commission does not
believe that a registered SDR would violate Rule 902(c) if it disseminated a report of a
transaction that fell within Rule 902(c) if the reporting side fails to appropriately flag the
transaction.

198

dissemination. However, the Commission believes it could be misleading if market
observers did not understand that a transaction involves affiliated counterparties.
•

Transactions resulting from netting or compression exercises. 460 The Commission
believes that market observers should be made aware that these transactions are
related to previously existing transactions and generally do not represent new risks
being assumed by the counterparties.

•

Transactions resulting from a “forced trading session” conducted by a clearing
agency. 461 The Commission believes that it would be helpful for market observers to
understand that such transactions may not be available to market participants outside
of the forced trading session.

460

This applies only to transactions resulting from netting or compression exercises other
than through a registered clearing agency. Security-based swaps resulting from netting or
compression exercises carried out by a registered clearing agency are not subject to
public dissemination. See Rule 902(c)(6). See also supra Section VI(D)(1) (explaining
Rule 902(c)(6)); Section VI(D)(2)(v) (explaining why the Commission believes that
transactions resulting from portfolio compression—other than clearing transactions—
should be publicly disseminated).

461

Entities that the Commission previously exempted from certain Exchange Act
requirements, including clearing agency registration, have informed the Commission that
they undertake “forced trading” sessions in order to promote accuracy in the end-of-day
valuation process. See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 59527 (March 6,
2009), 74 FR 10791, 10796 (March 12, 2009) (Order Granting Temporary Exemptions
Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Connection With Request on Behalf of
ICE U.S. Trust LLC Related to Central Clearing of Credit Default Swaps, and Request
for Comments) (describing “forced trading sessions” conducted by a clearing agency as
follows: “ICE Trust represents that, in connection with its clearing and risk management
process, it will calculate an end-of-day settlement price for each Cleared CDS in which
an ICE Trust Participant has a cleared position, based on prices submitted by ICE Trust
Participants. As part of this mark-to-market process, ICE Trust will periodically require
ICE Trust Participants to execute certain CDS trades at the applicable end-of-day
settlement price. Requiring ICE Trust Participants to trade CDS periodically in this
manner is designed to help ensure that such submitted prices reflect each ICE Trust
Participant’s best assessment of the value of each of its open positions in Cleared CDS on
a daily basis”).
199

•

Transactions reported more than 24 hours after execution. The Commission believes
that there is price discovery value in disseminating the transaction report, particularly
in cases where there are few or no other recent last-sale reports in that product.
However, all market observers should understand that the report is no longer timely
and thus may not reflect the current market at the time of dissemination.

•

Transactions resulting from default of a clearing member. The Commission believes
that the fact that the transaction was necessitated by a clearing agency’s need to have
surviving clearing members assume the positions of a defaulting clearing member is
important information about understanding the transaction and market conditions
generally.

•

Package trades. “Package trade” is a colloquial term for a multi-legged transaction of
which a security-based swap constitutes one or more legs. Market observers should
be made aware that the reported price of a security-based swap that is part of a
package trade might reflect other factors—such as the exchange of an instrument that
is not a security-based swap—that are not reflected in the transaction report of the
security-based swap itself.

This list is by way of example and not of limitation. There are likely to be other types of
transactions or circumstances associated with particular transactions that may warrant a
condition flag. The Commission anticipates that each registered SDR will revise its list over
time as the security-based swap market evolves and registered SDRs and market participants
gain greater insight into how to maximize the effectiveness of publicly disseminated transaction
reports.

200

VII.

Block Trades and the Interim Phase of Regulation SBSR
Section 13m(1)(E) of the Exchange Act 462 requires the Commission rule for real-time

public dissemination of security-based swap transactions to: (1) “specify the criteria for
determining what constitutes a large notional security-based swap transaction (block trade) for
particular markets and contracts” and (2) “specify the appropriate time delay for reporting large
notional security-based swap transactions (block trades) to the public.” In addition, Section
13m(1)(E)(iv) of the Exchange Act 463 requires the Commission rule for real-time public
dissemination of security-based swap transactions to contain provisions that “take into account
whether the public disclosure [of transaction and pricing data for security-based swaps] will
materially reduce market liquidity.” 464
As discussed further below, the Commission is neither proposing nor adopting rules
relating to block trades at this time. However, the rules, as adopted, establish an interim phase of
Regulation SBSR. During this first phase, as described below, reporting sides—with certain
minor exceptions—will have up to 24 hours (“T+24 hours”) after the time of execution to report
a transaction. The registered SDR that receives the transaction information would then be
required to publicly disseminate a report of the transaction immediately thereafter.

462

15 U.S.C. 78m(m)(1)(E).

463

15 U.S.C. 78m(m)(1)(E)(iv).

464

These statutory mandates apply only with respect to cleared security-based swaps. The
Dodd-Frank Act does not require the Commission to specify block thresholds or
dissemination delays or to take into account how public disclosure will materially reduce
market liquidity with respect to uncleared security-based swaps. For security-based
swaps that are not cleared but are reported to an SDR or the Commission under Section
3C(a)(6) of the Exchange Act, “the Commission shall require real-time public reporting
for such transactions, in a manner that does not disclose the business transactions and
market positions of any person.” 15 USC 78m(1)(C)(iii).

201

The Commission recognizes that the introduction of mandated post-trade transparency in
the security-based swap market could have a significant impact on market participant behavior
and the provision of liquidity. The interim phase is designed, among other things, to generate
information about how market participants behave in an environment with post-trade
transparency. Furthermore, once the first phase is implemented, reporting sides will be required
under Regulation SBSR to report, among other things, the time of execution of their securitybased swap transactions. As described in a staff analysis of the inventory management of dealers
in the market for single-name CDS based on transaction data from DTCC-TIW, security-based
swap transaction data currently stored in DTCC-TIW include the time of reporting, but not the
time of the execution. 465 Having the execution time instead of only the reporting time will
enable staff to perform a more robust and granular analysis of any hedging that may or may not
occur within the first 24-hour period after execution. After collecting and analyzing data that are
more granular and reflect the reactions of market participants to T+24 hour post-trade
transparency, the Commission anticipates that it will undertake further rulemaking to propose
and adopt rules related to block trades and the reporting and public dissemination timeframe for
non-block trades.
A.

Proposed Rules Regarding Block Trades

The Commission did not propose specific thresholds for block trades in the Regulation
SBSR Proposing Release. Instead, the Commission described general criteria that it would
consider when setting specific block trade thresholds in the future. 466 The Commission stated
465

See “Inventory risk management by dealers in the single-name credit default swap
market” (October 17, 2014) at 5, available at http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-3410/s73410-184.pdf (“Hedging Analysis”).

466

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75228.

202

that it “preliminarily believes that the general criteria for what constitutes a large notional
security-based swap transaction must be specified in a way that takes into account whether
public disclosure of such transactions would materially reduce market liquidity, but presumably
should be balanced by the general mandate of Section 13(m)(1) of the Exchange Act, which
provides that data on security-based swap transactions must be publicly disseminated in real
time, and in a form that enhances price discovery.” 467 The Commission further stated: “For
post-trade transparency to have a negative impact on liquidity, market participants would need to
be affected in a way that either: (1) Impacted their desire to engage in subsequent transactions
unrelated to the first; or (2) impacted their ability to follow through with further actions after the
reported transaction has been completed that they feel are a necessary consequence of the
reported transaction.” 468
The Commission noted, with respect to the first case, that post-trade dissemination of
transaction prices could lead to narrower spreads and reduce participants’ willingness to trade.
However, the Commission noted that liquidity could be enhanced if market participants
increased their trading activity as a result of the new information. Because it would be difficult,
if not impossible, to estimate with certainty which factor would prevail in the evolving securitybased swap market, the Commission was guided by the general mandate of Section 13(m)(1) and
the Commission’s preliminary belief that even in illiquid markets, transaction prices form the
foundation of price discovery. 469 Therefore, the Commission proposed that prices for block
trades be disseminated in the same fashion as prices for non-block transactions.

203

The Commission noted that, in the second case, counterparties may intend to take further
action after an initial transaction for hedging purposes. The Commission believed that, for a
transaction that was sufficiently large, disseminating the size of such a transaction could signal to
the market that there is the potential for another large transaction in a particular security-based
swap or related security. 470 Therefore, in order to give the market time to absorb any subsequent
transactions, the Commission stated that it preliminarily believed that the size of a sufficiently
large transaction should be suppressed for a certain period of time to provide time for subsequent
transactions. 471
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission noted a variety of metrics
that could be used to determine whether a security-based swap transaction should be considered
a block trade. 472 They included: (1) the absolute size of the transaction; (2) the size of the
transaction relative to other similar transactions; (3) the size of the transaction relative to some
measure of overall volume for that security-based swap instrument; and (4) the size of the
470

472

The Commission considered several tests including a percentage test (the top N-percent
of trade would be considered block) and set forth data from the Depository Trust Clearing
Corporation (“DTCC”) regarding single-name corporate CDS and single name sovereign
CDS. The Commission noted that the observed trade sizes would suggest certain cut-off
points when considering single-name corporate CDS or sovereigns as a whole. The
Commission also noted, however, that there may still be differences in liquidity between
individual corporates and sovereigns, as well as linkages between the underlying cash
markets and the CDS markets that a simple percentage or threshold test would not
capture. In addition, the Commission’s Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial
Innovation (which has been renamed the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis)
prepared an analysis of several different block trade criteria in January 2011, based on the
same DTCC data. The analysis examined fixed minimum notional amount thresholds;
dynamic volume-based thresholds based on the aggregate notional amount of all
executions in a CDS instrument over the past 30 calendar days; and a combination of
dynamic volume-based thresholds and fixed minimum thresholds of $10 and $25 million,
respectively. See id. at 75230-31.

204

transaction relative to some measure of overall volumes for the security or securities underlying
the security-based swap. 473 The Commission stated that the metric should be chosen in a way
that minimizes inadvertent signaling to the market of potential large follow-on transactions. 474
Although the Commission did not propose block thresholds, the Commission did propose
two “waves” of public dissemination of block trades for when it had adopted block thresholds.
Rule 902(b), as proposed and re-proposed, would have required a registered SDR to publicly
disseminate a transaction report of a security-based swap that constitutes a block trade
immediately upon receipt of information about the block trade from the reporting party. The
transaction report would have been required to consist of all the information reported pursuant to
Rule 901(c)—except for the notional amount—plus the transaction ID and an indicator that the
report represents a block trade. The second wave would have required the registered SDR to
publicly disseminate a complete transaction report for the block trade (including the transaction
ID and the full notional amount) between 8 and 26 hours after the execution of the block trade.
Thus, under Rule 902(b), as proposed and re-proposed, market participants would have learned
the price and all other primary trade information (except notional amount) about a block trade in
real time, and the full notional amount of the transaction on a delayed basis. 475 Registered SDRs
would have been responsible for calculating the specific block thresholds based on the formula
established by the Commission and publicizing those thresholds, but the Commission

473

474

475

Rule 902(b)(3), as proposed and re-proposed, would have provided that, if a registered

concerning a block trade, the registered SDR would be required to disseminate the
information immediately upon re-opening.

emphasized that a registered SDR would be performing “mechanical, non-subjective
calculations” when determining block trade thresholds. 476
The Commission proposed and re-proposed a variety of other provisions related to block
trades. Proposed Rule 900 defined “block trade” to mean a large notional security-based swap
transaction that satisfied the criteria in Rule 907(b). Proposed Rule 907(b) would have required
a registered SDR to establish and maintain written policies and procedures for calculating and
publicizing block trade thresholds for security-based swaps in accordance with the criteria and
formula for determining block size specified by the Commission. Proposed Rule 907(b)(2) also
would have provided that a registered SDR should not designate as a block trade: (1) any
security-based swap that is an equity total return swap or is otherwise designed to offer risks and
returns proportional to a position in the equity security or securities on which the security-based
swap is based; or (2) any security-based swap contemplated by Section 13(m)(1)(C)(iv) of the
Exchange Act. 477

Potential Impact on Liquidity

The Commission received several comments addressing the issue of timing for public
dissemination and the potential impact of public dissemination on liquidity. The commenters
vary significantly in their views on this issue. One commenter stated that the proposed
timeframes for publicly disseminating security-based swap transaction reports would not
materially reduce market liquidity. 478 Another commenter, however, expressed the view that

15 USC 78m(m)(1)(C)(iv) (“With respect to security-based swaps that are determined to

Commission shall require real-time public reporting for such transactions”).

206

“[t]here is insufficient liquidity in the single-name credit default swap market to support realtime public dissemination of non-block transaction data for all but a handful of instruments
without creating price moving events.” 479 A third commenter expressed concern that real-time
security-based swap reporting, “if implemented without adequate safeguards, could
unnecessarily increase the price of entering into a derivatives contract to hedge risk” 480 and
cautioned that requiring real-time reporting of thinly traded products in illiquid markets in an
effort to compel derivatives to trade similarly to exchange-listed products represented “a
fundamentally flawed approach that demonstrates a lack of understanding of the existing market
structure.” 481 A fourth commenter expressed concern about the impact of real-time post-trade
transparency for illiquid security-based swaps on pre-trade transparency that currently exists in
the form of indicative prices provided by dealers to their clients (known as “runs”). 482 This
commenter requested that the Commission provide illiquid security-based swaps with an
exception from real-time reporting and instead allow for delays roughly commensurate with the
trading frequency of the security-based swap. 483

482

See ISDA IV at 14 (expressing concern that the combination of name-attributed runs and
a rapidly disseminated set of post-trade information would make it relatively easy for
many participants to reconstruct the identity of parties to a particular transaction, which
might reduce dealers’ willingness to disseminate pre-trade price information in the form
of runs, thereby reducing pre-trade transparency).

483

See id., note 21 (stating, for example, that a 24-hour delay would be appropriate for a
security-based swap that trades, on average, once per day, and security-based swap that
trades 10 times per day could be reported in real time).

207

In addition, several commenters raised concerns about the effect of an improperly
designed block trade regime. 484 One commenter stated that an appropriate block exemption is
critical to the successful implementation of Title VII. 485 Several commenters expressed the view
that improper block thresholds or definitions would adversely impact liquidity. 486 One
commenter noted that the SEC and CFTC’s proposed block trade rules would adversely impact
liquidity. 487 By contrast, one commenter recommended that the Commission consider that
increased transparency of trades that are large relative to the liquidity of the product may attract
new entrants to the market and may result in increased liquidity. 488
The Commission has considered these comments as well as the statutory requirement that
the Commission rule for public dissemination of security-based swap transactions contain
provisions that “take into account whether the public disclosure [of transaction and pricing data

for security-based swaps] will materially reduce market liquidity.” 489 The Commission is
adopting these final rules for regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based
swaps with a view toward implementing additional rules in one or more subsequent phases to
define block thresholds and to revisit the timeframes for reporting and public dissemination of
block and non-block trades. This approach is designed to increase post-trade transparency in the
security-based swap market—even in its initial phase—while generating new data that could be
studied in determining appropriate block thresholds after the initial phase. The Commission also
considered several comments related to the timing of public dissemination and believes that at
present the commenters’ concerns are appropriately addressed by the Commission’s adoption of
T+24 hour reporting during the interim phase.
During this phase, the reporting side will have up to 24 hours after the time of execution
of a security-based swap transaction to report it to a registered SDR, regardless of its notional
amount. 490 The registered SDR will be required, for all dissemination-eligible transactions, 491 to
publicly disseminate a report of the transaction immediately upon receipt of the information.
Even with the T+24 reporting of transactions, the Commission anticipates being able to collect
significant new information about how market participants behave in an environment with post-

489

15 U.S.C. 78m(m)(1)(E). However, this mandate applies only with respect to cleared
security-based swaps. No provision of Title VII requires the Commission to specify
block thresholds or dissemination delays, or to take into account how public disclosure
will materially reduce market liquidity, for uncleared security-based swaps.

490

For a security-based swap that is subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination
solely by operation of Rule 908(a)(1)(ii), however, a reporting side is required to report
the information required under Rules 901(c) and 901(d) within 24 hours of acceptance for
clearing. See Rule 901(j); Section XV(C)(4), infra.

trade transparency, which will inform the Commission’s analysis and effort to determine what
block thresholds and time delays may be appropriate.
In developing a regulatory regime for post-trade transparency in the security-based swap
market, the Commission is cognizant of rules adopted by the CFTC to provide for post-trade
transparency in the swap market. Commission staff analyzed the effect of the adoption of posttrade transparency in the swap market, which is regulated by the CFTC. 492 That analysis shows
no discernible empirical evidence of economically meaningful effects of the introduction of posttrade transparency in the swap market at this time. In particular, the study did not find negative
effects such as reduced trading activity. Based on this analysis, the Commission believes that
post-trade transparency does not seem to have a negative effect on liquidity and market activity
in the swap market. 493

T+24 Hour Reporting for All Transactions

The Commission initially proposed to require reporting to a registered SDR of the
primary trade information of all security-based swaps “as soon as technologically practicable,
but in no event later than 15 minutes after the time of execution of the security-based swap
transaction.” 494 For all dissemination-eligible transactions other than block trades, the registered

available at http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-34-10/s73410-183.pdf (“Analysis of PostTrade Transparency”). See also infra Sections XXII(C)(2)(b), XXII(C)(2)(c),
XXII(C)(3)(a), and XXII(D)(4)(b). The one comment that the Commission received on
the Analysis of Post-Trade Transparency did not directly address the staff’s analysis.
This comment is discussed in notes 688 and 1011, infra.

See Analysis of Post-Trade Transparency at 1 (“While we acknowledge that there are
significant differences between the index [credit default swap] market and the securitybased swap market, the data analysis presented here may enhance the Commission’s

the security‐based swap market”).

SDR would have been required to publicly disseminate a report of the transaction immediately
and automatically upon receipt of the transaction. As proposed, block trades would have been
subject to two-part dissemination: (1) an initial report with suppressed notional amount
disseminated in real-time; and (2) a full report including notional amount disseminated between
8 to 26 hours after execution. 495
Commenters expressed mixed views regarding the proposed reporting timeframes. Two
commenters generally supported them. 496 However, several commenters stated that, at least in
the near term, it would be difficult to comply with the reporting timeframes as proposed. 497 One
of these commenters argued, for example, that the benefits of providing security-based swap
information within minutes of execution did not outweigh the infrastructure costs of building a

495

Rule 902(b)(1), as proposed and re-proposed, would have provided: “If the securitybased swap was executed on or after 05:00 UTC and before 23:00 UTC of the same day,
the transaction report [for the block trade] (including the transaction ID and the full
notional amount) shall be disseminated at 07:00 UTC of the following day.” Proposed
Rule 902(b)(2) would have provided: “If the security-based swap was executed on or
after 23:00 UTC and up to 05:00 UTC of the following day, the transaction report
(including the transaction ID and the full notional size) shall be disseminated at 13:00
UTC of that following day.” Those block trades executed at the end of each window
would receive an 8 hour dissemination delay and those blocks executed at 5:00 UTC
would receive a 26 hour dissemination delay. The delay for all other block trades would
vary between 8 and 26 hours, depending on the time of execution.

496

See FINRA Letter at 2 (supporting the Commission’s proposal to require reporting as
soon as technologically practicable, but in no event later than 15 minutes after the time of
execution); Barnard I at 3 (recommending full post-trade transparency as soon as
technologically and practicably feasible, with an exemption permitting delayed reporting
for block trades).

mechanism to report in real time, particularly given the likelihood of errors. 498 Another
commenter expressed concern that “the 15 minute limit is not technologically practicable under
existing communications and data infrastructure.” 499
Commenters also advocated that the Commission phase-in reporting deadlines over time,
similar to the implementation model for TRACE, to allow regulators to assess the impact of posttrade transparency on the security-based swap market. 500 One commenter noted that phased-in
implementation would allow regulators to assess the impact of transparency on the securitybased swap market and make adjustments, if necessary, to the timing of dissemination and the
data that is disseminated. 501 Other commenters echoed the belief that a phased approach would
allow the Commission to assess the impact of public reporting on liquidity in the security-based
swap market, monitor changes in the market, and adjust the reporting rules, if necessary. 502

permitted. See DTCC II at 9-10.

Three commenters recommended a 24-hour delay for reporting block trades, 503 and one
recommended a delay of at least five days with an indefinite delay of full notional size. 504 Of
those commenters, two also suggested that the delay could be reduced or refined after the
Commission gathers additional information about the security-based swap market. 505 In
contrast, two commenters recommended block delays as short as 15 minutes. 506 In addition,
several commenters opposed two-part transaction reporting for block trades. These commenters
believed that all information about a block trade, including the notional amount of the
transaction, should be subject to a dissemination delay to provide liquidity providers with

adequate time to hedge their positions. 507 Two commenters recommended initially setting block
sizes low and over time collecting data to determine an appropriate block trade size. 508
In addition, Commission staff has undertaken an analysis of the inventory management of
dealers in the market for single-name CDS based on transaction data from DTCC-TIW. 509 The
analysis, in line with prior studies of hedging in this market, 510 shows that, after most large
transactions between a dealer and customer are executed, dealers do not appear to hedge
resulting exposures by executing offsetting transactions (either with other dealers or other
customers) in the same single-name CDS. In instances where dealers appear to hedge resulting
exposures following a large trade in single-name CDS written on the same reference entity, they
generally do so within a maximum of 24 hours after executing the original trade.
One commenter responded to this analysis, asserting that dealers, rather than hedging
security-based swap exposures using offsetting transactions in the same instruments, might

See Kathryn Chen, et al., Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report, An Analysis
of CDS Transactions: Implications for Public Reporting (September 2011), available at

2014. See also http://www.dtcc.com/repository-otc-data.aspx, last visited September 22,
2014. This study uses an earlier sample of DTCC-TIW transaction data to identify
hedging of transactions in single-name CDS. They find little evidence of hedging via
offsetting trades in the same instrument and conclude by saying that “requiring same day
reporting of CDS trading activity may not significantly disrupt same day hedging
activity, since little such activity occurs in the same instrument.”

214

choose instead to hedge their security-based swap exposures in related assets, and that these
types of hedging behaviors were not measured in the Commission staff analysis. The commenter
further suggested that the use of cross-market hedges could be particularly important for
transactions in single-name CDS that are especially illiquid. 511 The Commission acknowledges
that the staff’s analysis was limited to same-instrument hedging. 512 However, the Commission
notes that, to the extent that security-based swap positions can be hedged using other assets—as
the commenter suggests—these additional opportunities would suggest that dealers would likely
need less time to hedge than if hedging opportunities existed only within the security-based swap
market.
In view of these comments and the staff analysis, the Commission is modifying
Regulation SBSR’s timeframes for reporting security-based swap transaction information as
follows. First, Rules 901(c) and 901(d), as adopted, require reporting sides to report the
information enumerated in those rules “within the timeframe specified in paragraph (j) of this
section”—i.e., by Rule 901(j). Rule 901(j), as adopted, provides that the reporting timeframe for
Rules 901(c) and 901(d) shall be “within 24 hours after the time of execution (or acceptance for
511

See ISDA IV at 15 (stating that “participants may enter into risk mitigating transactions
using other products that are more readily available at the time of the initial trade (for
example CD index product [sic], CDS in related reference entities, bonds or loans issued
by the reference entity or a related entity, equities or equity options)”). In addition, the
commenter stated that it “interprets the data in the study to imply that such temporary
hedges in other asset classes (rather than offsetting transactions in the precise reference
entity originally traded) are the norm for an illiquid market.” See id.

512

See Chen et al., supra note 510, at 6. Like the Chen et al. report, which was cited by the
commenter, the Commission staff analysis did not incorporate data that would allow it to
identify hedging in corporate bonds or equities, because appropriate data were not
available. The commenter did not provide any analysis, rationale, or data demonstrating
how public dissemination of a single-name CDS transaction within 24 hours would
negatively impact a dealer from being able to hedge this exposure in another market, such
as a broad-based CDS index.

215

clearing in the case of a security-based swap that is subject to regulatory reporting and public
dissemination solely by operation of § 242.908(a)(1)(ii)), or, if 24 hours after the time of
execution or acceptance for clearing, as applicable, would fall on a day that is not a business day,
by the same time on the next day that is a business day.” Under Rule 902(a), as adopted, the
registered SDR that receives the transaction report from the reporting side is required, as
proposed and re-proposed, to publicly disseminate a report of that transaction immediately upon
receipt. The Commission believes that this approach will improve post-trade transparency and
respond to commenters’ concerns. In particular, the Commission believes that this approach
addresses concerns relating to potential market impact, the ability to report in real time, and the
length of delay for dissemination of block trade information. 513 Thus, the T+24 hour approach is
designed to improve post-trade transparency in the security-based swap market in the near term,
while generating additional data that the Commission can evaluate in considering appropriate
treatment of block trades.
At this time, the Commission is not adopting the provisions of proposed and re-proposed
Rule 902 that would have provided for real-time public dissemination of non-block trades.
However, the Commission is adopting, substantially as proposed and re-proposed, what was
originally designed to be the second wave of block dissemination—i.e., disseminating the full
trade details, including the true notional amount, at one of two points in the day (either 07:00 or
13:00 UTC) after an initial report of the transaction (without the notional amount) had been

513

Although two commenters advocated shorter block trade delays, the Commission
believes that it would be prudent to allow for the accumulation of additional data about
the effect of post-trade transparency on the security-based swap market before
considering shorter reporting and dissemination timeframes for block trades. The
Commission may consider shorter timeframes in the future but believes that it is neither
necessary nor appropriate to adopt these commenters’ recommendations at this time.

216

disseminated in real time. 514 The Commission is now simplifying that approach by eliminating
the idea of “batch dissemination” at two points during the day, and instead allowing for T+24
hour reporting for all transactions, regardless of the time of execution. Furthermore, in the
absence of a standard to differentiate block from non-block transactions, the Commission
believes that it is appropriate to require the same T+24 hour reporting for all transactions. 515
This interim phase is designed to allow the accumulation of empirical data and is
consistent with various comments that emphasized the need for further study and analysis of
empirical data prior to establishing block trading rules. 516 Several commenters noted that

514

See Rule 902(b), as proposed and re-proposed.

515

As discussed in more detail in Section VII(B)(3), infra, if 24 hours after the time of
execution would fall on a non-business day (i.e., a Saturday, Sunday, or U.S. federal
holiday), reporting would instead be required by the same time on the next business day.

516

See ABC Letter at 7-8; CCMR I at 4 (“The Commission should set the thresholds low at
first in order to collect data that will enable them to make informed decisions about the
final delay and threshold determinations”); Institutional Investors Letter at 4-5 (stating, in
reference to the CFTC’s proposed rules, that the marketplace currently lacks sufficient
collection and analysis of swap trading data to establish block trade thresholds); ICI II at
8 (“We agree with the SEC that it should defer its proposed rulemaking regarding block
thresholds until after SDRs register with the SEC and the SEC begins to receive and
analyze data required to be reported under the final rules or until after SB swap
transaction information begins to be publicly reported”); MFA I at 4 (recommending that
the Commission study and obtain empirical evidence to determine block trade definitions
for each asset class to assure that the final rules do not disrupt the markets or reduce
liquidity); ISDA/SIFMA I at 4-5 (recommending significant detailed research, including
independent academic research, before determining block size thresholds and reporting
delays for particular security-based swap transactions); ISDA/SIFMA II at 8 (stating that
market-based research and analysis should be employed to provide the basis for the
determination of well-calibrated block trading exemption rules); SIFMA II at 8 (“Until a
liquid SBS trading market develops on SB-SEFs and exchanges, the Commission will not
be able to make informed decisions on the definition of a block or an appropriate public
reporting time frame. For the same reason, real-time reporting should be implemented
gradually. Block trade thresholds should be set at a low level at first, such that many
trades are treated as blocks, and raised slowly by the Commission when doing so is
supported by market data”). But see SDMA Letter at 3 (stating that swap transaction data
are available today and block trade thresholds could be established without delay).

217

implementing the rules requiring reporting to registered SDRs prior to the block trading rules
would provide security-based swap transaction data (in addition to historical data) that could be
used in the formation of block trade thresholds. 517 One of these commenters stated, for example,
that it would be premature to adopt block trade thresholds prior to the commencement of
reporting to registered SDRs because SDR reporting would increase the amount of information
available across various markets and asset classes. 518 Commenters also recommended several
methods for obtaining and analyzing empirical data, 519 including independent academic
research 520 and a review of a statistically significant data set for each security-based swap
category. 521
Although more data and analyses about executed transactions are now available than
when the Commission originally issued the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 522 these data
provide limited insights into how post-trade transparency might affect market behavior if
executed transactions were to become publicly known on a real-time or near-real-time basis. 523

See ICI II at 8 (“Any data on which the SEC could rely currently to develop a

negative effects of post-trade transparency in other securities markets. See ISDA/SIFMA
218

The Commission has information from DTCC-TIW about most CDS trades over the past few
years 524 and can analyze the frequency of execution and the notional trade sizes. However, the
Commission believes that these data permit only speculative inferences about the potential
market impact of those trades being made public. Currently, there is little post-trade
transparency in the security-based swap market, so the current trading generally is informed only
imperfectly, if at all, about earlier trading.
Several aspects of the Commission’s adopted rules are designed to help facilitate the
collection of data relating to how post-trade transparency affects market behavior. The
Commission is adopting, as re-proposed, the requirement that the trade report include the time of
execution and the requirement that the registered SDR mark the time that it receives the trade
report. These requirements are designed to help inform the Commission as to the length of time
between the execution of a transaction and when the transaction is reported to a registered SDR,
which should provide useful data to the Commission in analyzing trends in reporting timeframes.
These timeframes would provide some insight into the beliefs of market participants regarding
the length of the reporting delay that they deem necessary to minimize the market impact of a
transaction. Observing trades being reported to a registered SDR with varying delays after
execution could provide the Commission with greater insight as to what market participants
consider to be market-impacting trades. Further, the Commission believes that this approach

negatively impacted markets, including the Canadian stock markets and the London
Stock Exchange); J.P. Morgan Letter at 2-4 (stating that anecdotal evidence reported in

as a result of TRACE reporting, and that adverse impacts could be more substantial for
CDS).

would address, during the interim phase, the concerns of the commenters who believed that a
public dissemination regime with inappropriately low block trade thresholds could harm market
liquidity, and those who argued that market participants would need an extended period of time
to comply with the requirements to report within shorter timeframes.
Although any participant could take the full 24 hours to report a given trade, there may be
incentives to submit trade reports in substantially less than 24 hours. The Commission
understands that, in some cases, entities that are likely to become SB SEFs (“pre-SEFs”) may
want to broadcast trades executed electronically across their platforms to all subscribers in order
to catalyze trading by other counterparties at the same price. 525 This “work-up” process,
according to a commenter, is designed to foster liquidity in the security-based swap market and
to facilitate the execution of larger-sized transactions. 526 If pre-SEFs and their participants want
to continue their current practices and broadcast a subset of their executed trades across the
platform in real time to facilitate work-ups, they will be subject to Rule 902(d), which embargos
transaction information until the information is transmitted to a registered SDR. 527 Therefore,
any pre-SEF or user of a pre-SEF that wants to continue to have real-time information about a
completed trade broadcast as part of a work-up must ensure that the initial transaction is reported
to a registered SDR no later than the time at which it is broadcast to users of the pre-SEF.
In response to commenters who advocated shorter reporting time frames or block trade
delays, the Commission notes that it anticipates further refining the reporting timeframes when it
proposes and implements final block trade rules, at which point reporting sides will have had

220

more time to test and implement their reporting systems and processes. This approach was
recommended by several commenters. 528
2.

Reporting Timeframe for Trades Executed Prior to Weekends or U.S.
Federal Holidays

While most transactions will have 24 hours within which to be reported, Rule 901(j) also
provides that, “if 24 hours after the time of execution would fall on a day that is not a business
day, [the transaction must be reported] by the same time on the next day that is a business day.”
The Commission’s intent is to afford security-based swap counterparties—during the interim
phase—the equivalent of at least an entire business day to hedge their positions, if they so desire,
before the transaction must be reported and publicly disseminated. Without clarifying that,
during the interim phase, reporting requirements fall only on business days, for a transaction
executed on the day before a weekend or holiday, the counterparties would have less than the
number of business hours of a regular business day to hedge a transaction if reporting were
required within 24 hours of execution.
The Commission is also adopting a definition of “business day” to clarify the “not a
business day” provision. “Business day” is defined in Rule 900(f) as “a day, based on U.S.
Eastern Time, other than a Saturday, Sunday, or a U.S. federal holiday.” Counterparties to the

528

See Institutional Investors Letter at 4 (recommending that the CFTC collect market data
for one year before adopting rules relating to block trades); MFA II, Recommended
Timeline at 4; WMBAA III at 6; FIA/FSF/ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 6 (appropriate block
trade thresholds, and therefore real-time reporting requirements, can be established only
after the commencement of SDR reporting to regulators and careful analysis of securitybased swap market transaction data). This approach is also broadly consistent with the
implementation of the TRACE system, which shortened reporting requirements over
time. Several commenters recommended a phased reporting approach analogous to
TRACE. See CCMR I at 2; Cleary II at 20; DTCC II at 9-10; FINRA Letter at 4-5;
ISDA/SIFMA I at 10; ISDA/SIFMA Block Trade Study at 2; UBS Letter at 2-3;

trade may be in different time zones and/or jurisdictions; in the absence of Rule 900(f) there
could be confusion about whether the “not a business day” provision referred to the jurisdiction
and time zone of one side or the jurisdiction and time zone of the other. Because Regulation
SBSR is designed to implement Title VII’s regulatory reporting and public dissemination
requirements for the U.S. security-based swap market, the Commission is designating U.S.
Eastern Time (which may be either Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Time) as the time
zone on which the reporting side should base its reporting for purposes of Rules 900(f) and
901(j). The Commission also is excluding U.S. federal holidays from the definition of “business
day.” The following examples are designed to help explain the application of this provision:
•

Example 1. A trader executes a trade at 04:59 UTC on Friday (11:59 p.m. EST
on Thursday). This particular Friday is not a U.S. federal holiday. The reporting
side must report by 04:59 UTC on Saturday (11:59 p.m. EST on Friday).

•

Example 2. A trader executes a trade at 05:01 UTC on Friday (12:01 a.m. EST on
Friday). The reporting side must report by 05:01 UTC on Monday (12:01 a.m.
EST on Monday), provided that this particular Monday is not a U.S. federal
holiday.

•

Example 3. A trader executes a trade at 14:42 UTC on Friday (9:42 a.m. EST on
Friday). The reporting side must report by 14:42 UTC on Monday (9:42 a.m.
EST on Monday), provided that this particular Monday is not a U.S. federal
holiday.

•

Example 4. A trader executes a trade at 13:42 UTC on Friday (9:42 a.m. EDT on
Friday). The following Monday is Labor Day, a U.S. federal holiday. The

222

reporting party must report by 13:42 UTC on Tuesday (9:42 a.m. EDT on
Tuesday).
•

Example 5. A trader executes a trade at 16:45 UTC on Wednesday, November
26, 2014 (11:45 a.m. EST on Wednesday, November 26, 2014). Thursday,
November 27, 2014 is Thanksgiving, a U.S. federal holiday. The reporting party
must report by 16:45 UTC on Friday, November 28, 2014 (11:45 a.m. EST on
Friday, November 28, 2014).

•

Example 6. A trader executes a trade at 16:45 UTC on a Wednesday (11:45 a.m.
EST on Wednesday). Thursday is not a U.S. federal holiday, but a large blizzard
causes emergency closures in New York City and several other U.S. cities. The
reporting party must report by 16:45 UTC on Thursday (11:45 a.m. EST on
Thursday).
3.

Other Revisions to Accommodate the Interim Phase

In addition to the changes noted above, the Commission is adopting the following
technical changes to Regulation SBSR to implement the interim phase of reporting and public
dissemination. First, the Commission is not adopting certain sections of rule text that referred to
block trades and marking those sections as “Reserved.” Rule 900(c), as re-proposed, would have
defined a “block trade” as a large notional security-based swap transaction that meets the criteria
set forth in proposed Rule 907(b). Rule 907(b), as proposed and re-proposed, would have
required a registered SDR to establish and maintain policies and procedures “for calculating and
publicizing block trade thresholds for all security-based swap instruments reported to the
registered security-based swap data repository in accordance with the criteria and formula for
determining block size as specified by the Commission.” Rule 907(b), as proposed and re-

223

proposed, also would have excluded equity TRS instruments and any security-based swap
contemplated by Section 13(m)(1)(C)(iv) of the Exchange Act 529 from the definition of “block
trade.” Because the Commission anticipates soliciting public comment on block thresholds and
other rules related to block trades—including what role (if any) registered SDRs should play in
calculating those thresholds—the Commission is not at this time defining the term “block trade”
in Rule 900(c) or adopting Rule 907(b). Similarly, because the Commission is not at this time
adopting the requirement to report in real time, the Commission is not adopting a definition of
“real time” in Rule 900.
Second, the Commission has determined not to utilize the term “security-based swap
instrument” 530 in Regulation SBSR. The Commission devised the original definition of
“security-based swap instrument” in connection with its overall analysis of the block trade issue.
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated its preliminary belief that it
would not be appropriate to establish different block trade thresholds for similar instruments with
different maturities. Thus, the proposed definition of “security-based swap instrument” did not
include any distinction based on tenor or date until expiration.531
One commenter discussed the concept of security-based swap instruments in the context
of its overall discussion of block trade issues. 532 The commenter argued that a different block
size threshold would have to be calculated for each category of security-based swap instrument,

529

15 U.S.C. 78m(m)(1)(C)(iv).

530

Proposed Rule 900 would have defined “security-based swap instrument” to mean “each
security-based swap in the same asset class, with the same underlying reference asset,
reference issuer, or reference index.” This definition was included, without change, in reproposed Rule 900(dd).

531

See 75 FR at 75231.

532

See CCMR I at 3.

224

so the boundaries of those categories would greatly impact market participants’ ability to engage
in block trading. The commenter recommended, therefore, that instruments be classified in as
few categories as possible. 533 Another commenter argued that the definition of “security-based
swap instrument” “should provide for more granular distinctions between different types of
transaction within a single asset class to avoid grouping together transactions with quite different
characteristics.” 534
The Commission anticipates soliciting public comment on block trade thresholds at a
later date. Because the initial intent of the term “security-based swap instrument” was to
delineate separate categories of security-based swaps that could have separate block trade
thresholds, the Commission is not adopting the term “security-based swap instrument” at this
time. The Commission anticipates soliciting public comment on whether and how to establish
different categories of security-based swaps—and what, if any, block thresholds and
dissemination delays will apply to those different categories—when it solicits comment on block
thresholds.
Further, proposed Rule 902(b) would have specified the delay for dissemination of
certain information about block trades to the public as well as what information a registered SDR
should disseminate immediately. Because the Commission anticipates that it will re-propose all
aspects of Regulation SBSR as they pertain to block trades, the Commission is not adopting Rule
902(b) at this time.
Rules 901(j), as adopted, require the reporting of both primary and secondary trade
information, respectively, for a security-based swap no later than 24 hours after the time of
533

225

execution (or acceptance for clearing in the case of a security-based swap that is subject to
regulatory reporting and public dissemination solely by operation of Rule 908(a)(1)(ii)), or, if 24
hours after the time of execution or acceptance for clearing, as applicable, would fall on a day
that is not a business day, by the same time on the next day that is a business day. Re-proposed
Rule 901(d)(2) would have required the reporting side to report what final Rule 901(d) now
terms the “secondary trade information” promptly, but in any event, no later than: (1) 15
minutes after the time of execution for a security-based swap that is executed and confirmed
electronically; (2) 30 minutes after the time of execution for a security-based swap that is
confirmed electronically but not executed electronically; or (3) 24 hours after the time of
execution for a security-based swap that is not executed or confirmed electronically. In
proposing these reporting timeframes, the Commission recognized that the amount of time
required for counterparties to report the information required under proposed Rule 901(d)(1)
depended upon, among other things, the extent to which the security-based swap was customized
and whether the security-based swap was executed or confirmed electronically or manually. 535
Generally, commenters’ views regarding the regulatory reporting timeframes in proposed
Rule 901(d)(2) were mixed. While some commenters expressed concerns that the proposed
timeframes were too lenient or incentivized slower technologies, 536 other commenters expressed

535

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75219. The Commission believed
that the information required under Rule 901(d)(1) would be available relatively quickly
for a security-based swap that was executed and confirmed electronically because most of
the required information would already be in an electronic format. On the other hand, the
Commission recognized that, for security-based swaps that are not executed or confirmed
electronically, additional time might be needed to systematize the information required
under Rule 901(d)(1) and put it into the appropriate format. See id.

536

See Better Markets I at 9 (noting that technology that would permit reporting within
much shorter timeframes is widely available, and that market participants routinely
adhere to much shorter timeframes for their own business and internal reporting);
226

the view that the reporting timeframes in proposed Rule 901(d)(2) were not practicable. 537 One
of these commenters noted the likelihood of errors if reporting timeframes were too short. 538
Another commenter urged the Commission to strike an appropriate balance between speed and
accuracy in establishing timeframes for regulatory reporting. 539 One commenter suggested that,
initially, the Rule 901(d) regulatory reporting timeframes should be set closer to current market
capability, with electronically confirmable trades reported within 24 hours. 540 This commenter
recommended a phase-in period to allow reporting parties to develop the necessary reporting
capabilities, after which time shorter timeframes could be implemented. 541
The Commission is not adopting the reporting timeframes proposed in Rule 901(d)(2),
and is therefore renumbering Rule 901(d)(1) as Rule 901(d). 542 Because Rule 901(j), as adopted,
allows reporting sides up to 24 hours to report the primary trade information pursuant to Rule
901(c) (or until the same time on the next business day if the trade occurs less than 24 hours
before a weekend or federal holiday), the Commission believes that it is appropriate also to
modify the timeframe for reporting the secondary trade information set forth in Rule 901(d) to
harmonize with the Rule 901(c) requirement. Although both the primary and secondary trade
Tradeweb Letter at 5 (different reporting timeframes based on the method of execution
potentially could create incentives for market participants not to take advantage of
available technology); SDMA I at 3 (stating, with reference to the CFTC’s proposed
rules, that different reporting timeframes based on method of execution could create a
‘race to the slowest’ among swap execution facilities, with market participants favoring
slower-reporting swap execution facilities over more efficient and transparent facilities).

information must be reported within 24 hours of the time of execution or acceptance for clearing,
as applicable (or until the same time on the next business day if the trade occurs less than 24
hours before a weekend or federal holiday), Rule 901 does not require that all of the information
enumerated in Rules 901(c) and 901(d) be provided in a single trade report. Thus, a reporting
side could, if permitted by the policies and procedures of the relevant registered SDR, make an
initial report of the primary trade information followed by a subsequent report containing
secondary trade information, so long as both reports were provided within the timeframe
prescribed by Rule 901(j). 543
The Commission acknowledges the issues raised by the commenters regarding the
proposed reporting timeframes, and, in particular, the concerns that unreasonably short reporting
timeframes would result in the submission of inaccurate transaction information. The
Commission believes that the 24-hour reporting timeframe being adopted in Rule 901(j) strikes
an appropriate balance, for the interim phase, between the need for prompt reporting of securitybased swap transaction information and allowing reporting entities sufficient time to develop fast
and robust reporting capability. The Commission notes that some commenters supported a 24hour reporting timeframe as consistent with existing industry reporting capability, 544 and

543

However, the registered SDR’s policies and procedures adopted under Rule 907(a)(1)
generally should explain to reporting sides how to report if all the security-based swap
transaction data required by Rules 901(c) and 901(d) is being reported simultaneously,
and how to report if responsive data are being provided at separate times. In the latter
case, the registered SDR should provide the reporting side with the transaction ID after
the reporting side reports the information required by Rule 901(c). The reporting side
would then include the transaction ID with its submission of data required by Rule
901(d), thereby allowing the registered SDR to match the Rule 901(c) report with the
subsequent Rule 901(d) report.

544

See DTCC II at 12; MFA at 5.

228

believes that this timeframe addresses commenters’ concerns that some elements of the required
information might not be available within the initially proposed reporting timeframes. 545
Finally, Rule 901(d)(2), as proposed and re-proposed, would have established reporting
timeframes based on whether a security-based swap is executed and/or confirmed electronically.
The term “confirm” appeared only in Rule 901(d)(2), as proposed and re-proposed. 546 Because
this term does not appear in Rule 901(d)(2), as adopted, the Commission has determined not to
adopt a definition for the term “confirm” in final Rule 900. 547
4.

Dissemination of Notional Amount

The Commission is mindful of comments expressing concern about dissemination of the
full notional amount for block trades. 548 For example, two commenters expressed the view that
disseminating the notional amount of a block trade could jeopardize the anonymity of the

545

See Cleary II at 15-16.

546

Rule 900(e), as re-proposed, defined “confirm” as “the production of a confirmation that
is agreed to by the parties to be definitive and complete and that has been manually,
electronically, or, by some other legally equivalent means, signed.”

547

One commenter suggested that the Commission use the term “issued,” rather than
“confirm” to better reflect existing market practice with respect to confirming the terms
of a security-based swap. See ISDA IV at 10. The deletion of the term “confirm” from
Regulation SBSR, as adopted, addresses this concern.

548

See Cleary II at 13 (“we would recommend that the SEC gather further data on the costs
and benefits of disclosing notional size before requiring such disclosure for all
transactions”); ISDA/SIFMA I at 5 (size of a block trade transaction should not be
disclosed at any time); ISDA/SIFMA II at 8 (same); ISDA/SIFMA Block Trade Study at
26-27 (noting that reporting of notional amounts of block trades will hamper the
execution of large-sized trades and recommending dissemination of capped volume
information); Phoenix Letter at 3; SIFMA I at 5; UBS Letter at 2 (arguing actual notional
amount of an illiquid security-based swap would provide information to the market about
potential hedging activity); WMBAA II at 7 (arguing that dissemination of the full
notional amount could jeopardize the anonymity of counterparties to the trade).

229

counterparties. 549 One commenter, who noted that TRACE never requires the dissemination of
the exact notional amount of block transactions, suggested that the Commission had not fully
explained its rationale for not adopting this approach for security-based swaps. 550 Numerous
commenters supported dissemination of the notional amount of block trades through a “masking”
or “size plus” convention comparable to that used by TRACE, in which transactions larger than a
specified size would be reported as “size plus.” 551
Under Rule 902(a), as adopted, a registered SDR is required to publicly disseminate (for
all dissemination-eligible transactions 552), immediately upon receipt of the transaction report, all
of the elements required by Rule 901(c), including the true notional amount of the transaction (as
opposed to a “capped” or “bucketed” notional amount). The Commission believes the T+24
hour approach during the interim phase should address commenters’ concerns about
disseminating the true notional amount of a transaction, including concerns about preserving the
anonymity of counterparties. 553 One commenter expressed concern about reporting blocks and
non-blocks in the same timeframe, which, the commenter stated, would prevent market
549

See WMBAA II at 7 (also noting that the result may be that counterparties are less
willing to engage in large transactions); Phoenix Letter at 3 (stating that reporting block
trades at the same time as non-block trades could jeopardize the anonymity of the block
trade).

550

See Cleary II at 13.

Phoenix Letter at 3; ISDA IV at 16.

552

See Rule 902(c) (requiring that certain types of security-based swaps not be publicly
disseminated).

553

One commenter appears to agree generally with this approach. See J.P. Morgan Letter at
14 (“‘un-masked’ trade-by-trade notional amounts should eventually be disseminated . . .
in order to facilitate analysis of market trends by market participants and the academic
community”).

230

participants from being able to hedge the trade. 554 The Commission believes that a 24-hour
timeframe for reporting of transaction information should address any concerns about
disseminating the true notional amount of any transaction and allow market participants who
choose to hedge adequate time to accomplish a majority of their hedging activity before
transaction data is publicly disseminated. 555 During the interim phase when no transaction must
be reported in less than 24 hours after execution, the Commission will be able to collect and
analyze transaction information to develop an understanding of how market participants are
reacting to the introduction of mandated post-trade transparency. The Commission expects to
study, among other things, the frequency with which security-based swap market participants
transact in non-standard notional amounts, and will attempt to observe whether the market reacts
differently to last-sale prints of any non-standard sizes versus more conventional sizes. Based on
such data and analysis, the Commission anticipates considering whether it may be appropriate to
establish notional caps or rounding conventions in disseminated reports.
5.

Analysis Period

As discussed in Section XXII(C)(3)(a), infra, during the interim phase, the Commission
will have access to more useful data about how different security-based swap trades of different
sizes and with different reporting delays might be affecting subsequent behavior in the market, as
well as any additional data and analysis that might be submitted by third parties. 556 Furthermore,
554

See Phoenix Letter at 3.

555

The Commission further notes that equity total return swaps are synthetic substitutes for
positions in the underlying equity security or securities; therefore, the Commission
believes that it would not be appropriate to allow masking for a synthetic substitute when
there is no masking exceptions to public dissemination in the cash equities markets.

556

See ICI II at 7 (“We also support the SEC re-opening for comment certain issues related
to block trades—such as the required time delays—in connection with the future SEC
proposal regarding how to define block trades”).
231

once implemented, reporting sides will be required under Regulation SBSR to submit their
security-based swap execution times to a registered SDR. As noted above, security-based swap
transaction data currently stored in DTCC-TIW includes the time of reporting but not the time of
the execution. 557 Having the execution time instead of only the reporting time will allow a more
robust and granular analysis of any hedging that may or may not occur within the first 24-hour
period after execution.
The Commission is directing its staff to use data collected during the interim phase to
publish a report for each asset class of security-based swaps assessing the impact of post-trade
transparency on that asset class. The Appendix to Rule 901 of Regulation SBSR sets forth the
guidelines for these reports, which must be completed no later than two years following the
initiation of public dissemination of SBS transaction data by the first registered SDR in each
asset class. 558
The completion of the staff’s report for an asset class will mark the beginning of an
analysis period, during which the Commission anticipates considering the report, any public
comments received on the report, and any other relevant data and information, including the
Commission’s original proposal to define “real time” in the context of Section 13(m) of the
Exchange Act to mean “as soon as technologically practicable, but in no event later than 15
minutes after the time of execution of a security-based swap transaction.” 559 Based on this
analysis, the Commission anticipates that it will prepare a proposal that would address, among
other things: (1) the criteria for determining what constitutes a large notional security-based

232

swap transaction (block trade) for particular markets and contracts; and (2) the appropriate time
delay for disseminating large notional security-based swap transactions (block trades) to the
public. 560 The Commission believes that the approach of studying security-based swap market
activity once post-trade transparency is implemented, but before adopting block trade rules,
accords with the recommendations of several commenters. 561

560

See 15 U.S.C. 78m(m)(1)(E)(ii)-(iii). The Commission anticipates that these proposed
rules also would address certain issues raised by commenters during the comment period
for Regulation SBSR. For example, several commenters proposed calculation
methodologies for block trade thresholds. See, e.g., Goldman Sachs Letter at 4-6;
ISDA/SIFMA I at 4; Better Markets I at 6; WMBAA II at 3; ISDA/SIFMA Block Trade
Study at 26; Cleary II at 14 (supporting various tests or methodologies for establishing
block trade thresholds). Commenters suggested various approaches for how often block
thresholds should be updated. See ISDA/SIFMA I at 5 (stating that block trade
thresholds should be updated at least every three months because liquidity in the OTC
markets may change quickly); ISDA/SIFMA II at 8 (stating that the block trading
exemption rules should be updated quarterly); ISDA/SIFMA Block Trade Study at 2
(stating that the reporting rules should be re-evaluated regularly to ensure that they reflect
the changing characteristics of the market); ICI I at 3 (stating that block trade thresholds
would need to be reviewed more than once a year to remain meaningful); WMBAA II at
5 (recommending that block trade thresholds be updated at appropriate intervals); MFA
III at 8 (stating that an SB SEF’s swap review committee should periodically determine
what constitutes a “block” for each security-based swap or security-based swap class that
the SF SEF trades). See also Barclays Letter at 5 (generally supporting a 30-calendar-day
look-back for determining block size thresholds).

561

See Institutional Investors Letter at 4 (recommending that the CFTC collect market data
for one year before adopting rules relating to block trades); MFA II, Recommended
Timeline at 4; WMBAA III at 6; FIA/FSF/ISDA/SIFMA Letter at 6 (appropriate block
trade thresholds, and therefore real-time reporting requirements, can be established only
after the commencement of SDR reporting to regulators and careful analysis of securitybased swap market transaction data). This approach is also broadly consistent with the
implementation of the TRACE system, which shortened reporting requirements over
time. Several commenters recommended a phased reporting approach analogous to
TRACE. See CCMR I at 2; Cleary II at 20; DTCC II at 9-10; FINRA Letter at 4-5;
ISDA/SIFMA I at 10; ISDA/SIFMA Block Trade Study at 2; UBS Letter at 2-3;

VIII. Reporting and Public Dissemination of Security-Based Swaps Involving Allocation
This section explains the application of Regulation SBSR to certain security-based swaps
executed by an asset manager on behalf of multiple clients—transactions involving what are
sometimes referred to as “bunched orders.” 562 To execute a bunched order, an asset manager
negotiates and executes a security-based swap with a counterparty, typically a security-based
swap dealer, on behalf of multiple clients. The bunched order could be executed on- or offplatform. The asset manager would allocate a fractional amount of the aggregate notional
amount of the transaction to each client, either at the time of execution or some time after
execution. Allocation results in the termination of the executed bunched order and the creation
of new security-based swaps between the security-based swap dealer and the accounts managed
by the asset manager. 563 By executing a bunched order, the asset manager avoids having to
negotiate the account-level transactions individually, and obtains exposure for each account on
the same terms (except, perhaps, for size).
A.

Discussion of Comments Received and Application of Regulation SBSR

In response to the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, one commenter stated that asset
managers commonly use bunched orders and allocations in the OTC derivatives market, and
recommended that publicly disseminating the execution of a bunched order—without the
562

The Commission recognizes that market participants may use a variety of other terms to
refer to such transactions, including “blocks,” “parent/child” transactions, and “splits.”
The Commission has determined to use a single term, “bunched orders,” for purposes of
this release, as this appears to be a widely accepted term. See, e.g., “Bunched orders
challenge SEFs,” MarketsMedia (March 25, 2014), available at
http://marketsmedia.com/bunched-orders-challenge-sefs/ (last visited September 22,
2014); “Cleared bunched trades could become mandatory rule,” Futures and Options
World (October 31, 2013) (available at http://www.fow.com/3273356/Cleared-bunchedtrades-could-become-mandatory-rule.html (last visited September 22, 2014).

563

In aggregate, the notional amount of the security-based swaps that result from the
allocation is the same as the notional amount of the executed bunched order.

234

allocation information—would satisfy the transparency objective of Title VII and be consistent
with TRACE reporting. 564 The commenter also expressed the view that the reporting party for a
bunched order execution should be obligated to report allocation information, which would be
necessary to indicate the final placement of risk derived from the initial trade. 565 The discussion
below explains how Regulation SBSR’s regulatory reporting and public dissemination
requirements apply to executed bunched orders that are subject to the reporting hierarchy in Rule
901(a)(2)(ii) and the security-based swaps that result from the allocation of these transactions, to
the extent that the resulting security-based swaps are not cleared. The Regulation SBSR
Proposed Amendments Release is proposing guidance for reporting platform-executed bunched
orders that will be submitted to clearing and security-based swaps that result from the allocation
of a bunched order if the resulting security-based swaps are cleared.
Regulation SBSR requires bunched order executions to be reported like other securitybased swaps. The reporting side for a bunched order execution subject to the reporting hierarchy
in Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) 566 must report the information required by Rules 901(c) and 901(d) for the
bunched order execution, including the notional amount of the bunched order execution, to a
registered SDR. 567 The information described in final Rule 901(c) will be publicly disseminated
under final Rule 902(a), like any other security-based swap transaction that does not fall within
564

See ISDA/SIFMA I at 7-8. See also ISDA IV at 10, 13 (asserting that the bunched order
execution could be disseminated publicly, but that post-allocation activities should be
excluded from public dissemination).

565

See id. at 8.

566

See supra Section V. A bunched order execution will be subject to this reporting
hierarchy unless it is executed on a platform and submitted to clearing.

567

Rule 901(d)(1) requires the reporting side for a security-based swap to report “the
counterparty ID or the execution agent ID of each counterparty, as applicable.” The
Commission notes that an asset manager acts as an execution agent for the clients that
receive allocations of an executed bunched order.

235

the enumerated exceptions to public dissemination in Rule 902(c). 568 The Commission believes
that it is appropriate to enhance price discovery, and thus consistent with the statutory provisions
governing public dissemination of security-based swaps, to require public dissemination of a
single transaction report showing the aggregate notional amount of the bunched order execution
(i.e., the size prior to allocation). 569 The public thereby will know the full size of the bunched
order execution and that this size was negotiated at a single price. The reporting side for a
bunched order execution also must report life cycle events for the bunched order execution—
including the termination of the executed bunched order that result from its allocation—to the
registered SDR that receives the initial report of the transaction.
When a bunched order execution is allocated, new security-based swaps are created that
must be reported to a registered SDR pursuant to Rule 901(a). To clarify that point, the
introductory language to final Rule 901(a) states that a “security-based swap, including a
security-based swap that results from the allocation, termination, novation, or assignment of
another security-based swap, shall be reported” as provided in the rest of the rule. 570 Reporting
of the security-based swaps resulting from the allocation of a bunched order execution should
assure that the Commission and other relevant authorities know the final placement of risk that
results from the bunched order execution. 571 As with any other security-based swap, the

568

See supra Section VI.

569

See 15 U.S.C. 13(m)(1)(B) (authorizing the Commission to make security-based swap
transaction and pricing data available to the public “in such form and at such times as the
Commission determines appropriate to enhance price discovery”).

570

See supra Section V(C)(5).

571

As stated above, allocation also results in the termination of the bunched order execution,
which is a life cycle event of the original transaction. This life cycle event must be
reported, in accordance with Rule 901(e), to the registered SDR that receives the report of
the original bunched order execution.

236

reporting side for a security-based swap resulting from an allocation is determined by Rule
901(a). Also, as with any other security-based swap, the reporting side must make the required
report within 24 hours of the time that the new security-based swap is created—not within 24
hours of the time of execution of the original bunched order. 572 Under Rule 901(d)(10), the
reporting side for a security-based swap resulting from an allocation must report the transaction
ID of the executed bunched order as part of the report of the new security-based swap. 573 This
requirement will allow the Commission and other relevant authorities to link a report of a
bunched order execution to the smaller security-based swaps that result from the allocation of the
bunched order execution. Because these related transactions can be linked across registered
SDRs using the transaction ID of the bunched order execution, the Commission believes that it is
not necessary or appropriate to require that the security-based swaps resulting from the allocation
be reported to the same registered SDR that received the transaction report of the original
transaction.
The Commission agrees with the commenters who recommended that publicly
disseminating the execution of a bunched order—without the allocation information—would
572

If 24 hours after the time of allocation would fall on a day that is not a business day, the
report of the security-based swaps resulting from the allocation would be due by the same
time on the next day that is a business day. See Rule 901(j). One commenter requested
that Regulation SBSR reflect that the timeframe for reporting security-based swaps
resulting from a bunched order execution commence upon receipt of the identity of the
counterparties to the bunched order execution by the reporting party during its own
business hours. See ISDA IV at 10. The Commission believes that the requirement that
the reporting side make the required report within 24 hours of the time that the new
security-based swap is created is responsive to this comment.

573

Rule 901(d)(10), as adopted, provides that, if a “security-based swap arises from the
allocation, termination, novation, or assignment of one or more existing security-based
swaps,” the reporting side must report “the transaction ID of the allocated, terminated,
assigned, or novated security-based swap(s),” subject to one exception that would not
apply to an allocation that is not submitted for clearing.

237

satisfy the transparency objective of Title VII. 574 Therefore, Regulation SBSR does not require a
registered SDR to publicly disseminate reports of the new security-based swaps that result from
an allocation. In fact, as described above, Rule 902(c)(7), as adopted, prohibits a registered SDR
from disseminating “[a]ny information regarding the allocation of a security-based swap.” 575
This approach also accords with the recommendation of the commenter who urged that the
aggregate notional amount prior to allocation be disseminated, rather than the individual
transaction sizes, in order to preserve anonymity of the asset manager and its clients. 576
The Commission notes that Rule 907(a)(1), as adopted, requires a registered SDR to
establish and maintain policies and procedures that, among other things, enumerate the specific
data elements of a security-based swap that must be reported. Registered SDRs should consider
describing, as part of these policies and procedures, the means by which persons with a duty to
report bunched order executions—and the new security-based swaps that result from the
allocation—must report the information required by Rules 901(c) and 901(d).
B.

Example: Reporting and Public Dissemination for an Uncleared Bunched
Order Execution

The following example demonstrates how Regulation SBSR applies to a bunched order
execution that will not be cleared and the security-based swaps that result from the allocation of
that bunched order execution. Assume that an asset manager, acting on behalf of several
investment fund clients, executes a bunched order with a registered security-based swap dealer.

574

See ISDA/SIFMA I at 7-8; ISDA IV at 10, 13.

575

See supra Section VI(D).

576

See MFA I at 2-3 (“Counterparties are often aware of an investment manager’s standard
fund allocation methodology and therefore, reporting transactions at the allocated level
. . . will make evident an allocation scheme that other participants can easily associate
with a particular investment manager”).

238

Assume that the transaction is not submitted to clearing and there are no indirect counterparties
on either side. The execution of the bunched order could occur either on a platform or not.
1.

Reporting the Executed Bunched Order

Under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii), as adopted, the registered security-based swap dealer is the
reporting side for the bunched order execution because only one side of the transaction includes
a registered security-based swap dealer. Under final Rules 901(c) and 901(d), the registered
security-based swap dealer has up to 24 hours after the time of execution of the bunched order to
report all applicable primary and secondary trade information to a registered SDR. The
registered security-based swap dealer must report the entire notional amount of the executed
bunched order as part of the Rule 901(c) primary trade information. 577 Rule 902(a) requires the
registered SDR to publicly disseminate a single last-sale print showing the aggregate notional
amount of the bunched order execution immediately upon receiving the report from the
registered security-based swap dealer.
2.

Reporting the Allocations

Regulation SBSR also requires reporting to a registered SDR of the security-based swaps
that result from allocation of the bunched order execution. 578 As the reporting side for the
executed bunched order, the registered security-based swap dealer must make a life cycle event
report, in accordance with Rule 901(e), to notify the registered SDR that received the report of
the executed bunched order that the trade has been allocated, which terminates the security-based
swap. Pursuant to Rule 901(a)(2)(ii), the registered security-based swap dealer also is the
577

See Rule 901(c)(4) (requiring reporting of the notional amount of a security-based swap
and the currency in which the notional amount is denominated).

578

See Rule 901(a) (requiring that a security-based swap, “including a security-based swap
that results from the allocation, termination, novation, or assignment of another securitybased swap shall be reported” as provided in the rest of the rule).

239

reporting side for each security-based swap resulting from allocation of the bunched order
execution because only one side of the transaction includes a registered security-based swap
dealer. 579 If the asset manager provides the allocation information to the registered securitybased swap dealer prior to or contemporaneous with the bunched order execution, the registered
security-based swap dealer could report the bunched order execution and the security-based
swaps that result from its allocation to a registered SDR at the same time. 580 If the asset manager
does not provide the allocation information to the registered security-based swap dealer until
some time after execution of the bunched order, the registered security-based swap dealer must
report each security-based swap resulting from the allocation within 24 hours of the allocation.
In either case, the reports of the security-based swaps resulting from the allocation of the
bunched order execution must include the counterparty IDs of each investment fund and the
notional amount of each security-based swap resulting from the allocation. In either case, Rule
901(d)(10) requires each report of a security-based swap resulting from the allocation to include
the transaction ID of the bunched order execution so that the Commission and other relevant
authorities will have the ability to link each resulting transaction with the initial bunched order
execution.
IX.

Inter-Affiliate Security-Based Swaps
A.

Background and Summary of Final Rule

579

The Commission assumes that the investment funds would not be registered securitybased swap dealers for purposes of these examples.

580

Even though the reports could be made at the same time, Rule 901(a) requires a report of
a bunched order execution and an associated allocation to be maintained as separate
records by a registered SDR because the execution of the bunched order and the
allocations are separate reportable security-based swap transactions.

240

Regulation SBSR, as initially proposed, did not contemplate any exception from
reporting for inter-affiliate security-based swaps. In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release,
the Commission expressed the preliminary view that a report of an inter-affiliate security-based
swap should be publicly disseminated with an indicator identifying the transaction as an interaffiliate security-based swap. 581 The Commission noted that, for such transactions, “there might
not be an arm’s length negotiation over the terms of the [security-based swap] transaction, and
disseminating a report of the transaction without noting that fact would be inimical to price
discovery.” 582 Rule 907(a)(4), as proposed, would have required a registered SDR to establish
and maintain written policies and procedures describing, among other things, how reporting
parties would report—and consistent with the enhancement of price discovery, how the
registered SDR would publicly disseminate—security-based swap transactions that do not
involve an opportunity to negotiate any material terms, other than the counterparty. 583
The Commission received several comments regarding inter-affiliate security-based
swaps in response to the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release and discussed those comments in
the Cross-Border Proposing Release. 584 Although the Cross-Border Proposing Release did not
propose to revise any portion of Regulation SBSR with regard to the treatment of inter-affiliate
security-based swaps, the Commission provided some preliminary thoughts on how Regulation
SBSR could be applied to them, particularly as regards to public dissemination, in a manner that
could address commenters’ concerns without taking the step of suppressing all inter-affiliate

transactions from public dissemination. 585 In response to the Cross-Border Proposing Release,
the Commission received additional comments, described below, regarding the application of
Regulation SBSR to inter-affiliate security-based swaps.
Regulation SBSR, as adopted, applies to all security-based swaps, including inter-affiliate
security-based swaps. The Commission has considered, but is not adopting, any exemption from
Regulation SBSR’s regulatory reporting or public dissemination requirements for inter-affiliate
security-based swaps. Therefore, Rules 901(c) and 901(d) require reporting of inter-affiliate
security-based swaps; Rule 901(i) requires reporting of historical inter-affiliate security-based
swaps; and Rule 902 requires public dissemination of inter-affiliate security-based swaps.
Furthermore, Rule 907(a)(4) requires a registered SDR to establish and maintain policies and
procedures that, among other things, identify characteristics of or circumstances associated with
the execution or reporting of a security-based swap that could, in the fair and reasonable
estimation of the registered SDR, cause a person without knowledge of such characteristics or
circumstances to receive a distorted view of the market. As discussed in Section VI(G), supra,
the Commission generally believes that a registered SDR should establish a flag for inter-affiliate
security-based swaps to help market observers better understand the information that is publicly
disseminated.
B.

Discussion of Comments
1.

Regulatory Reporting of Inter-Affiliate Security-Based Swaps

Most of the comments relating to inter-affiliate security-based swaps, in response to both
the initial proposal and the Cross-Border Proposing Release (which re-proposed Regulation
SBSR in its entirety), pertained to public dissemination. However, one commenter stated that,
585

See id. at 31071-72.

242

because inter-affiliate transactions should not be publicly disseminated, it also should be
unnecessary to “collect” information about them. 586 Another commenter on the Regulation
SBSR Proposing Release argued that, for a foreign entity registered as a bank holding company
and subject to the consolidated supervision of the Federal Reserve System, the reporting of interaffiliate transactions would be superfluous because the Federal Reserve has “ample authority to
monitor transactions among affiliates,” 587 suggesting that even regulatory reporting of interaffiliate security-based swaps should not be necessary. 588 In the Cross-Border Proposing
Release, the Commission specifically asked whether commenters believed that cross-border
inter-affiliate security-based swaps should be excluded from the regulatory reporting
requirements of Regulation SBSR and, if so, under what circumstances such security-based
swaps should be excluded. 589 No commenters on the Cross-Border Proposing Release responded
to this particular question pertaining to regulatory reporting.
The Commission continues to believe that the Commission and other relevant authorities
should have ready access to information about the specific counterparties that hold positions in
all security-based swaps subject to Regulation SBSR. While it is true that the Federal Reserve or
perhaps another relevant authority might exercise consolidated supervision over a group, such
supervision might not provide the Commission and other relevant authorities with current and
specific information about security-based swap positions held by the group’s subsidiaries. As a

See also Multiple Associations IV at 6 (stating that “many of the transaction-based
requirements in Title VII, such as. . . trade reporting rules, generally do not further

specifying whether the comment was with respect to regulatory reporting, public
dissemination, or both).

243

result, it would likely be more difficult for relevant authorities to conduct general market
analysis or surveillance of market behavior, and could present difficulties during a crisis, when
ready access to accurate and timely information about specific risk exposures might be crucial.
Furthermore, the statutory provisions that require regulatory reporting of security-based swap
transactions state that “each” security-based swap shall be reported; these statutory provisions do
not by their terms limit the reporting requirement to transactions having particular characteristics
(such as being negotiated at arm’s length). 590 Even absent these constraints, for the reasons
described above, the Commission does not believe that an exemption from regulatory reporting
for these transactions would be appropriate. Therefore, Regulation SBSR subjects inter-affiliate
security-based swaps to regulatory reporting. 591
2.

Public Dissemination of Inter-Affiliate Security-Based Swaps

As discussed below, some commenters raised concerns regarding the public
dissemination of inter-affiliate security-based swaps. After carefully considering the issues
raised by these commenters, the Commission has determined to adopt Regulation SBSR with no
590

Section 13A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m-1(a)(1), provides that each
security-based swap that is not accepted for clearing shall be subject to regulatory
reporting. Section 13(m)(1)(G) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(m)(1)(G), provides
that each security-based swap (whether cleared or uncleared) shall be reported to a
registered SDR.

591

In addition, one group of commenters acknowledged that “a number of rules that apply to
the core operations of a registered entity will perforce apply to such entity’s inter-affiliate
swap transactions and could further Dodd-Frank policy purposes.” Multiple Associations
Letter at 9. These commenters stated that inter-affiliate transactions would need to be
taken into account in calculating an entity’s capital requirements, and that internal
recordkeeping requirements are essential to the oversight of the security-based swap
business. See id. The Commission notes that regulatory reporting of all security-based
swaps, including inter-affiliate security-based swaps, will assist the Commission and
other relevant authorities in overseeing compliance with these capital and recordkeeping
requirements, as the regulatory report of an entity’s security-based swap activity could
provide an external check of the internal records of such entities’ positions and activities.

244

exemption from the public dissemination requirements for inter-affiliate security-based swaps.
As a preliminary matter, the Commission notes that, once a security-based swap
transaction has been reported to a registered SDR, the counterparties assume no additional
burdens associated with public dissemination of the transaction. That function will be carried
out solely by the registered SDR. Thus, requiring registered SDRs to publicly disseminate
security-based swaps, including inter-affiliate security-based swaps, will not increase the
compliance burden on security-based swap counterparties.
One commenter argued that inter-affiliate security-based swaps should not be subject to
public dissemination because “public reporting could confuse market participants with irrelevant
information” and suggested that “the Commissions collect data on these transactions but not require
dissemination to the public at large.” 592 Another commenter stated that an inter-affiliate

transaction “does not contain any additional price information beyond that contained in the
transaction with the customer.” 593 One group of commenters argued that publicly disseminating
inter-affiliate transactions “will distort the establishment of position limits, analysis of open
interest, determinations of block trade thresholds and performance of other important regulatory
analysis, functions and enforcement activities that require an accurate assessment of the
[security-based] swaps market.” 594 These commenters stated, further, that inter-affiliate securitybased swaps “could be required to be publicly reported in multiple jurisdictions, even though
592

Cleary II at 17. See also SIFMA/FIA/Roundtable Letter at A-44 (stating that “real-time
reporting of inter-affiliate [security-based swaps] … would distort market information
and thus have a detrimental market and commercial impact”).

pre-enactment security-based swaps, that inter-affiliate security-based swaps should not

245

they are not suitable for reporting in any jurisdiction.” 595
An accurate assessment of the security-based swap market will be necessary for a wide
range of functions, potentially including—as noted by this group of commenters—analysis of
open interest and the establishment of block trade thresholds. 596 The Commission believes that
users of security-based swap market data—whether regulators, SDRs, market participants, or the
public at large—should have an accurate and undistorted view of the market. However, it does
not follow that public dissemination of inter-affiliate security-based swaps will necessarily
prevent an accurate assessment of the security-based swap market.
The need to distinguish reports of initial transactions from subsequent inter-affiliate
transactions exists whether or not the latter are publicly disseminated. As noted above, the
Commission is requiring each registered SDR to adopt, among others, policies and procedures
for flagging transaction reports that have special circumstances. 597 This flagging mechanism is
designed to provide regulators with a more accurate view of the security-based swap market, and
the same mechanism can be applied to publicly disseminated last-sale reports to give market
595

Multiple Associations Letter at 16.

596

See id. at 11-12.

597

These policies and procedures could address not only reporting of whether a securitybased swap is an inter-affiliate transaction, but also whether the initial security-based
swap was executed in a jurisdiction with public dissemination requirements. This could
be either the United States or another jurisdiction that imposes last-sale transparency
requirements similar to those in Regulation SBSR. Further, these policies and procedures
also could address whether to indicate the approximate time when the initial securitybased swap was executed. For example, there could be condition flags for the initial
security-based swap having been executed within the past 24 hours, between one and
seven days before, or longer than seven days before. An indication that the initial trade
was executed less than 24 hours before could provide significant price discovery value,
while an indication that the initial trade was executed over a week before could, all things
being equal, have less. However, even information about a trade executed over a week
ago (or more) could have price discovery value for security-based swaps that trade
infrequently.

246

observers the same view. The Commission continues to believe that the commenters’ concerns
about the potentially limited price discovery value of inter-affiliate security-based swaps can be
addressed through the public dissemination of relevant data that flags such limitations, rather
than suppressing these transactions from public dissemination entirely. Additionally, even if the
report of an initial security-based swap transaction has been publicly disseminated in another
jurisdiction, the Commission believes that it would be preferable to disseminate a report of the
subsequent inter-affiliate transaction with an appropriate condition flag rather than suppressing a
report of the inter-affiliate transaction from public dissemination through a registered SDR.
Public dissemination of such a transaction by a registered SDR would help to assure that
information concerning the transaction was readily available to participants in the U.S. market
and other market observers.
One group of commenters argued that “use of inter-affiliate [security-based swaps] not
only allows risks to reside where they are more efficiently managed, but it also has a net positive
effect on an institution’s assets and liquidity, as well as on its efficiency in deploying capital.
For these reasons, we believe that there should be an inter-affiliate exemption from the public
dissemination requirements.” 598 Another commenter raised similar concerns, arguing that
“public reporting of inter-affiliate transactions could seriously interfere with the internal risk
management practices of a corporate group” and that “[p]ublic disclosure of a transaction
between affiliates could prompt other market participants to act in a way that would prevent the
corporate group from following through with its risk management strategy by, for instance,
causing adverse price movements in the market that the risk-carrying affiliate would use to

SIFMA/FIA/Roundtable Letter at A-44.

247

hedge.” 599 The Commission agrees generally that corporate groups should engage in appropriate
risk management practices. However, the Commission does not agree that Regulation SBSR, as
adopted, is inimical to effective risk management. The Commission notes that, during the first
phase of Regulation SBSR, all security-based swaps—regardless of size—must be reported
within 24 hours from the time of execution and—except with regard to transactions falling
within Rule 902(c)—immediately publicly disseminated. As discussed in Section VII, supra,
this reporting timeframe is designed, in part, to minimize any potential for market disruption
resulting from public dissemination of any security-based swap transaction during the interim
phase of Regulation SBSR. The Commission anticipates that, during the interim period, it will
collect and analyze data concerning the sizes of transactions that potentially affect liquidity in the
market. If the Commission ultimately determines that some form of block trade exception to
real-time public dissemination is appropriate, an inter-affiliate security-based swap of block size
would be able to avail itself of that exception. The Commission sees no basis for concluding, at
this time, that inter-affiliate security-based swaps are more difficult to hedge than other types of
security-based swaps, or that the hedging of these transactions presents unique concerns that
would not also arise in connection with the hedging of a security-based swap that was not an
inter-affiliate transaction. Therefore, the Commission does not agree with the commenters’
concern that public dissemination of inter-affiliate security-based swaps will impede the ability
of corporate groups to hedge.
Another group of commenters argued that “affiliates often enter into these swaps on
terms linked to an external trade being hedged. If markets have moved before the inter-affiliate
trade is entered into on the SEF or reported as an off-exchange trade, market participants could
599

248

also misconstrue the market’s true direction and depth.” 600 This comment suggests that last-sale
reports of transactions that appear out of the order in which the transactions in fact occurred
could mislead market observers. The Commission shares this concern but does not conclude that
the appropriate response is to suppress all inter-affiliate transactions from public dissemination.
The Commission believes instead that this issue can be addressed by requiring the dissemination
of the date and time of execution on the last-sale report. 601 This requirement is designed to allow
market observers to construct a time-sequenced record of all transactions in the security-based
swap market and thereby counteract the possibility that certain transactions could be reported
and publicly disseminated out of the order in which they were in fact executed.
Some commenters stated that inter-affiliate security-based swaps “are typically risk
transfers with no market impact.” 602 This statement does not exclude the possibility that some
inter-affiliate security-based swaps might have a market impact. The Commission sees no basis
to conclude at this time that inter-affiliate security-based swaps do not provide price discovery
value or other useful information to market observers. Market observers might be able to discern
useful information from the last-sale reports of some inter-affiliate security-based swaps, and the
Commission believes that market observers should be given the opportunity to do so—
particularly given the Title VII mandate that all security-based swaps shall be publicly
disseminated. The value of this information to market observers is unknown at this time,
because market observers have never before had the opportunity to view comprehensive last-sale
information from the security-based swap market. Suppressing all inter-affiliate security-based

added).

249

swaps from public dissemination would eliminate any potential that market observers could
develop ways to utilize this information. Thus, under the final rules, market observers who wish
to evaluate the entire record of transactions, including inter-affiliate transactions, will have the
opportunity to do so. As discussed above, the Commission disagrees with the commenters who
argued that “[r]equiring real-time reporting of inter-affiliate [security-based swaps] . . . would
distort market information and thus have a detrimental market and commercial impact.” 603
Because such transactions will be flagged, market observers can simply—if they wish—remove
from their analysis any transactions having an inter-affiliate flag.
The Commission sees one circumstance where public dissemination of an inter-affiliate
transaction could have significant price discovery value: when the initial transaction is effected
in a foreign jurisdiction without a public dissemination requirement and is not otherwise subject
to public dissemination under Regulation SBSR, and the subsequent inter-affiliate transaction—
between one of the original counterparties and one of its affiliate—would be publicly
disseminated if it fell within Rule 908(a)(1). Commenters’ views that public dissemination of an
inter-affiliate transaction would be duplicative and distorting are premised on the view that the
initial transaction is, in fact, publicly disseminated, which may not always be the case. 604
Therefore, public dissemination of the subsequent inter-affiliate transaction might be the only
way for the market to obtain any pricing information about the related pair of transactions. 605 In
603

SIFMA/FIA/Roundtable Letter at A-44.

604

See Multiple Associations Letter at 12 (“The market-facing swaps already will have been
reported and therefore, to require that inter-affiliate swaps also be reported will duplicate
information”).

605

In addition, even if the initial transaction is publicly disseminated, the Commission does
not believe that publicly disseminating the second, inter-affiliate transaction would cause
observers to obtain a distorted view of the market, as long as the second transaction is
flagged as an inter-affiliate transaction. See supra Section VI(G).
250

the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission specifically noted this circumstance and
requested comment on it. 606 No commenters responded.
Finally, one commenter on the Cross-Border Proposing Release argued that the
Commission should propose a comprehensive rule regarding inter-affiliate security-based swaps
“before finalizing the substantive underlying rules governing the SBS markets.” 607 The
commenter reasoned that “a separate proposed rule, like the Cross-Border Proposal, is necessary
to ensure that market participants are accorded sufficient opportunity to comment on the
interplay between the Commission’s proposed rules and inter-affiliate trades.” 608
The Commission notes that Regulation SBSR, as initially proposed, did not contemplate
any exception for inter-affiliate security-based swaps, and the Regulation SBSR Proposing
Release discussed at various points how proposed Regulation SBSR would apply to interaffiliate transactions. 609 The Commission received comments regarding the reporting of interaffiliate transactions in response to both the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release and the CrossBorder Proposing Release. Commenters on the Cross-Border Proposing Release’s discussion of
the application of Regulation SBSR to inter-affiliate security-based swaps did not raise any new
issues that had not already been raised in response to the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release.
In addition, as noted above, the Commission discussed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release
the comments regarding inter-affiliate transactions submitted in response to the Regulation

transactions in Regulation SBSR and therefore it is appropriate at this time to adopt final rules
relating to regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps, including
inter-affiliate security-based swaps.

Rule 903—Use of Codes
Regulation SBSR, as adopted, permits or, in some instances, requires security-based

swap counterparties to report coded information to registered SDRs. These codes, known as
unique identification codes (“UICs”), will be used to identify products, transactions, and legal
entities, as well as certain business units and employees of legal entities. 611 Rule 903 of
Regulation SBSR establishes standards for assigning and using coded information in securitybased swap reporting and dissemination to help ensure that codes are assigned in an orderly
manner and that regulators, market participants, and the public are able to interpret coded
information stored and disseminated by registered SDRs.
A.

Proposed Treatment of Coded Information

As initially proposed, Regulation SBSR would have established a process for assigning
UICs in Rule 900 and addressed the standards for using coded information in Rule 903.
Proposed Rule 900 would have provided that a “unique identification code” or “UIC” would be
the unique code assigned to a person, unit of a person, or product by or on behalf of an
internationally recognized standards-setting body (“IRSB”) that imposes fees and usage
restrictions that are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory. The proposed
definition of “UIC” further would have provided that, if there existed no IRSB meeting these
611

See supra Section II (describing UICs that must be reported to registered SDRs pursuant
to Regulation SBSR).

252

criteria, a registered SDR would have been required to assign all necessary UICs using its own
methodology. Similarly, if an IRSB meeting the criteria existed but had not assigned a relevant
UIC, the registered SDR would have been required to assign that UIC using its own
methodology. When the Commission re-proposed Regulation SBSR as part of the Cross-Border
Proposing Release, it designated the definition of “UIC” as re-proposed Rule 900(nn) but made
no changes to the substance of the definition. 612
Rule 903, as originally proposed, would have permitted the use of codes in place of
certain data elements for purposes of reporting and publicly disseminating the information
required under proposed Rules 901 and 902 of Regulation SBSR, provided that the information
to interpret such codes is “widely available on a non-fee basis.” When the Commission reproposed Rule 903, it replaced the term “reporting party” with “reporting side” but otherwise
made no substantive revisions to the rule. 613
B.

Comments Received and Final Rule 903
1.

Relocation of UIC Provisions into Rule 903

Final Rule 903 is divided into paragraphs (a) and (b). Rule 903(a) sets out the
requirements that registered SDRs must follow when assigning UICs. Similar requirements were
initially proposed as part of the definition of “UIC” in Rule 900, and re-proposed without
revision in Rule 900(nn). The Commission now believes that it would be more consistent with
the overall structure of Regulation SBSR to move any substantive requirements from the
definitions rule (Rule 900) and into an operative rule. Therefore, the Commission’s substantive

612

See 78 FR at 31211-12.

613

See id. at 31213.

253

requirements for a registered SDR’s use of UICs are now located in final Rule 903. 614 As
described below, the Commission is adopting these requirements substantially as proposed, but
with certain changes as described below. In particular, Rule 903(a), as adopted, includes new
language regarding Commission recognition of international systems for assigning UICs. In
addition, final Rule 903(a) provides that, if the Commission has recognized such a system that
assigns UICs to persons, each participant of a registered SDR shall obtain a UIC from or through
that system for identifying itself, and each participant that acts as a guarantor of a direct
counterparty’s performance of any obligation under a security-based swap that is subject to Rule
908(a) shall, if the direct counterparty has not already done so, obtain a UIC for identifying the
direct counterparty from or through that system, if that system permits third-party registration
without a requirement to obtain prior permission of the direct counterparty.
Final Rule 903(b) imposes certain restrictions on how coded information may be reported
and publicly disseminated. Rule 903(b) substantially incorporates the earlier versions of Rule
903, with certain conforming and technical changes described below.
2.

Comments Regarding UICs and Final Rule 903(a)

The Commission received several comments on the proposed rules relating to UICs and
the development of internationally recognized LEIs generally. One commenter expressed
concern that, absent a methodology outlined by a standard-setting body, multiple UICs could be
assigned by different regulators to the same financial entity, thereby creating compliance

614

Accordingly, the Commission is now adopting a simplified definition of “UIC.” See
Rule 900(qq) (defining “UIC” as “a unique identification code assigned to a person, unit
of a person, product, or transaction”). See also infra Section X(B)(2) (discussing final
Rule 903(a)).

254

burdens, operational difficulties, and opportunities for confusion. 615 Another commenter
believed that, absent internationally recognized LEIs, requiring SDR-specific UICs would create
inconsistencies among different SDRs. 616 This commenter recommended that the Commission
postpone this requirement until an international taxonomy exists that can be applied
consistently. 617 A third commenter stated that it is imperative that a single source of reference
data and unambiguous identifiers be established. 618 A fourth commenter argued that
“[s]ignificant progress in establishing the GLEIS has been made to date, and the time for further
expanding the use of the LEI through rulemaking is favorable.” 619 A fifth commenter noted that
the CFTC’s swap reporting rules require the use of LEIs and urged the Commission, for the sake
of clarity and consistency, to replace its reference to “unique counterparty identifiers” with
“Legal Entity Identifiers,” unless the Commission’s rule was intended to include identifiers
beyond LEIs. 620 A sixth commenter suggested that the rules reflect primary use of the LEI as a

party identifier and the need to use an LEI “when available,” recognizing that a reporting party
may request but cannot compel its counterparties to obtain an LEI. 621
The Commission is adopting in Rule 903(a) the provisions relating to the process for
assigning UICs largely as proposed and re-proposed, but—reflecting the comments described
above—is including two new requirements: (1) that the Commission recognize an IRSS before
the use of UICs from that IRSS becomes mandatory under Regulation SBSR; and (2) that, if the
Commission has recognized an IRSS that assigns UICs to persons, each participant of a
registered SDR shall obtain a UIC from or through that IRSS. As noted below, the Commission
is recognizing the GLEIS as an IRSS for assigning LEIs. Final Rule 903(a) states: “If an
internationally recognized standards-setting system that imposes fees and usage restrictions on
persons that obtain UICs for their own usage that are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably
discriminatory and that meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section is recognized by
the Commission and has assigned a UIC to a person, unit of a person, or product (or has
endorsed a methodology for assigning transaction IDs), the registered security-based swap data
repository shall employ that UIC (or methodology for assigning transaction IDs). If no such
system has been recognized by the Commission, or a recognized system has not assigned a UIC
to a particular person, unit of a person, or product (or has not endorsed a methodology for
assigning transaction IDs), the registered security-based swap data repository shall assign a UIC
to that person, unit of person, or product using its own methodology (or endorse a methodology
for assigning transaction IDs). If the Commission has recognized such a system that assigns
UICs to persons, each participant of a registered security-based swap data repository shall obtain

See ISDA IV at 12. Regulation SBSR, as adopted, does not compel a counterparty on a
reporting side to a security-based swap to obtain an LEI for a counterparty on the other
side of the transaction.

256

a UIC from or through that system for identifying itself, and each participant that acts as a
guarantor of a direct counterparty’s performance of any obligation under a security-based swap
that is subject to § 242.908(a) shall, if the direct counterparty has not already done so, obtain a
UIC for identifying the direct counterparty from or through that system, if that system permits
third-party registration without a requirement to obtain prior permission of the direct
counterparty.” 622
The Commission shares commenters’ desire to have identifiers that are widely
recognized, which would increase efficiency at both the SDR and market participant level. To
avoid confusion about when an IRSS meets the standards of Rule 903, the Commission has
modified the rule to provide that UICs issued by a particular IRSS would not become mandatory
under Regulation SBSR unless the Commission has recognized the IRSS. As detailed below, the
Commission is recognizing the GLEIS, applying the standards provided in Rule 903. The
Commission will apply the standards provided in Rule 903 to any future assessment of whether
an IRSS should be recognized as a provider of UICs for purposes of Regulation SBSR.
Specifically, the Commission will consider whether the IRSS imposes fees and usage restrictions
on persons that obtain UICs for their own usage that are fair and reasonable and not
unreasonably discriminatory, and whether the information necessary to interpret the codes
assigned by or through the IRSS is widely available to users of the information on a non-fee
basis and without usage restrictions. 623
Since Regulation SBSR was initially proposed in 2010, significant strides have been
made in the development of a globally recognized LEI. The Commission hereby recognizes the

GLEIS, which operates under a regulatory oversight committee (“ROC”), as an internationally
recognized standards-setting system (“IRSS”) 624 that meets the requirements of Rule 903 of
Regulation SBSR. The Commission notes that the LEI Regulatory Oversight Committee (“LEI
ROC”) currently includes members that are official bodies from over 40 jurisdictions. 625 LEIs
are being issued by over 30 pre-local operating units (“pre-LOUs”) around the globe, including
the Global Markets Entity Identifier (“GMEI”) Utility in the United States. 626 Furthermore, the
Commission believes that the GLEIS imposes fees and usage restrictions on persons that obtain
UICs for their own usage that are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory under
Rule 903(a). 627 The Commission also understands that the GLEIS does not impose any fees for
usage of or access to its LEIs, and that all of the associated reference data needed to understand,
624

Regulation SBSR, as proposed and re-proposed, would have employed the term
“internationally recognized standards-setting body” rather than “internationally
recognized standards-setting system,” which is used in Regulation SBSR, as adopted.
The Commission made this revision to better reflect the process of LEI issuance. LEIs
are being assigned by a number of different bodies in different jurisdictions being
coordinated through a global system, rather than by a single body.

625

The Commission is a member of the Executive Committee of the LEI ROC. The LEI
ROC is a stand-alone committee established pursuant to recommendations by the
Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) that was subsequently endorsed by the Group of 20
nations. See Financial Stability Board (“FSB”), A Global Legal Entity Identifier for
Financial Markets (June 8, 2012), available at

from public sources and provide LEIs to its local entities free of charge”). As of
December 26, 2014, the cost of obtaining an LEI from the GMEI Utility was $200, plus a
$20 surcharge for the LEI Central Operating Unit. The annual cost of maintaining an LEI

process, and utilize the LEIs are widely and freely available and not subject to any usage
restrictions. 628 Therefore, the Commission believes that the LEIs issued by or through the
GLEIS meet the standards of Rule 903(b), which are discussed in the section immediately below.
The Commission also notes that it would expect to revisit its recognition of the GLEIS if the
GLEIS were to modify its operations in a manner that causes it no longer to meet the standards
of Rule 903. The Commission believes that the provisions of Rule 903—coupled with the
Commission’s recognition of the GLEIS—will facilitate the reporting and analysis of securitybased swap transaction data, because (1) each participant of a registered SDR must be identified
using the same LEI for all transactions reported pursuant to Regulation SBSR, and regardless of
which registered SDR holds records of its transactions, and (2) a participant, when it acts as
guarantor of a direct counterparty to a security-based swap that is subject to Rule 908(b), is
required to obtain an LEI from or through the GLEIS if the direct counterparty does not already
have an LEI and if the system permits third-party registration without a requirement to obtain
prior permission of the direct counterparty. 629
As noted above, one commenter recommended that, for clarity and consistency with the
CFTC’s swap reporting rules, the Commission refer to LEIs, rather than UICs, unless the

628

See, e.g., http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/wpcontent/uploads/r_120608.pdf?page_moved=1, at 9 (“Access to the LEI and associated
reference data will be free and open to all users, and there should be no ‘bundling’ of other
services alongside the LEI by providers which forces users to pay directly or indirectly for
the LEI”). In addition, LEI information can be downloaded at no cost from pre-LOU
websites. See, e.g., https://www.gmeiutility.org/ (providing a link for downloading an FTP
file containing LEI information).

629

The Commission understands that the GLEIS permits one firm to register a second firm
when the first firm has a controlling interest over the second. See

for the LEI?”).

259

Commission intended to include identifiers beyond LEIs. 630 Although the Commission agrees
that the use of the term “LEI” would provide greater consistency with the CFTC’s rules,
Regulation SBSR continues to refer to UICs, rather than LEIs, for two reasons. First, as the
commenter suggested, the term “UIC” in Regulation SBSR includes identifiers in addition to
LEIs, such as identifiers for products, transactions, business units of legal entities (i.e., branches
and trading desks), and individual traders. 631 Second, the GLEIS does not extend to natural
persons or sub-legal entity business units, such as a branches and trading desks. Because at
present the Commission has not recognized an IRSS for these types of UICs, a registered SDR is
required to assign UICs to these entities using its own methodology. Thus, because Regulation
SBSR refers to identifiers in addition to LEIs, Regulation SBSR continues to refer to UICs rather
than LEIs.
The Commission acknowledges that, under final Rule 903(a), different registered SDRs
could, in theory, assign different UICs to the same person, unit of a person, or product.
Inconsistent UICs could require the Commission and other relevant authorities to map the UICs
assigned by one registered SDR to the corresponding UICs assigned by other registered SDRs to
obtain a complete picture of the market activity pertaining to a particular person or business
unit. 632 Although mapping may present certain challenges, the Commission believes that this
630

See Levin Letter at 4.

631

Rule 900(qq), as adopted, defines UIC to mean “a unique identification code assigned to
a person, unit of a person, product, or transaction.”

632

To avoid this possibility with respect to the identification of legal persons that are
participants of at least one registered SDR, the Commission has recognized the GLEIS—
by or through which LEIs are issued—as an IRSS that meets the criteria of Rule 903.
The Commission is requiring that, if the Commission has recognized such a system that
assigns UICs to persons, each participant of a registered SDR shall obtain a UIC from or
through that system. The Commission notes that a single person may act in various
capacities in the security-based swap market. For example, a person could be a direct
260

approach is better than the likely alternative of having market participants assign UICs to
identify persons, units of persons, or products according to their own methodologies. 633 In other
words, the Commission believes that UICs, even if they are SDR-specific, will provide a
streamlined way of reporting, disseminating, and interpreting security-based swap
information. 634 The Commission believes that requiring registered SDRs to develop their own
UICs—but only for UICs that are not assigned by or through an IRSS that has been recognized
by the Commission—will result in less confusion than the currently available alternatives, such
as allowing each reporting side to utilize its own nomenclature conventions, which would
subsequently have to be normalized by registered SDRs themselves or by the Commission.
The Commission further understands that, at this time, neither the GLEIS nor any other
IRSS has assigned product IDs or established a methodology for assigning transaction IDs.
Therefore, a registered SDR also is required under Rule 903(a) to assign, or endorse a
methodology for assigning, product IDs and transaction IDs. One commenter recommended that
“industry utilities” be considered for assigning unique IDs, including transaction IDs and product
IDs. 635 With respect to product IDs, Rule 903(a) provides a registered SDR with flexibility to

counterparty with respect to some transactions while acting as a broker with respect to
other transactions. If that person is a participant of a registered SDR, that person must
obtain an LEI from or through the GLEIS to identify itself in all applicable security-based
swap transaction reports, regardless of the capacity in which the person acted with respect
to a particular transaction.
633

The Commission notes, however, that Regulation SBSR does not prohibit one registered
SDR from utilizing the UICs that were originally assigned by another SDR.

634

See infra Section XIX (discussing regulatory implications of having multiple registered
SDRs).

635

See ISDA/SIFMA I at 8. See also ISDA IV at 12 (requesting that the Commission
acknowledge the ISDA OTC Taxonomy as an acceptable product ID for reporting under
Regulation SBSR and recognize that reporting parties, as opposed to SDRs, are generally
best positioned to assign these values). In the context of the development of product IDs,
261

assign a product ID created by an industry utility, in the absence of an IRSS recognized by the
Commission that issues product IDs. Thus, if an industry utility developed product IDs, 636 a
registered SDR could endorse that industry utility as the means for assigning such product IDs,
and require use of those product IDs for reporting and publicly dissemination transaction
information in its policies and procedures required by Rule 907(a).
With respect to transaction IDs, a registered SDR—in the absence of an IRSS recognized
by the Commission that has endorsed a methodology for assigning transaction IDs—is required
to assign transaction IDs or endorse a methodology for assigning transaction IDs. 637 A number
of commenters recommended that Regulation SBSR permit transaction IDs generated by persons
other than a registered SDR. 638 The Commission generally agrees with these comments, and has
revised the UIC provisions relating to transaction IDs as follows. Although Rule 900, as
proposed and re-proposed, would have defined “transaction ID” as “the unique identification
code assigned by registered security-based swap data repository to a specific security-based
swap,” the definition of “UIC” in proposed Rule 900(nn) did not mention transaction IDs. The
final definition of “UIC” includes transaction IDs in addition to identification codes for persons,
units of persons, and products. The final definition of “transaction ID” is “the UIC assigned to a
specific security-based swap transaction,” without the limitation that it be assigned by a
the Commission is not at this time making any determination as to whether the ISDA
OTC Taxonomy system constitutes an IRSS under Regulation SBSR, or whether the
product IDs issued under the ISDA OTC Taxonomy system meet the criteria of Rule 903.

262

registered SDR. The Commission agrees with these commenters that requiring a registered SDR
to use transaction IDs assigned only by a registered SDR would not be practical. The
Commission believes that it would be more efficient and consistent with current practice in the
security-based swap market to allow transaction IDs to be assigned at or shortly after execution,
by a counterparty, platform, or post-trade processor. Final Rule 903(a) includes language that
contemplates that an IRSS or registered SDR may “endorse a methodology for assigning
transaction IDs.” This formulation makes clear that transaction IDs need not be assigned by an
IRSS or registered SDR itself, but can be assigned by security-based swap counterparties,
platforms, or post-trade processors using the IRSS’s or registered SDR’s methodology. Any
entity that assigns the transaction ID must do so in accordance with the methodology endorsed
by a recognized IRSS or, in the absence of a recognized IRSS that has endorsed a methodology
for assigning transaction IDs, by the registered SDR that will receive the report of the
transaction. 639
Two commenters addressed the types of entities that can act as IRSSs. One of these
commenters recommended that for-profit entities be permitted to act as reference data
registration authorities, 640 while the other commenter argued that LEIs should be issued by a notfor-profit entity that operates on the principle of cost recovery, and that the industry should
determine the appropriate model for cost recovery. 641 The Commission does not believe that it is
necessary or appropriate to specify the type of entity—for-profit or non-profit—that can establish

639

See Rule 903(a). Thus, for example, a counterparty or platform must not generate 40character transaction IDs if the registered SDR requires and can accept only 32-character
transaction IDs.

263

or operate an IRSS. Whichever the case, final Rule 903(a) specifies that the UICs issued by an
IRSS may be used under Regulation SBSR only if the IRSS that imposes fees and usage
restrictions that are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory and that meets the
criteria of Rule 903(b) has been recognized by the Commission. In other words, the overall
character of the IRSS’s operation does not matter for purposes of compliance with Regulation
SBSR (i.e., whether it is a for-profit or non-profit entity) so long as any fees and usage
restrictions imposed with respect to UICs meets the requirements of Rule 903(a). In addition,
any codes used as, or as part of, UICs under Regulation SBSR must meet the standards of Rule
903(b), which are described below.
3.

Comments on Proposed Rule 903 and Final Rule 903(b)

Commenters expressed differing views regarding whether the providers of UICs—and
product IDs in particular—should be able to charge fees for the codes or for the information
necessary to interpret the codes. One commenter supported the proposed requirement that
information necessary to interpret reported or publicly disseminated codes be available free of
charge. 642 However, a second commenter—a provider of product identification codes for
security-based swaps—stated that Regulation SBSR should not require product identifiers to be
freely available. 643 This commenter noted that maintaining a reliable identification system for
security-based swaps requires a substantial level of investment, and recommended that the
providers of product identification codes be permitted to charge commercially reasonable fees

642

See Barnard I at 3 (noting that making this information available for free could eliminate
confusion).

643

See Markit I at 6 (stating that identifier systems provided on an automated basis and/or
for free “generally are not adequate for the intended goals”).

264

for developing and maintaining the codes. 644 A third commenter recommended that existing
licensing codes be used for product IDs to the extent possible, because using existing codes
would be easier for registered SDRs; the use of new codes would require ongoing maintenance
and the development of specific processes for reporting, which could result in poorer quality data
submissions.645
After careful consideration of these comments, the Commission continues to believe that
the information necessary to interpret any codes used by registered SDRs must be “widely
available on a non-fee basis.” Thus, the Commission is adopting this key feature of Rule 903(b)
as proposed and re-proposed. A primary goal of Title VII is to use reporting and public
dissemination of security-based swap data as a means of monitoring risks and increasing
transparency, both to regulators and the public, of the security-based swap markets. If the
transaction data that are reported and publicly disseminated contain codes and the information
necessary to interpret such codes is not widely available on a non-fee basis, these Title VII goals
could be frustrated. In the absence of Rule 903(b), a registered SDR could require—or acquiesce
in the use of—proprietary, fee-based identification codes, thereby requiring all users of the
security-based swap market data to pay the code creator, directly or indirectly, for the
644

See id.

645

See DTCC II at 16. The commenter supported the continued use of existing license
codes, including the Markit Reference Entity Database (“RED”)™ codes currently used
in trade confirmations for credit derivatives and the Reuters Instrument Codes (“RIC”)
used in electronic messages for equity derivatives. The commenter further noted that
without RED codes, the description of a reference entity in submitted data could vary,
even in minor ways (e.g., the punctuation used in an abbreviation), creating difficulties
for the SDR that would be required to correctly identify the reference entity. This
commenter also suggested that the Commission adopt a rule that would provide existing
licensing codes at a reduced cost for small volume market participants. As described
below, final Rule 903(b) permits the use of codes in security-based swap reports under
Regulation SBSR only if the information necessary to interpret the codes is widely
available on a non-fee basis.

265

information necessary to interpret the codes. Users of the data also might be subject to usage
restrictions imposed by the code creator.
Currently, the security-based swap market data typically include fee-based codes, and all
market participants and market observers must pay license fees and agree to various usage
restrictions to obtain the information necessary to interpret the codes. The Commission believes
that allowing continuation of the status quo would not satisfy the Title VII mandate to increase
security-based swap market transparency through public dissemination. If information to
understand embedded codes is not widely available on a non-fee basis, information asymmetries
would likely continue to exist between large market participants who pay for the codes and
others market participants. One commenter suggested that alternatives could be developed to the
status quo of using fee-based codes in security-based swap market data. 646 The Commission
welcomes the development of such alternatives, and believes that Rule 903(b), as adopted, will
likely encourage such development.
Furthermore, the Commission believes that the public dissemination requirements in Title
VII should allow observers of the market to incorporate the information contained in public
reports of security-based swaps into any decisions they might take regarding whether and how to
participate in the market (or even to avoid participation), and for intermediaries in the market to
incorporate this information to provide better advice to their clients about the market. The
Commission does not believe that these objectives would be advanced if the ability of market
participants to understand public reports of security-based swap transactions were conditioned on
646

See Bloomberg Letter at 2. This commenter stated that it would be possible to develop a
public domain symbology for security-based swap reference entities that relied on
products in the public domain to “provide an unchanging, unique, global and inexpensive
identifier.” According to this commenter, its proprietary symbology product for
securities could provide a starting point for a security-based swap symbology product.

266

agreeing to pay fees to a code creator. The Commission similarly believes that subjecting the
public’s use of this information to restrictions imposed by a code creator also could frustrate the
objectives of public dissemination. In addition, allowing continuation of the status quo would
retard the ability of the Commission and other relevant authorities to obtain and analyze
comprehensive security-based swap information.
The Commission recognizes the usefulness of codes. They make reporting more efficient
because providing just one code—a product ID, for example—can eliminate the need to report
multiple data elements individually. Codes also facilitate the standardized representation of
security-based swap data and thereby make reporting (and understanding reported data) more
reliable and efficient. 647 With respect to product IDs specifically, the Commission believes that
unless an IRSS has been recognized by the Commission and can assign product IDs, registered
SDRs should be free to choose between using an existing mechanism for assigning product
IDs—assuming it is consistent with Rule 903(b)—and developing a new product classification
system. If all existing product identification codes require users of the transaction information to
pay a fee, then a registered SDR may not require or permit use of those codes for reporting and
public dissemination. The registered SDR would be required to issue UICs using its own
methodology and make the information necessary to interpret those codes available on a non-fee
basis.
In light of the requirement in Rule 903(b) that the information necessary to interpret
coded information be widely available on a non-fee basis, it would be inconsistent with the rule

647

For example, in the absence of an LEI, different persons might refer to a particular legal
entity as “XYZ,” “XYZ Corp.”, or “XYZ Corporation.” Confusion about whether all of
these terms refer to same entity would be minimized, if not wholly eliminated, if all
parties referred to the entity using the same code (e.g., “ABCD12345”).

267

for a registered SDR to permit information to be reported pursuant to Rule 901, or to publicly
disseminate information pursuant to Rule 902, using codes in place of certain data elements if the
registered SDR imposes, or permits the imposition of, any usage restrictions on the disseminated
information. The purpose of Rule 903(b) is to help ensure that the public is able to utilize the
last-sale information provided by Regulation SBSR without limitation or expense.
The commenter that provides product identification codes for security-based swaps also
noted that proposed Regulation SBSR would allow an IRSB that develops counterparty
identifiers to charge fees, and believed that providers of product IDs should receive comparable
treatment. 648 In response to this comment, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to
make minor revisions to the rule language to clarify its original intent and thereby eliminate any
apparent contradiction between the two paragraphs of Rule 903. When the Commission
originally proposed that an IRSB could impose fees and usage restrictions as long as they were
fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory, the Commission intended that language
to apply to persons that obtain UICs for their own usage (such as a legal entity that seeks to
identify itself as a counterparty when engaging in security-based swap transactions), not ultimate
users of the information (such as third parties who might wish to enter into a security-based swap
with that entity as the reference entity). The Commission believes that this distinction is
consistent with international efforts to develop a global LEI. 649

See Charter of the Regulator Oversight Committee for the Global Legal Entity Identifier
(LEI) System (November 5, 2012),
http://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/roc_20121105.pdf (last visited September 22,
2014) (“ROC Charter”). The ROC Charter provides that the mission of the ROC is “to
uphold the governance principles of and to oversee the Global LEI System, in the broad
public interest.” Id. at 1. The ROC Charter further provides that, in protecting the broad
public interest, the objectives of the ROC include “open and free access to publicly
268

In Rule 903(a), as adopted, the Commission is inserting after the words “fees and usage
standards” the new words “on persons that obtain UICs for their own usage.” 650 This language
clarifies that it is consistent with Rule 903(a) for a registered SDR to accept codes for which the
code creator assesses fair and reasonable fees on market participants that need to identify
themselves, their agents, or parts of their organizations when engaging in financial activities.
For example, Rule 903(a) would permit a registered SDR to charge participants that need to
acquire UICs that are assigned by registered SDRs, such as counterparty IDs, ultimate parent
IDs, branch IDs, trading desk IDs, and trader IDs.
In Rule 903(b), as adopted, the Commission is inserting the words “to users of the
information” immediately after the phrase “widely available.” 651 The users of information

available data from the Global LEI System,” and specifically includes the following
principle: “all public data should be readily available on a continuous basis, easily and
widely accessible using modern technology, and free of charge.” Id. at 2 (emphasis
added). At the same time, the ROC Charter states that “any entities required, or eligible,
to obtain an LEI [must be] able to acquire one under open and non-discriminatory terms.”
Id. One such term is that “fees, where and when imposed by the [Central Operating
Unit], are set on a non-profit cost-recovery basis.” Id.
650

Final Rule 903(a) thus provides: “If an internationally recognized standards-setting
system that imposes fees and usage restrictions on persons that obtain UICs for their own
usage that are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory is recognized by
the Commission and has assigned a UIC to a person, unit of a person, or product (or has
endorsed a methodology for assigning transaction IDs), the registered security-based
swap data repository shall employ that UIC (or methodology for assigning transaction
IDs). If no such system has been recognized by the Commission, or a recognized system
has not assigned a UIC to a particular person, unit of a person, or product (or has not
endorsed a methodology for assigning transaction IDs), the registered security-based
swap data repository shall assign a UIC to that person, unit of person, or product using its
own methodology (or endorse a methodology for assigning transaction IDs)” (emphasis
added).

651

Final Rule 903(b) thus provides: “A registered security-based swap data repository may
permit information to be reported pursuant to § 242.901, and may publicly disseminate
that information pursuant to § 242.902, using codes in place of certain data elements,
provided that the information necessary to interpret such codes is widely available to
users of the information on a non-fee basis” (emphasis added).
269

referred to in final Rule 903(b) could include the Commission, other relevant authorities, or any
person who wishes to view or utilize the publicly disseminated security-based swap transaction
data for any purpose. As noted above, the Commission does not believe that access to this
information should be impeded by having to pay fees or agree to usage restrictions in order to
understand any coded information that might be contained in the transaction data.
The Commission notes that Rule 903(b) prevents registered SDRs and code creators from
impeding a person’s ability to obtain the information necessary to interpret coded information
used in reporting or public dissemination under Regulation SBSR. Rule 903(b) is not intended to
prevent a registered SDR from charging for its SDR services. To the contrary, registered SDRs
are expressly permitted to charge fees for their SDR services that are fair and reasonable and not
unreasonably discriminatory. 652
The Commission notes that it is making an additional revision to the language in reproposed in Rule 903 to conform final Rule 903(b) to the Commission’s original intent and to
avoid any potential conflict with final Rule 901(h). Rule 901(h), as adopted, provides that the
reporting side shall electronically transmit the information required under Rule 901 to a
registered SDR “in a format required by the registered [SDR].” Under re-proposed Rule 903, the
reporting side could “provide information to a registered [SDR]…using codes in place of certain
data elements.” 653 This language in re-proposed 903 could have been read to give the reporting

652

See Rule 13n-4(c)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act, which is part of the SDR Adopting
Release. But see Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, Section VI
(proposing to prohibit SDRs from charging fees for publicly disseminating regulatorily
mandated transaction data).

653

Specifically, re-proposed Rule 903 provided that “The reporting side may provide
information to a registered security-based swap data repository pursuant to § 242.901 and
a registered security-based swap data repository may publicly disseminate information
270

side discretion to select what codes it could use for reporting transaction information to a
registered SDR. , The Commission has revised final Rule 903(b) to more clearly reflect its
original intent: that reporting sides shall report information in a format required by the registered
SDR. 654 Thus, Rule 903(b), as adopted, provides that a registered SDR “may permit information
to be reported . . . using codes in place of certain data elements.” The Commission believes that
final Rule 903(b), read together with final Rule 901(h), makes clear that a reporting side may
provide coded information to a registered SDR only to the extent permitted by the registered
SDR and only in a format required by the SDR. Therefore, the reporting side may not exercise
its own discretion when selecting codes to use in its reports to the registered SDR, regardless of
whether the codes otherwise comport with Rule 903.
Finally, one commenter expressed concern that, although Regulation SBSR, as initially
proposed, would have required that the information necessary to interpret codes be made
available for free, the proposal would not have prevented a code creator from charging for other
uses. 655 In this commenter’s view, “[a] widely used identifier can become a de facto standard for
anyone doing business in the relevant marketplace. This creates the potential for abuse,
defeating the entire purpose of promoting the broad availability of identifiers.” 656 This
commenter believed instead that, “[a]s long as all market participants have the unfettered

pursuant to § 242.902 using codes in place of certain data elements, provided that the
information necessary to interpret such codes is widely available on a non-fee basis.”
654

See supra Section IV (discussing Rule 901(h)). See also Rule 907(a)(5) (requiring a
registered SDR to establish and maintain policies and procedures for assigning UICs in a
manner consistent with Rule 903); Rule 907(a)(2) (requiring a registered SDR to
establish and maintain policies and procedures that specify, among other things, protocols
for submitting information, including but not limited to UICs).

freedom to introduce alternative identifiers and to map those identifiers to the standard, however,
multiple, competing identifiers can provide an inexpensive solution.”657 The Commission shares
the commenter’s concern that identification codes not become a tool for monopolistic abuse.
This is why the Commission is requiring in Rule 903(b) that, if such codes will be used for
reporting or publicly disseminating security-based swap transaction data, “the information
necessary to interpret such codes [must be] widely available to users of the information on a nonfee basis.” Thus, the Commission does not believe it will be necessary for market participants to
introduce alternative identifiers, although Regulation SBSR would not prohibit them from doing
so.
C.

Policies and Procedures of Registered SDRs Relating to UICs

As proposed and re-proposed, Rule 907(a)(5) would have required a registered SDR to
establish and maintain written policies and procedures for assigning: (1) a transaction ID to each
security-based swap that is reported to it; and (2) UICs established by or on behalf of an IRSB
that imposes fees and usage restrictions that are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably
discriminatory (or, if no standards-setting body meets these criteria or a standards-setting body
meets these criteria but has not assigned a UIC to a particular person, unit of a person, or
product, assigning a UIC using its own methodology).
The Commission received several comments, noted above, that discussed utilization of
UICs generally and considered them in connection with Rule 907(a)(5). 658 The Commission also
received a comment that generally encouraged the Commission to adopt a convention for

657

Id.

658

See supra notes 615 to 618 and accompanying text.

272

assigning unique IDs and incorporating a pilot or early adopter program for certain products and
participants that would allow for end-to-end testing and proof of concept. 659
As discussed above, the Commission believes that UICs—even if utilized on an SDRspecific basis in the absence of UICs issued by a recognized IRSS—will create a more consistent
and transparent system for reporting and analyzing security-based swap transactions. Therefore,
the Commission continues to believe that it is important for registered SDRs to have policies and
procedures providing for the issuance of such UICs and is adopting a modified version of Rule
907(a)(5) that requires registered SDRs to establish written policies and procedures “[f]or
assigning UICs in a manner consistent with [Rule 903].” This is a conforming change to be
consistent with the Commission’s decision to locate the substantive requirements for the
assignment of UICs in Rule 903. 660 With respect to the comment received, the Commission
believes that market participants can work with entities that are likely to register with the
Commission as SDRs on pilot programs for certain products and conventions for assigning UICs.
However, the Commission does not believe it would be appropriate for the Commission itself to
adopt such conventions; the Commission believes instead that greater expertise in coding data
will reside in the industry and, in particular, at registered SDRs. The Commission further
believes that Rule 900(qq), which defines “UIC,” and Rule 903, which establishes standards for
the use of UICs provide adequate parameters for the development of a UIC system. The
Commission believes that allowing the industry to develop conventions for assigning UICs will
likely result in a more efficient and flexible UIC regime than if the Commission were to adopt
such conventions itself.

XI.

Operating Hours of Registered SDRs—Rule 904
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act does not explicitly address or prescribe the hours of

operation of the reporting and public dissemination regime that it requires. The security-based
swap market is global in nature, and security-based swaps are executed throughout the world and
at any time of the day. In light of the global nature of the security-based swap market, the
Commission believes that the public interest is served by requiring near-continuous reporting and
public dissemination of security-based swap transactions, no matter where or when they are
executed (subject to the cross-border rules discussed in Section XV, infra). Furthermore, having
a near-continuous reporting and public dissemination regime would reduce the incentive for
market participants to defer execution of security-based swap transactions until after regular
business hours to avoid post-trade transparency. Accordingly, the Commission proposed Rule
904, which would have required a registered SDR to design its systems to allow for nearcontinuous receipt and dissemination of security-based swap data. A registered SDR would have
been permitted to establish “normal closing hours” and to declare, on an ad hoc basis, “special
closing hours,” subject to certain requirements. Rule 904 was not revised as part of the CrossBorder Proposing Release, and was re-proposed in exactly the same form as initially proposed.
As discussed below, three commenters addressed proposed Rule 904. The Commission
has carefully reviewed the comments received and has determined to adopt Rule 904, as
proposed and re-proposed, subject to one conforming change, as discussed below. 661
Rule 904, as adopted, requires a registered SDR to have systems in place to receive and
disseminate information regarding security-based swap data on a near-continuous basis, with

661

In addition, the Commission is making a technical conforming change to revise the title
of the rule to refer to “registered” SDRs.

274

certain exceptions. First, under final Rule 904(a), a “registered SDR may establish normal
closing hours when, in its estimation, the U.S. market and major foreign markets are inactive.”
Second, under final Rule 904(b), a registered SDR “may declare, on an ad hoc basis, special
closing hours to perform system maintenance that cannot wait until normal closing hours.” Rule
904(b) further provides that a registered SDR shall, “to the extent reasonably possible under the
circumstances, avoid scheduling special closing hours during [periods] when, in its estimation,
the U.S. market and major foreign markets are most active.” Rules 904(a) and 904(b) each
require the registered SDR to provide participants and the public with reasonable advance notice
of its normal closing hours and special closing hours, respectively.
Rule 904(c) specifies requirements for handling and disseminating reported data during a
registered SDR’s normal and special closing hours. During normal closing hours and, to the
extent reasonably practicable during special closing hours, a registered SDR is required to “have
the capability to receive and hold in queue” the transaction data that it receives. Pursuant to Rule
904(d), immediately upon system re-opening following normal closing hours or special closing
hours (assuming it was able to hold incoming data in queue), the registered SDR is required to
publicly disseminate any transaction data required to be reported under Rule 901(c) that it
received and held in queue. Finally, pursuant to Rule 904(e), if the registered SDR could not,
while it was closed, receive and hold in queue reported information, it would be required,
immediately upon resuming normal operations, to send a notice to all participants that it had
resumed normal operations but could not, while closed, receive and hold in queue such
transaction information. Therefore, any participant that had an obligation to report
information—but was unable to do so because of the registered SDR’s inability to receive and

275

hold data in queue—would be required upon notification by the registered SDR to promptly
report the information to the registered SDR.
As proposed and re-proposed, Rule 904(e) would have provided that if a participant could
not fulfil a reporting obligation due to a registered SDR’s inability to receive and hold data in
queue, the participant would be required to report the information “immediately” upon receiving
a notification that the registered SDR has resumed normal operations. The Commission has
decided to replace the word “immediately” with the word “promptly” in the final rule because
“promptly” emphasizes the need for information to be submitted without unreasonable delay
while affording participants a practical degree of flexibility. In general, the Commission
believes that submitting a required report “promptly” implies “as soon as practicable.”
The three commenters that addressed Rule 904 were generally supportive of the goal of
promoting transparency and price discovery though a regime of continuous reporting and public
dissemination, 662 although one of these commenters pointed out the need for registered SDRs to
close periodically to perform necessary system maintenance. 663 Two of these commenters also
suggested alternative operating hours and procedures for registered SDRs. 664 One commenter
stated that the requirements that a registered SDR have normal closing hours only when neither
U.S. nor international markets are active, and should continue to receive the relevant transaction
data and hold them in queue even when the registered SDR is closed for normal or ad hoc special
closing hours, exceeded the capabilities of currently existing reporting infrastructures. The

See Markit I at 4-5; DTCC II at 19-20; DTCC IV at 4 (recommending that SDRs operate

transactions in real time, while also maintaining multiple levels of operational
redundancy and data security).

276

commenter argued that such requirements would increase the risk of infrastructure failure
because SDRs would not have adequate time to maintain and update their systems. 665 This
commenter suggested that, if systems are required to be available on a 24-hour basis, the
Commission should define operating hours to be 24 hours from Monday to Friday, and consider
allowing additional closing hours either “when markets are less active” or “when only less active
markets are open.” 666
The Commission believes there are compelling reasons to implement a system of
reporting and public dissemination that, in general, operates near-continuously. As discussed
above, the Commission believes that requiring near-continuous reporting and public
dissemination of security-based swaps—except for when, in the estimation of a registered SDR,
the U.S. market and major foreign markets are inactive—will serve the public interest and reduce
incentives for market participants to trade outside of regular business hours. The Commission,
however, recognizes the need for a registered SDR to have closing hours to maintain and update
its systems, and Rules 904(a) and 904(b), as adopted, specifically allow registered SDRs to have
normal and special closing hours. Further, while Rule 904(b) states that a registered SDR should
avoid scheduling special closing hours during a time when, in its estimation, the U.S. and major
foreign markets are most active, the Commission notes that a registered SDR is required to do so
only “to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances.” As such, the Commission
believes that Rules 904(a) and 904(b) provide sufficient flexibility to registered SDRs in
determining their closing times to perform the necessary maintenance procedures. The
Commission does not believe it would be appropriate to require registered SDRs to operate 24
665

See Markit I at 4.

666

Markit I at 4-5.

277

hours only from Monday to Friday, as the commenter suggests, as certain major foreign markets
may be active during hours that fall within the weekend in the United States.
The Commission recognizes the commenter who asserted that the proposed requirement
for a registered SDR to receive and hold in the queue the data required to be reported during its
closing hours “exceeds the capabilities of currently-existing reporting infrastructures.” 667 The
Commission notes that this comment was submitted in January 2011. Since that time, however,
provisionally registered CFTC SDRs that are likely also to register as SDRs with the
Commission appear to have developed the capability of receiving and holding data in queue
during their closing hours. 668 Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to
require registered SDRs to hold data in queue during their closing hours should help to prevent
market disruptions by enabling reporting sides for security-based swaps to report transactions at
all times.

Subsequent Revisions to Reported Security-Based Swap Information
A.

Reporting Life Cycle Events—Rule 901(e)
1.

Description of Proposal and Re-proposal

Rule 901(e), as proposed and re-proposed, would have required the reporting of certain
life cycle event information. “Life cycle event” was defined in the proposal and re-proposal to
mean “with respect to a security-based swap, any event that would result in a change in the
information reported to a registered security-based swap data repository under § 242.901,

including a counterparty change resulting from an assignment or novation; a partial or full
termination of the security-based swap; a change in the cash flows originally reported; for a
security-based swap that is not cleared, any change to the collateral agreement; or a corporate
action affecting a security or securities on which the security-based swap is based (e.g., merger,
dividend, stock split, or bankruptcy). Notwithstanding the above, a life cycle event shall not
include the scheduled expiration of the security-based swap, a previously described and
anticipated interest rate adjustment (such as a quarterly rate adjustment), or other event that does
not result in any change to the contractual terms of the security-based swap.”
Re-proposed Rule 901(e) would have provided that “For any life cycle event, and any
adjustment due to a life cycle event, that results in a change to information previously reported
pursuant to Rule 901(c), 901(d), or 901(i), the reporting side shall promptly provide updated
information reflecting such change to the entity to which it reported the original transaction,
using the transaction ID,” subject to two exceptions. Under Rule 901(e)(1), as re-proposed, if
the reporting side ceased to be a counterparty to the security-based swap due to any assignment
or novation and if the new side included a U.S. person, a security-based swap dealer, or a major
security-based swap participant, the new side would be the reporting side following the
assignment or novation. Under re-proposed Rule 901(e)(2), if the new side did not include a
U.S. person, a security-based swap dealer, or a major security-based swap participant, the other
side would be the reporting side following the assignment or novation.
In proposing Rule 901(e), the Commission preliminarily believed that the reporting of
life cycle event information would provide regulators with access to information about

279

significant changes that occur over the duration of a security-based swap. 669 The Commission
also stated that the reporting of life cycle event information would help to assure that regulators
have accurate and up-to-date information concerning outstanding security-based swaps and the
current obligations and exposures of security-based swap counterparties. 670
In determining the entity that would be required to report life cycle event information, the
Commission’s approach in proposing and re-proposing Rule 901(e) was that, generally, the
person who originally reported the initial transaction would have the responsibility to report any
subsequent life cycle event. 671 However, if the life cycle event were an assignment or novation
that removed the original reporting party, either the new counterparty or the remaining original
counterparty would have to be the reporting party. 672
In re-proposing Regulation SBSR, the Commission included the new concept of a
“reporting side,” which would have included the direct counterparty and any indirect
counterparty. The Cross-Border Proposing Release also proposed to impose greater duties to
report transactions on non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap
participants. Accordingly, the Commission re-proposed Rule 901(e) to provide that the duty to
report would switch to the other side only if the new side did not include a U.S. person (as in the
originally proposed rule) or a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap
669

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75220.

670

See id. In a separate rulemaking, the Commission is adopting a rule that will require a
registered SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to calculate positions for all persons with open security-based swaps
for which the SDR maintains records. See SDR Adopting Release (adopting Rule 13n5(b)(2) under the Exchange Act).

671

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31068.

672

Rule 901(e), as initially proposed, would have provided that the new counterparty would
be the reporting party if it is a U.S. person; the other original counterparty would become
the reporting party if the new counterparty is not a U.S. person.

280

participant. The Commission preliminarily believed that, if the new side included a securitybased swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, the new side should retain the duty
to report. This approach was designed to align reporting duties with the market participants that
the Commission believed would be better suited to carrying them out, because non-U.S. person
security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants likely would have taken
significant steps to establish and maintain the systems, processes and procedures, and staff
resources necessary to report security-based swaps. 673

Final Rules Relating to Life Cycle Events and Response to Comments
a.

General Comment and Definition of “Life Cycle Event”

One commenter expressed support for the requirement to report life cycle event
information, stating that the reporting of life cycle event information was necessary for detailed
market regulation and for prudential and central bank regulation. 674 The commenter noted that
“[m]any life cycle events are price-forming or significantly change the exposures under a
trade….” 675 In subsequent comment letters, this commenter stated that the definition of “life
cycle event” was overly broad, and that life cycle events should be limited to those that impact
the counterparties to or the pricing of the security-based swap. 676 Specifically, the commenter
suggested that the Commission define “life cycle event” to mean “an event that would result in a
change in the counterparty or price of a security-based swap reported to the registered [SDR].” 677

677

DTCC VI at 9.

281

However, another commenter believed that the proposed definition was “clear, sufficient, and
complete.” 678
After careful consideration, the Commission is adopting the definition of “life cycle
event” in Rule 900(q) substantially as re-proposed, but with certain minor modifications to
respond to comments and to clarify the original intent of the rule. 679 First, the Commission is
making a technical change to the definition to indicate that a life cycle event refers to any event
that would result in a change in the information reported “under § 242.901(c), (d), or (i),” rather
than any event that would result in a change in the information reported “under § 242.901” (as
re-proposed). This technical change will conform the definition of “life cycle event” to the
requirements of Rule 901(e), as re-proposed and as adopted, which requires the reporting of a
change to information previously reported pursuant to paragraph (c), (d), or (i) of Rule 901. By
defining “life cycle event” in this manner, the Commission aims to ensure that information
reported pursuant to Rules 901(c), (d), and (i) is updated as needed, so that the data maintained
by registered SDRs remains current for the duration of a security-based swap. This requirement
should help to ensure that the data accessible to the Commission through registered SDRs
678

Barnard I at 3.

679

Rule 900(q), as adopted, defines “life cycle event” to mean “with respect to a securitybased swap, any event that would result in a change in the information reported to a
registered security-based swap data repository under § 242.901(c), (d) or (i), including:
an assignment or novation of the security-based swap; a partial or full termination of the
security-based swap; a change in the cash flows originally reported; for a security-based
swap that is not a clearing transaction, any change to the title or date of any master
agreement, collateral agreement, margin agreement, or any other agreement incorporated
by reference into the security-based swap contract; or a corporate action affecting a
security or securities on which the security-based swap is based (e.g., a merger, dividend,
stock split, or bankruptcy). Notwithstanding the above, a life cycle event shall not
include the scheduled expiration of the security-based swap, a previously described and
anticipated interest rate adjustment (such as a quarterly interest rate adjustment), or other
event that does not result in any change to the contractual terms of the security-based
swap.”

282

accurately reflects the current state of the market. Therefore, the Commission does not believe
that it is appropriate to limit the definition of “life cycle event” to post-execution events that
impact the counterparties to or the pricing of a security-based swap, as suggested by the
commenter. 680 Although the final definition of “life cycle event” encompasses these types of
events, it also encompasses other information reported pursuant to Rules 901(c), 901(d), or
901(i).
One commenter asked that the Commission remove the reference to “dividends” in the
definition of “life cycle event” because dividends “are contract intrinsic events that do not result
in a change to the contractual terms of the SBS and therefore, should not be defined as reportable
life cycle events.” 681 The Commission does not believe that it is necessary to revise the
definition of “life cycle event” as the commenter suggests. As indicated above, the definition of
“life cycle event” provides, in relevant part, that a life cycle event includes “any event that would
result in a change in the information reported to a registered [SDR] . . . including. . . a corporate
action affecting a security or securities on which the security-based swap is based (e.g., a merger,
dividend, stock split, or bankruptcy)” (emphasis added). Thus, a regular payment of a dividend
that does not require a restatement of the terms of the security-based swap would not constitute a
life cycle event. However, other actions involving dividends could be life cycle events. For
example, the distribution of a stock dividend that required an adjustment to the notional terms of
an equity security-based swap—or any other corporate action related to dividends that resulted in

283

a modification of one or more terms of the security-based swap—would be a life cycle event and
therefore would have to be reported pursuant to Rule 901(e).
Second, the Commission is clarifying that a life cycle event includes “an assignment or
novation of the security-based swap,” instead of “a counterparty change resulting from an
assignment or novation.” The Commission notes that, while assignments and novations
necessarily include a counterparty change, assignments and novations also may involve
modifications to other terms of the security-based swap reported pursuant to paragraphs (c), (d),
or (i) of Rule 901. These modifications are the type of changes that the Commission believes
should be reported to a registered SDR; therefore, the Commission is modifying the definition of
“life cycle event” to clarify this view.
Third, the Commission is making a technical change to the definition to indicate that a
life cycle event includes, for a security-based swap that is not a clearing transaction, “any change
to the title or date of any master agreement, collateral agreement, margin agreement, or any other
agreement incorporated by reference into the security-based swap contract.” As re-proposed, the
definition of “life cycle event” would have included, “for a security-based swap that is not
cleared, any change to the collateral agreement.” One commenter questioned the need to include
a reference to a change in the collateral agreement in the definition of “life cycle event” because
“collateral agreement terms are not among the data required to be reported upon execution.” 682
The Commission agrees with the commenter that collateral agreement terms are not required to

682

DTCC VI at 9. Another commenter stated that the parties to a collateral agreement rarely
modify their agreement over its life, and that any change to a collateral agreement would
require extensive negotiation between the counterparties. Accordingly, the commenter
believed that the cost of establishing reporting processes to detect and report changes to a
collateral agreement would outweigh the usefulness of reporting them. See
ISDA/SIFMA I at 16.

284

be reported, and the definition of “life cycle event” in final Rule 900(q) no longer refers to
changes in the collateral agreement. To assure that Rule 901(e) operates as intended, the
Commission has modified the definition of “life cycle event” in final Rule 900(q) to reference,
with respect to a security-based swap that is not a clearing transaction, the same terms that must
be reported pursuant to Rule 901(d)(4). 683 Thus, if there were a change in the title or date of a
master agreement, collateral agreement, margin agreement, or other agreement incorporated by
reference into a security-based swap contract, such a change would be a “life cycle event” as
defined in final Rule 900(q), and final Rule 901(e) would require reporting of that change.
Finally, two commenters argued that the “Commission’s classification of a swap being
accepted for clearing as a life cycle event is inconsistent with the operations of a Clearing
Agency” because clearing may require the “termination of the pre-existing alpha swap in order to
create two new, unique swaps.” 684 The Commission agrees that any security-based swap that
results from clearing an alpha should not be considered a life cycle event of the alpha, although
the termination of the alpha would be such a life cycle event. 685 The Commission believes that
683

Final Rule 901(d)(4) requires, for a security-based swap that is not a clearing transaction,
reporting of the title and date of any master agreement, collateral agreement, margin
agreement, or other agreement incorporated by reference in the security-based swap
contract.

CME/ICE Letter at 3. As discussed in Section V, supra, in the agency model of clearing,
and sometimes in the principal model as well, acceptance of an alpha for clearing

(April 5, 2012) (noting that “when a security-based swap between two counterparties . . .
is executed and submitted for clearing, the original contract is extinguished and replaced
by two new contracts where the [clearing agency] is the buyer to the seller and the seller
to the buyer”). This treatment also would be consistent with CFTC regulations. See 17
CFR 39.12(b)(6) (CFTC rule providing that derivatives clearing organizations that clear
swaps must have rules providing that, among other things, “upon acceptance of a swap by
the derivatives clearing organization for clearing: (i) The original swap is extinguished;
[and] (ii) The original swap is replaced by an equal and opposite swap between the
285

the new term “clearing transaction” makes clear that security-based swaps that result from
clearing (e.g., betas and gammas in the agency model) are independent security-based swaps, not
life cycle events of the security-based swap that is submitted to clearing (e.g., alpha securitybased swaps).
b.

Final Rule 901(e)(1)

As described above, re-proposed Rule 901(e) would have required the reporting side to
promptly report any life cycle event, or any adjustment due to a life cycle event, that resulted in a
change to information previously reported pursuant to Rule 901(c), (d), or (i) to the entity to
which it reported the original transaction, using the transaction ID. Rule 901(e), as proposed and
re-proposed, also included provisions for determining which counterparty would report the life
cycle event. The Commission is adopting a modified version of Rule 901(e) to address
comments received and to implement certain technical changes. The Commission also has
changed the title of the rule from “Duty to report any life cycle event of a security-based swap”
in the re-proposal to “Reporting of life cycle events” in the final rule. In addition, final Rule
901(e) provides that a life cycle event or adjustment due to a life cycle event must be reported
within the timeframe specified in Rule 901(j).
Although the definition of “life cycle event” would encompass the disposition of a
security-based swap that has been submitted to clearing (e.g., whether, under the agency model
of clearing, the alpha security-based swap has been accepted for clearing or rejected by the
clearing agency), the Commission believes that it is appropriate to address the reporting of this
specific type of life cycle event in the context of the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments

house trade or acting as agent for a customer trade”).

286

Release, which address a number of topics regarding the reporting of security-based swaps that
will be submitted to clearing or that have been cleared. Accordingly, final Rule 901(e)(1)(i)
indicates that the reporting side shall not have a duty to report whether or not a security-based
swap has been accepted for clearing or terminated by a clearing agency, and instead provides that
“A life cycle event, and any adjustment due to a life cycle event, that results in a change to
information previously reported pursuant to paragraph (c), (d), or (i) of this section shall be
reported by the reporting side, except that the reporting side shall not report whether or not a
security-based swap has been accepted for clearing.”
c.

Final Rule 901(e)(2)

Re-proposed Rule 901(e) would have required the reporting side to include the
transaction ID in a life cycle event report, and to report life cycle event information to the entity
to which it reported the original transaction. Final Rule 901(e)(2) retains both of these
requirements. 686 The Commission believes that including the transaction ID in a life cycle event
report will help to ensure that it is possible to link the report of a life cycle event to the report of
the initial security-based swap of which it is a life cycle event. One commenter supported the
requirement to report life cycle events to the same entity that received the original transaction
report. 687 The commenter stated that requiring a single registered SDR to receive, store, and
report, where appropriate, all relevant information related to a given security-based swap
throughout its life cycle would help to prevent fragmentation and ensure that corrections to

686

Final Rule 901(e)(2) provides that “All reports of life cycle events and adjustments due to
life cycle events shall be reported within 24 hours of the time of occurrence of the life
cycle event to the entity to which the original security-based swap transaction was
reported and shall include the transaction ID of the original transaction.”

687

See MarkitSERV I at 8.

287

previously reported data could be easily identified by the public. 688 The Commission generally
agrees with these views, and final Rule 901(e)(2) retains the requirement to report life cycle
events to the same entity to which the original transaction was reported.
d.

Reporting Timeframe for Life Cycle Events

Rule 901(e), as proposed and re-proposed, would have required life cycle events to be
reported by the reporting side “promptly.” Two commenters believed that it was appropriate to
require that life cycle events be reported “promptly.” 689 One of these commenters also stated
that life cycle events could require different processing times based on the nature of the event,
and asked the Commission to clarify the meaning of “promptly” with respect to life cycle event
reporting. 690 In particular, the commenter stated that “the term ‘promptly,’… without further
explanation, may be interpreted by reporting parties differently for similar events and processes,
particularly in a market where certain processes have historically taken a number of days to
effect.” 691 This commenter also suggested that the Commission revise Rule 901(e) to allow for
the flexibility of reporting life cycle events either event-by-event or through one daily
submission that would include multiple events. 692 Another commenter stated that the required

688

See id. See also DTCC IX at 2.

689

See Barnard I at 3; DTCC II at 13.

690

See DTCC II at 13. The commenter stated that life cycle events that are price-forming
events subject to confirmation could be reported within the same timeframes as initial
reports of these events. However, the commenter indicated that life cycle events
resulting from other processes, such as corporate actions or credit events, “where many
trades will be impacted simultaneously and processing may be manual or automated,”
would require different amounts of time to report. See id.

691

DTCC II at 13.

692

See DTCC V at 11. See also ISDA III (requesting that “reporting parties be allowed to
report lifecycle events either intra-day or as an end-of day [sic] update to the terms of the
[security-based swap]”). Further, one commenter noted that the CFTC rules allow a life
cycle event to be reported either as event data on the same day as the event occurs or
288

time for reporting both life cycle events and corrections should be stronger and more specific
than the proposed requirement that they be reported “promptly.” 693
After careful consideration, the Commission does not believe that it would be appropriate
to require life cycle events or adjustments due to life cycle events to be reported more quickly
than the time within which information relating to the original transaction must be reported. As
noted in Section VII(B)(3), supra, final Rule 901(j) provides that the transaction information
required by Rules 901(c) and 901(d) generally must be reported within 24 hours of the time of
execution. Similarly, Rule 901(j) provides that the reporting timeframe for Rule 901(e) shall be
24 hours after the occurrence of the life cycle event or the adjustment due to the life cycle event.
The Commission believes that 24 hours should provide sufficient time to report life cycle events
even if the processing of some of these events is not yet fully automated. 694 The Commission

daily as “state data,” and that non-swap dealers or non-major swap participants may
report these events either as life cycle event data or as state data no later than the end of
the first business day following the event. See ISDA IV at 11. This commenter
requested that the Commission confirm in its rules that the same approach and timelines
may be applied to meet the requirements of Regulation SBSR. The Commission notes
that Rules 901(e) and 901(j), as adopted, provide for reporting of a life cycle event or an
adjustment due to a life cycle event within 24 hours after the occurrence of the life cycle
event or the adjustment due to the life cycle event. The Commission notes, further, that
Rule 901(e)(1) requires the reporting of a life cycle event, and any adjustment due to a
life cycle event, that results in a change to information previously reported pursuant to
Rule 901(c), 901(d), or 901(i). Thus, Rule 901(e)(1) contemplates the reporting of the
specific changes to previously reported information. Reports of life cycle events,
therefore, must clearly identify the nature of the life cycle event for each security-based
swap. It is not sufficient merely to re-report all of the terms of the security-based swap
each day without identifying which data elements have changed. However, Regulation
SBSR would not prevent a registered SDR from developing for its members a mechanism
or other service that automates or facilitates the production of life cycle events from state
data.
693

See Better Markets I at 9.

694

See DTCC II at 13. The Commission also believes that the 24-hour timeframe for
reporting life cycle events will allow reporting sides to determine whether to report life
cycle events on an intra-day or end-of-day basis. See DTCC V at 11; ISDA III. Reports
289

believes, further, that specifying a time within which life cycle event information must be
reported will address the commenter’s concern that reporting sides could adopt different
interpretations of the reporting timeframe. The Commission notes that it anticipates soliciting
comment on the timeframe for reporting life cycle events, adjustments, and clearing transactions
in the future, when it considers block thresholds and time delays.
e.

Re-proposed Rule 901(e)(2)

The Commission has determined not to adopt re-proposed Rule 901(e)(2), which would
have specified the reporting side following an assignment or novation of the security-based
swap. 695 One commenter noted that, under the current market practice for reporting novations,
the reporting party is re-determined based on the current status of the parties. 696 This commenter
noted that the current practice allows the reporting party logic to be consistent for new as well as
novated trades, and recommended that the Commission use a consistent methodology for
reporting of new trades and novations. The Commission agrees that using a single methodology
for assigning reporting obligations would be administratively easier than using one methodology
when a security-based swap is first executed and a different methodology when the
counterparties change as a result of an assignment or novation. As the Commission explained
of life cycle events, however, must clearly identify the nature of the life cycle event for
each security-based swap. It is not sufficient merely to re-report all of the terms of the
security-based swap each day without identifying which data elements have changed.
See also note 692 supra.
695

Re-proposed Rule 901(e)(2) would have provided that the duty to report life cycle event
information following an assignment or novation would switch to the other side only if
the new side did not include a U.S. person (as in the originally proposed rule) or a
security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant. As the Commission
explained in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, if the new side included a securitybased swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, the new side should retain
the duty to report. See 78 FR at 31068.

696

See ISDA III.

290

above, 697 it has determined that the reporting side following an assignment or novation will be
determined using the procedures in Rule 901(a).
f.

Additional Comments Regarding Life Cycle Event
Reporting

One commenter believed that life cycle events should be reported using standard market
forms, such as the trade confirmation for novations and early terminations, and the exercise
notice for an exercise. 698 Contrary to the commenter’s suggestion, the Commission believes that
registered SDRs should be responsible for specifying the precise manner and format for
reporting data. Moreover, the Commission understands that standard market forms may exist for
some, but not all, of the life cycle events that must be reported under Regulation SBSR.
Therefore, the Commission has determined not to prescribe a format for reporting sides to report
life cycle event information. Instead, Rule 907(a)(3), as adopted, requires a registered SDR to
establish and maintain written policies and procedures that specify how reporting sides are to
report life cycle events and corrections to previously submitted information, for making
corresponding updates or corrections to transaction records, and for applying an appropriate flag
to these transaction reports. 699
One commenter stated that it was critical for the SEC and the CFTC to adopt consistent
regulatory approaches “[i]n the life cycle event model across asset classes.” 700 The Commission
agrees that would be useful for the Commissions to adopt consistent approaches to the reporting
of life cycle event information to the extent possible. The Commission believes that Regulation

697

See supra Section V(C)(5).

698

See DTCC II at 13.

699

See infra Section XII(C).

700

ISDA/SIFMA I at 6.

291

SBSR’s approach to life cycle event reporting is broadly consistent with the approach taken by
the CFTC. For example, because the agencies have adopted similar definitions, the life cycle
event information required to be reported under the rules of both agencies is substantially
similar. 701 In addition, both agencies’ rules require that life cycle events be reported to the same
entity that received the report of the original transaction, and both agencies’ rules require the
entity that reports the initial transaction to also report life cycle events for the transaction. The
Commission notes that a registered SDR that accepts transaction reports for both swaps and
security-based swaps could establish policies and procedures for reporting life cycle events of
security-based swaps that are comparable to its policies and procedures for reporting life cycle
events of swaps, provided that its policies and procedures for reporting life cycle events of
security-based swaps comply with the requirements of Regulation SBSR.
Another commenter expressed the view that Regulation SBSR “should clarify what shall
be reported as the time of execution for a life cycle event for purposes of public
dissemination.” 702 The commenter stated that the CFTC requires market participants to report
the execution time of the original trade as the execution time for a life cycle event for the trade.
The commenter suggested that, under this approach, “the data that is publicly disseminated for
lifecycle events may not be that meaningful to the public as it does not include any indication of
the point in time the reported price has been traded.” 703 The commenter stated, further, that the

701

See CFTC Rule 45.1, 17 CFR 45.1. The Commissions’ ongoing reporting requirements
differ, however, with respect to the reporting of valuation information. The CFTC’s rules
require reporting of valuation data as well as life cycle event data. As discussed in above
in Section II(B)(3)(k), the Commission is not requiring reporting of valuation data for
security-based swaps.

702

703

292

time of execution for a life cycle event for purposes of public dissemination “should be the date
and time such price-forming event is agreed.” 704
As discussed in Section VII(B)(3), supra, final Rule 901(j) provides that the reporting
timeframe for a life cycle event shall be 24 hours after the occurrence of the life cycle event or
the adjustment due to the life cycle event. Final Rule 902(a) requires a registered SDR to
publicly disseminate a transaction report of a life cycle event, or adjustment due to a life cycle
event, immediately upon receipt of the information. Thus, under Regulation SBSR, a life cycle
event, or an adjustment due to a life cycle event, must be reported and publicly disseminated
within 24 hours after the occurrence of the life cycle event or adjustment due to the life cycle
event. The Commission believes that together these requirements will provide market observers
with certain information concerning the time when the life cycle event occurred. However, the
Commission notes that Regulation SBSR, as proposed and re-proposed, did not require the
reporting or public dissemination of the time of execution of a life cycle event, and Regulation
SBSR, as adopted, likewise includes no such requirements.
B.

Error Corrections—Rule 905

As the Commission noted in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, any system for
transaction reporting must accommodate the possibility that certain data elements may be
incorrectly reported. 705 Therefore, the Commission proposed Rule 905 to establish procedures
for correcting errors in reported and disseminated security-based swap information.
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission modified proposed Rule 905
slightly to correspond with certain new provisions in re-proposed Rule 908, which contemplated
704

Id. at 13-14.

705

See 75 FR at 75236.

293

that certain types of cross-border security-based swaps would be required to be reported but not
publicly disseminated. Rule 905 was re-proposed to clarify that, if a registered SDR receives
corrected information relating to a previously submitted transaction report, it would be required
to publicly disseminate a corrected transaction report only if the initial security-based swap were
subject to the public dissemination requirement. 706 The Commission also made certain other
technical and conforming changes, 707 but otherwise re-proposed Rule 905 was substantially
similar to proposed Rule 905.
As discussed below, the Commission received several comments on proposed Rule 905.
After consideration of the comments, the Commission has determined to adopt Rule 905 with
certain minor editorial revisions. 708
Rule 905(a) applies to any counterparty to a security-based swap that discovers an error
in the information reported with respect to that security-based swap. If a non-reporting side
discovers the error, the non-reporting side shall promptly notify the reporting side of the error.
Once the reporting side receives notification of the error from the non-reporting side, or if the
706

As discussed above in Section VI, Rule 902 requires a registered SDR to immediately
publicly disseminate a transaction report of a security-based swap, or a life cycle event or
adjustment due to a life cycle event. If a security-based swap falls into the category of
regulatory reporting but not public dissemination, there would be no need to publicly
disseminate the correction because the initial security-based swap was not publicly
disseminated.

707

The Commission modified the language from “counterparty” or “party” to “side” in the
re-proposal of Rule 905. Additional minor changes were made for clarification such as
inserting “transaction” in Rule 905(a)(1) and changing an “a” to “the” in Rule 905(b)(1).
Re-proposed Rule 905 also substitutes the word “counterparties”—which is a defined
term in Regulation SBSR—for the word “parties,” which was used in the initial proposal
but was not a defined term.

708

For example, the title of final Rule 905(a) is “Duty to correct,” rather than “Duty of
counterparties to correct.” In addition, the Commission is deleting a reference to
“security-based swap transaction” from Rule 905(a)(2), as well as a reference to
“reporting side” in Rule 905(b)(1).”

294

reporting side discovers the error on its own, the reporting side must promptly submit an
amended report—containing corrected data—to the registered SDR that received the erroneous
transaction report. The reporting side must submit the report required by Rule 905(a) in a
manner consistent with the policies and procedures of the registered SDR that are contemplated
by Rule 907(a)(3). 709
Rule 905(b) details the responsibilities of a registered SDR to correct information and redisseminate corrected information, where appropriate. If a registered SDR either discovers an
error in the security-based swap information or receives notification of an error from a reporting
side, the registered SDR is required to verify the accuracy of the terms of the security-based
swap and, following such verification, promptly correct the information in its system. If the
erroneous information contains any primary trade information enumerated in Rule 901(c) (and
the transaction is dissemination-eligible 710), the registered SDR must publicly disseminate a
corrected transaction report of the security-based swap promptly following verification of the
trade by the counterparties to the security-based swap, with an indication that the report relates to
a previously disseminated transaction. 711
Three commenters were generally supportive of the proposed error reporting procedures.
One commenter believed that publicly disseminating error reports would “increase confidence in
709

See infra Section XII(C).

710

See Rule 902(c) (listing certain transactions that a registered SDR may not publicly
disseminate).

711

See Rule 905(b)(2). When verifying information pursuant to Rule 905(b), a registered
SDR must comply with the standards of Rule 13n-5. In particular, Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iii)
provides that an SDR “shall establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to satisfy itself that the transaction data that has been
submitted to the security-based swap data repository is complete and accurate, and
clearly identifies the source for each trade side and the pairing method (if any) for each
transaction in order to identify the level of quality of the transaction data.”

295

the integrity of the markets.” 712 Another commenter stated that it supported “the objective of
prompt correction of errors by the reporting party.” 713 A third commenter expressed support for
requiring a reporting party to correct previously reported erroneous data, and agreed that it was
appropriate for a non-reporting counterparty to have the obligation to notify the reporting party
of an error of which it is aware. 714
The third commenter also sought guidance regarding the application of Rule 905 if a
dispute arose between a reporting side and non-reporting side concerning whether a report was,
in fact, erroneous. 715 The commenter urged the Commission to provide in its final rule that, if
corrected information is not promptly reported to the registered SDR because of a dispute over
whether an error exists, the non-reporting party side may itself report the disputed data to the
registered SDR; the commenter believed that, in such cases, the Commission should oblige the
registered SDR to review promptly the disputed data with the counterparties. 716
The Commission notes that, in a separate release, it is adopting Rule 13n-5(b)(6) under
the Exchange Act, which requires an SDR to establish procedures and provide facilities
reasonably designed to effectively resolve disputes over the accuracy of the transaction data and
positions that are recorded in the SDR. 717 As the Commission notes in adopting that rule, only
the parties to a dispute can resolve it. Thus, the SDR itself is not required to resolve the dispute,
although the Commission believes that SDRs must provide processes to facilitate resolution,

296

which would improve the quality and accuracy of the security-based swap data that the SDR
holds. The Commission is interpreting the term “error” in final Rule 905 as one which both sides
to the transaction would reasonably regard as such. If the counterparties dispute whether an error
exists, then the counterparties can use an SDR’s procedures and facilities established under Rule
13n-5(b)(6) to attempt to resolve the dispute. If the dispute-resolution process under Rule 13n5(b)(6) yielded agreement that an error exists, then Rule 905 would require the counterparties to
correct the error. 718
The third commenter also asked the Commission, in the context of Rule 905, to clarify
that the reporting is for informational purposes and does not affect the terms of the trade;
otherwise, “[a]bsent some mechanism to make the report nonbinding pending a dispute, the
correction mechanics in the Proposed Rule will result in the reporting party (typically the SBS
dealer) prevailing in any dispute.” 719 The Commission does not believe that reporting of an error
in previously submitted security-based swap transaction information can change the terms of the
trade. Reporting is designed to capture the terms of the trade, not to establish such terms. The
Commission’s expectation, however, is that the report of a security-based swap provided to and
held by a registered SDR will reflect, fully and accurately, the terms of the trade agreed to by the
counterparties. If a counterparty becomes aware that the record held by the registered SDR does

718

In the context of trade reporting, one commenter stated: “Confirmation processes are
designed to identify when economic terms to trades have changed, distinguishing
between expected events under an existing confirmation and amendments of economic
terms due to the modification in terms. . . . The trade confirmation is a bilateral process in
which both parties agree to the confirmation, thereby ensuring any errors in the original
data are corrected.” DTCC II at 5. The Commission believes that this comment supports
the approach taken above, that counterparties to a transaction do not incur duties under
Rule 905 unless an error is detected that both sides would regard as such.

719

297

not accurately reflect the terms of the trade, that counterparty incurs a duty under Rule 905 to
take action to have that record corrected.
A fourth commenter argued that the specific root cause of such amendments (for example
a booking error or a trade amendment between parties) could be omitted. 720 The Commission
notes that Rule 905 does not require the reporting side to include the root cause of the error. This
commenter also urged the Commission to clarify that reporting parties are not responsible for
data that are inaccurately transcribed or corrupted after submission to the registered SDR. The
Commission notes that the obligations under Rule 905 attach to a counterparty to a securitybased swap only after that counterparty “discovers” the error or, if the counterparty is the
reporting side, after it “receives notification” of the error from the non-reporting side. 721 Thus, a
security-based swap counterparty incurs no duty under Rule 905 if its transaction data are
inaccurately transcribed or corrupted after submission to the registered SDR unless the
counterparty discovers the inaccurate transcription or corruption. Thus, under Rule 905, a
counterparty would incur no duty to correct data errors of which it is unaware. 722
Finally, a fifth commenter believed that Rule 905 should provide an error reporting
timeframe that is stronger and more specific than the proposed requirement that such reports be
submitted “promptly.” 723 The Commission continues to believe that “promptly” is an
appropriate standard because it emphasizes the need for corrections to be submitted without

Rule 905(a).

722

The registered SDR, however, must comply with Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iii) under the
Exchange Act, which provides, in relevant part: “Every security-based swap data
repository shall establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to satisfy itself that the transaction data that has been submitted to
the security-based swap data repository is complete and accurate.”

Policies and Procedures for Reporting Life Cycle Events and Corrections

Rule 907(a)(3), as originally proposed, would have required a registered SDR to establish
and maintain written policies and procedures for “specifying how reporting parties are to report
corrections to previously submitted information in its records that is subsequently discovered to
be erroneous, and applying an appropriate indicator to any transaction report required to be
disseminated by [Rule 905(b)(2)] that the report relates to a previously disseminated
transaction.” Rule 907(a)(3), as re-proposed, would have required a registered SDR to establish
and maintain written policies and procedures for “specifying how reporting sides are to report
corrections to previously submitted information, making corrections to information in its records
that is subsequently discovered to be erroneous, and applying an appropriate indicator to any
report required to be disseminated by [Rule 905(b)(2)] that the report relates to a previously
disseminated transaction.”
The Commission received no adverse comment on Rule 907(a)(3) and is adopting it as
re-proposed with a slight modification. Rule 907(a)(3), as adopted, requires a registered SDR to
establish and maintain policies and procedures for “specifying procedures for reporting life cycle
events and corrections to previously submitted information, making corresponding updates or
corrections to transaction records, and applying an appropriate flag to the transaction report to
indicate that the report is an error correction required to be disseminated by [Rule 905(b)(2)] or
is a life cycle event, or any adjustment due to a life cycle event, required to be disseminated by
[Rule 902(a)]” (emphasis added). The Commission is adding to final Rule 907(a)(3) the explicit
requirement that a registered SDR establish and maintain policies and procedures regarding the
reporting and flagging of life cycle events. The Commission believes that these additions will

299

improve the ability of the Commission and other relevant authorities to identify and analyze life
cycle events of security-based swaps.
In the case of a life cycle event or error correction, the initial transaction has already been
reported to the registered SDR, and the subsequent report involves some type of revision to the
previously submitted report. The Commission seeks to have the ability to observe a securitybased swap transaction throughout its life, which requires the ability to connect subsequently
reported events to the original transaction. The Commission also seeks to avoid mistaking life
cycle events or corrections of previously submitted reports for new transactions, which could
result in overcounting the gross notional amount of the security-based swap market or subsets
thereof. Therefore, the Commission believes that registered SDRs must have appropriate
policies and procedures that stipulate how reporting sides must report such follow-on events, and
how the registered SDR itself can distinguish them and record them properly.
Just as the Commission believes that a registered SDR should be given reasonable
flexibility to enumerate specific data elements to be reported and the method for reporting them,
the Commission also believes that a registered SDR should be given reasonable flexibility
regarding the handling of corrections to previously submitted information. As discussed above,
final Rule 905 does not require the reporting side to report the cause of an error. 724 Nor does
Rule 905 set forth a specific procedure for how a registered SDR must accept a report of a life
cycle event or error correction. Accordingly, a registered SDR’s policies and procedures under
Rule 907(a)(3) could require resubmission of the entire record with or without an indication of
which elements in that record had been revised. Alternatively, a registered SDR’s policies and
procedures could require a submission of only the data element or elements that had been
724

See supra note 721 and accompanying text.

300

revised. The Commission notes, however, that Rule 905(b)(2) requires a registered SDR to
publicly disseminate a corrected transaction report of a security-based swap, if erroneously
reported information relates to a security-based swap that had been publicly disseminated and
falls into any of the categories of information enumerated in Rule 901(c). Therefore, a registered
SDR will need to have a means of identifying changes in reported data so that it can identify the
changed element or elements in the publicly disseminated correction report.
The Commission notes that Rule 907(a)(3) requires a registered SDR’s policies and
procedures also to address how the registered SDR will apply an appropriate condition flag to
any corrected transaction report that must be re-disseminated. Market observers should be able
to understand that a transaction report triggered by Rule 905(b)(2) or Rule 902(a) does not
represent a new transaction, but merely a revision to a previous transaction. Without an
indication to that effect, market observers could misunderstand the true state of the market. 725
To provide observers with a clear view of the market, public reports of life cycle events should
allow observers to identify the security-based swap subject to the life cycle event. The
Commission notes, however, that registered SDRs may not use the transaction ID for this
function because the transaction ID is not a piece of “information reported pursuant to [Rule
901(c)]” or a condition flag. 726 Moreover, the Commission believes that knowledge of the
transaction ID should remain limited to counterparties, infrastructure providers, and their agents,
725

One such condition flag could be for voided trades. There may be scenarios in which a
security-based swap is executed (or thought to be executed), subsequently reported to a
registered SDR, and publicly disseminated by that SDR—but later voided or canceled for
some reason. For example, a transaction might be submitted to clearing but rejected by
the clearing agency, and the counterparties could deem their agreement to be void ab
initio. In this situation, the Commission believes the registered SDR could satisfy its
obligation to publicly disseminate under Regulation SBSR by including a condition flag
that the previously disseminated transaction report had been voided or canceled.

726

See Rule 902(a).

301

and should not be widely known. Knowledge of the transaction ID by additional parties could
raise data integrity issues, as such additional parties could accidentally or even intentionally
submit “false corrections” to the registered SDR regarding transactions to which they were never
a counterparty. This could damage the otherwise accurate record of the original transaction.
Screening out improperly submitted “corrections”—or repairing damage to the registered SDR’s
records that a false correction might cause—could become a significant and unwanted burden on
registered SDRs. Therefore, registered SDRs, in their policies and procedures under Rule
907(a)(3), will need to use some means other than the transaction ID to indicate that a publicly
disseminated report triggered by Rule 905(b)(2) or Rule 902(a) pertains to a previously
disseminated transaction. 727
XIII. Other Duties of Participants
A.

Duties of Non-Reporting Sides to Report Certain Information—Rule 906(a)

The Commission believes that a registered SDR generally should maintain complete
information for each security-based swap reported to the registered SDR, including UICs for
both sides of a transaction. Although Regulation SBSR generally takes the approach of requiring

727

For example, DTCC Data Repository, LLC (“DDR”) utilizes an Event Identifier (“EID”)
to maintain the integrity of a transaction throughout its lifecycle and enable public
identification of events, including corrections, which occur with respect to the
transaction. See DDR Rulebook, Section 4.1 at
http://dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rules/DDR_Rulebook.ashx, last visited
September 22, 2014. The EID is separate from the Unique Swap Identifiers (“USI”),
which is the CFTC-equivalent of the transaction ID. See also ISDA/SIFMA I at 10
(recommending that initial trades should carry a “primary reference number” when
disseminated, “and all amendments of that trade would then produce iterations of the
original reference number”).

302

only one side to report the majority of the transaction information, 728 the Commission recognizes
that it might not be feasible or desirable for the reporting side to report to a registered SDR all of
the UICs of the non-reporting side. To address this issue, the Commission proposed Rule 906(a),
which would provide a means for a registered SDR to obtain UICs from the non-reporting side.
Rule 906(a), as initially proposed, would have established procedures designed to ensure
that a registered SDR obtains UICs for both direct counterparties to a security-based swap. As
initially proposed, Rule 906(a) would have required a registered SDR to identify any securitybased swap reported to it for which the registered SDR does not have the participant ID and (if
applicable) the broker ID, desk ID, and trader ID of each counterparty. The registered SDR
would have been required to send a report once a day to each of its participants identifying, for
each security-based swap to which that participant is a counterparty, the security-based swap(s)
for which the registered SDR lacks participant IDs and (if applicable) a broker ID, desk ID, or
trader ID. The participant would have been required to provide the missing information within
24 hours of receiving this report from the registered SDR.
When the Commission re-proposed Regulation SBSR as part of the Cross-Border
Proposing Release, it made conforming changes to Rule 906(a) to reflect the introduction of the

728

Section 13A(a)(3) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m-1(a)(1), stipulates which
counterparty must report a security-based swap that is not accepted by any clearing
agency or derivatives clearing organization. That provision does not contemplate
reporting by the other direct counterparty. Title VII does not stipulate who should report
cleared security-based swaps. However, Section 13(m)(1)(F) of the Exchange Act, 15
U.S.C. 78m(m)(1)(F), provides that “[p]arties to a security-based swap (including agents
of the parties to a security-based swap) shall be responsible for reporting security-based
swap transaction information to the appropriate registered entity in a timely manner as
may be prescribed by the Commission.”

303

“reporting side” concept and to clarify that the participant ID, broker ID, desk ID, and trader ID
must be reported only for direct counterparties. 729
The Commission has decided to adopt Rule 906(a) substantially as re-proposed, with
conforming changes related to including branch ID and execution agent ID among the UICs that
must be provided to the registered SDR 730 and other minor technical changes. 731
729

See 78 FR at 31214.

730

As discussed above, see supra Section II(C), the Commission has added “branch ID” and
“execution agent ID” to the UICs required to be reported under Regulation SBSR. The
Commission believes that reporting the branch ID and the execution agent ID for both
counterparties to a security-based swap, if applicable, to a registered SDR will assist the
Commission and other relevant authorities in overseeing the security-based swap market.
Accordingly, the Commission has included branch ID and execution agent ID as UICs
that registered SDRs must obtain pursuant to Rule 906(a).

731

The Commission has determined to use the term “counterparty ID” rather than
“participant ID” and to use the term “trading desk ID” rather than “desk ID” throughout
Regulation SBSR. See supra Sections II(B)(3)(b) and II(C)(3)(c). In addition, the
Commission has inserted the word “direct” immediately before each instance of the word
“counterparty.” When the Commission re-proposed Rule 906(a), it made conforming
changes to reflect the introduction of the “reporting side” concept and to clarify that
relevant UICs for the non-reporting side must be reported only for direct counterparties.
The word “counterparty” occurs in two places in final Rule 906(a), but the re-proposed
rule inserted “direct” before “counterparty” only after the first occurrence. Final Rule
906(a) inserts “direct” before “counterparty” both times that the word “counterparty” is
used. Final Rule 906(a) also includes modifications that clarify that the term
“participant,” as used in Rule 906(a), means a participant in a registered SDR. The
Commission has made similar modifications throughout final Rule 906. The
Commission also is revising the final sentence of Rule 906(a) to clarify that the
participant referred to in that sentence is a participant of a registered SDR, and to clarify
that a participant that receives a Rule 906(a) report from a registered SDR is responsible
for providing missing UIC information for its side of each security-based swap
referenced in the report. The participant is not responsible for providing any missing
UIC information pertaining to the other side of the transaction. Accordingly, the last
sentence of Rule 906(a) states: “A participant of a registered security-based swap data
repository that receives such a report shall provide the missing information with respect
to its side of each security-based swap referenced in the report to the registered securitybased swap data repository within 24 hours.” In addition, the Commission is revising the
rule to refer to execution agents to conform to Rule 901(d)(1)(i). Finally, to more
accurately reflect the requirements of the rule, the Commission is changing the title of the
rule to “Identifying missing UIC information.”
304

The Commission received two comment letters from the same commenter addressing
proposed Rule 906(a). The first letter, which responded to the initial proposal, stated that
regulators must have the UICs of both counterparties to a security-based swap to accurately track
exposures. 732 The commenter believed that, ideally, this process would be supported
electronically and that the use of third-party services should meet this requirement. 733
The Commission generally shares the commenter’s view that registered SDRs should
maintain UICs for both sides of a security-based swap. 734 The Commission notes that Rule
901(d) requires the reporting side to report the branch ID, broker ID, execution agent ID, trader
ID, and trading desk ID—as applicable—only for the direct counterparty on its side. Rule
901(d)(1) requires the reporting side to report only the counterparty ID or execution agent ID, as
applicable, of a counterparty on the other side. The Commission could have required the
reporting side to provide UIC information for both sides of the transaction, but this would
obligate a non-reporting side to furnish its UIC information to the reporting side so that the
additional UICs could be reported by the reporting side. There are circumstances where a nonreporting side might be unable or unwilling to provide its UIC information to the reporting side.
Therefore, the Commission is instead requiring the registered SDR to obtain these UICs from the

732

See DTCC II at 16. This commenter also suggested that desk IDs and trader IDs should
not be required to be reported due to the fact that desk structures are changed relatively
frequently and traders often rotate to different desks or transfer to different firms. See
DTCC II at 11. This suggestion is addressed above in Section II(C)(3)(c).

733

See DTCC II at 16.

734

However, if the non-reporting side for the security-based swap does not meet the
definition of “participant” in Rule 900(u), Rule 906(a) would not require the registered
SDR to request UIC information from the non-reporting side. This result is consistent
with the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release. See 75 FR at 75240 (“Thus, the
Commission anticipates that there would be some SBSs reported to and captured by a
registered SDR where only one counterparty of the SBS is a participant”).

305

non-reporting side through the Rule 906(a) process. 735 Obtaining UICs for both sides will
enhance the Commission’s ability to carry out its responsibility to oversee the security-based
swap market, because the Commission will be able to identify individual traders and business
units that are involved in security-based swap transactions. 736
In a subsequent comment letter, in response to the re-proposal of Regulation SBSR, the
same commenter expressed concern that Rule 906(a) could require a registered SDR to send
reports to and obtain information from persons who might not be participants of that registered
SDR. 737 More generally, this commenter suggested that registered SDRs should not police

735

Rule 906(a) provides: “A registered security-based swap data repository shall identify
any security-based swap reported to it for which the registered security-based swap data
repository does not have the counterparty ID and (if applicable) the broker ID, branch ID,
execution agent ID, trading desk ID, and trader ID of each direct counterparty. Once a
day, the registered security-based swap data repository shall send a report to each
participant of the registered security-based swap data repository or, if applicable, an
execution agent, identifying, for each security-based swap to which that participant is a
counterparty, the security-based swap(s) for which the registered security-based swap
data repository lacks counterparty ID and (if applicable) broker ID, branch ID, execution
agent ID, desk ID, and trader ID. A participant of a registered security-based swap data
repository that receives such a report shall provide the missing information with respect
to its side of each security-based swap referenced in the report to the registered securitybased swap data repository within 24 hours.” Rule 900(u) defines “participant,” with
respect to a registered SDR, as “a counterparty, that meets the criteria of § 242.908(b), of
a security-based swap that is reported to that registered security-based swap data
repository to satisfy an obligation under § 242.901(a).”

736

Nothing in Regulation SBSR prevents a non-reporting side from voluntarily providing all
of its applicable UICs to the reporting side, so that the reporting side could, as agent,
report all of the non-reporting side’s UICs together with the rest of the data elements
required by Rules 901(c) and 901(d). If this were to occur, the registered SDR would not
need to send a Rule 906(a) report to the non-reporting side inquiring about the nonreporting side’s missing UICs.

737

See DTCC V at 13. As noted above, however, Rule 906(a), as adopted, requires the
registered SDR to obtain UIC information only from non-reporting sides that are
participants of that registered SDR.

306

security-based swap reports for deficiencies or unpopulated data fields in any manner that
requires the registered SDR to take affirmative action to obtain information. 738
The Commission disagrees with the commenter’s suggestion that registered SDRs should
have no duty to review the completeness of security-based swap reports or obtain missing
information from participants. To the contrary, the Commission believes that registered SDRs
are best situated to review reported data for completeness because they have a statutory and
regulatory duty to accept and maintain security-based swap data, as prescribed by the
Commission.739 Imposing an affirmative duty on registered SDRs to verify the completeness of
reported data and to obtain missing data should increase the reliability of data maintained by
registered SDRs while decreasing the possibility of registered SDRs providing incomplete
reports to relevant authorities. This, in turn, will facilitate oversight of the security-based swap
market, which is a primary objective Title VII.
Rule 906(a) requires registered SDRs to communicate with participants that are not
reporting sides under Regulation SBSR. As discussed above, these communications are required
to ensure that a registered SDR maintains complete UIC information for both sides of each
security-based swap transaction that is reported to the registered SDR. The Commission
recognizes that some non-reporting sides may not wish to connect directly to a registered SDR
because they may not want to incur the costs of establishing a direct connection. Rule 906(a)
does not prescribe the means registered SDRs must use to obtain information from non-reporting
sides. As a result, registered SDRs have broad discretion to establish a methodology for
notifying non-reporting sides of missing UIC information and obtaining UIC reports from the
738

See DTCC V at 13.

739

See 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5).

307

non-reporting side. For example, a registered SDR could send notifications and receive reports
via e-mail, in accordance with its policies and procedures. 740 Registered SDRs should consider
allowing non-reporting sides to provide the information required by Rule 906(a) in a minimallyburdensome manner.
Historical security-based swaps must be reported to a registered SDR pursuant to Rule
901(i). The Commission acknowledges that broker IDs, branch IDs, execution agent IDs,
trading desk IDs, and trader IDs do not yet exist and will not exist until assigned by registered
SDRs. Therefore, these UICs are not data elements applicable to historical security-based swaps.
Accordingly, registered SDRs are not required under Rule 906(a) to identify these UICs as
missing or to communicate to non-reporting side participants that they are missing, and nonreporting side participants are not required by Rule 906(a) to provide these UICs to a registered
SDR with respect to any historical security-based swaps.
B.

Duty to Provide Ultimate Parent and Affiliate Information to Registered
SDRs—Rule 906(b)

To assist the Commission and other relevant authorities in monitoring systemic risk, a
registered SDR should be able to identify and calculate the security-based swap exposures of its
participants on an enterprise-wide basis. 741 Therefore, the Commission proposed Rule 906(b),
which would have required each participant of a registered SDR to provide to the registered SDR
information sufficient to identify its ultimate parent(s) and any affiliate(s) of the participant that
also are participants of the registered SDR. Proposed Rule 906(b) would have required a person
740

See supra Section IV (discussing Rule 907(a)(2)).

741

The Commission notes that Rule 13n-5(b)(2) under the Exchange Act provides: “Every
security-based swap data repository shall establish, maintain, and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to calculate positions for all persons with open
security-based swaps for which the security-based swap data repository maintains
records.”

308

to provide parent and affiliate information to a registered SDR immediately upon becoming a
participant. 742 Proposed Rule 906(b) also would have required a participant to promptly notify
the registered SDR of any changes to reported parent or affiliate information.
The Commission also proposed rules to define the relationships that could give rise to
reporting obligations under Rule 906(b). Proposed Rule 900 would have defined an “affiliate” as
“any person that, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
with, a person” and “control” as “the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or
cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership
of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.” 743 The Commission also proposed definitions of
“parent” and “ultimate parent” to identify particular categories of affiliated entities based on a
person’s ability to control an affiliate. Specifically, proposed Rule 900 would have defined
“parent” to mean “a legal person that controls a participant” and “ultimate parent” as “a legal
person that controls a participant and that itself has no parent.” The Commission also proposed
to define “ultimate parent ID” as “the UIC assigned to an ultimate parent of a participant.”

742

The policies and procedures of a registered SDR will establish on-boarding procedures
for participants.

743

Proposed Rule 900 further would have provided that a person would be presumed to
control another person if the person: “(1) [i]s a director, general partner or officer
exercising executive responsibility (or having similar status or functions); (2) [d]irectly or
indirectly has the right to vote 25 percent or more of a class of voting securities or has the
power to sell or direct the sale of 25 percent or more of a class of voting securities; or (3)
[i]n the case of a partnership, has the right to receive, upon dissolution, or has
contributed, 25 percent or more of the capital.”

309

The Commission re-proposed the definitions of “affiliate,” “control,” “parent,” “ultimate
parent,” and “ultimate parent ID,” and Rule 906(b) without change in the Cross-Border
Proposing Release. 744
After considering the comments received, which are discussed below, the Commission is
adopting Rule 906(b), as proposed and re-proposed, subject to two clarifying changes. 745
Obtaining ultimate parent and affiliate information will assist the Commission in monitoring
enterprise-wide risks related to security-based swaps. If participants are not required to identify
which of their affiliates also are participants of a particular registered SDR, the Commission or
other relevant authorities might be unable to calculate the security-based swap exposures of that
ownership group using data held in the registered SDR. As a result, systemic risk might build
undetected within an ownership group, even if all security-based swaps for that enterprise were
reported to the same registered SDR. The lack of transparency regarding OTC derivatives
exposures within the same ownership group was one of the factors that hampered regulators’
ability to respond to the financial crisis of 2007-08. 746

744

See 78 FR at 31210-11. The definition of “affiliate” was re-proposed as Rule 900(a).
The definitions of “control,” “parent,” and “ultimate parent” were re-proposed as Rules
900(f), 900(r), and 900(ll), respectively. Re-proposed Rule 900(mm) contained the
definition of “ultimate parent ID.”

745

Specifically, the Commission is modifying Rule 906(b) to clarify that the term
“participant,” means a participant in a registered SDR. The Commission also is replacing
the term “participant ID” with “counterparty ID.”

746

See Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, “The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report: Final
Report of the National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis
in the United States,” January 2011, at xxi, available at:
http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf, last visited September 22,
2014 (explaining that relevant authorities “lacked a full understanding of the risks and
interconnections in the financial markets” prior to and during the financial crisis,
including, among other things, the exposures created by Lehman Brothers’ derivatives
contracts).

310

The Commission believes that a reasonable means of monitoring security-based swap
positions on a group-wide basis is by requiring each participant of a registered SDR to provide
information sufficient to identify the participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any affiliate(s) of the
participant that also are participants of the registered SDR, using ultimate parent IDs and
counterparty IDs. 747 Rule 906(b), as adopted, imposes an affirmative obligation on participants
of a registered SDR to provide this ownership and affiliation information to a registered SDR
immediately upon becoming a participant of that SDR. The participant also must notify the
registered SDR promptly of any changes to that information. To minimize burdens on
participants and to align the burdens as closely as possible with the purpose behind the
requirement, Rule 906(b) does not require a participant of a registered SDR to provide
information to the registered SDR about all of its affiliates, but only those that are also
participants of the same registered SDR.
The Commission received three comments addressing proposed Rule 906(b). 748 One
commenter supported the proposed rule, stating that parent and affiliate information, along with
other information required to be reported by Regulation SBSR, is critical to providing regulators
with a comprehensive view of the swaps market and assuring that publicly reported data is
accurate and meaningful. 749 This commenter further stated that registered SDRs should have the
power to obtain parent and affiliate information from firms, because this information would help
to illustrate the full group level exposures of firms and the impact of the failure of any
747

Among other things, Rule 906(b) should enable the Commission and other relevant
authorities to identify quickly security-based swaps of a corporate group that have been
reported to the registered SDR, including security-based swaps held by securitization
vehicles that are controlled by financial institutions.

participant. 750 The Commission generally agrees with the commenter’s points and continues to
believe that identifying security-based swap exposures within an ownership group is critical to
monitoring market activity and detecting potential systemic risks. The existence of data vendors
that provide parent and affiliate information may reduce any burdens on participants associated
with reporting such information to a registered SDR, 751 but the Commission does not view this
as an adequate substitute for having the information reported to and readily available from
registered SDRs. Title VII’s regulatory reporting requirement is designed to allow the
Commission and other relevant authorities to have access to comprehensive information about
security-based swap activity in registered SDRs. The Commission believes that it would be
inimical to that end for relevant authorities to have all the transaction information in registered
SDRs but be forced to rely on information from outside of registered SDRs to link positions held
by affiliates within the same corporate group.
Two commenters suggested clarifications or modifications to the proposed rule. 752 One
commenter expressed concerns about how Rule 906(b) would apply to agents, noting that
investment advisers frequently execute a single security-based swap transaction on behalf of
multiple accounts and allocate the notional amount of the transaction among these accounts at
the end of the day. 753 The commenter stated that advisers often do not know all of the affiliates
of their clients and, as a result, might be unable to comply with Rule 906(b). 754 The commenter
750

See id. at 17. This commenter believed that a registered SDR likely would obtain parent
and affiliate information from a data vendor and allow participants to review and approve
the data.

recommended that “the Commission clarify that an adviser that has implemented reasonable
policies and procedures to obtain the required information about affiliates and documented its
efforts to obtain the information from its clients be deemed to have satisfied [Rule 906(b) of]
Regulation SBSR.” 755
The Commission believes that it is unnecessary to modify Rule 906(b) in response to this
comment. The Commission notes that Rule 906(b) imposes no obligations on an execution
agent, such as an investment adviser that executes a single security-based swap on behalf of
multiple accounts and allocates the notional amount of the transaction among those accounts at
the end of the day. Rather, it would be the counterparty itself that would have the responsibility
under Rule 906(b).
Another commenter expressed the view that the information required to be reported by
Rule 906(b) should be placed in prescribed XBRL templates or other such input mechanisms that
would capture this information at its source for all downstream processes in the financial supply
chain to use. 756 The Commission has determined not to specify the manner or format in which
security-based swap counterparties must provide ultimate parent and affiliate information to a
registered SDR. The Commission believes that it would be preferable to allow each registered
SDR to determine a suitable way to receive and maintain ultimate parent and affiliate
information about its participants. The Commission notes that Rule 907(a)(6), as adopted,
requires a registered SDR to establish and maintain written policies and procedures for
periodically obtaining from each participant information that identifies the participant’s ultimate

313

parent(s) and any other participant(s) with which the counterparty is affiliated, using ultimate
parent IDs and counterparty IDs. 757
The Commission received three comments on the definitions of “control” and
“affiliate.” 758 No commenters specifically addressed the definitions of “parent,” “ultimate
parent,” or “ultimate parent ID.” After carefully evaluating these comments, the Commission is
adopting the definitions of “affiliate,” “control,” “parent,” “ultimate parent,” and “ultimate
parent ID” as proposed and re-proposed. 759
One commenter stated its view that the proposed definition of “control” was improper. 760
This commenter believed that the proposed 25% threshold for presuming control was too low,
and that obtaining the information required by Rule 906(b) from entities with which a securitybased swap market participant has less than a majority ownership relationship would be overly
burdensome, and, in some cases, not practicable. 761 The commenter recommended that the
Commission amend the definition to presume control based on no less than majority
ownership. 762

757

As originally proposed, Rule 907(a)(6) would have required a registered SDR to establish
and maintain written policies and procedures “[f]or periodically obtaining from each
participant information that identifies the participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any other
participant(s) with which the counterparty is affiliated, using ultimate parent IDs and
participant IDs” (emphasis added). The Commission re-proposed Rule 907(a)(6) with the
word “participant” in place of the word “counterparty.”

758

See DTCC II at 17; Multiple Associations Letter at 7-8; SIFMA I at 6.

759

Final Rule 900(a) defines “affiliate,” while the definitions of “control,” “parent,”
“ultimate parent” and “ultimate parent ID” are in Rules 900(h), 900(t), 900(oo), and
900(pp), respectively.

The Commission disagrees that, for purposes of Regulation SBSR, control should be
presumed to exist only if there is majority ownership. Rule 906(b) is designed to assist the
Commission and other relevant authorities in monitoring group-wide security-based swap
exposures by enabling a registered SDR to provide them with the information necessary to
calculate positions in security-based swaps held within the same ownership group that are
reported to that registered SDR. If the Commission were to adopt definitions of “control” and
“affiliate” that were based on majority ownership, participants would be required to identify
fewer entities as affiliates, even if certain indicia of affiliation were present. The Commission
believes that, to carry out its oversight function for the security-based swap market, it should err
on the side of inclusion rather than exclusion when considering which positions are part of the
same ownership group for general oversight purposes.
The Commission also notes that the definition of “control” as adopted in Rule 900(h) is
consistent with the definition used in other Commission rules and forms, 763 so market
participants should be accustomed to applying this definition in the conduct of their business
activities. Furthermore, the CFTC’s swap data reporting rules employ a materially similar
definition of “control” for purposes of determining whether two market participants are affiliated
with each other. 764 If the Commission were to adopt a different definition of “control,” market
763

See, e.g., Rule 300(f) of Regulation ATS under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 242.300(f);
Rule 19g2-1(b)(2) under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.19g2-1(b)(2); Form 1
(Application for, and Amendments to Application for, Registration as a National
Securities Exchange or Exemption from Registration Pursuant to Section 5 of the
Exchange Act); Form BD (Uniform Application for Broker-Dealer Registration). See
also Rule 3a55-4(b)(2) under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.3a55-4(b)(2) (defining
control to mean ownership of 20% or more of an issuer’s equity, or the ability to direct
the voting of 20% or more of the issuer’s voting equity).

See 17 CFR 45.6(a) (defining “control” in the context of the CFTC’s LEI system); 17
CFR 45.6(e)(2).

participants would need to determine their affiliates under both sets of rules, thereby imposing
what the Commission believes would be unnecessary costs on market participants.
One commenter suggested that the Commission and the CFTC use a consistent definition
of “affiliate” throughout the Title VII rulemakings 765 and recommended that the Commission
and CFTC use the definition of “affiliated group” in the Commissions’ proposed joint
rulemaking to further define the terms swap dealer, security-based swap dealer, major swap
participant, major security-based swap participant, and eligible contract participant (“Entity
Definitions Proposing Release”). 766 The Commission does not believe it is appropriate to adopt,
for purposes of Regulation SBSR, the definition of “affiliated group” that was proposed in the
Entity Definitions Proposing Release. The final rules defining “swap dealer,” “security-based
swap dealer,” “major swap participant,” “major security-based swap participant,” and “eligible
contract participant” (“Final Entity Definition Rules”) did not adopt a definition of “affiliated
group.” 767 When the Commission and CFTC adopted the Final Entity Definition Rules they
specifically rejected the notion that an “affiliated group” should include only those entities that
report information or prepare financial statements on a consolidated basis as a prerequisite for
being affiliated because they did not believe that whether or not two entities are affiliated should

766

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 63452 (December 7, 2010), 75 FR 80174
(December 21, 2010). In the Entity Definitions Proposing Release, “affiliated group”
would have been used to describe the range of counterparties that a security-based swap
market participant would need to count for purposes of determining whether it qualified
for a de minimis exception from the definition of “security-based swap dealer.” For
purposes of the Entity Definitions Proposing Release, the Commissions stated that an
affiliated group would be defined as “any group of entities that is under common control
and that reports information or prepares its financial statements on a consolidated basis.”
See 75 FR at 80180, note 43.

change according to changes in accounting standards. 768 The Commission continues to believe
that changes in accounting standards should not determine whether two entities are affiliated and
therefore declines to adopt the definition of “affiliated group” that it proposed in the Entity
Definitions Proposing Release.
C.

Policies and Procedures of Registered Security-Based Swap Dealers and
Registered Major Security-Based Swap Participants to Support Reporting—
Rule 906(c)

For the security-based swap reporting requirements established by the Dodd-Frank Act to
achieve the objectives of enhancing price transparency and providing regulators with access to
data to help carry out their oversight responsibilities, the information that participants provide to
registered SDRs must be reliable. Ultimately, the majority of security-based swaps likely will be
reported by registered security-based swap dealers and registered major security-based swap
participants. The Commission believes that requiring these participants to adopt policies and
procedures to address their security-based swap reporting obligations will increase the accuracy
and reliability of the transaction reports that they submit to registered SDRs.
Proposed Rule 906(c) would have required a participant that is a security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant to establish, maintain, and enforce written
policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the participant complies with
any obligations to report information to a registered SDR in a manner consistent with Regulation
SBSR and the policies and procedures of any registered SDR of which it is a participant. The
policies and procedures contemplated by proposed Rule 906(c) were intended to promote
complete and accurate reporting of security-based swap information by participants that are
security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants, consistent with their
768

See id. at 30625.

317

obligations under the Dodd-Frank Act and Regulation SBSR. Proposed Rule 906(c) also would
have required a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant to review
and update its policies and procedures at least annually. The Commission re-proposed Rule
906(c) without change as part of the Cross-Border Proposing Release. 769 The one commenter
who addressed this aspect of Regulation SBSR stated that proposed Rule 906(c) is “a necessary
part of risk governance and compliance.” 770
The Commission agrees and is adopting Rule 906(c), largely as proposed and reproposed, subject to two modifications. 771 As proposed and re-proposed, Rule 906(c) would
have required security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants to
establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures to support security-based swap
transaction reporting. As discussed above, Rule 906(c), as adopted, imposes this duty only on
registered security-based swap dealers and registered major security-based swap participants. 772
Second, Rule 906(c), as adopted, does not include the phrase “and the policies and procedures of
any registered security-based swap data repository of which it is a participant.” The Commission
believes that it is sufficient to require that the policies and procedures of registered securitybased swap dealers and registered major security-based swap participants be reasonably designed

769

See 78 FR at 31214.

770

Barnard I at 3.

771

The Commission also revised Rule 906(c), to clarify that the term “participant” means a
participant of a registered SDR.

772

See supra Section V(B)(1) (explaining that, during the period before the Commission has
adopted rules for the registration of security-based swap dealers and major security-based
swap participants, the Commission seeks to avoid imposing costs on market participants
who otherwise would have to assess whether they are security-based swap dealers or
major security-based swap participants).

318

to ensure compliance with the reporting obligations under Regulation SBSR. 773 Additionally,
the Commission anticipates that SDRs will enter into contractual arrangements with reporting
sides for the reporting of transactions required to be reported under Regulation SBSR, and that
such arrangements likely will stipulate the various rights and obligations of the parties when
reporting security-based swap transactions.
Rule 906(c) is designed to promote greater accuracy and completeness of reported
security-based swap transaction data by requiring the participants that will bear substantial
reporting obligations under Regulation SBSR to adopt policies and procedures that are
reasonably designed to ensure that their reports are accurate and reliable. If these participants do
not have written policies and procedures for carrying out their reporting duties, compliance with
Regulation SBSR might depend too heavily on key individuals or ad hoc and unreliable
processes. The Commission, therefore, believes that registered security-based swap dealers and
registered major security-based swap participants should be required to establish written policies
and procedures which, because they are written and can be shared throughout the organization,
should be independent of any specific individuals. Requiring such participants to adopt and
maintain written policies and procedures relevant to their reporting responsibilities, as required
under Rule 906(c), should help to improve the degree and quality of overall compliance with the
reporting requirements of Regulation SBSR. Periodic review of the policies and procedures, as
required by Rule 906(c), should help ensure that these policies and procedures remain well
functioning over time.

773

The Commission notes that a reporting side is also required to electronically transmit
information required under Regulation SBSR to a registered SDR in a format required by
that SDR. See Rule 901(h); note 268, supra, and accompanying text.

319

The value of requiring policies and procedures in promoting regulatory compliance is
well-established. Internal control systems have long been used to strengthen the integrity of
financial reporting. For example, Congress recognized the importance of internal control
systems in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which requires public companies to maintain a
system of internal accounting controls. 774 Broker-dealers also must maintain policies and
procedures for various purposes. 775 The Commission believes that requiring each registered
security-based swap dealer and registered major security-based swap participant to adopt and
maintain written policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with Regulation SBSR
is consistent with Congress’s goals in adopting the Dodd-Frank Act.
The policies and procedures required by Rule 906(c) could address, among other things:
(1) The reporting process and designation of responsibility for reporting security-based swap
transactions; (2) the process for systematizing orally negotiated security-based swap transactions;
(3) order management system outages or malfunctions, and when and how back-up systems are
to be used in connection with required reporting; (4) verification and validation of all
information relating to security-based swap transactions reported to a registered SDR; (5) a
training program for employees responsible for security-based swap transaction reporting; (6)
control procedures relating to security-based swap transaction reporting and designation of
personnel responsible for testing and verifying such policies and procedures; and (7) reviewing
and assessing the performance and operational capability of any third party that carries out any
774

See 15 U.S.C. 78m(b)(2)(B).

775

See, e.g., FINRA Conduct Rule 3010(b) (requiring FINRA member broker-dealers to
establish and maintain written procedures “that are reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, and with the applicable Rules
of [the NASD]”); FINRA Conduct Rule 3012 (requiring FINRA member broker-dealers
to establish and maintain written supervisory procedures to ensure that internal policies
and procedures are followed and achieve their intended objectives).

duty required by Regulation SBSR on behalf of the registered security-based swap dealer or
registered major security-based swap participant. 776
XIV. Other Aspects of Policies and Procedures of Registered SDRs
A.

Public Availability of Policies and Procedures

Rule 907(c), as proposed and re-proposed, would have required a registered SDR to make
its policies and procedures publicly available on its website. The Commission did not receive
any comments on Rule 907(c) and is adopting it as proposed and re-proposed. This public
availability requirement will allow all interested parties to understand how the registered SDR is
utilizing the flexibility it has in operating the transaction reporting and dissemination system.
Being able to review the current policies and procedures will provide an opportunity for
participants to make suggestions to the registered SDR for altering and improving those policies
and procedures, in light of new products or circumstances, consistent with the principles set out
in Regulation SBSR.
B.

Updating of Policies and Procedures

Proposed Rule 907(d) would have required a registered SDR to “review, and update as
necessary, the policies and procedures required by [Regulation SBSR] at least annually.”
Proposed Rule 907(d) also would have required the registered SDR to indicate the date on which
its policies and procedures were last reviewed. The Cross-Border Proposing Release reproposed Rule 907(d) without revision.
The Commission did not receive any comments on Rule 907(d) and is adopting it as
proposed and re-proposed. The Commission continues to believe that a registered SDR should

776

See 75 FR at 75234.

321

periodically review its policies and procedures to ensure that they remain well-functioning over
time. The Commission also continues to believe that requiring registered SDRs to indicate the
date on which their policies and procedures were last reviewed will allow regulators and SDR
participants to understand which version of the policies and procedures are current. A registered
SDR could satisfy this obligation by, for example, noting when individual sections were last
updated or by reissuing the entirety of the policies and procedures with an “as of” date. The
Commission notes that, regardless of the method chosen and although only the most current
version of a registered SDR’s policies and procedures must be publicly available pursuant to
Rule 907, the registered SDR must retain prior versions of those policies and procedures for
regulatory purposes pursuant to Rule 13n-7(b) under the Exchange Act, 777 as adopted by the
Commission. 778 These records would help the Commission, if conducting a review of a
registered SDR’s past actions, to understand what policies and procedures were in force at the
time.
C.

Provision of Certain Reports to the Commission

Under Title VII, the Commission is responsible for regulating and overseeing the
security-based swap market, including the trade reporting obligations imposed by Regulation
SBSR. 779 The Commission believes that, to carry out this responsibility, it will be necessary to

777

17 CFR 240.13n-7(b)(1) (“Every security-based swap data repository shall keep and
preserve at least one copy of all documents, including all documents and policies and
procedures required by the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder”).

778

See SDR Adopting Release.

779

Under Title VII, registered SDRs are not self-regulatory organizations and thus lack the
enforcement authority that self-regulatory organizations have over their members under
the Exchange Act. Any information or reports requested by the Commission under Rule
907(e) would assist the Commission in examining for and enforcing compliance with
Regulation SBSR by reporting parties.

322

obtain from each registered SDR information related to the timeliness, accuracy, and
completeness of data reported to the registered SDR by the SDR’s participants. Required data
submissions that are untimely, 780 inaccurate, 781 or incomplete 782 could compromise the
regulatory data that the Commission would utilize to carry out its oversight responsibilities.
Furthermore, required data submissions that are untimely, inaccurate, or incomplete could
diminish the value of publicly disseminated reports that are meant to promote transparency and
price discovery.
Accordingly, the Commission proposed and re-proposed Rule 907(e), which would have
required a registered SDR to “have the capacity to provide to the Commission, upon request,
information or reports related to the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of data reported to
it” pursuant to Regulation SBSR and the registered SDR’s policies and procedures. The sole
commenter on this provision agreed that an SDR should be able to “readily provide the
Commission with any relevant information,” but noted that an SDR might not be in the best
position to confirm the accuracy of the trade information it receives. 783 The commenter believed
that ultimate responsibility for the submission of accurate and complete information belongs with

780

For example, a registered SDR would be able to determine that a reporting side had
reported late if the date and time of submission were more than 24 hours after the date
and time of execution reported by the reporting side (or, if 24 hours after the time of
execution would have fallen on a day that was not a business day, then after that same
time on the next business day). See Rule 901(j).

781

Some examples of clearly inaccurate data would include using lettered text in a field that
clearly requires a number (or vice versa), or using a UIC that corresponds to no valid LEI
or to a UIC issued or endorsed by the registered SDR.

782

An example of an incomplete report would be leaving one or more required reporting
fields blank.

783

323

the reporting side, and that Rule 907(e) should be revised to reflect that an SDR’s information
will “only be as timely, accurate, and complete as provided to it by parties to the trade.” 784
The Commission is adopting Rule 907(e) with a minor revision. The final rule provides
that a registered SDR “shall provide, upon request, information or reports . . .” rather than, as
proposed and re-proposed, that a registered SDR “shall have the capacity to provide . . .” This
language better conveys the Commission’s expectation that, not only must a registered SDR have
the capacity to provide the relevant information or reports, it must in fact provide such
information or reports when the Commission requests. The Commission believes that this
revision accords with the commenter who stated that an SDR should be able to “readily provide
the Commission with any relevant information.” 785
However, the Commission is not revising Rule 907(e) to reflect that an SDR’s
information will “only be as timely, accurate, and complete as provided to it by parties to the
trade,” as requested by the commenter. 786 The Commission appreciates that there could be
certain data elements submitted by reporting sides that a registered SDR could not reasonably be
expected to know are inaccurate. For example, if the reporting side submits a valid trader ID for
trader X when in fact the transaction was carried out by trader Y, the Commission would not
expect a Rule 907(e) report provided by a registered SDR to reflect this fact. The Commission
notes, however, that Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(iii) under the Exchange Act requires an SDR to “establish,
maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to satisfy itself that
the transaction data that has been submitted to the security-based swap data repository is

784

785

See note 783, supra.

786

324

complete and accurate.” Thus, the Commission could require a registered SDR to include in a
Rule 907(e) report any instances where a reporting side reported a trader ID that fails the SDR’s
validation rules, because the SDR is in a position to know which trader IDs (and other UICs) are
consistent with UICs assigned to traders of its participants. 787
XV.

Rule 908—Cross-Border Reach of Regulation SBSR
Security-based swap business currently takes place across national borders, with

agreements negotiated and executed between counterparties in different jurisdictions (which
might then be booked and risk-managed in still other jurisdictions). 788 Given the global nature of
the market and to help ensure an effective regime for regulatory reporting and public
dissemination of security-based swap transactions under Title VII, it is important that Regulation
SBSR identify which transactions in this global market will be subject to these Title VII
requirements. Regulation SBSR, as initially proposed in November 2010, included Rule 908,
which sought to address the cross-border application of the regulatory reporting and public
dissemination requirements. In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, issued in May 2013, the
Commission re-proposed Rule 908 with substantial revisions. Commenters’ views on reproposed Rule 908 and the final rule, as adopted by the Commission, are discussed in detail
787

See also Section 13(n)(5)(B) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(B) (requiring an
SDR to “confirm with both counterparties to the security-based swap the accuracy of the
data that was submitted”); Rule 13n-4(b)(3) under the Exchange Act (implementing that
requirement).

788

Security-based swap market data indicates that many security-based swap transactions
involve activity in more than one jurisdiction. See infra Section XXII(B)(1)(b) (noting
that data in the Trade Information Warehouse reveals that approximately 13% of priceforming transactions in North American single-name CDS transaction from January 2008
to December 2013 were between two U.S.-domiciled counterparties; 48% of such
transactions were cross-border transactions between a U.S.-domiciled counterparty and a
foreign-domiciled counterparty; and an additional 39% were between two foreigndomiciled counterparties).

325

below, following a discussion of the Commission’s approach to cross-border application of its
authority under Title VII and the Exchange Act generally.
A.

General Considerations

As stated in the Cross-Border Adopting Release, the Commission continues to believe
that a territorial approach to the application of Title VII—including the requirements relating to
regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swap transactions—is
appropriate. 789 This approach, properly understood, is grounded in the text of the relevant
statutory provisions and is designed to help ensure that the Commission’s application of the
relevant provisions is consistent with the goals that the statute was intended to achieve. 790 Once
the Commission has identified the activity regulated by the statutory provision, it then
determines whether a person is engaged in conduct that the statutory provision regulates and
whether this conduct occurs within the United States. 791
Under the foregoing analysis, when a U.S. person enters into a security-based swap, the
security-based swap necessarily exists at least in part within the United States. The definition of
“U.S. person”—adopted in the Cross-Border Adopting Release and incorporated by reference
into Regulation SBSR—is intended, in part, to identify those persons for whom it is reasonable
to infer that a significant portion of their financial and legal relationships is likely to exist within
789

See 79 FR at 47287.

790

See Morrison v. Nat’l Australia Bank, Ltd., 130 S. Ct. 2869, 2884 (2010) (identifying
focus of statutory language to determine what conduct was relevant in determining
whether the statute was being applied to domestic conduct).

791

When the statutory text does not describe the relevant activity with specificity or provides
for further Commission interpretation of statutory terms or requirements, this analysis
may require the Commission to identify through interpretation of the statutory text the
specific activity that is relevant under the statute or to incorporate prior interpretations of
the relevant statutory text. See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47287
(explaining the Commission’s approach to interpreting Title VII requirements).

326

the United States, and that it is therefore reasonable to conclude that risk arising from their
security-based swap activities could manifest itself within the United States, regardless of the
location of their counterparties, given the ongoing nature of the obligations that result from
security-based swap transactions. 792 Under its territorial approach, the Commission seeks to
apply Title VII’s regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements in a consistent
manner to differing organizational structures that serve similar economic purposes, and thereby
avoid creating different regulatory outcomes for differing legal arrangements that raise similar
policy considerations and pose similar economic risks to the United States. 793 Therefore, as
discussed in the Cross-Border Adopting Release, this territorial application of Title VII
requirements extends to the activities of U.S. person conducted through a foreign branch or
office 794 and to the activities of a non-U.S. person for which the U.S. person provides a recourse
guarantee. 795
The Commission further notes that Section 15F(f)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act 796 provides
that each registered security-based swap dealer and major security-based swap participant “shall
make such reports as are required by the Commission, by rule or regulation, regarding the

792

See 79 FR at 47288-89. As discussed below, the Commission is adopting a definition of
“U.S. person” in Regulation SBSR that cross-references the definition adopted as part of
the Cross-Border Adopting Release.

793

See id. at 47344.

794

See id. at 47289.

796

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(f)(1)(A).

327

transactions and positions and financial condition of the registered security-based swap dealer or
major security-based swap participant.” 797
Finally, the Commission seeks to minimize the potential for duplicative or conflicting
regulations. The Commission recognizes the potential for market participants who engage in
cross-border security-based swap activity to be subject to regulation under Regulation SBSR and
parallel rules in foreign jurisdictions in which they operate. To address this possibility, the
Commission—as described in detail below—is adopting a “substituted compliance” framework.
The Commission may issue a substituted compliance determination if it finds that the
corresponding requirements of the foreign regulatory system are comparable to the relevant
provisions of Regulation SBSR, and are accompanied by an effective supervisory and
enforcement program administered by the relevant foreign authorities. 798 The availability of
substituted compliance is designed to reduce the likelihood of cross-border market participants
being subject to potentially conflicting or duplicative reporting requirements.
B.

Definition of “U.S. Person”

797

In addition, Section 30(c) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78dd(c), authorizes the
Commission to apply Title VII to persons transacting a business “without the jurisdiction
of the United States” if they contravene rules that the Commission has prescribed as
“necessary or appropriate to prevent the evasion of any provision” of Title VII. As the
Commission stated in the Cross-Border Adopting Release, Section 30(c) does not require
a finding that actual evasion has occurred or is occurring to invoke the Commission’s
authority to reach activity “without the jurisdiction of the United States” or to limit
application of Title VII to security-based swap activity “without the jurisdiction of the
United States” only to business that is transacted in a way that is purposefully intended to
evade Title VII. See 79 FR at 47291. The focus of this provision is not whether such
rules impose Title VII requirements only on entities engaged in activity that is
consciously evasive, but whether the rules are generally “necessary or appropriate” to
prevent potential evasion of Title VII. The Commission therefore disagrees with the
commenter who stated that the Commission “should not adopt an extraterritorial
regulatory framework premised on the assumption that activities conducted outside the
U.S. will be undertaken abroad for the purpose of evasion.” Cleary III at 5.

798

See Rule 908(c). See also infra Section XV(E).

328

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission proposed to define “U.S.
person” as “a natural person that is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident or a legal person that is
organized under the corporate laws of any part of the United States or has its principal place of
business in the United States.” 799 In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission
introduced a new definition of “U.S. person” that it proposed to use in all Title VII rulemakings
to promote consistency and transparency, which differed from the initially proposed definition in
certain respects. Re-proposed Rule 900(pp) would have defined “U.S. person” by crossreferencing proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(7), which would have defined “U.S. person” as:
(i) any natural person resident in the United States;
(ii) any partnership, corporation, trust, or other legal person organized or incorporated
under the laws of the United States or having its principal place of business in the United States;
and
(iii) any account (whether discretionary or non-discretionary) of a U.S. person. 800
The Commission received extensive comment on this proposed definition of “U.S.
person” and responded to those comments in the Cross-Border Adopting Release. 801
The Commission adopted a definition of “U.S. person” in the Cross-Border Adopting
Release as Rule 3a71-3(a)(4) under the Exchange Act, which reflects a territorial approach to the
application of Title VII. 802 The Commission believes that using the same definition of “U.S.
person” in multiple Title VII rules could benefit market participants by eliminating complexity
799

Rule 900 as initially proposed. See also Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at
75284.

800

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31207.

801

See 79 FR at 47303-13. These comments focused on the proposed definition generally
and did not address the application of the definition to Regulation SBSR.

802

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47308, note 255.

329

that might result from the use of different definitions for different Title VII rules. Accordingly,
final Rule 900(ss) of Regulation SBSR defines “U.S. person” to have the same meaning as in
Rule 3a71-3(a)(4). Rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i) defines “U.S. person” as: (1) a natural person resident
in the United States; 803 (2) a partnership, corporation, trust, investment vehicle, or other legal
person organized, incorporated, or established under the laws of the United States or having its
principal place of business 804 in the United States; (3) an account (whether discretionary or nondiscretionary) of a U.S. person; or (4) any estate of a decedent who was a resident of the United
States at the time of death. As discussed in the Cross-Border Adopting Release, the Commission
believes that a definition of “U.S. person” that focused solely on whether a legal person is
organized, incorporated, or established in the United States could encourage some entities to
move their place of incorporation to a non-U.S. jurisdiction to avoid complying with Title VII,
while maintaining their principal place of business in the United States. 805

Rule 3a71-3(a)(5) under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.3a71-3(a)(4), defines “United
States” as the United States of America, its territories and possessions, any State of the
United States, and the District of Columbia.

804

Rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(ii) under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.3a71-3(a)(4)(ii), defines
“principal place of business” as the location from which the officers, partners, or
managers of the legal person primarily direct, control, and coordinate the activities of the
legal person. With respect to an externally managed investment vehicle, this location is
the office from which the manager of the vehicle primarily directs, controls, and
coordinates the investment activities of the vehicle. See also Cross-Border Adopting
Release, 79 FR at 47308 (discussing the Commission’s rationale for adopting the
“principal place of business” test).

805

See id., 79 FR at 47309, note 262 (“The final definition of ‘principal place of business’
will help ensure that entities do not restructure their business by incorporating under
foreign law while continuing to direct, control, and coordinate the operations of the entity
from within the United States, which would enable them to maintain a significant portion
of their financial and legal relationships within the United States while avoiding
application of Title VII requirements to such transactions”).

330

By incorporating Rule 3a71-3(a)(4) by reference, Regulation SBSR also incorporates
subparagraph (iv) of Rule 3a71-3(a)(4), which allows a person to rely on a counterparty’s
representation that the counterparty is not a U.S. person, unless such person knows or has reason
to know that the representation is inaccurate. As explained in the Cross-Border Adopting
Release, 806 Rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(iv) reflects a constructive knowledge standard for reliance. Under
this standard, a counterparty is permitted to rely on a representation, unless such person knows or
has reason to know that it is inaccurate. A person would have reason to know the representation
is not accurate if a reasonable person should know, under all of the facts of which the person is
aware, that it is not accurate. 807 Expressly permitting market participants to rely on such
representations in the “U.S. person” definition should help facilitate the determination of which
side to a security-based swap is the reporting side and mitigate challenges that could arise in
determining a counterparty’s U.S.-person status under the final rule. 808 It permits the party best
positioned to make this determination to perform an analysis of its own U.S.-person status and
convey, in the form of a representation, the results of that analysis to its counterparty. Such

806

See id. at 47313.

807

To the extent that a person has knowledge of facts that could lead a reasonable person to
believe that a counterparty may not be a U.S. person under the definition, it might need to
conduct additional diligence before relying on the representation. See id. at 47313, note
302.

808

As discussed below, under Rule 908(a), the U.S.-person status of the counterparties to a
security-based swap is one factor in determining whether the security-based swap is
subject to Regulation SBSR. If a security-based swap is subject to Regulation SBSR, the
U.S.-person status of the counterparties may influence the determination of the reporting
side under Rule 901(a)(2)(ii). See supra Section V(B).

331

representations should help reduce the potential for inconsistent classification and treatment of a
person by its counterparties and promote uniform application of Title VII. 809
Rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(iii)—and thus Regulation SBSR—provides that the term “U.S. person”
does not include the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the African
Development Bank, the United Nations; their agencies and pension plans; and any other similar
international organizations and their agencies and pension plans. Therefore, a security-based
swap involving any such institution, for that fact alone, will not be subject to regulatory reporting
or public dissemination under Regulation SBSR. 810 However, as discussed in Section XVI(A),
infra, a security-based swap transaction involving such an institution could be subject to
regulatory reporting and/or public dissemination, depending on the domicile and registration
status of the other side of the transaction.
Finally, similar to the approach taken by the Commission in the Cross-Border Adopting
Release for purposes of the de minimis calculation, 811 a change in a counterparty’s U.S.-person
status after a security-based swap is executed would not affect the original transaction’s
treatment under Regulation SBSR. However, if that person were to enter into another securitybased swap following its change in status, any duties required by Regulation SBSR would be
determined according to the new status of that person at the time of the second security-based
809

The final rule permitting reliance on representations with respect to a counterparty’s
U.S.-person status applies only to the definition of “U.S. person” as used in Regulation
SBSR and does not apply to any determination of a person’s U.S.-person status under any
other provision of the federal securities laws, including Commission rules, regulations,
interpretations, or guidance.

C.

Scope of Security-Based Swap Transactions Covered by Requirements of
Regulation SBSR—Rule 908(a)
1.

Transactions Involving a Direct Counterparty That Is a U.S. Person

Under both the proposal and re-proposal, any security-based swap that had a direct
counterparty that is a U.S. person would have been subject to both regulatory reporting and
public dissemination, regardless of the registration status or domicile of any counterparty on the
other side of the transaction. Commenters generally did not object to this aspect of the proposal
and the re-proposal. 812
Final Rule 908(a)(1)(i) provides, in relevant part, that a security-based swap shall be
subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination if “[t]here is a direct . . . counterparty
that is a U.S. person on either or both sides of the transaction.” Thus, any security-based swap
that has a direct counterparty that is a U.S. person is subject to both regulatory reporting and
public dissemination, regardless of the registration status or domicile of any counterparty on the
other side of the transaction. This determination is consistent with the territorial application of
Title VII described above, because any security-based swap that has a U.S.-person direct
counterparty exists at least in part within the United States. One purpose of the rule is to allow
the Commission and other relevant authorities to access, for regulatory and supervisory purposes,
a record of each such transaction. A second purpose of the rule is to carry out the Title VII
812

Some commenters supported a cross-border jurisdictional regime that would apply
security-based swap regulation on the basis of whether a direct counterparty to a securitybased swap is a U.S. person. See, e.g., JFMC Letter at 5; JSDA Letter at 3-4; AFR Letter
at 4, 13-14. These commenters did not, however, raise this suggestion specifically in the
context of Regulation SBSR. See also IIB Letter at 11 (observing that a status-based test
for jurisdictional application would be more appropriate than a territorial approach based
on the location of conduct). The Cross-Border Adopting Release addressed these
comments. See 79 FR at 47302-06.

333

mandate for public dissemination of security-based swap transactions. The transparency benefits
of requiring public dissemination of security-based swaps involving at least one U.S.-person
direct counterparty would inure to other U.S. persons and the U.S. market generally, as other
participants in the U.S. market are likely to transact in the same or related instruments.
2.

Transactions Conducted Through a Foreign Branch or Office

Rule 908(a), as initially proposed, treated foreign branches and offices of U.S. persons as
integral parts of the U.S. person itself. 813 Therefore, Rule 908(a), as initially proposed, would
not have treated a security-based swap transaction executed by or through a foreign branch or
office of a U.S. person any differently than any other transaction executed by the U.S. person.
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission revised its approach to
transactions conducted through a foreign branch. Although all transactions conducted through a
foreign branch or office would have been subject to regulatory reporting, re-proposed Rule
908(a)(2)(iii) would have provided an exception to public dissemination for transactions
conducted through a foreign branch when the other side is a non-U.S. person who is not a
security-based swap dealer. 814 In proposing this exception to public dissemination for such
transactions conducted through a foreign branch, the Commission stated that it was “concerned
that, if it did not take this approach, non-U.S. market participants might avoid entering into
813

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75240 (“Because a branch or office
has no separate legal existence under corporate law, the branch or office would be an
integral part of the U.S. person itself”).

814

In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the term “transaction conducted through a
foreign branch” was defined in re-proposed Rule 900(hh) to cross-reference the definition
of that term in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(4) under the Exchange Act, and the term
“foreign branch” was defined in re-proposed Rule 900(n) to cross-reference the definition
of foreign branch in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(1). In the Cross-Border Adopting Release,
the Commission adopted the term “foreign branch” as proposed and adopted the term
“transaction conducted through a foreign branch” with certain modifications. See 79 FR
at 47322.

334

security-based swaps with the foreign branches of U.S. banks so as to avoid their security-based
swaps being publicly disseminated.” 815 However, Rule 908(a)(2) would have subjected a
transaction conducted through a foreign branch to public dissemination if there was, on the other
side, a U.S. person (including a foreign branch) 816 or a security-based swap dealer. 817
One commenter expressed the view that foreign branches should be treated the same as
non-U.S.-person security-based swap dealers for purposes of public dissemination, and that
security-based swaps between two non-U.S. persons, between a non-U.S. person and a foreign
branch, and between two foreign branches should not be subject to public dissemination. 818
Another commenter, however, stated that “it should be expected that most jurisdictions would
seek to apply their rules to transactions between two of their own domiciled persons, despite
some of the activity being conducted abroad.” 819 A third commenter recommended that the
exception to public dissemination for foreign branches be eliminated, so that security-based
swaps between a foreign branch and any non-U.S. person would be subject to public
dissemination. 820
As noted above, the Commission is adopting the requirement that any security-based
swap transaction having a direct counterparty that is a U.S. person, including a security-based
swap conducted through a foreign branch, shall be subject to regulatory reporting. The

Infrastructure Regulation] would apply to transactions between the U.S. branches of two
entities established in the EU,” id., and thus appeared to suggest that U.S. regulation
should apply to transactions between two foreign branches of U.S. persons.

820

See Better Markets IV at 23.

335

Commission has determined not to adopt the proposed exception from public dissemination for
certain transactions conducted through a foreign branch. Thus, under Rule 908(a)(1)(i), as
adopted, any security-based swap transaction conducted through a foreign branch is subject to
both regulatory reporting and public dissemination. Under the territorial approach to the
application of Title VII requirements discussed above, a foreign branch has no separate existence
from the U.S. person itself. Therefore, any security-based swap transaction conducted through a
foreign branch is a security-based swap executed by the U.S. person itself, and any securitybased swap executed by a U.S. person exists at least in part within the United States. 821 The
Title VII requirements for regulatory reporting and public dissemination apply to all securitybased swap transactions that exist in whole or in part within the United States, unless an
exception applies.
Upon further consideration, the Commission believes that the exception from public
dissemination for foreign branches in Rule 908(a), as re-proposed, is not warranted. Granting an
exception to public dissemination for certain transactions conducted through a foreign branch
could have created incentives for some U.S. persons to utilize foreign branches to evade Title
VII’s public dissemination requirements. 822 This could be the case particularly in a foreign

821

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47289 (describing the application of the
security-based swap dealer de minimis threshold with respect to foreign branches or
offices of U.S. persons). The Commission notes that a transaction conducted by a U.S.
person through any other office that does not have a separate legal identity from the U.S.
person, even if such office does not meet the definition of “foreign branch” in Rule 3a713(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, also is a transaction conducted by the U.S. person directly,
and thus is subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination under Rule
908(a)(1)(i), as adopted.

822

Under Rule 908(a)(2)(iii), as re-proposed, public dissemination would have applied to a
security-based swap between a U.S. person direct counterparty and a non-U.S. person
(other than a security-based swap dealer) unless the U.S. person conducted the
transaction through a foreign branch. Thus, the U.S. person could have directed a non336

jurisdiction that does not apply rules for public dissemination to all or some transactions
conducted through foreign branches operating within that jurisdiction. Thus, the Commission
disagrees with the commenter who expressed the view that foreign branches should be treated
the same as non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers for purposes of public dissemination, 823
and that security-based swaps between two non-U.S. persons, between a non-U.S. person and a
foreign branch, and between two foreign branches should not be subject to public
dissemination. 824
3.

Transactions Guaranteed by a U.S. Person

Regulation SBSR, as initially proposed, did not impose reporting requirements based on
whether a U.S. person acts as a guarantor of a security-based swap. As re-proposed, however,
Rule 908(a)(1)(ii) would have required regulatory reporting of any security-based swap that had
a U.S.-person guarantor, even when no direct counterparty was a U.S. person. 825 In addition,
Rule 908(a)(2), as re-proposed, would have required public dissemination of some, but not all,
transactions having a U.S.-person indirect counterparty. Re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2)(ii) would
have provided, in relevant part, that a security-based swap is subject to public dissemination if

U.S.-person counterparty to interact only with its foreign branch staff, which would have
made the transaction eligible for the exception provided by re-proposed Rule
908(a)(2)(iii).
823

As discussed in Section XV(C)(6), infra, if a transaction involving a registered securitybased swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant does not fall within
Rule 908(a)(1), Rule 908(a)(2), as adopted, subjects that transaction to regulatory
reporting but not public dissemination.

824

See SIFMA/FIA/Roundtable Letter at A-43.

825

Also in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission proposed new terms “direct
counterparty” and “indirect counterparty” to distinguish the primary obligor on the
security-based swap from the person who guarantees the primary obligor’s performance,
respectively. The Commission also proposed the term “side” to refer to the direct
counterparty and any guarantor of the direct counterparty. See 78 FR at 31211.

337

there is an indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on each side of the transaction. 826 Reproposed Rule 908(a)(2)(iv) would have provided, in relevant part, that a transaction where one
side includes a U.S.-person (including an indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person) and the
other side includes a non-U.S. person that is a security-based swap dealer would be subject to
public dissemination. However, a transaction would have been excepted from public
dissemination if one side consisted of a non-U.S.-person direct counterparty and a U.S.-person
guarantor, where neither is a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap
participant, and the other side includes no counterparty that is a U.S. person, security-based swap
dealer, or major security-based swap participant (a “covered cross-border transaction”). 827
Commenters generally did not object to the Commission’s proposal to subject
transactions between direct counterparties who are U.S. persons to regulatory reporting or public
dissemination. However, commenters expressed mixed views about extending regulatory
reporting and public dissemination requirements to transactions involving U.S.-person
guarantors. 828 One of these commenters stated that a guarantee of a security-based swap
transaction by a U.S. person should not affect whether the transaction is subject to regulatory
reporting or public dissemination, because there is too tenuous a nexus to justify applying
Regulation SBSR on the basis of the guarantee alone. 829 Another commenter recommended that
a security-based swap between two non-U.S. persons be subject to Commission regulation only
826

The Commission noted in the Cross-Border Proposing Release that, where U.S. persons
have an interest on both sides of a transaction, even if indirectly, the transaction generally
should be subject to Title VII’s public dissemination requirement. See 78 FR at 31062.

827

As used in this release, a “covered cross-border transaction” refers to a transaction that
meets the description above and will not be submitted to clearing at a registered clearing
agency having its principal place of business in the United States.

828

See SIFMA/FIA/Roundtable Letter at A-41; ESMA Letter at 3; AFR Letter at 4, 13-14.

338

where the transaction is “guaranteed by a U.S. person for a significant value.” 830 A third
commenter, however, recommended that the Commission apply Title VII rules to transactions in
which the risk flows back to a U.S. entity, including transactions involving guaranteed foreign
subsidiaries and branches of U.S. entities. 831
The Commission is adopting, as re-proposed, in Rule 908(a)(1)(ii) the requirement that
any transaction involving a U.S.-person guarantor is subject to regulatory reporting. The
Commission has determined to continue to consider whether to carve out covered cross-border
transactions from public dissemination. Thus, Rule 908(a)(1)(i), as adopted, requires public
dissemination of all security-based swap transactions having a U.S.-person guarantor. 832 This
approach is consistent with the territorial approach to applying Title VII requirements, described
above. A security-based swap with a U.S.-person indirect counterparty is economically
equivalent to a security-based swap with a U.S.-person direct counterparty, and both kinds of
security-based swaps exist, at least in part, within the United States. As the Commission
830

ESMA Letter at 3.

831

See AFR Letter at 4, 13-14 (noting that the geographic location of the entities ultimately
responsible for security-based swap liabilities should determine the application of the
Commission’s rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act). Another commenter stated that
the proposed definition of “indirect counterparty” in Regulation SBSR implies that an
indirect counterparty can cause a trade to be subject to reporting even in cases where the
direct counterparties to the trade would not lead to the conclusion that the trade is
reportable. The commenter recommended that the Commission amend the definition of
“indirect counterparty” to make it clear that its scope is limited to U.S.-person guarantors
and not all guarantors, to be consistent with the intent demonstrated by the Commission
in the preamble where reference is made to U.S.-person guarantors. See ISDA IV at 4.
Although the Commission has not amended the definition of “indirect counterparty” in
this manner, such an amendment is not necessary because Rule 908(a)(i), as adopted,
effectively reaches the same result. Rule 908(a)(i) provides that a security-based swap
will be subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination if there is a direct or
indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on either or both sides of the transaction.

832

As discussed below, compliance with Rule 908(a)(1)(i) is not required until the
Commission establishes a compliance date for this provision.

339

observed in the Cross-Border Adopting Release, the presence of a U.S. guarantor facilitates the
activity of the non-U.S. person who is guaranteed and, as a result, the security-based swap
activity of the non-U.S. person cannot reasonably be isolated from the U.S. person’s activity in
providing the guarantee. 833 The financial resources of the U.S.-person guarantor could be called
upon to satisfy the contract if the non-U.S. person fails to meet its obligations. Thus, the
extension of a guarantee is economically equivalent to a transaction entered into directly by the
U.S.-person guarantor. Accordingly, Rule 908(a)(1)(i), as adopted, provides that a securitybased swap shall be subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination if “[t]here is a direct
or indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on either or both sides of the transaction” (emphasis
added).The Commission disagrees with the commenter who stated that a guarantee of a securitybased swap transaction by a U.S. person should not affect whether the transaction is subject to
regulatory reporting or public dissemination, because there is too tenuous a nexus to justify
applying Regulation SBSR on the basis of the guarantee alone. 834 Under the territorial approach
described above, any security-based swap guaranteed by a U.S. person exists at least in part
within the United States, which triggers the application of Title VII requirements. The
Commission believes that this is true regardless of whether a particular guarantee is “for a
significant value.” 835 Furthermore, if the Commission does not require regulatory reporting of
security-based swaps that are guaranteed by U.S. persons—in addition to security-based swaps
having a U.S.-person direct counterparty—the Commission and other relevant authorities could
be less likely to detect potential market abuse or the build-up of potentially significant risks

within individual firms or groups or more widespread systemic risks to the U.S. financial system.
The Commission anticipates seeking additional comment on whether or not to except
covered cross-border transactions from public dissemination in the future. Furthermore, as
discussed in the proposed compliance schedule for Rules 901, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, and 908
of Regulation SBSR set forth in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, the
Commission is proposing to defer the compliance date for Rule 908(a)(1)(i) with respect to the
public dissemination of covered cross-border transactions until such time as the Commission has
received and considered comment on such an exception. Thus, although covered cross-border
transactions are subject to public dissemination under Rule 908(a)(1)(i), as adopted, there would
be no public dissemination of any such transaction until the Commission considers whether these
transactions should be excepted from public dissemination.
4.

Transactions Accepted for Clearing by a U.S. Clearing Agency

Re-proposed Rules 908(a)(1)(iv) and 908(a)(2)(v) would have required regulatory
reporting and public dissemination, respectively, of security-based swaps that are “cleared
through a clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United States.” One
commenter agreed that “Dodd-Frank’s reporting requirements should apply to any transaction
that . . . was cleared through a registered clearing organization having its principal place of
business in the U.S.” 836 Two other commenters objected. 837 One of these commenters observed
that Regulation SBSR could require regulatory reporting and public dissemination of transaction
information before the transaction is submitted for clearing; as a result, circumstances could arise
where the sides would not know whether a particular security-based swap is subject to regulatory
836

837

341

reporting and public dissemination until after reporting deadlines have passed. 838 The other
commenter argued that the proposed requirement might discourage market participants from
clearing transactions in the United States, which would be contrary to the objective of reducing
systemic risk. 839 Another commenter argued that a transaction between two non-U.S. persons
that is cleared through a clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United
States should not be subject to public dissemination, “although the clearing agency can provide
information for regulatory purposes.” 840
The Commission is adopting Rule 908(a)(1)(ii) with two modifications. The rule, as
adopted, provides that a security-based swap shall be subject to regulatory reporting and public
dissemination if “[t]he security-based swap is accepted for clearing by a clearing agency having
its principal place of business in the United States.” Rule 908(a)(1)(ii), as adopted, is consistent
with the territorial approach discussed above. Just as a security-based swap to which a U.S.
person is a direct or indirect counterparty exists, at least in part, within the United States, a
security-based swap that is accepted for clearing by a clearing agency having its principal place
of business in the United States also exists, at least in part, within the United States. Such
acceptance creates ongoing obligations that are borne by a U.S. person and thus are properly
viewed as existing within the United States. 841

See CME II at 5.

839

See SIFMA/FIA/Roundtable Letter at A-42.

840

ISDA/SIFMA I at 19. The Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release addresses
the issue of whether registered clearing agencies should be required to report securitybased swap transaction information to a registered SDR.

841

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47302-03, note 186 (explaining that
security-based swap activity that “results in a transaction involving a U.S. counterparty
creates ongoing obligations that are borne by a U.S. person, and thus is properly viewed
as occurring within the United States”).

342

The Commission acknowledges the concerns of the commenter who observed that
Regulation SBSR, as re-proposed, could have required regulatory reporting and public
dissemination of transaction information before the transaction is submitted for clearing. 842
Currently, clearing in the security-based swap market is voluntary. Therefore, counterparties—if
they decide to clear a transaction at all—might not submit the transaction to a clearing agency
until some time after it is executed. The final rule reflects the Commission’s view that, if a
security-based swap is subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination solely because of
Rule 908(a)(1)(ii), 843 the duty to report the trade is not triggered by the execution of the securitybased swap but rather by the registered clearing agency’s acceptance of the transaction for
clearing. 844 The Commission believes that it would not be appropriate to link the reporting
requirement to the time of execution, because the registered clearing agency’s acceptance of the
transaction for clearing might not take place until several days after the time of execution.
The Commission disagrees with the commenter who argued that a transaction between
two non-U.S. persons that is cleared through a clearing agency having its principal place of
business in the United States should not be subject to public dissemination, “although the
clearing agency can provide information for regulatory purposes.” 845 The Commission believes

842

See CME II at 5.

843

A transaction also could be subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination
because it meets the first prong of Rule 908(a)(1): it could have a U.S. person on either
or both sides of the transaction. Such a transaction must be reported within 24 hours after
the time of execution, regardless of whether the transaction is accepted for clearing. See
Rule 901(j).

844

See supra Sections II(A)(2)(a) and II(B)(2) (explaining that Rule 901(j) provides that the
reporting timeframes applicable to Rules 901(c) and 901(d) are triggered by acceptance
for clearing, not the time of execution, if a security-based swap is subject to regulatory
reporting and public dissemination solely by operation of Rule 908(a)(1)(ii)).

845

343

that such transactions—subject to the modifications to the rule text noted above—should be
subject to both regulatory reporting and public dissemination and therefore is not adopting the
this commenter’s recommendation. For the reasons described above, the Commission believes
that such transactions exist at least in part within the United States; therefore, Title VII’s
requirements for both regulatory reporting and public dissemination properly apply to such
transactions. This approach will permit the Commission and other relevant authorities the ability
to observe in a registered SDR all of the alpha transactions that have been accepted by a
registered clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United States and to carry
out oversight of security-based swaps that exist at least in part within the United States.
Furthermore, the Commission believes that public dissemination of such transactions will have
value to participants in the U.S. security-based swap market, who are likely to trade the same or
similar products, as these products have been made eligible for clearing by a registered clearing
agency having its principal place of business in the United States. 846
Furthermore, the Commission disagrees with the commenter who argued that requiring
regulatory reporting and public dissemination of transactions cleared through a U.S. clearing
agency is likely to discourage market participants from clearing transactions in the United
846

Another commenter argued that, if the Commission applied Regulation SBSR to securitybased swaps involving non-U.S. counterparties that nevertheless are cleared through a
clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United States, the
Commission could require reporting of such transactions to a registered SDR “without
exercising further jurisdiction over” the transaction. Société Générale Letter at 12. The
commenter believed that “[t]his solution would provide the Commission and U.S. market
participants with information about swaps cleared in the United States without conflicting
with foreign regulatory schemes.” Id. The Commission’s decision to require such
transactions to be reported and publicly disseminated pursuant to Regulation SBSR does
not necessarily indicate that they will be subjected to other requirements of Title VII.
The Commission intends to address the scope of each of those requirements, including
their applicability to the types of transactions identified by this commenter, in subsequent
rulemakings.

States. 847 The Commission questions whether the commenters’ assertion would in fact come to
pass. Market participants are likely to consider multiple factors when deciding whether and
where to clear a security-based swap. These factors could include the cost of clearing, the types
of products that can be cleared, the safeguards that clearing agencies put in place for customer
funds, and clearing agency policies on netting and margin. Commenters offered no support for
the assertion that the application of regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements
to transactions that are accepted for clearing by a U.S. clearing agency would be a deciding or
even a significant factor in whether to clear or the choice of clearing agency. Even if this
assertion were true, however, the Commission believes that it is appropriate, for the reasons
discussed above, to subject these transactions to regulatory reporting and public dissemination.
Finally, the Commission recognizes that the reporting hierarchy in Rule 901(a)(2)(ii), as
adopted, does not assign reporting obligations for two kinds of cross-border transaction: (1) a
transaction where there is no U.S. person, registered security-based swap dealer, or registered
major security-based swap participant on either side; and (2) a transaction where there is no
registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant on
either side and there is a U.S. person on only one side. If such a transaction is accepted for
clearing by a registered clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United
States, neither side—under Regulation SBSR as adopted by the Commission—is required to
report the transaction to a registered SDR. However, as described in Section V(B), supra, the
Commission anticipates soliciting further comment on how Regulation SBSR should be applied
to transactions involving unregistered non-U.S. persons, including how reporting duties should
be assigned for the two kinds of transaction noted above.

Transactions Involving a Registered Security-Based Swap Dealer or
Registered Major Security-Based Swap Participant That Is Not a U.S.
Person

Under re-proposed Rule 908(a)(1)(iii), a security-based swap would have been subject to
regulatory reporting if there is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant on either side of the transaction, regardless of the
counterparties’ place of domicile and regardless of the place of execution of the transaction.
Under Rule 908(a), as initially proposed, a counterparty’s status as a security-based swap dealer
or major security-based swap participant would not by itself have triggered reporting obligations
for a particular security-based swap. 848
One commenter recommended expanding the public dissemination requirement to
include security-based swaps that occur outside the United States between a non-U.S. person
security-based swap dealer and a non-U.S. person that is not guaranteed by a U.S. person, 849 and
between two non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers. 850
Rule 908(a)(2), as adopted, provides: “A security-based swap that is not included within
paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be subject to regulatory reporting but not public
dissemination if there is a direct or indirect counterparty on either or both sides of the transaction
that is a registered security-based swap dealer or a registered major security-based swap
participant.” 851 Thus, a security-based swap between a non-U.S. person registered security-

851

A security-based swap involving a U.S.-person that is registered as a security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant is included in Rule 908(a)(1) and is thus
subject to both regulatory reporting and public dissemination. A security-based swap
between a non-U.S. person that is registered as a security-based swap dealer or major
346

based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant and another non-U.S.
person (which could include another non-U.S. person registered security-based swap dealer or
registered major security-based swap participant), and where neither direct counterparty is
guaranteed by a U.S. person, would be subject to regulatory reporting but not public
dissemination. This treatment of security-based swaps involving non-U.S. person registered
security-based swap dealers and non-U.S. person registered major security-based swap
participants is generally consistent with re-proposed Rule 908(a); the language of final Rule
908(a)(2) is designed to clarify that outcome. 852
The Commission is not at this time taking the view that a security-based swap involving a
registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant, for
that reason alone, exists within the United States. Therefore, the Commission is not subjecting
any transactions involving a non-U.S.-person registered security-based swap dealer or registered
major security-based swap participant, for its registration status alone, to any requirement under
Regulation SBSR based on a territorial application of Title VII. However, the Commission is
requiring non-U.S.-person registered security-based swap dealers and registered major securitybased swap participants to report their security-based swap transactions pursuant to Rule
908(a)(2). 853 Requiring reporting to a registered SDR of all transactions entered into by

security-based swap participant and a U.S. person (including a foreign branch or office)
also is included in Rule 908(a)(1).
852

Rule 908(a)(1)(iii), as re-proposed, would have required regulatory reporting of a
security-based swap having a direct or indirect counterparty that is a registered securitybased swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant on either side of
the transaction. However, Rule 908(a)(2), as re-proposed, did not list the existence of a
registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant
on either side of the transaction, for that reason alone, as triggering public dissemination.

853

See Section 15F(f)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(f)(1)(A) (providing that
each registered security-based swap dealer and major security-based swap participant
347

registered security-based swap dealers and registered major security-based swap participants will
provide the Commission and other relevant authorities with important information to help with
the assessment of their positions and financial condition. 854 Such information could in turn assist
the Commission and other relevant authorities in assessing and addressing potential systemic
risks caused by these security-based swap positions, or in detecting insider trading or other
market abuse.
The Commission notes that a non-U.S. person that is registered as a security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant, when reporting a transaction that falls within
Rule 908(a)(2), must comply with the policies and procedures of the registered SDR regarding
how to flag the transaction as not subject to public dissemination. The Commission would not
view a registered SDR as acting inconsistent with Rule 902 for publicly disseminating a securitybased swap that falls within Rule 908(a)(2) if the reporting side had failed to appropriately flag
the transaction.
6.

No Final Rule Regarding Transactions Conducted Within the United
States

Under re-proposed Rule 908(a)(1)(i), a security-based swap would have been subject to
regulatory reporting if it was a transaction conducted within the United States. 855 Re-proposed

“shall make such reports as are required by the Commission, by rule or regulation,
regarding the transactions and positions and financial condition of the registered securitybased swap dealer or major security-based swap participant”).
854

In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission noted its longstanding view that
an entity that has registered with the Commission subjects itself to the entire regulatory
system governing such regulated entities. See 78 FR at 30986.

855

A security-based swap would be a “transaction conducted within the United States” if it
is solicited, negotiated, executed, or booked within the United States, by or on behalf of
either counterparty to the transaction, regardless of the location, domicile, or residence
status of either counterparty to the transaction. See proposed Rule 240.3a71-3(a)(5)
under the Exchange Act; Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31297; re-proposed
348

Rule 908(a)(1)(i) preserved the principle—but not the specific language—from the initial
proposal that a security-based swap would be subject to regulatory reporting if it is executed in
the United States. 856 When the Commission re-proposed Rule 908(a)(1)(i) in the Cross-Border
Proposing Release, the Commission expressed concern that the language in the Regulation SBSR
Proposing Release could have required a security-based swap to be reported if it had only the
slightest connection with the United States. 857
Re-proposed Rules 908(a)(1)(i) and 908(a)(2)(i) would have subjected a security-based
swap transaction to Regulation SBSR’s regulatory reporting and public dissemination
requirements, respectively, if the security-based swap was a “transaction conducted within the
United States.” Commenters expressed divergent views regarding this provision 858 and, after
careful consideration, the Commission has decided not to adopt re-proposed Rule 908(a)(1)(i) or
908(a)(2)(i) at this time. As discussed above, the Commission anticipates seeking additional
public comment on whether and, if so, how regulatory reporting and public dissemination
requirements should be applied to transactions involving non-U.S. persons when they engage in
conduct within the United States. 859

Rule 900(ii). The word “counterparty” as used within this term would have the same
meaning as “direct counterparty” in re-proposed Rule 900(j) of Regulation SBSR. See
Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31061.
856

Rule 908(a), as initially proposed, would have required regulatory reporting of any
security-based swap that is “executed in the United States or through any means of
interstate commerce.” See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75287.

Letter at 4-5; ISDA IV at 18.

In addition, the Commission has authority to promulgate rules, including additional
regulatory requirements, applicable to persons transacting a business in security-based
swaps “without the jurisdiction of the United States” when “necessary or appropriate” to

D.

Limitations on Counterparty Reporting Obligations—Rule 908(b)

As-proposed, Rule 908(b) would have provided that, notwithstanding any other provision
of Regulation SBSR, a direct or indirect counterparty to a security-based swap would not incur
any obligation under Regulation SBSR unless the counterparty is:
(1) a U.S. person;
(2) a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant; or
(3) a counterparty to a transaction conducted within the United States.
The Commission received no comments that specifically addressed re-proposed Rule 908(b). 860
At this time, the Commission is adopting only the first two prongs of Rule 908(b). Thus,
Rule 908(b), as adopted, provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of Regulation SBSR,
a person shall not incur any obligation under Regulation SBSR unless it is a U.S. person, a
registered security-based swap dealer, or a registered major security-based swap participant. As
discussed above, U.S. persons can be subjected to requirements under Title VII because their
transactions, whether undertaken directly or indirectly, exist at least in part within the United
States. Furthermore, registered security-based swap dealers and registered major security-based
swap participants are required to report their security-based swap transactions. 861

prevent evasion of the provisions of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Commission
is not necessarily exercising the full extent of its authorities today but will be monitoring
for gaps in reporting of swaps outside the United States that could be an evasion of the
Commission’s rules and regulations. See Section 30(c) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
78dd(c).
860

However, several commenters argued that specific requirements under Regulation SBSR
should not apply to certain kinds of counterparties in certain circumstances. All of these
comments are discussed in relation to Rule 908(a) in the section immediately above.

861

See supra Section XV(C)(5), note 853 and accompanying text.

350

Rule 908(b) is designed to specify the types of persons that will incur duties under
Regulation SBSR. If a person does not come within any of the categories enumerated by Rule
908(b), it would not incur any duties under Regulation SBSR. Under Rule 908(b), as adopted, a
non-U.S. person incurs no duties under Regulation SBSR unless it is a registered security-based
swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant. The Commission believes that
this modification will reduce assessment costs and provide greater legal certainty to
counterparties engaging in cross-border security-based swaps. The Commission anticipates
soliciting additional public comment on whether regulatory reporting and/or public
dissemination requirements should be extended to transactions occurring within the United
States between non-U.S. persons and, if so, which non-U.S. persons should incur reporting duties
under Regulation SBSR.
E.

Substituted Compliance—Rule 908(c)
1.

General Considerations

The security-based swap market is global in scope, and relevant authorities around the
globe are in the process of adopting security-based swap reporting and public dissemination
requirements within their jurisdictions. Once these new requirements are finalized and take
effect, market participants that engage in security-based swap transactions involving more than
one jurisdiction could be subject to conflicting or duplicative reporting or public dissemination
obligations. As initially proposed, Regulation SBSR did not contemplate that the reporting and
public dissemination requirements associated with cross-border security-based swaps could be
satisfied by complying with the rules of a foreign jurisdiction instead of U.S. rules. Thus, in
many cases, counterparties to a security-based swap would have been required to comply with
proposed Regulation SBSR even if reporting of a security-based swap also was required under

351

the rules of a foreign jurisdiction.
As discussed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, 862 a number of commenters urged
the Commission to allow compliance with comparable home country requirements to substitute
for compliance with the parallel U.S. requirements. 863 In response to those comments and
recognizing that other jurisdictions may implement regulatory reporting and public dissemination
regimes for security-based swaps that are comparable to the requirements set forth in Title VII
and Regulation SBSR, the Commission re-proposed Rule 908 in the Cross-Border Proposing
Release to include a new paragraph (c). Rule 908(c), as re-proposed, would have permitted,
under certain conditions, substituted compliance for regulatory reporting and public
dissemination requirements relating to security-based swaps. The Commission preliminarily
believed that the availability of substituted compliance would reduce the likelihood that market
participants would be subject to potentially conflicting or duplicative sets of rules while still
meeting the statutory and policy objectives of Title VII. Re-proposed Rule 908(c) would have
specified the security-based swaps that would be eligible for substituted compliance and would
have established procedures for market participants to request, and for the Commission to issue,
substituted compliance orders.
As discussed in detail below, the Commission is adopting Rule 908(c) substantially as reproposed, with minor modifications also described below. The Commission believes in general
that, if a foreign jurisdiction applies a comparable system for the regulatory reporting and public
dissemination of security-based swaps, it would be appropriate to consider permitting affected

See 78 FR at 31092.

Générale Letter at 11; CCMR II at 2. See also Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at
47357-58 (discussing several comments relating to substituted compliance issues
generally).

352

market participants to comply with the foreign requirements to satisfy the comparable
requirements of Regulation SBSR. Where the Commission finds that a foreign jurisdiction’s
reporting and public dissemination requirements are comparable to those implemented by the
Commission, Rule 908(c) provides that the Commission may make a substituted compliance
determination with respect to such jurisdiction for these requirements. The Commission believes
that permitting substituted compliance could reduce the likelihood that market participants would
be subject to conflicting or duplicative regulation with respect to a security-based swap
transaction.
In adopting Rule 908(c), the Commission is not making any assessment at this time
regarding whether any foreign jurisdiction’s requirements for regulatory reporting and public
dissemination of security-based swaps are comparable to Regulation SBSR. Furthermore,
because the analysis of any particular foreign jurisdiction would be very fact specific, it is
impractical for the Commission to opine at this time on whether specific aspects of a foreign
system would or would not allow the Commission to make a comparability determination. In
view of the many technical differences that could exist between the Commission’s Title VII rules
and parallel requirements in other jurisdictions, the Commission stated in the Cross-Border
Proposing Release that “the Commission would endeavor to take a holistic approach in making
substituted compliance determinations—that is, we would ultimately focus on regulatory
outcomes as a whole with respect to the requirements within the same category rather than a
rule-by-rule comparison.” 864 The Commission continues to believe that this approach to
comparability is appropriate, and intends to focus on regulatory outcomes as a whole when
considering whether to make a comparability determination.

2.

Substituted Compliance Procedure—Rule 908(c)(2)(i)

Rule 908(c)(2)(i), as re-proposed, would have allowed the Commission, conditionally or
unconditionally, by order, to make a substituted compliance determination regarding regulatory
reporting and public dissemination with respect to a foreign jurisdiction “if that foreign
jurisdiction’s requirements for regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based
swaps are comparable to otherwise applicable requirements” under Regulation SBSR.
A number of commenters endorsed the Commission’s proposal to permit substituted
compliance with Regulation SBSR. 865 One of these commenters noted, for example, that
substituted compliance would reduce burdens on businesses in the United States and elsewhere
without weakening oversight, thus allowing firms to use funds more efficiently. 866 However,
two commenters recommended that the Commission narrow the proposed availability of
substituted compliance. One of these commenters stated that the Commission’s proposed
controls on substituted compliance would be inadequate. 867 The commenter further stated that,
although substituted compliance potentially has a legitimate role to play in a cross-border
regulatory regime, the greater the scope for substituted compliance, the stricter the controls
should be on the ability to substitute foreign rules for U.S. rules. 868 The other commenter stated
that the Cross-Border Proposing Release failed to provide an adequate legal or policy

justification for allowing substituted compliance. 869 This commenter believed that, rather than
using substituted compliance, the Commission should exercise its exemptive authority sparingly
and only upon finding an actual conflict exists with a particular foreign regulation. 870
The Commission has carefully considered these comments and determined to adopt Rule
908(c)(2)(i) as re-proposed, with one modification, as described in Section XV(E)(3), infra.
Permitting substituted compliance should reduce the likelihood that market participants face
duplicative or contradictory reporting or public dissemination requirements, and thereby
decrease costs and administrative burdens on market participants without compromising the
regulatory goals of Title VII. The requirements for substituted compliance are designed to
ensure that the Title VII requirements for regulatory reporting and public dissemination of
security-based swaps are being satisfied, albeit through compliance with the rules of a foreign
jurisdiction rather than the specific provisions of Regulation SBSR.
3.

Security-Based Swaps Eligible for Substituted Compliance—Rule
908(c)(1)

Rule 908(c)(1), as re-proposed, would have provided that compliance with the regulatory
reporting and public dissemination requirements in Sections 13(m) and 13A of the Exchange
Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, may be satisfied by compliance with the rules of a
foreign jurisdiction that is the subject of a substituted compliance order issued by the
Commission, provided that at least one of the direct counterparties to the security-based swap is
either a non-U.S. person or a foreign branch, and the transaction is not solicited, negotiated, or
executed within the United States. Thus, under re-proposed Rule 908(c)(1), certain kinds of
869

See Better Markets IV at 3, 24-25 (noting that the Commission’s duty is to protect
investors and the public consistent with congressional policy, not to minimize the costs,
burdens, or inconvenience that regulation imposes on industry).

870

See id. at 26.

355

security-based swaps would not have been eligible for substituted compliance even if they were
subject to reporting and public dissemination requirements in a foreign jurisdiction. 871
Specifically, a security-based swap between two U.S. persons would not have been eligible for
substituted compliance with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination, even if the
security-based swap was solicited, negotiated, and executed outside the United States. 872
Furthermore, re-proposed Rule 908(c)(1) would not have allowed for the possibility of
substituted compliance with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination if the
relevant direct counterparty that was either a non-U.S. person or foreign branch (or its agent)—
regardless of place of domicile—solicited, negotiated, or executed a security-based swap from
within the United States.
The Commission received two comment letters in response to re-proposed Rule
908(c)(1), both of which addressed the proposal to limit substituted compliance availability to
security-based swaps that are not solicited, negotiated, or executed in the United States. 873 One
of these commenters recommended that the Commission remove this requirement altogether. 874
The other commenter noted that, as a general matter, it is virtually impossible to determine on a
trade-by-trade basis whether each specific contact with a counterparty or potential counterparty
871

If the rules of a foreign jurisdiction did not apply to the security-based swap, there would
be no need to consider the possibility of substituted compliance, because there would be
no foreign rules that could substitute for the applicable U.S. rules.

872

As noted in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, this assumed that neither U.S. person is
acting through a foreign branch. If either or both U.S. persons is acting through a foreign
branch, the security-based swap between those U.S. persons would have been eligible for
substituted compliance under Rule 908(c)(1), as re-proposed. See 78 FR at 31093-94,
note 1149.

873

See ISDA II at 5; SIFMA/FIA/Roundtable Letter at 3-4. A third commenter expressed
the view that any swap involving a U.S. person and a non-U.S. person should be eligible
for substituted compliance. See CCMR II at 2-3.

874

See ISDA II at 5.

356

has some nexus to the United States, and urged the Commission to subject security-based swaps
to Title VII regulation solely according to whether counterparties are U.S. persons. 875
In response to these comments, the Commission has decided to adopt a modified version
of Rule 908(c)(1) that does not condition substituted compliance eligibility on the location of
execution, negotiation, or solicitation of a particular transaction. 876 Under Rule 908(c)(1), as
adopted, a security-based swap is eligible for substituted compliance with respect to regulatory
reporting and public dissemination if at least one of the direct counterparties to the securitybased swap is either a non-U.S. person or a foreign branch. Thus, Rule 908(c)(1) permits a
security-based swap between a U.S. person and the New York branch of a foreign bank (i.e., a
non-U.S. person with operations inside the United States) to be eligible for substituted
compliance, provided that a substituted compliance order is in effect with respect to the home
country of the foreign bank that operates the U.S. branch. The standard in Rule 908(c)(1), as
adopted, is consistent with the Commission’s decision not to impose, at this time, reporting or
public dissemination requirements based solely on whether a transaction is conducted within the
United States.
Regarding which security-based swaps are eligible for the possibility of substituted
compliance, the Commission believes that, if at least one direct counterparty to a security-based
swap is a foreign branch or a non-U.S. person (even if the non-U.S. person is a registered
875

See SIFMA/FIA/Roundtable Letter at 3-4. This commenter did not raise this comment
expressly in the context of Rule 908(c)(1), however.

876

Rule 908(c)(1), as adopted, provides: “Compliance with the regulatory reporting and
public dissemination requirements in sections 13(m) and 13A of the Act (15 U.S.C.
78m(m) and 78m-1), and the rules and regulations thereunder, may be satisfied by
compliance with the rules of a foreign jurisdiction that is the subject of a Commission
order described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, provided that at least one of the direct
counterparties to the security-based swap is either a non-U.S. person or a foreign branch.”

357

security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant, or is guaranteed
by a U.S. person), the security-based swap should be eligible for consideration for a substituted
compliance determination under Regulation SBSR. This approach recognizes that a transaction
involving a foreign branch or a non-U.S. person faces the possibility of being subject to reporting
requirements in multiple jurisdictions (the United States and another jurisdiction whose rules
may govern the transaction). The approach adopted by the Commission of allowing any
transaction involving a foreign branch or non-U.S. person to be eligible to be considered for
substituted compliance is designed to limit disincentives for non-U.S. persons to transact
security-based swaps with U.S. persons by allowing for the possibility that compliance with the
rules of a foreign jurisdiction could be substituted for compliance with the specific provisions of
Regulation SBSR when the non-U.S. person transacts with a U.S. person. This approach also
would allow for a reasonable minimization of reporting burdens on foreign branches and nonU.S. persons in situations where the local jurisdiction in which they operate does not offer the
possibility of substituted compliance.
4.

Requests for Substituted Compliance—Rule 908(c)(2)(ii)

Rule 908(c)(2)(ii), as re-proposed, would have established the process for market
participants to follow when applying for a substituted compliance determination: “Any person
that executes security-based swaps that would, in the absence of a substituted compliance order,
be required to be reported pursuant to [Regulation SBSR] may file an application, pursuant to the
procedures set forth in § 240.0-13 of this chapter, requesting that the Commission make a
substituted compliance determination regarding regulatory reporting and public dissemination
with respect to a foreign jurisdiction the rules of which also would require reporting and public

358

dissemination of those security-based swaps. Such application shall include the reasons therefor
and such other information as the Commission may request.”
A number of commenters recommended that the Commission permit foreign regulators,
as well as market participants, to file an application for a substituted compliance
determination. 877 Some of these commenters noted that foreign regulatory authorities would be
well-positioned to describe their regulatory frameworks and manner of supervision, and, in any
event, their involvement would be needed to negotiate the memorandum of understanding that
the Commission proposed to require as a precondition of granting a substituted compliance
order. 878 One commenter also stated that the CFTC’s Cross-Border Guidance 879 contemplates
accepting applications for substituted compliance from non-U.S. regulators. 880 Two commenters
suggested that substituted compliance applications should be submitted by foreign regulatory
authorities, rather than individual firms. 881

See ICI II at 11; ISDA II at 4. Re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(iv), described below, would

of understanding or other agreement with the relevant foreign regulator(s) prior to issuing
a substituted compliance order covering a foreign jurisdiction.

359

The Commission is adopting Rule 908(c)(2)(ii) largely as re-proposed, with a few minor
revisions. First, consistent with the adoption of Rule 0-13 in the Cross-Border Adopting
Release, the Commission has revised Rule 908(c)(2)(ii) to permit foreign financial regulatory
authorities to submit applications for substituted compliance determinations on behalf of market
participants subject to their jurisdictions. 882
Second, Rule 908(c)(2)(ii), as re-proposed, would have permitted filing by any “person
that executes security-based swaps.” Read literally, this language in the re-proposed rule could
have permitted persons who are not subject to Regulation SBSR to seek a substituted compliance
determination. The Commission seeks to limit the scope of persons who can apply for
substituted compliance determinations to foreign financial regulators and parties that would be
subject to Regulation SBSR, because these persons have the greatest knowledge about the
foreign jurisdiction in question. Moreover, in the case of market participants active in that
jurisdiction, they will be directly impacted by potentially overlapping rules and thus have the
greatest interest in making the strongest case for substituted compliance. Accordingly, Rule
908(c)(2)(ii), as adopted, permits a “party that potentially would comply with requirements under
[Regulation SBSR] pursuant to a substituted compliance order,” 883 or the relevant foreign

882

See 79 FR at 47358 (“We are persuaded that allowing foreign regulators to submit such
requests would promote the completeness of requests and promote efficiency in the
process for considering such requests, in light of foreign regulators’ expertise regarding
their domestic regulatory system, including the effectiveness of their compliance and
enforcement mechanisms, and to allow for a single point of contact to facilitate the

Third, the Commission has determined not to include the final sentence of re-proposed
Rule 908(c)(2)(ii)—“[s]uch application shall include the reasons therefor and such other
information as the Commission may request”—in final Rule 908(c)(2)(ii). Rule 0-13(e) under
the Exchange Act, as adopted in the Cross-Border Adopting Release, provides detailed
requirements regarding the information required to be submitted (e.g., supporting documentation,
including information regarding applicable regulatory requirements, compliance monitoring by
foreign regulators, and applicable precedent). 886 In light of the cross-reference to Rule 0-13 in
final Rule 908(c)(2)(ii), the last sentence of re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(ii) is unnecessary and
therefore is not included in final Rule 908(c)(2)(ii).
5.

Findings Necessary for Substituted Compliance—Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)

884

This formulation of final Rule 908(c)(2)(ii) closely follows the language of Rule 0-13(a)
under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.0-13(a), which provides in relevant part that an
application for substituted compliance must be submitted to the Commission “by a party
that potentially would comply with requirements under the Exchange Act pursuant to a
substituted compliance order, or by the relevant foreign financial regulatory authority or
authorities.”

885

Thus, the Commission disagrees with the commenters who argued that substituted
compliance applications should be submitted only by foreign regulatory authorities,
rather than individual firms. See ESMA Letter at 3; JSDA Letter at 2. Although
obtaining information from foreign regulatory authorities could be an important aspect of
the substituted compliance review, the Commission sees no basis for denying individual
firms that might comply with requirements of Regulation SBSR pursuant to a substituted
compliance order the ability to request substituted compliance and thereby initiate that
review. See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47358 (“We are not . . .
foreclosing the ability of a market participant itself to submit a request that it be able to
comply with Exchange Act requirements pursuant to a substituted compliance order”).

886

See id. In addition, Rule 0-13(h) requires the Commission to publish in the Federal
Register a notice that a complete application has been submitted.

361

Rule 908(c)(2)(iii), as re-proposed, would have provided that, in making a substituted
compliance determination with respect to a foreign jurisdiction, the Commission shall take into
account such factors as it determines are appropriate, such as the scope and objectives of the
relevant foreign regulatory requirements, as well as the effectiveness of the supervisory
compliance program administered, and the enforcement authority exercised, by the foreign
financial regulatory authority to support oversight of its regulatory reporting and public
dissemination system for security-based swaps. Furthermore, Rule 908(c)(2)(iii), as re-proposed,
would have provided that the Commission would not make a substituted compliance
determination with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination unless the
Commission found that the relevant foreign regulatory regime provided for the reporting and
public dissemination of comparable data elements in a manner and timeframe comparable to
those required by Regulation SBSR.887 As a prerequisite to any substituted compliance
determination, re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(iii) also would have required that the Commission
have direct electronic access to the security-based swap data held by the trade repository or
foreign regulatory authority. 888 Lastly, re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(iii) would have required the
Commission to find that any trade repository or foreign regulatory authority in the foreign
jurisdiction is subject to requirements regarding data collection and maintenance; systems
capacity, resiliency, and security; and recordkeeping that are comparable to the requirements
imposed on registered SDRs. 889

362

The Commission has determined to adopt Rule 908(c)(2)(iii) as re-proposed, subject to
two minor changes, one in each of Rules 908(c)(2)(iii)(B) and 908(c)(2)(iii)(D), which are
discussed below. Final Rule 908(c)(2)(iii) provides that, in making a substituted compliance
determination, the Commission shall take into account such factors that it determines are
appropriate, which include but are not limited to the scope and objectives of the relevant foreign
regulatory requirements, as well as the effectiveness of the supervisory compliance program
administered, and the enforcement authority exercised, by the foreign financial regulatory
authority to support oversight of its regulatory reporting and public dissemination system for
security-based swaps. The rule further provides that the Commission shall not make such a
substituted compliance determination unless it finds that:
(A) The data elements that are required to be reported pursuant to the rules of the foreign
jurisdiction are comparable to those required to be reported pursuant to Rule 901;
(B) The rules of the foreign jurisdiction require the security-based swap to be reported
and publicly disseminated in a manner and a timeframe comparable to those required by
Regulation SBSR (or, in the case of transactions that are subject to regulatory reporting but not
public dissemination, the rules of the foreign jurisdiction require the security-based swaps to be
reported in a manner and timeframe comparable to those required by Regulation SBSR);
(C) The Commission has direct electronic access to the security-based swap data held by
a trade repository or foreign regulatory authority to which security-based swaps are reported
pursuant to the rules of that foreign jurisdiction; and
(D) Any trade repository or foreign regulatory authority in the foreign jurisdiction that
receives and maintains required transaction reports of security-based swaps pursuant to the laws
of that foreign jurisdiction is subject to requirements regarding data collection and maintenance;

363

systems capacity, integrity, resiliency, availability, and security; and recordkeeping that are
comparable to the requirements imposed on security-based swap data repositories by the
Commission’s rules and regulations. 890
Although no commenters discussed the appropriateness of considering the examination
and enforcement practices of foreign regulators in making a substituted compliance
determination for Regulation SBSR specifically, a number of commenters addressed the general
concept of considering actual practices in the foreign jurisdiction as part of the substituted
compliance determination. Certain commenters generally supported the retention by the
Commission of the authority to decline to make a comparability finding based on the substantive
enforcement of foreign regulatory regimes. 891 Two of these commenters noted, however, that
supervisory practices differ significantly among jurisdictions. 892 One of these commenters
stated: “This lack of commonality should not be assumed to be a defect in supervisory
standards; common objectives may be reached through differing means.” 893 This commenter
expressed the general view, however, that “a general, high-level inquiry into the existence of an
examination and enforcement process and institutions to support it arguably should inform views
about the comparability of outcomes.” 894
The Commission agrees that the examination and enforcement practices of each foreign
jurisdiction will need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and anticipates that it will consider
whether the regulatory protections provided in that jurisdiction’s security-based swap markets

are substantially realized through sufficiently vigorous supervision and enforcement. While the
Commission believes that common objectives may be reached through differing means, the
Commission also believes that compliance with a foreign jurisdiction’s rules for reporting and
public dissemination of security-based swaps should be a substitute for compliance with the U.S.
rules only when the foreign jurisdiction has a reporting and public dissemination regime
comparable to that of the United States. This determination must consider actual practices and
implementation as well as written laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdiction.
a.

Data Element Comparability—Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)(A)

The Commission received several comments regarding the data element comparability
determination required by what is now final Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)(A). Two commenters
recommended that the Commission determine whether a foreign jurisdiction has comparable
security-based swap reporting requirements based on a holistic review of that jurisdiction’s
regulations and the local market environment. 895 Some commenters suggested that the
Commission should determine whether the security-based swap reporting framework of a foreign
jurisdiction is designed to achieve the G-20 goals of transparency in the derivatives markets. 896

895

See JFMC Letter at 7; ISDA II at 8. Other commenters expressed a general preference
for a holistic review of a relevant jurisdiction’s security-based swap regulatory regime
but did not expressly reference Regulation SBSR in this context. See, e.g.,
SIFMA/FIA/Roundtable Letter at A-37-A-38; Pearson Letter at 3; IIF Letter at 5; ICI II
at 11; JFMC Letter at 1; MFA/AIMA Letter at 5 (observing that a line-by-line or rule-byrule analysis would place a significant burden on the Commission, and potentially result
in disjointed regulation); ABA Letter at 5.

896

See ICI II at 12; ISDA II at 8 (noting also that jurisdictions may choose to establish goals
and requirements that are ancillary to the G-20 regulatory goals, but these ancillary
requirements should not become a barrier to an effective cross-border compliance regime
that furthers the G-20 goals). With respect to security-based swap reporting, the “G-20
goals” referenced by these commenters were articulated in the Leaders’ Statement at the
Pittsburgh Summit (September 24-25, 2009), available at:
365

The Commission is adopting re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)(A) without revision. Under
the final rule, the foreign jurisdiction must require reporting of data elements comparable to
those required under Rule 901 of Regulation SBSR for the Commission to make a comparability
determination. If the data elements required by the foreign jurisdiction are not comparable,
important information about a security-based swap might not be captured by the foreign trade
repository or foreign regulatory authority. This could create gaps or inconsistencies in the
information available to the Commission and impair the Commission’s ability to monitor the
security-based swap market. As noted in Section XV(E)(1), supra, the Commission generally
agrees with the commenters who expressed the view that the Commission should take a
“holistic” or “outcomes-based” view of another jurisdiction’s rules when making a substituted
compliance determination, rather than conduct a “line-by-line” or “rule-by-rule” analysis. At
this time, the Commission does not believe that it is sufficient to consider only whether the data
elements required by the foreign regulatory regime are designed to achieve the objectives of the
G-20 with respect to reporting. The G-20 objectives are a high-level set of principles designed to
guide jurisdictions in adopting reforms for the OTC derivatives markets. Therefore, the
Commission believes that it is necessary and appropriate to consider whether the data elements
reported under that jurisdiction’s rules are comparable to those required under Rule 901 of
Regulation SBSR—not whether they are comparable to the G-20 standards—in deciding whether
to grant a substituted compliance determination. If the Commission took the opposite view, it
would be difficult to conclude that the oversight and transparency goals of Title VII were being

satisfied through compliance with the rules of the foreign jurisdiction in lieu of Regulation
SBSR. 897
b.

Timeframe of Reporting and Public Dissemination—Rule
908(c)(2)(iii)(B)

The Commission also is adopting Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)(B) as re-proposed, subject to certain
conforming changes. 898 Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)(B), as adopted, provides that the Commission shall
not issue a substituted compliance determination unless the relevant foreign jurisdiction requires
security-based swaps to be reported and publicly disseminated “in a manner and a timeframe
comparable to those required by [Regulation SBSR].” Given the Title VII requirements that all
security-based swaps be reported to a registered SDR and that security-based swaps be publicly
disseminated in real time, the Commission believes that allowing substituted compliance with
the rules of a foreign jurisdiction that has reporting timeframes and dissemination outcomes not
897

One commenter urged the Commission to “replace the apparently subjective ‘outcomesbased’ standard for comparison with a more rigorous and objective standard based on the
underlying rules.” AFR Letter at 9. For the reasons noted above, the Commission is
adopting a “comparable” standard, rather than the type of review suggested by the
commenter. This commenter further stated: “Another reason that ‘outcomes-based’
assessment may not be adequate is that the inter-operability of different rule sets may be
critical to the effectiveness of the overall international regime. . . . this is the case for
standardization of data formats in reporting, and may also be true for various risk
management elements that must be standardized across a global financial institution.” Id.
at 10. The Commission intends to work with foreign regulatory authorities to develop
more uniform data standards to allow maximum aggregability while minimizing market
participant costs and burdens that would result from having to report in different
jurisdictions using different data standards and formats.

898

As re-proposed, this rule would have provided that the Commission shall not make a
substituted compliance determination unless it finds that the “rules of the foreign
jurisdiction require the security-based swap to be reported and publicly disseminated in a
manner and a timeframe comparable to those required by §§ 242.900 through 242.911.”
As discussed previously, Regulation SBSR, as adopted, consists of Rules 900 through
909 under the Exchange Act. Therefore, the reference in re-proposed Rule
908(c)(2)(iii)(B) to “§§ 242.900 through 242.911” is being revised to read: “§§ 242.900
through 242.909.”

367

comparable to those in the United States would run counter to the objectives and requirements of
Title VII. If the Commission allowed substituted compliance for such a jurisdiction, the
Commission might have access to less regulatory data about the security-based swap market, or
price discovery could be less efficient, than would have been the case if Regulation SBSR
applied in its entirety. Thus, for example, the Commission generally does not anticipate
permitting substituted compliance with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination
under Rule 908(c) if a foreign jurisdiction does not (among other things) impose public
dissemination requirements for all security-based swaps on a trade-by-trade basis. 899 Thus, the
Commission disagrees with the commenter who suggested that a non-U.S. public dissemination
regime that disseminates data on an aggregate basis should be deemed comparable to Regulation
SBSR. 900
One commenter stated that “[c]omparability should be addressed flexibly with respect to
public dissemination, recognizing that in certain jurisdictions’ [sic] transparency obligations are

899

Although the Commission is requiring reporting and public dissemination of securitybased swaps within 24 hours of the time of execution during the first initial phase of
Regulation SBSR, see Rule 901(j), the Commission anticipates considering provisions to
implement the Title VII requirement for real-time public dissemination. Therefore, the
Commission would view a foreign jurisdiction’s regime for public dissemination of
security-based swaps as comparable only if it (1) had rules providing for real-time public
dissemination of all security-based swaps currently, or (2) was following a comparable
process of moving to real-time public dissemination for all security-based swaps in
phases.

900

See JSDA Letter at 2. Another commenter requested that the Commission determine that
Japan has comparable security-based swap reporting standards. See JFMC Letter at 8.
This comment is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. However, after Regulation SBSR
becomes effective, market participants in this jurisdiction that would rely on a substituted
compliance determination, or their regulators, may submit a request for substituted
compliance with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination if they believe
that the rules in that jurisdiction satisfy the criteria for substituted compliance described
in Rule 908(c).

368

linked to use of a trading venue and fall on the venue.” 901 Another commenter recommended
that the Commission should not determine that a foreign jurisdiction lacks comparable securitybased swap reporting rules based on technical differences in the timeframes for, or manner of,
reporting. 902 Whether the Commission grants a substituted compliance determination will
depend on the facts and circumstances pertaining to a particular request. Thus, it is difficult to
address concerns such as those raised by these two commenters in the abstract. As the
Commission noted in Section XV(E)(1), supra, it will assess comparability in a holistic manner
rather than on a rule-by-rule basis.
c.

Direct Electronic Access—Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)(C)

The Commission also is adopting Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)(C) as re-proposed. Rule
908(c)(2)(iii)(C) provides that the Commission may not issue a substituted compliance order
with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination in a foreign jurisdiction unless
“[t]he Commission has direct electronic access to the security-based swap data held by a trade
repository or foreign regulatory authority to which security-based swaps are reported pursuant to
the rules of that foreign jurisdiction.” 903 Commenters expressed differing views regarding the
direct electronic access requirement in re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)(C). One commenter
expressed support for the proposed requirement, believing that direct electronic access is a

901

ISDA II at 9.

902

See ICI II at 12.

903

Under Rule 900(l), as adopted, “direct electronic access” has the same meaning as in
Rule 13n-4(a)(5) under the Exchange Act, discussed in the SDR Adopting Release. Rule
13n-4(a)(5) defines “direct electronic access” to mean access, which shall be in a form
and manner acceptable to the Commission, to data stored by an SDR in an electronic
format and updated at the same time as the SDR’s data is updated so as to provide the
Commission or any of its designees with the ability to query or analyze the data in the
same manner that the SDR can query or analyze the data.

369

critical element for adequate monitoring of risks to U.S. financial stability. 904 However, two
commenters objected to the proposed direct electronic access requirement. 905 One of these
commenters suggested that the Commission should not require direct electronic access at this
time, but should instead wait for the “FSB” to develop plans “to produce and share globally
aggregated trade repository data that authorities need for monitoring systemic risks.” 906 Another
commenter “urge[d] the Commission to take into account the issue of foreign jurisdictions’
privacy laws before imposing a blanket requirement that [the Commission] have direct electronic
access.” 907
After carefully considering the comments received, the Commission continues to believe
that requiring direct electronic access to security-based swap data held by a trade repository or
foreign regulatory authority is a necessary part of any substituted compliance determination.
Thus, the Commission does not believe that it should rely instead on the FSB or other
international bodies developing arrangements for trade repositories and relevant authorities to
share information across jurisdictions. While these cross-border information-sharing
arrangements are important, and the Commission will continue to participate in such efforts,
granting substituted compliance without direct electronic access would not be consistent with the
underlying premise of substituted compliance: that a comparable regulatory result is reached
904

See AFR Letter at 9 (noting that the Commission should seek to analyze data from
foreign repositories in conjunction with U.S.-sourced data to determine the swap
exposure of an entity on a global basis).

905

See IIF Letter at 7; ISDA II at 8.

proposed direct electronic access requirement. See IIF Letter at 7.

907

SIFMA/FIA/Roundtable Letter at A-46 (stating that over a dozen jurisdictions have been
identified where local law prohibits the disclosure of client names to non-local regulators

regulator, some of which cannot be satisfied by counterparty consent).

370

through compliance with foreign rules rather than with the corresponding U.S. rules. If the
Commission were to grant substituted compliance for a foreign jurisdiction where the
Commission did not have direct electronic access to the facility to which security-based swap
transactions of that jurisdiction are reported, the Commission might not have access to
transaction information for portions of the security-based swap market that it otherwise would
have the ability to surveil. 908 If the Commission were to rely solely on international informationsharing agreements, it could face substantial delays before a foreign trade repository or foreign
regulatory authority, even acting expeditiously, could compile and make available to the
Commission data relating to a substantial volume of transactions. Delays in obtaining such data
could compromise the ability of the Commission to supervise security-based swap market
participants, or to share information with other relevant U.S. authorities in a timely fashion.
Thus, the Commission believes that direct electronic access to security-based swap data held by
the foreign trade repository or foreign regulatory authority to which security-based swap
transactions are reported in the foreign jurisdiction must be a prerequisite to issuing a substituted
compliance order with respect to Regulation SBSR applying to that jurisdiction.
The Commission has taken into consideration the comment that certain jurisdictions have
privacy laws or blocking statutes that could, in certain cases, render a foreign trade repository or
foreign regulatory authority unable to provide the Commission with direct electronic access to
transaction information that would include the identity of the counterparties. The Commission is
not persuaded that this consideration should remove direct electronic access as a requirement for
substituted compliance under Regulation SBSR. Indeed, if foreign privacy laws result in the

908

See supra note 788 (providing statistics regarding the amount of cross-border trading in
the security-based swap market).

371

Commission having less than comparable access to the security-based swap transaction data held
at a foreign trade repository or foreign regulatory authority than the Commission otherwise
would have if no substituted compliance order were in effect, then the premise of substituted
compliance would not be met. Although foreign regulatory authorities would likely have access
to information about security-based swap transactions that exist at least in part in their
jurisdictions, these authorities might lack the ability to share this information with the
Commission. As a result, it could be difficult if not impossible for the Commission or any other
relevant authority, foreign or domestic, to observe the build-up of systemic risks created by the
global security-based swap activity of U.S. persons. In sum, the Commission believes that, if it
does not have direct electronic access to the transaction information reported to the foreign trade
repository or foreign regulatory authority, substituted compliance would not yield a comparable
outcome and the requirements of Rule 908(c)(2) would not be met. 909 The Commission believes
that, in this situation, the specific requirements of Regulation SBSR should continue to apply; if
necessary supervisory information cannot be obtained via direct electronic access to the securitybased swap data held by a foreign trade repository or foreign regulatory authority, then such
transactions must continue to be reported to a registered SDR, from which the Commission can
obtain such information.
d.

Trade Repository Capabilities—Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)(D)

The Commission received no comments on Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)(D) and is adopting that
rule as re-proposed, with certain minor changes. Final Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)(D) provides that the
Commission shall not make a substituted compliance determination with respect to regulatory

909

See also infra Section XVI(A) (addressing the impact of foreign privacy laws on
Regulation SBSR).

372

reporting and public dissemination unless it finds that “[a]ny trade repository or foreign
regulatory authority in the foreign jurisdiction that receives and maintains required transaction
reports of security-based swaps pursuant to the laws of that foreign jurisdiction is subject to
requirements regarding data collection and maintenance; systems capacity, integrity, resiliency,
availability, and security; and recordkeeping that are comparable to the requirements imposed on
security-based swap data repositories by the Commission’s rules and regulations” (emphasis
added). In the re-proposed rule, the highlighted language would have read “. . . by §§ 240.13n-5
through 240.13n-7 of this chapter.” Because requirements imposed on registered SDRs relating
to data collection and maintenance; systems capacity, integrity, resiliency, availability, and
security; and recordkeeping could be imposed by Commission rules and regulations other than or
in addition to Rules 13n-5 through 13n-7 under the Exchange Act, the Commission believes that
it would be more appropriate to use the broader language in the text of final Rule
908(c)(2)(iii)(D). The Commission continues to believe that, to allow substituted compliance for
regulatory reporting and public dissemination with respect to a foreign jurisdiction, any entity in
that foreign jurisdiction that is required to receive and maintain security-based swap transaction
data must have protections and operability standards comparable to those imposed on SECregistered SDRs.
In addition, the re-proposed rule would have required, in relevant part, that—in
connection with a substituted compliance determination—the foreign trade repository or foreign
regulatory authority must be subject to requirements for “systems capacity, resiliency, and
security” that are comparable to parallel U.S. requirements. That provision in final Rule
908(c)(2)(iii)(D) now states, “systems capacity, integrity, resiliency, availability, and security.”
The addition of “integrity” and “availability” to characterize the expected operational capability

373

of the foreign trade repository or foreign regulatory authority is derived from a parallel change
that the Commission made in adopting final Rule 13n-6 under the Exchange Act that applies to
SEC-registered SDRs. 910 Because these standards apply to SEC-registered SDRs, the
Commission believes that it is appropriate for Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)(D) to include them as elements
necessary for a finding that a foreign trade repository or foreign regulatory authority is subject to
comparable regulatory duties.
e.

Memoranda of Understanding—Rule 908(c)(2)(iv)

Rule 908(c)(2)(iv), as re-proposed, would have required that, before issuing a substituted
compliance order relating to regulatory reporting and public dissemination with respect to a
foreign jurisdiction, the Commission shall have entered into a supervisory and enforcement
memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) or other arrangement with the relevant foreign
financial regulatory authority or authorities under such foreign financial regulatory system
addressing oversight and supervision of the applicable security-based swap market. No
commenters addressed this proposed requirement.
The Commission is adopting Rule 908(c)(2)(iv) with certain minor revisions. First, the
Commission is modifying the rule to indicate that a substituted compliance determination may
require the Commission to enter into more than one MOU or other arrangement with a foreign
authority. Second, the Commission has modified the rule to provide that such MOUs or other
arrangements would “address[] supervisory and enforcement cooperation and other matters
arising under the substituted compliance determination.” 911 These clarifications are designed to
facilitate discussions between the Commission and relevant foreign regulators.
910

See SDR Adopting Release, note 831.

911

Rule 908(c)(2)(iv).

374

The Commission expects that any grant of substituted compliance would be predicated on
the presence of enforcement MOUs or other arrangements that provide formal mechanisms by
which the Commission can request assistance and obtain documents and information from
foreign authorities regarding enforcement matters involving securities. Substituted compliance
also may be expected to be predicated on the presence of supervisory MOUs or other
arrangements that provide formal mechanisms by which the Commission can request assistance
and obtain non-public information from foreign authorities related to the oversight of dually
regulated entities. As a result, such MOUs or other arrangements should help the Commission
ensure compliance with Title VII requirements for regulatory reporting and public dissemination.
In addition, any grant of substituted compliance may be conditioned upon the
Commission entering into other MOUs or arrangements that address additional matters specific
to the substituted compliance determination. Such MOUs or other arrangements, among other
respects, may be expected to help promote the effectiveness of substituted compliance by
providing mechanisms by which the Commission may request information and/or monitor for
circumstances where the foreign regime may no longer be comparable to the counterpart Title
VII requirements (due, for example, to changes in the substantive legal framework of the foreign
regime that are inconsistent with the understandings that underpinned the Commission’s initial
grant of substituted compliance). In addition, such MOUs or other arrangements may provide
mechanisms by which the Commission could request information and monitor the effectiveness
of the enforcement and supervision capabilities of the appropriate foreign regulator(s). More
generally, such MOUs or other arrangements can provide mechanisms by which the Commission
could obtain information relevant to the assessment of comparability.
f.

Modification or Withdrawal of Substituted Compliance Order

375

Rule 908(c)(2)(v), as re-proposed, would have provided that the Commission may, on its
own initiative, modify or withdraw a substituted compliance order with respect to regulatory
reporting and public dissemination in a foreign jurisdiction, at any time, after appropriate notice
and opportunity for comment. The Commission is adopting Rule 908(c)(2)(v) as re-proposed,
without revision.
Situations can arise where it would be necessary or appropriate to modify or withdraw a
substituted compliance order. A modification or withdrawal could be necessary if, after the
Commission issues a substituted compliance order, the facts or understandings on which the
Commission relied when issuing that order are no longer true. The Commission believes,
therefore, that it is appropriate to establish a mechanism whereby it could, at any time and on its
own initiative, modify or withdraw a previously issued substituted compliance order with respect
to regulatory reporting and public dissemination, after appropriate notice and opportunity for
comment. Having made a comparability determination, the Commission should have the ability
to periodically review the determination and decide whether the substituted compliance
determination should continue to apply. 912 The Commission could determine to condition a
substituted compliance order on an ongoing duty to disclose relevant information. Thus, the
Commission generally agrees with the commenter who argued that persons making use of
substituted compliance should be responsible for informing the Commission if factors on which
the Commission relied in making the determination change in any material way. 913
Two commenters generally supported the re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(v) requirement for

The Commission made a similar statement in the Cross-Border Proposing Release. See

the Commission to publish for comment proposed withdrawals or modifications. 914 Several
commenters also recommended that any final decision by the Commission to modify or
withdraw a comparability determination should include a phase-in period to provide market
participants adequate opportunity to make necessary adjustments to their compliance systems
and processes. 915 The Commission generally agrees with these comments, and believes that all
affected persons should have appropriate notice of the introduction, withdrawal, or modification
of a substituted compliance order so as to minimize undue disruptions in the market. The
Commission will address phase-in issues and timeframes on a case-by-case basis—in the
relevant order that introduces, modifies, or withdraws substituted compliance—depending on the
facts and circumstances of the particular situation.

Consideration of Regulatory Reporting and Public Dissemination in the
Commission’s Analysis of Substituted Compliance

When the Commission re-proposed Rule 908(c) in the Cross-Border Proposing Release,
it expressed a preliminary view that regulatory reporting and public dissemination should be
considered together in the Commission’s analysis of whether to permit substituted
compliance. 916 If the Commission were to adopt that approach, security-based swap transactions
would not be eligible for substituted compliance if there were comparable foreign rules in one
area but not the other. In other words, a foreign jurisdiction that has comparable rules for
regulatory reporting of security-based swap transactions but not comparable rules for public
dissemination of such transactions would not have been eligible for substituted compliance under
Regulation SBSR.

Three commenters suggested that the Commission consider making separate substituted
compliance determinations for regulatory reporting and public dissemination. 917 One of these
commenters expressed the view that making separate determinations is appropriate because
regulatory reporting and public dissemination serve distinct goals. 918 This commenter also
argued that, due to the significant costs associated with documentation, procedures, and
technological systems necessary to comply with reporting regimes, the possibility of separate
substituted compliance determinations for regulatory reporting and public dissemination could
substantially reduce costs for non-U.S. market participants while still achieving the
Commission’s important market surveillance and transparency goals. 919 One of the other
commenters argued that “[d]ifferences among jurisdictions in the timing of reporting . . . should
be evaluated in light of systemic risk and market supervisory objectives, rather than policies of
facilitating price discovery.” 920 The commenter concluded, therefore, that “[s]uch flexibility
should include the potential for separate determinations regarding regulatory reporting and
public dissemination requirements.” 921
Notwithstanding these comments, the Commission continues to believe that—subject to
one exception described below—regulatory reporting and public dissemination should be
considered together for purposes of substituted compliance under Rule 908(c). Even if
regulatory reporting and public dissemination serve different policy goals, the Commission

believes that treating regulatory reporting and public dissemination separately would not further
those goals as effectively as considering these requirements together. The Commission agrees
with the commenters who argued that regulatory reporting serves important market oversight
goals. 922 However, the Commission disagrees that these objectives should be pursued “rather
than policies of facilitating price discovery.” 923 Title VII requires the Commission to pursue
both sets of policy goals. If the Commission were to permit substituted compliance for
regulatory reporting but not for public dissemination, certain transactions could be reported to a
foreign trade repository or a foreign regulatory authority in lieu of a registered SDR but would
(in theory) still be subject to the Regulation SBSR’s public dissemination requirements in Rule
902. Under Regulation SBSR, registered SDRs are charged with publicly disseminating
information about security-based swap transactions. To carry out its public dissemination
function, a registered SDR must obtain data about security-based swap transactions that
Regulation SBSR requires it to publicly disseminate. If this data were reported to a foreign trade
repository or foreign regulatory authority under the terms of a substituted compliance order, it
would be impractical, if not impossible, for a registered SDR to disseminate that transaction data,
as required under Rule 902. In other words, because the registered SDR needs a report of the
transaction from the reporting side in order to carry out public dissemination, no purpose would
be served—and indeed public dissemination could be compromised—by removing the duty to
report the transaction to a registered SDR in lieu of the duty to report it to the foreign trade

repository or foreign regulatory authority. 924 The Commission continues to believe that it is
impractical and unnecessary to devise an alternate method of public dissemination for securitybased swaps that are reported in a foreign jurisdiction pursuant to a substituted compliance order.
The Commission concludes, therefore, that a foreign jurisdiction’s regulatory reporting and
public dissemination requirements—subject to one exception described immediately below—
shall be considered together for purposes of evaluating comparability for purposes of a
substituted compliance determination under Rule 908(c).
One commenter argued that the Commission should be able to issue a substituted
compliance order solely in respect of regulatory reporting that would apply to cross-border
security-based swaps that are subject to regulatory reporting but not public dissemination under
Regulation SBSR. 925 Under Rule 908(a), as adopted, there is one kind of security-based swap
that is subject to regulatory reporting but not public dissemination: a transaction with a non-U.S.
person that is registered as a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant
on one side and no U.S. person on the other side. Upon further consideration, the Commission
agrees with the commenter and is adopting Rule 908(c) with certain revisions that will allow the
Commission to issue a substituted compliance order with respect to regulatory reporting but not
public dissemination with respect to this subset of cross-border transactions. The Commission
has added a second sentence to the language in re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(i) to carry out this

924

The Commission specifically raised this issue in the Cross-Border Proposing Release and
asked how public dissemination could be carried out if substituted compliance were in
effect for regulatory reporting but not for public dissemination. See 78 FR at 31096.

regulatory reporting or public dissemination could substantially reduce costs for non-U.S.
market participants while still achieving the Commission’s important market surveillance

aim. 926 The Commission also revised one prong of re-proposed Rule 908(c)(iii) to exclude
consideration of the reporting timeframes for public dissemination in cases where the
Commission is considering a substituted compliance request with respect to cross-border
transactions that are, under Regulation SBSR, subject to regulatory reporting but not public
dissemination. The Commission believes that offering the possibility of substituted compliance
for these kinds of cross-border transactions could reduce compliance burdens for affected
persons without reducing the capability of the Commission and other relevant authorities to
oversee the security-based swap market.
XVI. Other Cross-Border Issues
A.

Foreign Public Sector Financial Institutions

In response to the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, six commenters expressed
concern about applying the requirements of Title VII to the activities of foreign public sector
financial institutions (“FPSFIs”), such as foreign central banks and multilateral development
banks. 927 One commenter, the European Central Bank (“ECB”), noted that security-based swaps
entered into by the Federal Reserve Banks are excluded from the definition of “swap” in the
Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”) 928 and that the functions of foreign central banks and the
Federal Reserve are broadly comparable. The ECB argued, therefore, that security-based swaps
926

Rule 908(c)(2)(i).

927

See BIS Letter passim; CEB at 2, 4; ECB Letter passim; ECB Letter II passim; EIB
Letter passim; Nordic Investment Bank Letter at 1; World Bank Letter I passim.

928

Section 1a(47)(B)(ix) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 1a(47)(B)(ix), excludes from the definition of
“swap” any agreement, contract, or transaction a counterparty of which is a Federal
Reserve Bank, the federal government, or a federal agency that is expressly backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States. A security-based swap includes any swap, as
defined in the CEA, that is based on, among other things, a narrow-based index or a
single security or loan. See Section 3(a)(68) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c3(a)(68).

381

entered into by foreign central banks should likewise be excluded from the definition of
“swap.” 929 A second commenter, the World Bank (representing the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, and other multilateral
development institutions of which the United States is a member) also argued generally that the
term “swap” should be defined to exclude any transaction involving a multilateral development
bank. 930 The World Bank further noted that EMIR—the E.U. counterpart to Title VII of the
Dodd-Frank Act—would expressly exclude multilateral development banks from its coverage. 931
The ECB and BIS stated that foreign central banks enter into security-based swaps solely
in connection with their public mandates, which require them to act confidentially in certain
circumstances. 932 The ECB argued in particular that public disclosure of its market activities
could compromise its ability to take necessary actions and “could cause signaling effects to other
market players and finally hinder the policy objectives of such actions.” 933 Another commenter,
the Council of Europe Development Banks (“CEB”), while opposing application of Title VII
requirements to multilateral development banks generally, did not object to the CFTC and SEC
preserving their authority over certain aspects of their transactions, such as by imposing

reporting requirements. 934 Similarly, the World Bank believed that the definition of “swap”
could be qualified by a requirement that counterparties would treat such transactions as swaps
solely for reporting purposes. 935
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission sought additional information to
assist with analysis of this issue and asked a number of questions, including questions relating to
how active FPSFIs are in the security-based swap market generally; the extent to which FPSFIs
engage in security-based swap activity with U.S. persons; whether there are any characteristics
of FPSFI activity in the security-based swap market that could make it easier for market
observers to detect an FPSFI as a counterparty or that could make it easier to detect an FPSFI’s
business transactions or market positions; and whether there are steps that the Commission could
take to minimize such information leakage short of suppressing all FPSFI trades from public
dissemination. 936 The Commission specifically requested that commenters on this issue focus on
the security-based swap market, not the market for other swaps. In addition, commenters were
requested to answer only with respect to security-based swap activity that would be subject to
Regulation SBSR, and not with respect to activity that, because of other factors, would not be
subject to Regulation SBSR in any case. 937
Only a few commenters on the Cross-Border Proposing Release responded to any of
these questions or offered additional comments on FPSFI issues related to Regulation SBSR.
One commenter, FMS-Wertmanagement (“FMS”), an instrumentality of the government of the

934

should be subject to post-trade transparency.

Federal Republic of Germany that manages certain legacy financial portfolios, stated that
security-based swaps form only a small portion of its overall derivatives portfolio, and that it
does not enter into any new security-based swaps “except with the purpose of restructuring
existing security-based swaps within the limits of its winding-up strategy.” 938 This commenter,
however, did not provide an opinion regarding how any provisions of Regulation SBSR would
affect its operations; instead, the primary opinion expressed in the comment was that FPSFIs
such as FMS should not be required to register as security-based swap dealers or major securitybased swap participants and be subject to the attendant requirements. 939 Another commenter,
KfW Bankengruppe (“KfW”), is also an instrumentality of the Federal Republic of Germany and
engages in “promotional lending opportunities.” 940 KfW indicated that it has in the past engaged
in a small number of security-based swap transactions but none recently. 941 Like FMS, KfW
argued that FPSFIs should not be subject to regulation as security-based swap dealers or major
security-based swap participants and did not otherwise comment on any issues specific to
Regulation SBSR. 942 A third commenter, the World Bank, stated that, “We do not object to
reporting of our transactions by U.S. counterparties or non-U.S. counterparties that are
independently required to be registered with the Commission. Our concern is limited to ensuring

938

KfW indicated, for example, that between 2009 and 2012 it engaged in only four new
trades to acquire credit protection, all in 2011; that the last time it had sold credit
protection was in 2009; and that as of 2012 the outstanding notional amount of the credit
protection it had purchased was zero. See id. at Annex A.

that non-U.S. counterparties that are otherwise not subject to regulation could become subject to
certain requirements solely because a transaction with us could be deemed to be a ‘Transaction
conducted within the United States.’ We are amenable to any solution that fixes this
problem.” 943 A fourth commenter agreed with the World Bank, arguing that the term
“transaction conducted within the United States,” which as proposed in the Cross-Border
Proposing Release would trigger the regulatory reporting requirement, should be modified to
exclude transactions with FPSPIs. 944
The Commission believes that a security-based swap to which an FPSFI is a counterparty
(“FPSFI trade”) should not, on that basis alone, be exempt from regulatory reporting. By the
same token, however, the Commission also believes that a security-based swap to which an
FPSFI is a counterparty—even if headquartered in the United States—should not, on that basis
alone, be subject to regulatory reporting. All FPSFIs, even FPSFIs that are based in the United
States, are deemed non-U.S. persons under the Commission’s Title VII rules. 945 As with any
other security-based swap transaction having a direct counterparty that is a non-U.S. person, a
transaction involving an FPSFI as a direct counterparty would be subject to Regulation SBSR’s
regulatory reporting requirements only if it met one of the conditions in Rule 908(a)(1). Thus, a

See Rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(iii) under the Exchange Act (specifically excluding from the term
“U.S. person” the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian
Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the United Nations, and their
agencies, affiliates, and pension plans, and any other similar international organizations,
their agencies, affiliates, and pension plans).

385

transaction between an FPSFI and a U.S. person would be subject to regulatory reporting. 946
However, a transaction between an FPSFI and a non-U.S. person would be subject to regulatory
reporting only if the non-U.S. person is a registered security-based swap dealer or a registered
major security-based swap participant or is guaranteed by a U.S. person, a registered securitybased swap dealer, or a registered major security-based swap participant. 947 As noted above, 948
the Commission has declined to adopt the term “transaction conducted within the United States,”
which was proposed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release. In the Conduct Re-Proposal, the
Commission anticipates soliciting additional comment on such transactions as they relate to
regulatory reporting and public dissemination under Regulation SBSR.
Regulatory reporting of FPSFI trades involving, on the other side, a U.S. person, a
registered security-based swap dealer, or a registered major security-based swap participant will
facilitate the Commission’s ability to carry out our regulatory oversight responsibilities with
respect to registered entities, U.S. persons, and the U.S. security-based swap market more
generally. The Commission notes that this approach was endorsed by the World Bank and
another commenter in response to the original Regulation SBSR Proposing Release. 949
Finally, the Commission does not believe that a sufficient basis exists to support an
exemption from public dissemination for FPSFI trades. The Commission is aware of no
characteristics of security-based swap transactions executed by FPSFIs that indicate that an

is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on either side of the transaction).

948

See supra Section XV(C)(3)(iv).

949

See CEB Letter at 4; World Bank Letter I at 7 (stating that, although swaps involving
FPSFIs as counterparties generally should be exempt from the definition of “swap,” they
should be treated as swaps solely for reporting purposes).

386

exemption from the public dissemination requirements of Regulation SBSR would be
appropriate. No commenters suggested that FPSFIs use security-based swaps differently from
other market participants or that publicly disseminating FPSFI trades would provide an
inaccurate view of the market. Moreover, based on the comments received, it appears that that
FPSFI participation in the security-based swap market—rather than the swap market generally—
is extremely limited. 950 Thus, if security-based swap activity consists of such a small portion of
FPSFI activities, it is less apparent that an exemption is warranted; the harm that would result
from disseminating security-based swap transactions—assuming such harm exists—would, all
other things being equal, be less the fewer such transactions there are. The Commission notes, in
any event, that Regulation SBSR contains provisions relating to public dissemination that are
designed to protect the identity of security-based swap counterparties 951 and prohibit a registered
SDR (with respect to uncleared security-based swaps) from disclosing the business transactions
and market positions of any person. 952 The Commission also notes that, during the interim phase
of Regulation SBSR, no transaction must be reported before 24 hours after execution. This
approach is designed to minimize any adverse market impact of publicly disseminating any
security-based swap transactions, when the Commission has not yet proposed and adopted block
trades thresholds and the associated dissemination delays for the benefit of all counterparties,
including FPSFIs. Given these potential protections for all security-based swap counterparties,
not just FPSFIs, the Commission does not at this time see a basis to exempt FPSFI trades from

B.

Foreign Privacy Laws Versus Duty to Report Counterparty IDs

Rule 901(d), as adopted, sets forth the data elements that must be reported to a registered
SDR for regulatory purposes. One such element is the “counterparty ID” of each counterparty,
which will enable the Commission to determine every person who is a counterparty, direct or
indirect, to a security-based swap. The Commission believes that it could be necessary to assess
the positions and trading activity of any counterparty in order to carry out its regulatory duties
for market oversight. 953 Since only one side of the transaction is required to report, the reporting
side is required to provide the counterparty ID of any counterparty on the other side. 954 Without
this requirement, the registered SDR would not have a record of the identity of the other side.
Some commenters cautioned that U.S. persons might be restricted from complying with

953

The Commission and other relevant authorities have a strong interest in being able to
monitor the risk exposures of U.S. persons, particularly those involved in the securitybased swap market, as the failure or financial distress of a U.S. person could impact other
U.S. persons and the U.S. economy as a whole. The Commission and other relevant
authorities also have an interest in obtaining information about non-U.S. counterparties
that enter into security-based swaps with U.S. persons, because the ability of such nonU.S. counterparties to perform their obligations under those security-based swaps could
impact the financial soundness of U.S. persons. See, e.g., S. Comm. on Banking, Hous.,
& Urban Affairs, The Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010, S. Rep. No.
111-176, at 32 (“As a key element of reducing systemic risk and protecting taxpayers in
the future, protections must include comprehensive regulation and rules for how the OTC
derivatives market operates. Increasing the use of central clearinghouses, exchanges,
appropriate margining, capital requirements, and reporting will provide safeguards for
American taxpayers and the financial system as a whole”) (emphasis added).

954

However, as described above in Section II(C)(3)(b), the reporting side might not know
the counterparty ID of a counterparty by the time it must report the transaction (e.g., if
the trade is to be allocated to a series of funds, and the fund manager has not yet
determined the allocation). In such case, the reporting side would know the identity of
the execution agent acting for the funds and thus would be required to report the
execution agent ID instead of the counterparty ID with the initial transaction report.

388

such a requirement in cases where a security-based swap is executed outside the United States. 955
One of these commenters stated, for example, that the London branch of a U.S. person would
need its counterparty’s consent to identify that party under U.K. law. 956 The commenter noted
that, in this case, the reporting party is located in a jurisdiction where applicable local law
restricts the reporting party from reporting the identity of a counterparty. The same commenter
added that, in a similar transaction executed by a Paris branch of a U.S. firm, French law requires
the branch to obtain the consent of the counterparty every time that it wants to report that
counterparty’s identity. 957 Another of these commenters urged the Commission to “consider
carefully and provide for consistency with, foreign privacy laws, some of which carry criminal
penalties for wrongful disclosure of information,” 958 but did not provide further detail. A third
commenter argued, without further explanation, that allowing substituted compliance when both
parties are not domiciled in the United States could avoid problems with foreign privacy laws
conflicting with U.S. reporting requirements. 959
955

See DTCC Letter II at 21; ISDA/SIFMA Letter I at 20. In addition, two comments on the
Commission’s interim final temporary rule on the reporting of security-based swaps
entered into before July 21, 2010, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 63094 (October
13, 2010), 75 FR 64643 (October 20, 2010), made similar points. See Deutsche Bank
Letter at 5 (“In some cases, dissemination or disclosure of [counterparty] information
could lead to severe civil or criminal penalties for those required to submit information to
an SDR pursuant to the Interim Final Rules. These concerns are particularly pronounced
because of the expectation that Reportable Swap data will be reported, on a counterparty
identifying basis, to SDRs, which will be non-governmental entities, and not directly to
the Commissions”); ISDA I at 6 (“In many cases, counterparties to cross-border securitybased swap transactions will face significant legal and reputational obstacles to the
reporting of such information. Indeed, disclosure of such information may lead to civil
penalties in some jurisdictions and even criminal sanctions in other jurisdictions”).

In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission stated that it sought to
understand more precisely if—and, if so, how—requiring a party to report the transaction
pursuant to Regulation SBSR (including disclosure of the other side’s identity to a registered
SDR) might cause it to violate local law in a foreign jurisdiction where it operates. Before
determining whether any exception to reporting the counterparty’s counterparty ID might be
necessary or appropriate, the Commission sought additional information about any such foreign
privacy laws and asked a number of questions about this issue. 960
In response to the questions, one commenter listed specific provisions in foreign laws that
would prevent the reporting side from identifying its foreign counterparty. 961 Another
commenter noted that reporting parties could face issues with identifying the counterparty if
“either (i) consent is required for disclosing trade data to the Commission and such consent has
not or cannot be obtained or (ii) a counterparty consent is not sufficient to overcome the data
privacy restrictions.” 962 This commenter requested that the Commission “recognize in
[Regulation SBSR] the necessity for reporting parties to redact/mask counterparty-identifying
information” if they reasonably believe that disclosure of such information may violate the laws
of another jurisdiction. 963 Commenters did not suggest any rule text for a possible exemption
from proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(i) or discuss the effects of granting substituted compliance on
avoiding foreign legal barriers to reporting.

Based on the comment received as well as other sources consulted, 964 the Commission
understands that some laws and regulations exist in foreign jurisdictions that may limit or
prevent reporting of counterparty ID to an SEC-registered SDR pursuant to Regulation SBSR.
These types of restrictions may include privacy laws, which generally restrict disclosure of
certain identifying information about a natural person or entity, 965 and so-called “blocking
statutes” (including secrecy laws) which typically prevent the disclosure of information relating
to third parties and/or foreign governments. 966 Several jurisdictions with possible legal and
regulatory barriers also have reported that they are in the process of modifying their legislation
and regulations to remove such barriers. 967 Therefore, it is difficult for the Commission to assess
the extent to which legal and regulatory barriers will continue to exist that would hinder the
ability of parties to meet the reporting requirement of Regulation SBSR.

965

The Commission understands that the privacy law limitations on disclosure of certain
identifying information related to natural persons or entities can usually (but not always)
be overcome by counterparty consent to such disclosure. Even where express consent
resolves any outstanding privacy law issues, obtaining consent from the necessary
counterparties may require market education and additional time to implement. See
ISDA CFTC Letter at 8.

966

The Commission understands that blocking statue barriers to reporting normally cannot
be waived by the person or entity that is the subject of the information, though the person
or entity may, in some circumstances, apply for an exemption to report certain
information. See id.

967

See ODWG Seventh Progress Report, supra note 965, at 10.

391

The Commission recognizes that security-based swap counterparties that will incur the
duty to report pre-enactment and transactional security-based swaps pursuant to Rule 901(i) may
have entered into some of those transactions with counterparties in jurisdictions that have
privacy laws or blocking statutes that may prohibit these reporting sides from disclosing the
identities of these foreign counterparties. At the time that these transactions were executed, there
was no regulatory requirement to report the identity of the counterparty under the United States
securities laws. Therefore, the Commission believes that it would be inappropriate to compel a
reporting side to disclose the identity of a counterparty to a historical security-based swap now, if
such disclosure would violate applicable foreign law and the reporting side could not reasonably
have foreseen a future conflict with applicable U.S. law. The Commission will consider requests
from reporting sides for exemptions, pursuant to Section 36 of the Exchange Act, 968 from the
requirement to report counterparty IDs of historical security-based swaps executed up to the last
day before the effective date of these final rules. Any such request should be filed pursuant to
Rule 0-12 under the Exchange Act 969 and include: (1) the name of the jurisdiction or
jurisdictions which the requester believes prohibit it from being able to carry out the duty under
Rule 901(i) of reporting the identity of a counterparty; and (2) a discussion of the laws of the
jurisdiction or jurisdictions that prohibit such reporting, and why compliance with the duty to
report the counterparty ID under Rule 901(i) is limited or prohibited. 970 Upon the effective date
of these final rules, every security-based swap counterparty that is the reporting side for one or

more security-based swaps will eventually have to report, among other things, the identity of
each of its counterparties. 971
C.

Antifraud Authority

The provisions of Regulation SBSR and the interpretive guidance discussed above relate
solely to the applicability of the security-based swap regulatory reporting and public
dissemination requirements under Title VII. Regulation SBSR does not limit the cross-border
reach of the antifraud provisions or other provisions of the federal securities laws that are not
addressed by this release. 972
In Section 929P(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, 973 Congress added provisions to the federal
securities laws confirming the Commission’s broad cross-border antifraud authority.
971

The rules adopted in this release will be effective 60 days after publication in the Federal
Register. For Rules 900, 907, and 909, the compliance date is the same as the effective
date. The Commission is proposing a new compliance schedule for Rules 901, 902, 903,
904, 905, 906, and 908 of Regulation SBSR. See Regulation SBSR Proposed
Amendments Release, Section VII. Market participants will not have to comply with the
requirements in those rules—such as the requirement in Rule 901(i) to report historical
security-based swaps—until certain dates that will be specified when the Commission
takes final action on the proposed compliance schedule.

972

For example, security-based swaps, as securities, are subject to the provisions of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to securities. The
Securities Act requires that any offer and sale of a security must either be registered
under the Securities Act, see Section 5 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77e, or made
pursuant to an exemption from registration, see, e.g., Sections 3 and 4 of the Securities
Act, 15 U.S.C. 77c and 77d. In addition, the Securities Act requires that any offer to sell,
offer to buy or purchase, or sale of a security-based swap to any person who is not an
eligible contract participant must be registered under the Securities Act. See Section 5(e)
of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77e(e). Because of the statutory language of Section
5(e), exemptions from this requirement in Sections 3 and 4 of the Securities Act are not
available.

973

The antifraud provisions of the securities laws include Section 17(a) of the Securities Act,
15 U.S.C. 77q(a); Sections 9, 10(b), 14(e), and 15(c)(1)-(2) and (7) of the Exchange Act,
15 U.S.C. 78i, 78j, 78n, 78o(c)(1)-(2); Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of
1940, 15 U.S.C. 80b-6; and any rule or regulation of the Commission promulgated under
these statutory provisions.

In the Cross-Border Adopting Release, the Commission adopted Rule 250.1 under the
Exchange Act, 974 which sets forth the Commission’s interpretation of its cross-border
authority. 975 Rule 250.1(a) provides that the antifraud provisions of the securities laws apply to:
“(1) Conduct within the United States that constitutes significant steps in furtherance of the
violation; or (2) Conduct occurring outside the United States that has a foreseeable substantial
effect within the United States.” Nothing in this Regulation SBSR limits the broad cross-border
application of the anti-fraud provisions as set forth in Rule 250.1.

International Coordination Generally

Several commenters urged the Commission to coordinate their efforts to implement Title
VII requirements with those of foreign regulators who also are imposing new requirements on
the OTC derivatives markets. 976 For example, one commenter urged the SEC and CFTC “to
harmonize their real-time reporting regimes with each other and with those of comparable
international regulators.” 977 Similarly, a second commenter stated that the SEC and CFTC
“should work with foreign regulators that plan to create their own real-time reporting regimes to
harmonize their requirements regarding the timing of dissemination and the data to be

establishing a globally harmonized approach to creating [LEIs].” 979 Other commenters believed
generally that global coordination is necessary to develop LEIs and other identification codes. 980
The Commission agrees broadly with these commenters that international coordination
will be helpful in developing robust and efficient regimes for regulating cross-border securitybased swap activity and overseeing the security-based swap market. The Commission is
cognizant of its duty under Section 752(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act 981 and remains committed to
engaging in bilateral and multilateral discussions with foreign regulatory authorities to carry out
this goal. The Commission staff has consulted and coordinated with the CFTC, prudential
regulators, 982 and foreign regulatory authorities consistent with the consultation provisions of the
Dodd-Frank Act, 983 and more generally as part of its domestic and international coordination
efforts. The Commission staff has participated in numerous bilateral and multilateral discussions

The term “prudential regulator” is defined in Section 1a(39) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 1a(39),
and that definition is incorporated by reference in Section 3(a)(74) of the Exchange Act,

these discussions and the Commission’s participation in various international task forces and
working groups, it has gathered information about foreign regulatory reform efforts and
discussed the possibility of conflicts and gaps, as well as inconsistencies and duplications,
between U.S. and foreign regulatory regimes. The Commission has taken and will continue to
take these discussions into consideration in developing rules, forms, and interpretations for
implementing Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act.
XVII. Rule 909—SIP Registration
Section 3(a)(22)(A) of the Exchange Act 985 defines a SIP as “any person engaged in the
business of (i) collecting, processing, or preparing for distribution or publication, or assisting,
participating in, or coordinating the distribution or publication of, information with respect to

984

Senior representatives of OTC derivatives market regulators from G20 jurisdictions have
met on a number of occasions to discuss international coordination of OTC derivatives
regulations, including as part of the OTC Derivatives Regulators Group. See, e.g.,
Report of the OTC Derivatives Regulators Group on Cross-Border Implementation Issues
(March 2014), available at
https://www.g20.org/sites/default/files/g20_resources/library/Report%20of%20the%20O

Derivatives Market (December 4, 2012), available at

2014. The Commission participates in the FSB’s Working Group on OTC Derivatives
Regulation (“ODWG”), both on its own behalf and as the representative of the
International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”), which is co-chair of
the ODWG. The Commission also serves as one of the co-chairs of the IOSCO Task
Force on OTC Derivatives Regulation.

transactions in or quotations for any security (other than an exempted security) or (ii) distributing
or publishing (whether by means of a ticker tape, a communications network, a terminal display
device, or otherwise) on a current and continuing basis, information with respect to such
transactions or quotations.” Security-based swaps are securities under the Exchange Act. 986
Because Regulation SBSR requires registered SDRs to collect security-based swap transaction
reports from participants and to distribute data from such reports, registered SDRs will be SIPs
for purposes of the Exchange Act.
Section 11A(c)(1) of the Exchange Act 987 provides that the Commission may prescribe
rules requiring SIPs to, among other things, assure “the fairness and usefulness of the form and
content” 988 of the information that they disseminate, and to assure that “all other persons may
obtain on terms which are not unreasonably discriminatory” the transaction information
published or distributed by SIPs. 989 Section 11A(c)(1) applies regardless of whether a SIP is
registered with the Commission as such.
The provisions of Section 11A(b)(5) and11A(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, however, apply
only to registered SIPs. Requiring a registered SDR to register with the Commission as a SIP
would subject that entity to Section 11A(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, 990 which requires a
registered SIP to notify the Commission whenever it prohibits or limits any person’s access to its
services. Upon its own motion or upon application by any aggrieved person, the Commission

could review the registered SIP’s action. 991 If the Commission finds that the person has been
discriminated against unfairly, it could require the SIP to provide access to that person. 992
Section 11A(b)(6) of the Exchange Act also authorizes the Commission to take certain
regulatory action as may be necessary or appropriate against a registered SIP. 993
Section 11A(b)(1) of the Exchange Act 994 provides that a SIP not acting as the “exclusive
processor” 995 of any information with respect to quotations for or transactions in securities is
exempt from the requirement to register with the Commission as a SIP unless the Commission,
by rule or order, determines that the registration of such SIP “is necessary or appropriate in the
public interest, for the protection of investors, or for the achievement of the purposes of [Section
11A].” An SDR does not engage on an exclusive basis on behalf of any national securities
exchange or registered securities association in collecting, processing, or preparing for

Commission finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such
censure, placing of limitations, suspension, or revocation is in the public interest,
necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors or to assure the prompt, accurate,
or reliable performance of the functions of such SIP, and that such SIP has violated or is
unable to comply with any provision of this title or the rules or regulations thereunder).

engages on an exclusive basis on its own behalf, in collecting, processing, or preparing
for distribution or publication any information with respect to (1) transactions or
quotations on or effected or made by means of any facility of such exchange or (2)
quotations distributed or published by means of any electronic system operated or
controlled by such association).

398

distribution or publication any information with respect to transactions or quotations in
securities; therefore, an SDR does not fall under the statutory definition of “exclusive processor.”
To subject an SDR to the requirements of Sections 11A(b)(5) and 11A(b)(6), the
Commission would need, by rule or order, to make the determination under Section 11A(b)(1)
noted above. Accordingly, the Commission proposed Rule 909 to require a registered SDR also
to register with the Commission as a SIP on existing Form SIP. The Commission requested
comment on this proposed requirement, and whether it should combine Form SIP and Form SDR
to create a joint registration form. In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission reproposed Rule 909 without revision.
The Commission believes that requiring registered SDRs to register as SIPs will help to
ensure fair access to important security-based swap transaction data reported to and publicly
disseminated by them. The Commission believes that the additional authority over a registered
SDR/SIP provided by Sections 11A(b)(5) and 11A(b)(6) of the Exchange Act will ensure that
these entities offer security-based swap market data on terms that are fair and reasonable and not
unreasonably discriminatory. Therefore, the Commission believes that registering SDRs as SIPs
is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or for the
achievement of the purposes of Section 11A of the Exchange Act. Section 11A of the Exchange
Act establishes broad goals for the development of the securities markets and charges the
Commission with establishing rules and policies that are designed to further these objectives.
Section 11A(a) states, among other things, that it is in the public interest and appropriate for the
protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets to assure economically
efficient execution of securities transactions; the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of
information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities; and an opportunity for

399

investors’ orders to be executed without the participation of a dealer. Requiring registered SDRs
also to register with the Commission as SIPs is designed to help achieve these objectives in the
still-developing security-based swap market.
One commenter stated that, because of the duplicative nature of the information required
by Form SDR and Form SIP, the Commission should combine the two forms so that an SDR
could register as both an SDR and a SIP using only one form. 996 As an alternative, the
commenter suggested that an SDR be permitted to use either Form SDR or Form SIP to register
as both an SDR and a SIP. 997
Rule 909, as re-proposed, stated that “[a] registered security-based swap data repository
shall also register with the Commission as a securities information processor on Form SIP.” For
reasons discussed in the SDR Adopting Release, the Commission agrees that Form SDR should
be revised to accommodate SIP registration. 998 Accordingly, Rule 909, as adopted, eliminates
the reference to Form SIP and states instead that “[a] registered security-based swap data
repository shall also register with the Commission as a securities information processor on Form
SDR.” There are no filing requirements in addition to the Form SDR for a person to register as
both a SIP and an SDR.

See DTCC III at 9.

997

See id.

998

See SDR Adopting Release, Section VI(A)(1)(c). Form SDR is being adopted by the
Commission as part of the SDR Adopting Release. Form SDR will be used by SIPs that
also register as SDRs. Form SIP will continue to be used by applicants for registration as
SIPs not seeking to become dually registered as an SDR and a SIP, and for amendments
by registered SIPs that are not dually registered as an SDR and a SIP.

XVIII. Constitutional Questions About Reporting and Public Dissemination
One commenter argued that the reporting and dissemination requirements of Regulation
SBSR could violate the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution by compelling “noncommercial speech” without satisfying a strict scrutiny standard and by “taking” transaction
and/or holding data without just compensation. 999
As a preliminary matter, the Commission presumes “that Congress acted constitutionally
when it passed the statute.” 1000 Furthermore, the Commission has carefully considered the
commenter’s arguments and pertinent judicial precedent, and believes that the commenter does
not raise any issue that would preclude the Commission’s adoption of Regulation SBSR’s
regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements substantially as proposed and reproposed. The Commission does not believe that the public dissemination requirements of
Regulation SBSR violate the First Amendment. Under the federal securities laws, the
Commission imposes a number of requirements that compel the provision of information to the
Commission itself or to the public. The Supreme Court has suggested that only limited scrutiny
under the First Amendment applies to securities regulation, and that the government permissibly
regulates “public expression by issuers of and dealers in securities.” 1001 And in other contexts,
999

See Viola Letter at 3-4.

See Nebraska v. EPA, 331 F.3d 995, 997 (DC Cir. 2003) (“Agencies do not ordinarily

(6th Cir. 1943) (same); William J. Haberman, 53 SE.C. 1024, 1029 note14 (1998) (“[W]e
have no power to invalidate the very statutes that Congress has directed us to enforce.”)
(citing Milton J. Wallace, 45 SE.C. 694, 697 (1975); Walston & Co., 5 SE.C. 112, 113
(1939)).

1001

See, e.g., Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 64 (1973) (stating also that the
First Amendment does not “preclude[] States from having ‘blue sky’ laws to regulate
what sellers of securities may write or publish...”). See also S.E.C. v. Wall St. Pub. Inst.,
Inc., 851 F.2d 365, 373 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (“Speech relating to the purchase and sale of
401

the required disclosure of purely factual and uncontroversial information has also been subjected
to only limited First Amendment scrutiny. 1002
Nor does the Commission believe that public dissemination requirements of Regulation
SBSR violate the Fifth Amendment. To constitute a regulatory taking, the government action
must (1) affect a property interest, and (2) go “too far” in so doing. 1003 The Supreme Court has
identified several factors to be considered in determining whether the government action goes
too far, such as “the character of the governmental action, its economic impact, and its
interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations.” 1004 The requirements at issue
here directly advance the government’s legitimate interest in enhancing price discovery by,
among other things, reducing information asymmetries, enhancing transparency, and improving
confidence in the market. The character of the government action, therefore, weighs against
Rule 902(a) being a taking. The Commission further believes that the regulatory reporting and
public dissemination requirements of Regulation SBSR do not impose an unconstitutional
economic impact 1005 or interfere with reasonable investment-backed expectations. Regulation
SBSR does not interfere with market participants’ reasonable investment-backed expectations

securities…forms a distinct category of communications” in which “the government’s
power to regulate [speech about securities] is at least as broad as with respect to the
general rubric of commercial speech”).

402

because the financial markets are an industry with a long tradition of regulation focused on
promoting disclosure of information to investors. Businesses that operate in an industry with a
history of regulation have no reasonable expectation that regulation will not be strengthened to
achieve established legislative ends. 1006 Although security-based swaps did not become
securities and thus did not become fully subject to the regulatory regime for securities regulation
until after passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission believes that the economic similarity
of markets in securities and security-based swaps strongly suggests that market participants
could have anticipated regulation at a future date. Furthermore, the Commission believes that
the commenter has provided no argument to support the proposition that the mere fact that
security-based swaps were not fully subject to the Exchange Act until passage of the Dodd-Frank
Act necessarily implies that it was unconstitutional for Congress to amend the Exchange Act to
cover these securities.
XIX. What Happens If There Are Multiple SDRs?
The provisions of Title VII that amended the Exchange Act to require the registration of
security-based swap data repositories do not require that there be only a single SDR; in fact,
these provisions contemplate that there could be multiple SDRs registered with the

1006

District Intown Properties Ltd. P’ship v. District of Columbia, 198 F.3d 874, 884 (D.C.
Cir. 1999); see also Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1008-09 (1984) (finding
no reasonable investment-backed expectations because “the possibility was substantial”
in an industry long “the focus of great public concern and significant government
regulation” that Congress “would find disclosure to be in the public interest”); Maine
Educ. Ass’n Benefits Trust v. Cioppa, 695 F.3d 154-156 (1st Cir. 2012) (finding no
reasonable investment-backed expectations because the Maine legislature’s “continued
expansion of this right of access” to information about insurance plans to a type of plan
not covered by previous statutes providing a right of access was “reasonably foreseeable”
in light of “the historically heavy and continuous regulation of insurance in Maine”).

403

Commission.1007 Therefore, no provision of Regulation SBSR, as adopted, is designed to require
or promote the use of only a single SDR. The Commission believes, however, that it must
consider how the Title VII goals of monitoring and reducing systemic risk and promoting
transparency in the security-based swap market will be achieved if there are multiple registered
SDRs.
One commenter believed that a diverse range of options for reporting security-based
swap data would benefit the market and market participants. 1008 However, other commenters
raised various concerns with having multiple registered SDRs. Two commenters recommended
that the Commission designate a single registered SDR per asset class. 1009 Similarly, a third
commenter stated that “the Commission should consider designating one [registered SDR] per
SBS asset class to act as the industry consolidator of SBS data for the Commission and for the
purpose of public reporting.” 1010 This commenter also recommended that all life cycle events be
reported to the same registered SDR that received the original transaction report and that
registered SDRs be required to accept all security-based swaps in an asset class to further reduce
fragmentation of data across multiple SDRs.
1007

See Section 13(n) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m.

1008

See MFA Letter at 6.

1009

See ISDA I at 4; ISDA/SIFMA I at 9, note 12 (noting that, with a single SDR, there
would be no redundancy of platforms, no need for additional levels of data aggregation
for each asset class, reduced risk of errors, and greater transparency).

1010

MarkitSERV I at 8. The commenter also urged the Commission to “ensure that there is
consistency between the fields that different SBS SDRs in the same asset class would
collect and report in order to lay the foundation for the data to be consolidatable.” Id.
See also DTCC IX at 3. See supra Section II(B)(2) for discussion of the Commission’s
approach to ensure consistency. Another commenter also noted that “if there is more than
one registered SDR for an asset class, it may prove difficult for the Commission to ensure
that all registered SDRs calculate the same block thresholds for the same SBS
instruments.” WMBAA II at 4. As discussed in more detail above in Section VII, the
Commission is not yet adopting or proposing block trade rules.

404

Another commenter warned of the risks of security-based swaps being reported to
multiple SDRs, stating that, “[u]nless data fragmentation can be avoided, the primary lessons of
the 2008 financial crisis, as related to OTC derivatives trading, will not have been realistically or
adequately taken into account.” 1011 This commenter noted the “large one-way trades put on by
AIG in mortgage related credit derivatives” and stated that “if AIG had chosen to try to hide [its]
trades by reporting to multiple repositories, these systemically risky positions would not have
been discovered absent a ‘super repository’ that aggregated the trade level data of the various
reporting repositories in a manner as to detect the large one-way aggregate positions.” 1012 The
same commenter stated in a subsequent comment letter that, if there are multiple registered
SDRs, the “Commission should take such action as is necessary to eliminate any overstatements
of open interest or other inaccuracies that may result from having broader market data published
from separate SDRs.” 1013 One option suggested by this commenter was utilizing Section
13(n)(5)(D)(i) of the Exchange Act, 1014 which requires an SDR to “provide direct electronic
access to the Commission (or any designee of the Commission, including another registered
entity).” The commenter explained that, using this authority, “the Commission could designate
one [SDR] as the recipient of information from other [SDRs] in order to have consolidation and
direct electronic access for the Commission.” 1015

Four commenters urged the Commission to mandate the consolidation of publicly
disseminated security-based swap data. 1016 One of these commenters stated that “in order to
most effectively increase transparency in the swaps markets, it will be important for the real-time
swaps data to be available on a consolidated basis.” 1017 The second commenter believed that a
central consolidator or the Commission must have the authority to compel all participants,
including registered SDRs, to submit data to assure that there is a single, comprehensive, and
accurate source for security-based swap data. 1018 A third commenter, citing the regime for
producing consolidated public information in the U.S. equity markets, stated that “there is no
obvious reason why a similar regime could not succeed for security-based swaps.” 1019 In
addition, this commenter believed that “the ideal approach would be collaboration by the SEC
and the CFTC to create (or facilitate the direct creation of) a single, central system that performs
these data dissemination functions.” 1020 The fourth commenter cautioned that the failure to make
real-time data available on a consolidated basis would especially disadvantage less frequent and
smaller users of the transaction data, who would not be able to obtain an accurate view of market
activity because of the cost and complexity of accessing multiple data sources. 1021

swap transaction data would help to assure uniformity, thereby promoting market
integrity and investor protection).

1019

Better Markets II at 6. However, the commenter cautioned that the security-based swap
data dissemination regime must avoid the direct data feeds that have developed in the
equity markets because these data feeds allow “high-frequency traders to bypass the
aggregation and dissemination procedure, at the expense of retail and other investors.”

The Commission shares the concerns of these commenters. The regulatory goals
underpinning the Title VII requirements for regulatory reporting and public dissemination of
security-based swap transaction information could be frustrated if the information cannot be
easily aggregated and normalized. The Commission notes, however, that the statutory provisions
allow for the possibility of multiple SDRs.1022 The Commission therefore seeks to develop a
regulatory framework that would accommodate multiple SDRs, but mitigates the undesirable
fragmentation of regulatory data that would come from incompatible data standards.
At the same time, the Commission generally agrees with the commenter who stated that
the “Commission should take such action as is necessary to eliminate any overstatements of open
interest or other inaccuracies that may result from having broader market data published from
separate SDRs.” 1023 The requirement that all life cycle events must be reported to the same
registered SDR that received the report of the initial transaction is designed to minimize some
potential problems of having multiple registered SDRs, such as overstating open interest.
Although the reporting side can choose the registered SDR to which to report the initial
transaction, all subsequent life cycle events must then be reported to that registered SDR. The
Commission believes that this requirement will facilitate its ability to track security-based swaps
over their duration and minimize instances of double counting the same economic activity, which

1022

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated that requiring
registered SDRs to be the registered entities with the duty to disseminate security-based
swap transaction information—rather than, for example, SB SEFs, clearing agencies, or
the counterparties themselves—would produce some degree of mandated consolidation
of that information and help to provide consistency in the form of the reported
information. See 75 FR at 75227. However, the Commission acknowledges that this
approach cannot guarantee consolidation of the published data because of the possibility
of multiple registered SDRs.

could occur if the records of life cycle event reports did not indicate their relationship to earlier
occurring transactions. 1024
Similarly, the Commission is adopting Rules 902(c)(4) and 907(a)(4) to address potential
issues arising from non-mandatory reports (which could include duplicate reports of transactions
reported to a second SDR when a mandatory report has already been provided to a first SDR).
Rule 902(c)(4) prohibits a registered SDR from publicly disseminating a report of a nonmandatory transaction; this requirement is designed to prevent market observers from overestimating the true amount of market activity, which could occur if the same transaction was
disseminated by two SDRs. Rule 907(a)(4) requires registered SDRs to establish and maintain
policies and procedures, among other things, for how participants must identify non-mandatory
reports to the SDR, so that the SDR will be able to avoid publicly disseminating them.
The Commission believes that problems associated with the existence of multiple
registered SDRs can be minimized to the extent that such SDRs refer to the same persons or
things in the same manner. Thus, final Rule 903 provides that, if an IRSS that meets certain
criteria is recognized by the Commission and has assigned a UIC to a person, unit of a person, or
product, all registered SDRs must use that UIC in carrying out their responsibilities under
Regulation SBSR. As discussed in Section X(B)(2), supra, the Commission has recognized the
GLEIS—through which LEIs can be obtained—as an IRSS that meets the criteria of Rule 903.
Therefore, if an entity has an LEI issued by or through the GLEIS, that LEI must be used for all
purposes under Regulation SBSR. Furthermore, Rule 903(a)—in connection with the
Commission’s recognition of the GLEIS—requires all persons who are participants of at least
1024

Thus, the Commission concurs with the commenter who recommended that all life cycle
events be reported to the same registered SDR that received the original transaction
report. See MarkitSERV I at 8.

408

one registered SDR to obtain an LEI from or through the GLEIS for use under Regulation SBSR,
and each participant that acts as a guarantor of a direct counterparty’s performance of any
obligation under a security-based swap that is subject to Rule 908(a) shall, if the direct
counterparty has not already done so, obtain a UIC for identifying the direct counterparty from or
through that system, if that system permits third-party registration without a requirement to
obtain prior permission of the direct counterparty.
The Commission is particularly hopeful that a robust system for product IDs could
greatly improve the usability of security-based swap data, both for regulators and for market
observers that obtain publicly disseminated transaction information. The product ID could
minimize administrative burdens by rendering unnecessary the separate reporting of several data
elements. Product IDs also should more easily distinguish standardized from non-standardized
products and, thus, should facilitate aggregation of the public feeds issued from different
registered SDRs.
The Commission did not propose to take any specific actions towards consolidation of
the security-based swap data disseminated by different registered SDRs. As the Commission
stated in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, it considered mandating one consolidated
reporting entity to disseminate all security-based swap transaction data for each asset class by
requiring each registered SDR in an asset class to provide all of its security-based swap data to a
“central processor” that would also be a registered SDR. 1025 The Commission noted that there is
substantial precedent for this approach in the equity markets, where market participants may
access a consolidated quote for national markets system securities and a consolidated tape

1025

See 75 FR at 75227.

409

reporting executed transactions. The Commission stated, however, that such approach “may not
be warranted given the present [security-based swap] market structure.” 1026
The Commission continues to believe there is no need at this time to require
consolidation of the publicly disseminated security-based swap data. 1027 Although it is likely
that there will be multiple registered SDRs, it is unclear at present the extent to which each will
be publicly disseminating a significant number of transactions. 1028 Furthermore, the
Commission currently believes that, to the extent that there are different SDR data feeds that
warrant consolidation and that such feeds cannot readily be aggregated by market observers
themselves, certain market data vendors may be able to do so for commercially reasonable fees.
As different SDRs register with the Commission and these SDRs implement Regulation SBSR,
the Commission will monitor the situation and consider taking such action as it deems necessary
in order to better carry about the Title VII policy of promoting greater transparency in the
security-based swap market.
The Commission also acknowledges the recommendation made by one commenter to use
Section 13(n)(5)(D)(i) of the Exchange Act to direct all regulatory reports received by multiple

1026

Id.

1027

In response to the commenter who recommended requiring registered SDRs to accept all
security-based swaps in an asset class to reduce fragmentation of data, the Commission
notes that Rule 13n-5(b)(1)(ii) under the Exchange Act, adopted as part of the SDR
Adopting Release, requires an SDR that accepts reports for any security-based swap in a
particular asset class to accept reports for all security-based swaps in that asset class that
are reported to the SDR in accordance with that SDR’s policies and procedures.

1028

The Commission notes that, under Rule 902(c)(6), most clearing transactions will not be
publicly disseminated. Therefore, to the extent that a registered SDR receives only
clearing transactions, it would likely be required to publicly disseminate few if any
security-based swap transactions.

410

registered SDRs into a single “aggregator” SDR. 1029 The Commission believes that Rule
13n-4(b)(5), as adopted, 1030 helps to address these concerns. Rule 13n-4(b)(5) requires an SDR
to provide the Commission with direct electronic access to the data stored by the SDR. As stated
in the SDR Adopting Release:
data [provided by an SDR to the Commission] must be in a form and manner
acceptable to the Commission …[T]he form and manner with which an SDR
provides the data to the Commission should not only permit the Commission to
accurately analyze the data maintained by a single SDR, but also allow the
Commission to aggregate and analyze data received from multiple SDRs. 1031
Thus, the Commission does not believe that it is necessary or appropriate at this time to direct
registered SDRs to provide their transaction data to a single “aggregator” SDR, because the SDR
rules are designed to facilitate the Commission’s ability to aggregate information directly. As
registered SDRs and their participants develop experience with the Regulation SBSR reporting
regime and the Commission develops experience with overseeing that regime, the Commission
may consider re-evaluating the need for or the desirability of an aggregator SDR in the future.
1029

See DTCC I at 7 (“Under Section 13 of the Exchange Act . . . security-based swap data
repositories shall ‘provide direct electronic access to the Commission (or any designee of
the Commission, including another registered entity.’ Under this authority, the
Commission could designate one security-based swap data repository as the recipient of
information from other security based-swap data repositories in order to have
consolidation and direct access for the Commission”) (citation omitted).

1030

See SDR Adopting Release, Section VI(D)(2)(c)(ii).

1031

See id. The SDR Adopting Release states, further, that “[t]he Commission recognizes
that as the [security-based swap] market develops, new or different data fields may be
needed to accurately represent new types of [security-based swap data], in which case the
Commission may provide updated specifications of formats and taxonomies to reflect
these new developments. Therefore, the Commission intends to publish guidance, as
appropriate, on the form and manner that will be acceptable to it for the purposes of
direct electronic access” (internal citations omitted).

XX.

Section 31 Fees
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 1032 the Commission also proposed certain

amendments to Rule 31 under the Exchange Act, 1033 which governs the calculation and
collection of fees and assessments owed by self-regulatory organizations to the Commission
pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. 1034
Section 991 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended Section 31(e)(2) of the Exchange Act to
provide that certain fees and assessments required under Section 31 will be required to be paid
by September 25, rather than September 30. 1035 Therefore, the Commission proposed to make a
corresponding change to the definition of “due date” in Rule 31(a)(10)(ii) under the Exchange
Act 1036 by replacing a reference to “September 30” with a reference to “September 25.”
The Commission also proposed to exempt security-based swap transactions from the
application of Section 31 transaction fees. Section 31(c) of the Exchange Act 1037 requires a
national securities association to pay fees based on the “aggregate dollar amount of sales
transacted by or through any member of such association otherwise than on a national securities
exchange of securities . . . registered on a national securities exchange or subject to prompt last
sale reporting pursuant to the rules of the Commission or a registered national securities

association.” Pursuant to Section 761(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, 1038 security-based swaps are
securities. 1039 Accordingly, when security-based swap transactions become subject to prompt
last-sale reporting pursuant to the rules of the Commission, the members of a national securities
association that effect sales of security-based swaps other than on an exchange would become
liable for Section 31 fees for any such sales. 1040 Because of certain potential difficulties in fairly
and evenly applying Section 31 fees for sales of security-based swaps, 1041 the Commission
proposed to exercise its authority under Section 31(f) of the Exchange Act 1042 to exempt all such
sales from the application of Section 31 fees. To carry out that objective, the Commission
proposed to add a new subparagraph (ix) to Rule 31(a)(11), which defines the term “exempt
sale,” to include as an exempt sale “[a]ny sale of a security-based swap.” The Commission also
proposed to add a new paragraph (19) to Rule 31(a) to provide a definition for the term
“security-based swap.”
One commenter submitted two comment letters on this aspect of the proposal relating to
Rule 31. 1043

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(10).

regulation of markets and brokers and dealers, and the development of a national market
system.”).

transactions conducted on OneChicago are economically similar to security-based swap
transactions, EFP transactions also should be exempt from Section 31 fees or,

The Commission is not adopting these proposed revisions to Rule 31(a). As discussed
above, the Commission is not yet requiring that security-based swap transactions be publicly
disseminated in real time. Because security-based swaps are not yet subject to prompt last-sale
reporting pursuant to the rules of the Commission or a national securities association, 1044 sales of
security-based swaps are not yet subject to Section 31 fees. In the future, the Commission
anticipates soliciting public comment on block thresholds and the timeframe in which non-block
security-based swap transactions must be publicly disseminated. At such time, when
implementation of prompt last-sale public dissemination of security-based swap transactions
would subject them to Section 31 fees, the Commission can revisit whether to adopt the proposed
exemption for security-based swaps from Section 31 fees.
XXI. Paperwork Reduction Act
Certain provisions of Regulation SBSR contain “collection of information requirements”
within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). 1045 The Commission
published notices requesting comment on the collection of information requirements relating to
Regulation SBSR, as originally proposed, in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release 1046 and, as
re-proposed, in the Cross-Border Proposing Release 1047 and submitted relevant information to

information requirements is mandatory. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is
not required to respond to, a collection of information unless the agency displays a currently
valid control number.
The Commission is adopting Regulation SBSR, which contains these 12 collections of
information, largely as re-proposed, with certain revisions suggested by commenters or designed
to clarify the rules. 1049 The rules, as adopted, establish a “reporting hierarchy” that specifies the
side that has the duty to report a security-based swap that is a covered transaction 1050 and
provides for public dissemination of security-based swap transaction information (except as
1048

44 U.S.C. 3507; 5 CFR 1320.11.

1049

In addition, the Commission, in separate releases, is adopting rules relating to SDR
registration, duties, and core principles and proposing amendments to Regulation SBSR.

provided in Rule 902(c)). Registered SDRs are required to establish and maintain certain
policies and procedures regarding how transaction data are reported and disseminated, and
participants of registered SDRs that are registered security-based swap dealers or registered
major security-based swap participants are required to establish and maintain policies and
procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that they comply with applicable reporting
obligations. Regulation SBSR also requires a person that registers with the Commission as an
SDR also to register with the Commission as a SIP.
The hours and costs associated with complying with Regulation SBSR constitute
reporting and cost burdens imposed by each collection of information. Certain estimates (e.g.,
the number of reporting sides, the number of non-reporting sides, the number of participants, and
the number of reportable events 1051 pertaining to a security-based swap transaction) contained in
the Commission’s earlier PRA assessments have been updated to reflect the rule text of
Regulation SBSR, as adopted, as well as additional information and data now available to the
Commission, as discussed in further detail below. The Commission believes that the
methodology used for calculating the re-proposed paperwork burdens set forth in the CrossBorder Proposing Release is appropriate and has received no comments to the contrary. The
revised paperwork burdens estimated by the Commission herein are consistent with those made
in connection with the re-proposal of Regulation SBSR, which was included in the Cross-Border
Proposing Release. However, as described in more detail below, certain estimates have been
modified, as necessary, to conform to the adopted rules and to reflect the most recent data
available to the Commission.
1051

A reportable event includes both an initial security-based swap transaction, required to be
reported pursuant to Rule 901(a), as well as a life cycle event, the reporting of which is
governed by Rule 901(e).

416

The Commission requested comment on the collection of information requirements
included in both the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release and the Cross-Border Proposing
Release. As noted above, the Commission received 86 comment letters on the Regulation SBSR
Proposing Release and six comment letters on the Cross-Border Proposing Release that
specifically referenced Regulation SBSR. Although the comment letters did not specifically
address the Commission’s estimates for the proposed collection of information requirements,
views of commenters relevant to the Commission’s analysis of burdens, costs, and benefits of
Regulation SBSR are discussed below.
The rules containing these specific collections of information are discussed further below.
A.

Definitions—Rule 900

Rule 900 sets forth definitions of various terms used in Regulation SBSR. In the
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated its belief that Rule 900, since it
contains only definitions of relevant terms, would not be a “collection of information” within the
meaning of the PRA. 1052 Although Rule 900, as adopted, contains revisions to re-proposed Rule
900, including additions and deletions of certain defined terms and modification of others, the
Commission continues to believe that Rule 900 does not constitute a “collection of information”
within the meaning of the PRA.
B.

Reporting Obligations—Rule 901

Rule 901, as adopted, sets forth various requirements relating to the reporting of covered
transactions. Rule 901 of Regulation SBSR, as adopted, contains “collection of information
requirements” within the meaning of the PRA. The title of this collection is “Rule 901—
Reporting Obligations.”
1052

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75246.

417

1.

Summary of Collection of Information

Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Exchange Act to require the reporting of
security-based swap transactions. Accordingly, the Commission is adopting Rule 901 under the
Exchange Act to implement this requirement. Rule 901 specifies, with respect to each reportable
event pertaining to covered transactions, who is required to report, what data must be reported,
when it must be reported, where it must be reported, and how it must be reported. Rule 901(a),
as adopted, establishes a “reporting hierarchy” that specifies the side that has the duty to report a
security-based swap that is a covered transaction. 1053 The reporting side, as determined by the
reporting hierarchy, is required to submit the information required by Regulation SBSR to a
registered SDR. The reporting side may select the registered SDR to which it makes the required
report.
Pursuant to Rule 901(b), as adopted, if there is no registered SDR that will accept the
report required by Rule 901(a), the person required to make the report must report the transaction
to the Commission. Rule 901(c) sets forth the primary trade information and Rule 901(d) sets
forth the secondary trade information that must be reported. Under the final rules, covered
transactions—regardless of their notional amount—must be reported to a registered SDR at any
point up to 24 hours after the time of execution, or, in the case of a security-based swap that is
subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination solely by operation of Rule
908(a)(1)(ii), within 24 hours after the time of acceptance for clearing. 1054 Except as required by

1053

See supra notes 11-12 and accompanying text.

1054

See supra Section VII(B)(1) (discussing Rule 901(j) and the rationale for 24-hour
reporting timeframe). In addition, as discussed in more detail in Section VII(B), supra, if
24 hours after the time of execution would fall on a non-business day (i.e., a Saturday,
Sunday, or U.S. federal holiday), reporting would be required by the same time on the
next business day. As discussed in Section XV(C)(4), supra, Rule 908(a)(1)(ii), as
418

Rule 902(c), the information reported pursuant to Rule 901(c) must be publicly disseminated.
Information reported pursuant to Rule 901(d) is for regulatory purposes only and will not be
publicly disseminated.
Rule 901(e) requires the reporting of life cycle events, and adjustments due to life cycle
events, within 24 hours of the time of occurrence, to the entity to which the original transaction
was reported. The report must contain the transaction ID of the original transaction.
In addition to the reporting duties that reporting sides incur under Rule 901, Rule 901
also imposes certain duties on a registered SDR that receives security-based swap transaction
data. Rule 901(f) requires a registered SDR to timestamp, to the second, any information
submitted to it pursuant to Rule 901, and Rule 901(g) requires a registered SDR to assign a
transaction ID to each security-based swap, or establish or endorse a methodology for transaction
IDs to be assigned by third parties. Rule 901(h) requires reporting sides to electronically
transmit the information required by Rule 901 in a format required by the registered SDR.
Rule 901(i) requires reporting of pre-enactment security-based swaps and transitional
security-based swaps to the extent that information about such transactions is available.
As detailed in Sections II to V, supra, in adopting Rule 901, the Commission has made
certain changes to Rule 901, both as originally proposed and as re-proposed in the Cross-Border
Proposing Release, in response to comments or in order to clarify various provisions. The
Commission believes that these changes do not substantially alter the underlying method of
computing the paperwork burdens, but do result in changes to the number of impacted entities
adopted, provides that a security-based swap that is subject to regulatory reporting and
public dissemination solely by operation of Rule 908(a)(1)(ii)—i.e., because the securitybased swap has been accepted for clearing by a clearing agency having its principal place
of business in the United States—must be reported within 24 hours of acceptance for
clearing.

419

and the number to transactions covered by the rules, thus impacting the paperwork burden totals
that were previously estimated for Rule 901.
2.

Use of Information

The security-based swap transaction information required to be reported pursuant to Rule
901 will be used by registered SDRs, market participants, the Commission, and other relevant
authorities. The information reported by reporting sides pursuant to Rule 901 will be used by
registered SDRs to publicly disseminate reports of security-based swap transactions, as well as to
offer a resource for the Commission and other relevant authorities to obtain detailed information
about the security-based swap market. Market participants will use the public market data feed,
among other things, to assess the current market for security-based swaps and to assist in the
valuation of their own positions. The Commission and other relevant authorities will use
information about security-based swap transactions reported to and held by registered SDRs to
monitor and assess systemic risks, as well as for market surveillance purposes.
3.

Respondents

Rule 901(a) assigns reporting duties for covered transactions. In the Cross-Border
Proposing Release, the Commission revised its preliminary estimate to 300 respondents. 1055 The
Commission continues to believe that it is reasonable to use 300 as an estimate of “reporting
sides” (as that term was used in the Cross-Border Proposing Release).
The Commission notes that, since issuing the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the
Commission has obtained additional and more granular data regarding participation in the
security-based swap market from DTCC-TIW. These historical data suggest that, among the 300

1055

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31113 (lowering the estimate of reporting
sides from 1,000 to 300).

420

reporting sides, approximately 50 are likely to be required to register with the Commission as
security-based swap dealers and approximately five are likely to register as major security-based
swap participants. 1056 These data further suggest that these 55 reporting sides likely will account
for the vast majority of recent security-based swap transactions and reports and that there are
only a limited number of security-based swap transactions that do not include at least one of
these larger counterparties on either side. 1057
Rule 901 imposes certain duties on registered SDRs. In the Regulation SBSR Proposing
Release, the Commission preliminarily estimated that the number of registered SDRs would not
exceed ten, an estimate that was affirmed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release. 1058 The
Commission continues to believe that it is reasonable to estimate ten registered SDR respondents
for the purpose of estimating collection of information burdens for Regulation SBSR.
4.

Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens

Pursuant to Rule 901, covered transactions must be reported to a registered SDR or to the
Commission. Together, sections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (h), and (j) of Rule 901 set forth the
parameters that govern how reporting sides report covered transactions. Rule 901(i) addresses
the reporting of pre-enactment and transitional security-based swaps. These reporting
requirements impose initial and ongoing burdens on reporting sides. The Commission believes

1056

See id. at 31103.

1057

As a result, the Commission generally will continue to use 300 as an estimate of the
number of reporting sides. In cases where a rule is more limited in its application, for
example Rule 906(c), the Commission may use a different number that reflects some
subset of the estimated 300 reporting sides. See also Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79
FR at 47300 (stating that 55 firms might register as security-based swap dealers or major
security-based swap participants).

1058

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75247; See also Cross-Border
Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31113.

421

that these burdens will be a function of, among other things, the number of reportable events and
the data elements required to be reported for each such event. Rule 901(f) requires a registered
SDR to the time stamp, to the second, all reported information, and Rule 901(g) requires a
registered SDR to assign a transaction ID to each security-based swap, or establish or endorse a
methodology for transaction IDs to be assigned by third parties. These requirements impose
initial and ongoing burdens on registered SDRs.
a.

Baseline Burdens

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission estimated that respondents
would face three categories of burdens to comply with Rule 901. 1059 First, each entity that would
incur a duty to report security-based swap transactions pursuant to Regulation SBSR (a
“reporting party” 1060) would likely have to develop an internal order and trade management
system (“OMS”) capable of capturing the relevant transaction information. 1061 Second, each
such entity would have to implement a reporting mechanism. 1062 Third, each such entity would
have to establish an appropriate compliance program and support for the operation of any OMS
and reporting mechanism. 1063 In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission
preliminarily estimated that the initial, aggregate annualized burden associated with Rule 901
would be 1,438 hours per reporting party—for a total of 1,438,300 hours for all reporting
1059

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75248.

1060

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission proposed the term
“reporting party” to describe the entity with the duty to report a particular security-based
swap transaction. See 75 FR at 75211. In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the
Commission revised the term “reporting party” to “reporting side” as part of the reproposal of Regulation SBSR. See 78 FR at 31059.

1061

parties—in order to develop an OMS, implement a reporting mechanism, and establish an
appropriate compliance program and support system. 1064 The Commission preliminarily
estimated that the ongoing aggregate annualized burden associated with Rule 901 would be 731
hours per reporting party, for a total of 731,300 hours for all reporting parties. 1065 The
Commission further estimated that the initial aggregate annualized dollar cost burden on
reporting parties associated with Rule 901 would be $201,000 per reporting party, for a total of
$201,000,000 for all reporting parties. 1066
b.

Burdens of Final Rule 901

For Reporting Sides. The reporting hierarchy is designed to place the duty to report
covered transactions on counterparties who are most likely to have the resources and who are
best able to support the reporting function.
Reporting sides that fall under the reporting hierarchy in Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) incur certain
burdens as a result thereof with respect to their reporting of covered transactions. As stated
above, the Commission believes that an estimate of 300 reporting sides that would incur the duty
to report under Regulation SBSR is reasonable for estimating collection of information burdens
under the PRA. This estimate includes all of those persons that incur a reporting duty under
Regulation SBSR, as adopted, including registered security-based swap dealers and registered
major security-based swap participants. This estimate also includes some smaller counterparties

See id. In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission noted that the
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release incorrectly stated this total as $301,000 per
reporting party. The correct number is $201,000 per reporting party ($200,000 + $1,000).
See 78 FR at 31113, note 1259.

to security-based swaps that could incur a reporting duty, but many fewer than estimated in the
PRA of the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release.
As discussed in more detail in Section V, supra, Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) adopts the reporting
hierarchy set forth in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, but limits its application to uncleared
transactions. The Commission believes, however, that this limitation will not materially change
the number of reporting sides for PRA purposes, as there likely would be a significant overlap
between the approximately 300 reporting sides reporting uncleared transactions and those
reporting other security-based swaps.
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission preliminarily estimated that
there would be 15.5 million reportable events associated with security-based swap transactions
per year. 1067 In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, in addition to lowering its estimate of the
number of reporting sides from 1,000 to 300, the Commission also revised its estimate of the
number of reportable events to approximately 5 million.1068 Since issuing the Cross-Border
Proposing Release, however, the Commission has obtained additional and more granular data
regarding participation in the security-based swap market from DTCC-TIW. As a result, the
Commission is now further revising its estimate of the number of reportable events.
Accordingly, the Commission now estimates that there will be approximately 3 million
reportable events per year under Rule 901, as adopted. 1069 The Commission further estimates
1067

1069

According to data published by the Bank for International Settlements, the global
notional amount outstanding in equity forwards and swaps as of December 2013 was
$2.28 trillion. The notional amount outstanding in single-name CDS was approximately
$11.32 trillion, in multi-name index CDS was approximately $8.75 trillion, and in multiname, non-index CDS was approximately $950 billion. See Semi-annual OTC
derivatives statistics at end-December 2013 (June 2014), Table 19, available at
424

that approximately 2 million of these reportable events will consist of uncleared transactions
(i.e., those transactions that will be reported to a registered SDR by the reporting sides). The
Commission noted in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, and continues to believe, that the
reduction in the estimate of the number of reportable events per year is likely a result of several
factors. 1070
The Commission believes that, once a respondent’s reporting infrastructure and
compliance systems are in place, the burden of reporting each individual reportable event will be
small when compared to the burdens of establishing the reporting infrastructure and compliance
systems. 1071 As stated above, the Commission estimates that 2 million of the 3 million total

http://www.bis.org/statistics/dt1920a.pdf (last visited September 22, 2014). For the
purposes of this analysis, the Commission assumes that multi-name index CDS are not
narrow-based index CDS and, therefore, are not security-based swaps. The Commission
also assumes that all instruments reported as equity forwards and swaps are securitybased swaps, potentially resulting in underestimation of the proportion of the securitybased swap market represented by single-name CDS. Based on those assumptions,
single-name CDS appear to constitute roughly 82% of the security-based swap market.
Although the BIS data reflect the global OTC derivatives market, and not just the U.S.
market, the Commission believes that it is reasonable to assume these ratios would be
similar in the U.S. market. The Commission now estimates that there were
approximately 2.26 million single-name CDS transactions in 2013. Because single-name
CDS appear to constitute roughly 78% of the security-based swap market, the
Commission now estimates that there are approximately 3 million security-based swap
transactions (i.e., 2,260,000/0.78 = 2,898,329 reportable events).
1070

See 78 FR at 31115.

1071

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission preliminarily estimated that
reporting specific security-based swap transactions to a registered SDR—separate from
the establishing of infrastructure and compliance systems that support reporting—would
impose an annual aggregate cost of approximately $5,400,000. See 75 FR 75265. The
Commission further estimated that Rule 901 would impose an aggregate total first-year
cost of approximately $1,039,000,000 and an ongoing annualized aggregate cost of
approximately $703,000,000. See id. at 75280. See also Cross-Border Proposing
Release, 78 FR at 31115 (stating the Commission’s preliminary belief that the reporting
of a single reportable event would be de minimis when compared to the burdens of
establishing the reporting infrastructure and compliance systems).

425

reportable events would consist of the initial reporting of security-based swaps as well as the
reporting of any life cycle events. The Commission estimates that of the 2 million reportable
events, approximately 900,000 would involve the reporting of new security-based swap
transactions, and approximately 1,100,000 would involve the reporting of life cycle events under
Rule 901(e). The Commission estimates that Rule 901(a) would result in reporting sides having
a total burden of 4,500 hours attributable to the initial reporting of security-based swaps by
reporting sides to registered SDRs under Rules 901(c) and 901(d) over the course of a year. 1072
The Commission further estimates that reporting sides would have a total burden of 5,500 hours
attributable to the reporting of life cycle events under Rule 901(e) over the course of a year. 1073
Therefore, the Commission believes that Rule 901, as adopted, would result in a total reporting
burden for reporting sides under Rules 901(c) and (d) along with the reporting of life cycle
events under Rule 901(e) of 10,000 burden hours per year. The Commission continues to
believe that many reportable events will be reported through electronic means and that the ratio
of electronic reporting to manual reporting is likely to increase over time. The Commission
continues to believe that the bulk of the burden hours estimated above will be attributable to
manually reported transactions. Thus, reporting sides that capture and report transactions

1072

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission estimated that it would take
approximately 0.005 hours for each security-based swap transaction to be reported. See
75 FR at 75249, note 195. The Commission calculates the following: ((900,000 x 0.005)
/ (300 reporting sides)) = 15 burden hours per reporting side or 4,500 total burden hours
attributable to the initial reporting of security-based swaps.

1073

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission estimated that it would take
approximately 0.005 hours for each security-based swap transaction to be reported. See
75 FR at 75249, note 195. The Commission calculates the following: ((1,100,000 x
0.005) / (300 reporting sides)) = 18.33 burden hours per reporting side or 5,500 total
burden hours attributable to the reporting of life cycle events under Rule 901(e).

426

electronically will likely incur bear fewer burden hours than those reporting sides that capture
and report transactions manually.
Based on the foregoing, the Commission estimates that Rule 901, as adopted, will impose
an estimated total first-year burden of approximately 1,394 hours 1074 per reporting side for a total
first-year burden of 418,200 hours for all reporting sides. 1075 The Commission estimates that
Rule 901, as adopted, will impose ongoing annualized aggregate burdens of approximately 687
hours 1076 per reporting side for a total aggregate annualized cost of 206,100 hours for all
reporting sides. 1077 The Commission further estimates that Rule 901, as adopted, will impose
initial and ongoing annualized dollar cost burdens of $201,000 per reporting side, for total
aggregate initial and ongoing annualized dollar cost burdens of $60,300,000. 1078

1074

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: (355 hours (one-time hourly
burden for establishing and OMS) + 172 hours (one-time hourly burden for establishing
security-based swap reporting mechanisms) + 180 hours (one-time hourly burden for
compliance and ongoing support) = 707 hours (one-time total hourly burden). See
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75248-50, notes 186, 194, and 201. (436
hours (annual-ongoing hourly burden for internal order management) + 33.3 hours
(revised annual-ongoing hourly burden for security-based swap reporting mechanisms) +
218 hours (annual-ongoing hourly burden for compliance and ongoing support) = 687.3
hours (one-time total hourly burden. See id. at 75248-50, notes 187 and 201 (707 onetime hourly burden + 687 revised annual-ongoing hourly burden = 1,394 total first-year
hourly burden).

1075

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: (1,394 hours per reporting side
x 300 reporting sides) = 418,200 hours.

1076

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31112-15.

1077

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: (687 hours per reporting side x
300 reporting sides) = 206,100 hours.

1078

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: ($201,000 per reporting side x
300 reporting sides) = $60,300,000. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at
31113-15. The Commission originally estimated this burden based on discussions with
various market participants. See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 7524750.

427

For Registered SDRs. In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission set
forth estimated burdens on registered SDRs related to Rule 901. 1079 The Commission continues
to believe that these estimated burdens are reasonable.
Rule 901(f) requires a registered SDR to time-stamp, to the second, information that it
receives. Rule 901(g) requires a registered SDR to assign a unique transaction ID to each
security-based swap it receives or establish or endorse a methodology for transaction IDs to be
assigned by third parties. The Commission continues to believe that such design elements will
pose some additional burdens to incorporate in the context of designing and building the
technological framework that will be required of an SDR to become registered. 1080 Therefore,
the Commission estimates that Rules 901(f) and 901(g) will impose an initial one-time aggregate
burden of 1,200 burden hours, which corresponds to 120 burden hours per registered SDR. 1081
This figure is based on an estimate of ten registered SDRs, which the Commission continues to
believe is reasonable.
Once operational, these elements of each registered SDR’s system will have to be
supported and maintained. Accordingly, the Commission estimates that Rule 901(f) and 901(g)
will impose an annual aggregate burden of 1,520 burden hours, which corresponds to 152 burden

1079

See 75 FR at 75250-51.

1080

The Commission has adopted additional rules under the Exchange Act relating to the
duties, data collection and maintenance requirements, and automated systems
requirements of SDRs. See SDR Adopting Release.

1081

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75250. This figure is based on
discussions with various market participants and is calculated as follows: [((Sr.
Programmer at 80 hours) + (Sr. Systems Analyst at 20 hours) + (Compliance Manager at
8 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 4 hours) + (Compliance Attorney at 8 hours)) x (10
registered SDRs)] = 1,200 burden hours, which is 120 hours per registered SDR.

428

hours per registered SDR. 1082 This figure represents an estimate of the burden for a registered
SDR for support and maintenance costs for the registered SDR’s systems to time stamp incoming
submissions and assign transaction IDs.
Thus, the Commission estimates that the first-year aggregate annualized burden on
registered SDRs associated with Rules 901(f) and 901(g) will be 2,720 burden hours, which
corresponds to 272 burden hours per registered SDR. 1083 Correspondingly, the Commission
estimates that the ongoing aggregate annualized burden associated with Rules 901(f) and 901(g)
will be 1,520 burden hours, which corresponds to 152 burden hours per registered SDR. 1084 The
above burden estimates pertaining to Rules 901(f) and 901(g) are identical to those set forth in
the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release. 1085
Since Regulation SBSR, as adopted, requires reporting for only covered transactions,
registered SDRs will be required to receive, process, and potentially disseminate a smaller
number of security-based swaps than originally envisioned. Because the bulk of an SDR’s
burdens and costs under Regulation SBSR are not transaction-based, however, the Commission
has determined that the burden and cost estimates set forth in the Cross-Border Proposing
Release remain valid for the purposes of the PRA.

1082

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75250. This figure is based on
discussions with various market participants as follows: [((Sr. Programmer at 60 hours)
+ (Sr. Systems Analyst at 48 hours) + (Compliance Manager at 24 hours) + (Director of
Compliance at 12 hours) + (Compliance Attorney at 8 hours)) x (10 SDRs)] = 1,520
burden hours, which is 152 hours per registered SDR.

1083

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75250. This figure is based on the
following: [(1,200) + (1,520)] = 2,720 burden hours, which corresponds to 272 burden
hours per registered SDR.

1084

See supra note 1083.

1085

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75250.

429

In addition, the Commission recognizes that, since the publication of the Regulation
SBSR Proposing Release, many entities already have spent considerable time and resources
building the infrastructure that will support reporting of security-based swaps. Indeed, some
reporting is already occurring voluntarily. 1086 As a result, the Commission notes that the burdens
and costs calculated herein could be greater than those actually incurred by affected parties as a
result of the adoption of Regulation SBSR. Nonetheless, the Commission believes that its
estimates represent a reasonable upper bound of the actual burdens and costs required to comply
with Regulation SBSR.
5.

Recordkeeping Requirements

Rule 13n-5(b)(4) under the Exchange Act requires an SDR to maintain the transaction
data and related identifying information that it collects for not less than five years after the
applicable security-based swap expires, and historical positions for not less than five years. 1087
Accordingly, security-based swap transaction reports received by a registered SDR pursuant to
Rule 901 will be required to be retained by the registered SDR for not less than five years.
6.

Collection of Information is Mandatory

Each collection of information discussed above is mandatory.
7.

Confidentiality of Responses to Collection of Information

For the majority of security-based swap transactions, all of the information collected
pursuant to Rule 901(c) will be widely available to the public because these transactions will be
publicly disseminated by a registered SDR pursuant to Rule 902. However, certain security1086

See SDR Adopting Release, Section VI(E)(4).

430

based swaps are not subject to Rule 902’s public dissemination requirement; 1088 therefore,
information about these transactions will not be publicly available. In addition, reporting sides
must provide certain information about security-based swap transactions pursuant to Rule
901(d). Rule 901(d) information is for regulatory purposes and will not be publicly
disseminated.
An SDR, pursuant to Section 13(n)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13n-4(b)(8) and
13n-9 thereunder, must maintain the privacy of security-based swap information, 1089 including
information reported pursuant to Rule 901(d) of Regulation SBSR, as well as information about
a security-based swap transaction reported pursuant to Rule 901(c) where the transaction falls
into a category enumerated in Rule 902(c). To the extent that the Commission receives these
kinds of information under Regulation SBSR, such information will be kept confidential, subject
to the provisions of applicable law.
C.

Public Dissemination of Transaction Reports—Rule 902

Rule 902(a), as adopted, requires a registered SDR to publicly disseminate a transaction
report immediately upon receipt of information about a security-based swap, or a life cycle event
or adjustment due to a life cycle event (or upon re-opening following a period when the
registered SDR was closed), except in certain limited circumstances described in Rule 902(c). A
published transaction report must consist of all the information reported pursuant to Rule 901(c),
plus any condition flags required by the policies and procedures of the registered SDR to which
the transaction is reported. Certain provisions of Rule 902 of Regulation SBSR contain

1088

See supra Section VI(D).

1089

See SDR Adopting Release, Sections VI(D)(2) and VI(I)(1).

431

“collection of information requirements” within the meaning of the PRA. The title of this
collection is “Rule 902—Public Dissemination of Transaction Reports.”
1.

Summary of Collection of Information

As adopted, Rule 902(a) generally requires that a registered SDR publicly disseminate a
transaction report for each security-based swap transaction, or a life cycle event or adjustment
due to a life cycle, immediately upon receipt of information about the security-based swap
submitted by a reporting side pursuant to Rule 901(c). The transaction report must contain all of
the information reported pursuant to Rule 901(c) along with any condition flags required by the
policies and procedures of the registered SDR to which the transaction is reported. 1090 If its
systems are unavailable to publicly disseminate these transaction data immediately upon receipt,
the registered SDR is required to disseminate the transaction data immediately upon re-opening.
Rule 902(a), as adopted, provides registered SDRs with the authority and discretion to establish
the content, format, and mode of dissemination through its policies and procedures, as long as it
does so in compliance with the information required to be disseminated by Rule 901(c).
Rule 902(b), as proposed and re-proposed, addressed how a registered SDR would be
required to publicly disseminate transaction reports of block trades. As discussed in more detail
above, the Commission is not adopting Rule 902(b).
Rule 902(c), as adopted, prohibits a registered SDR from disseminating: (1) the identity
of any counterparty to a security-based swap; (2) with respect to a security-based swap that is not
cleared at a registered clearing agency and that is reported to a registered SDR, any information
disclosing the business transactions and market positions of any person; (3) any information
regarding a security-based swap reported pursuant to Rule 901(i); (4) any non-mandatory report;
1090

See Rule 907(a)(4).

432

(5) any information regarding a security-based swap that is required to be reported pursuant to
Rule 901 and Rule 908(a)(1) but is not required to be publicly disseminated pursuant to Rule
908(a)(2); (6) any information regarding certain clearing transactions; and (7) any information
regarding the allocation of a security-based swap.
Rule 902(d) provides that no person shall make available to one or more persons (other
than a counterparty or a post-trade processor) transaction information relating to a security-based
swap before the reporting side transmits the primary trade information about the security-based
swap to a registered SDR.
2.

Use of Information

The public dissemination requirements contained in Rule 902 are designed to promote
post-trade transparency of security-based swap transactions.
3.

Respondents

The collection of information associated with the Rule 902 will apply to registered SDRs.
As noted above, the Commission believes that an estimate of ten registered SDRs is reasonable
for purposes of its analysis of burdens under the PRA.
4.

Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens

Rule 13n-5(b) sets forth requirements for collecting and maintaining transaction data that
each SDR will be required to follow. 1091 The SDR Adopting Release describes the relevant
burdens and costs that complying with Rule 13n-5(b) will entail. 1092
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated its preliminary belief
that a registered SDR would be able to integrate the capability to publicly disseminate security1091

See SDR Adopting Release, Section VI(E)(1).

1092

See SDR Adopting Release, Section VII(D)(2).

433

based swap transaction reports required under Rule 902 as part of its overall system development
for transaction data. 1093 Based on discussions with industry participants, the Commission
estimates that, to implement and comply with the public dissemination requirement of Rule 902,
each registered SDR will incur a burden equal to an additional 20% of the first-year and ongoing
burdens discussed in the SDR Registration Proposing Release. 1094 This estimate was first
proposed in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release and reiterated in the Cross-Border
Proposing Release, and the Commission believes that it remains valid. 1095
Based on the above, the Commission estimates that the initial one-time aggregate burden
imposed by Rule 902 for development and implementation of the systems needed to disseminate
the required transaction information, including the necessary software and hardware, will be
approximately 8,400 hours and a dollar cost of $2 million for each registered SDR, which
aggregates to 84,000 hours and a dollar cost of $20 million for all SDR respondents. 1096 In
addition, the Commission estimates that annual aggregate burden (initial and ongoing) imposed
by the Rule 902 will constitute approximately 5,040 hours and a dollar cost of $1.2 million for
each registered SDR, which aggregates to 50,400 hours and a dollar cost of $12 million for all
1093

1094

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75252. See also SDR Adopting
Release, Section VII(D)(2). This estimate was based on discussions with industry
members and market participants, including entities that may register as SDRs under
Title VII, and includes time necessary to design and program a registered SDR’s system
to calculate and disseminate initial and subsequent trade reports.

Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31198.

1096

See SDR Adopting Release, Section VII(D)(2) for the total burden associated with
establishing SDR technology systems. The Commission derived this estimated burden
from the following: [((Attorney at 1,400 hours) + (Compliance Manager at 1,600 hours)
+ (Programmer Analyst at 4,000 hours) + (Senior Business Analyst at 1,400 hours)) x (10
registered SDRs)] = 84,000 burden hours, which corresponds to 8,400 hours per
registered SDR.

434

SDR respondents. 1097 Thus, the Commission estimates that the total first-year (initial) aggregate
annualized burden on registered SDRs associated with public dissemination requirement under
Rule 902 will be approximately 134,400 hours and a dollar cost of $32 million, which
corresponds to a burden of 13,440 hours and a dollar cost of $3.2 million for each registered
SDR. 1098
5.

Recordkeeping Requirements

Pursuant to Rule 13n-7(b) under the Exchange Act, a registered SDR is required to keep
and preserve at least one copy of all documents, including all documents and policies and
procedures required by the Exchange Act and the rules or regulations thereunder, for a period of
not less than five years, the first two years in a place that is immediately available to
representatives of the Commission for inspection and examination. 1099 This requirement
encompasses all security-based swap transaction reports disseminated by a registered SDR
pursuant to Rule 902 and are required to be retained for not less than five years.
6.

Collection of Information is Mandatory

Each collection of information discussed above is mandatory.
7.

Confidentiality of Responses to Collection of Information

1097

See SDR Adopting Release, Section VII(D)(2) for the total ongoing annual burdens
associated with operating and maintaining SDR technology systems. The Commission
derived this estimated burden from the following: [((Attorney at 840 hours) +
(Compliance Manager at 960 hours) + (Programmer Analyst at 2,400 hours) + (Senior
Business Analyst at 840 hours)) x (10 registered SDRs)] = 50,400 burden hours, which
corresponds to 5,040 hours per registered SDR.

1098

These estimates are based on the following: [(84,000 one-time burden hours) + (50,400
annual burden hours)] = 134,400 burden hours, which corresponds to 13,440 hours per
registered SDR; [($20 million one-time dollar cost burden) + ($12 million annual dollar
cost burden)] = $32 million cost burden, which corresponds to $3.2 million per registered
SDR.

1099

See SDR Adopting Release, Section VI(G)(2).

435

Most of the information required under Rule 902 will be widely available to the public to
the extent it is incorporated into security-based swap transaction reports that are publicly
disseminated by a registered SDR pursuant to Rule 902. However, Rule 902(c) prohibits public
dissemination of certain kinds of transactions and certain kinds of transaction information. An
SDR, pursuant to Sections 13(n)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13n-4(b)(8) and 13n-9
thereunder will be under an obligation to maintain the privacy of this security-based swap
information. 1100 To the extent that the Commission receives confidential information pursuant to
this collection of information, such information must be kept confidential, subject to the
provisions of applicable law.
D.

Coded Information—Rule 903

Regulation SBSR, as adopted, permits or, in some instances, requires security-based
swap counterparties to report coded information to registered SDRs using UICs. These UICs
will be used to identify products, transactions, and persons, as well as certain business units and
employees of legal persons. 1101 Rule 903 establishes standards for assigning and using coded
information in security-based swap reporting and dissemination to help ensure that codes are
assigned in an orderly manner and that relevant authorities, market participants, and the public
are able to interpret coded information stored and disseminated by registered SDRs.
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated its belief that Rule
903 would not be a “collection of information” within the meaning of the PRA because the rule
would merely permit reporting parties and registered SDRs to use codes in place of certain data

1100

See SDR Adopting Release, Sections VI(D)(2) and VI(I)(1).

1101

See supra Section II (describing UICs that must be reported to registered SDRs pursuant
to Regulation SBSR).

436

elements, subject to certain conditions. 1102 In re-proposing Rule 903 in the Cross-Border
Proposing Release, the Commission made only technical and conforming changes to Rule 903 to
incorporate the use of the term “side.” 1103 Rule 903, as adopted, includes a requirement that, if
the Commission has recognized an IRSS that assigns UICs to persons, each participant of a
registered SDR shall obtain a UIC from or through that IRSS. 1104 Because the Commission also
is recognizing the GLEIS—which issues LEIs—as an IRSS, any person who is a participant of
one or more registered SDRs will have to obtain an LEI from or through the GLEIS. Therefore,
the Commission now believes that Rule 903 constitutes a “collection of information” within the
meaning of the PRA. The title of this collection is “Rule 903—Coded Information.”
1.

Summary of Collection of Information

Rule 903(a) provides that, if an IRSS that meets certain criteria is recognized by the
Commission and has assigned a UIC to a person, unit of a person, or product (or has endorsed a
methodology for assigning transaction IDs), all registered SDRs must use that UIC in carrying
out their responsibilities under Regulation SBSR. If no such system has been recognized by the
Commission, or if such a system has not assigned a UIC to a particular person, unit of a person,
or product (or has not endorsed a methodology for assigning transaction IDs), the registered SDR
must assign a UIC to that person, unit of a person, or product using its own methodology (or
endorse a methodology for assigning transaction IDs). The following UICs are contemplated by
Regulation SBSR: branch ID, broker ID, counterparty ID execution agent ID, platform ID,
product ID, trader ID, trading desk ID, transaction ID, and ultimate parent ID. UICs are intended

437

to allow registered SDRs and the Commission and other relevant authorities to aggregate
transaction information across a variety of vectors. For example, the trader ID will allow the
Commission and other relevant authorities to identify all trades carried out by an individual
trader. The product ID will allow the Commission and other relevant authorities to identify all
transactions in a particular security-based swap product. The transaction ID will allow
counterparties and the registered SDR to link a series of life cycle events to each other and to the
original transaction. As discussed in Section X(B)(2), supra, the Commission has recognized the
GLEIS as an IRSS that meets the criteria of Rule 903. Therefore, if an entity has an LEI issued
by or through the GLEIS, that LEI must be used for all purposes under Regulation SBSR.
Furthermore, each participant that acts as a guarantor of a direct counterparty’s performance of
any obligation under a security-based swap that is subject to § 242.908(a) shall, if the direct
counterparty has not already done so, obtain a UIC for identifying the direct counterparty from or
through that system, if that system permits third-party registration without a requirement to
obtain prior permission of the direct counterparty.
2.

Use of Information

The information provided pursuant to Rule 903 is necessary to for any person who is a
participant of at least one registered SDR to be identified by an LEI for reporting purposes under
Regulation SBSR.
3.

Respondents

Rule 903 applies to any person who is a participant of at least one registered SDR. The
Commission estimates that there may be up to 4,800 security-based swap counterparties that are

438

participants of one or more registered SDRs. 1105 The Commission recognizes that, since the
publication of the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, many persons who are likely to become
participants of one or more registered SDRs already have LEIs issued by or through the GLEIS.
As a result, the burdens and costs actually incurred by participants as a result of the adoption of
Regulation SBSR are likely to be less than the burdens and costs calculated herein. Specifically,
as discussed in further detail in Section XXII(C)(4)(b), infra, based on transaction data from
DTCC-TIW, the Commission believes that no fewer than 3,500 of approximately 4,800 accounts
that participated in the market for single-name CDS in 2013 currently have LEIs. 1106 The
Commission assumes that no market participants that currently have LEIs would continue to
maintain their LEIs in the absence of Rule 903(a) in order to arrive at an upper bound on the
ongoing costs associated with Rule 903(a). The Commission believes that this is a conservative
approach, since regulators in certain other jurisdictions mandate the use of an LEI. 1107
Consequently, the Commission estimates, for purposes of the PRA, that there may be as many as

1105

As noted in Section XXII(B)(1), infra, the available data do not include transactions
between two foreign security-based swap market participants on foreign underlying
reference entities. As a result, this estimate may not include certain foreign
counterparties to security-based swaps.

1106

Some counterparties reported in the transaction data may be guarantors of other nonU.S.-person-direct counterparties and, if so, may be responsible for obtaining and
maintaining more than one LEI. As such, precisely quantifying the number of LEIs
required by Rule 903(a) is not possible at this time. However, because many of these
direct non-U.S.-person counterparties are likely from jurisdictions where regulators
mandate the use of LEIs, the Commission believes that these counterparties will already
have registered LEIs and will continue to maintain them.

1107

The European Market Infrastructure Regulation requires use of codes to identify
counterparties. See “Trade Reporting” (available at:

who will need to maintain an LEI. 1108

Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens

The Commission estimates that first-year aggregate burden imposed by Rule 903 will be
1,300 hours, which corresponds to 1 hour per participant, to account for the initial burdens of
obtaining an LEI. 1109 The Commission estimates that the ongoing burden imposed by Rule 903
will be 4,800 hours, which corresponds to 1 hour per participant, to account for ongoing
administration of the LEI. 1110 In addition, for these participants, the assignment of an LEI will
entail both one-time and ongoing costs assessed by local operation units (“LOUs”) of the GLEIS.
The current cost for registering a new LEI is approximately $220, with an additional cost of $120
per year for maintaining an LEI. 1111 For those participants that do not already have an LEI, the

1108

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission used an estimate of 5,000
participant respondents that might incur reporting duties under Regulation SBSR. This
estimate included an estimated 1,000 entities regularly engaged in the CDS marketplace
as well as 4,000 potential security-based swap counterparties that were expected to
transact security-based swaps less frequently but that nonetheless would be considered
“participants.” See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75254. Based on
more recent data, the Commission has revised the estimated number of participant
respondents to 4,800. The Commission notes that registered security-based swap dealers
and major security-based swap participants will, for some transactions, be the nonreporting side and are therefore included in this estimate.

1109

This figure is based on the following: [Compliance Attorney at 1 hour/year) x (1,300
participants)] = 1,300 burden hours.

1110

This figure is based on the following: [(Compliance Attorney at 1 hour/year) x (4,800

initial one-time cost would be $286,000, or $220 per participant. 1112 All participants would be
required to maintain their LEI resulting in an annual cost of $576,000, or $120 per
participant. 1113
5.

Recordkeeping Requirements

The applications that participants must complete in order to obtain an LEI issued by or
through the GLEIS are not subject to any specific recordkeeping requirements for participants, to
the extent that these participants are non-registered persons. 1114 The Commission expects,
however, that in the normal course of their business a participant of a registered SDR would keep
records of the information entered in connection with its LEI application, such as the
participant’s legal name, registered address, headquarters address, and the entity’s legal form.

This figure is based on the following: [($120 annual maintenance cost) x (4,800

participants obtaining an LEI in the first year, the annual maintenance cost will be
incurred beginning in the year following registration.

reporting requirements for security-based swap dealers, major security-based swap
participants, and broker-dealers).

441

Rule 904, as adopted, requires a registered SDR to have systems in place to continuously
receive and disseminate information regarding security-based swap data with certain exceptions.
Certain provisions of Rule 904 contain “collection of information requirements” within the
meaning of the PRA. The title of this collection is “Rule 904—Operating Hours of Registered
SDRs.”
1.

Summary of Collection of Information

Rule 904 requires a registered SDR to operate continuously, subject to two exceptions.
First, under Rule 904(a) a registered SDR may establish normal closing hours during periods
when, in its estimation, the U.S. market and major foreign markets are inactive. A registered
SDR is required to provide reasonable advance notice to participants and to the public of its
normal closing hours. Second, under Rule 904(b) a registered SDR may declare, on an ad hoc
basis, special closing hours to perform system maintenance that cannot wait until normal closing
hours. A registered SDR is required, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances,
to avoid scheduling special closing hours during when, in its estimation, the U.S. market and
major foreign markets are most active; and provide reasonable advance notice of its special
closing hours to participants and to the public.
Rule 904(c) specifies requirements for handling and disseminating reported data during a
registered SDR’s normal and special closing hours. During normal closing hours and, to the
extent reasonably practicable, during special closing hours, a registered SDR is required to have
the capability to receive and hold in queue transaction data it receives. 1115 Pursuant to Rule
904(d), immediately upon system re-opening, the registered SDR is required to publicly
disseminate any transaction data required to be reported under Rule 901(c) that it received and
1115

See Rule 904(c).

442

held in queue, in accordance with the requirements of Rule 902. Pursuant to Rule 904(e), if a
registered SDR cannot hold in queue transaction data to be reported, immediately upon reopening the SDR is required to send a message to all participants that it has resumed normal
operations. Thereafter, any participant that had an obligation to report transaction information to
the registered SDR, but could not due to the registered SDR’s inability to receive and hold in
queue such transaction information, must promptly report the information to the registered
SDR. 1116
The Commission originally stated its belief that there were not any costs or burdens
applicable to participants as a result of Rule 904(e). 1117 The Commission continues to believe
that this conclusion is appropriate. Specifically, the Commission believes that the process by
which the registered SDR will notify participants that it has resumed operations would be
automated. As a result, the Commission believes that the costs associated with building out the
systems necessary for such notifications have already been accounted for in the costs of
developing the registered SDRs systems associated with the receipt of security-based swap
information under Rule 901. 1118 As a result, the Commission continues to believe that Rule
904(e) is not a collection of information for participants.
2.

Use of Information

The information provided pursuant to Rule 904 is necessary to allow participants and the
public to know the normal and special closing hours of the registered SDR, and to allow

participants to take appropriate action in the event that the registered SDR cannot accept
security-based swap transaction reports from participants. 1119
3.

Respondents

Rule 904 applies to all registered SDRs. As noted above, the Commission estimates that
there will be ten registered SDRs.
4.

Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens

The Commission continues to estimate that that the one-time, initial burden, as well as
ongoing annualized burden for each registered SDR associated with Rule 904 will be only minor
additional burden beyond that necessary to ensure its basic operating capability under both
Regulation SBSR and the SDR Registration Rules. The Commission estimates that the annual
aggregate burden (first-year and ongoing) imposed by Rule 904 will be 360 hours, which
corresponds to 36 hours per registered SDR. 1120
One commenter asserted that the proposed requirement for a registered SDR to receive
and hold in the queue the data required to be reported during its closing hours “exceeds the
capabilities of currently-existing reporting infrastructures.” 1121 However, the Commission notes
that this comment was submitted in January 2011; since the receipt of this comment,
provisionally registered CFTC SDRs that are likely also to register as SDRs with the
Commission appear to have developed the capability of receiving and holding data in queue

1119

The Commission does not believe that Rule 904(c) will result in any burden within the
meaning of the PRA. Rule 904(c) does not create new or additional duties to report
security-based swap transactions.

1120

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75253. This figure is based on the
following: [(Operations Specialist at 3 hours/month) x (12 months/year) x (10 registered
SDRs)] = 360 burden hours.

1121

Markit I at 4.

444

during their closing hours. 1122 Thus, the Commission continues to believe that requiring
registered SDRs to hold data in queue during their closing hours would not create a significant
burden for registered SDRs.
The Commission does not believe Rule 904 imposes any separate collection of
information on participants of registered SDRs not already accounted for under Rule 901. 1123
Any respondent unable to report to a registered SDR, because such registered SDR was unable to
receive the transaction report, would have to delay the submission of the transaction report. The
Commission does not believe that the number of transaction reports impacted by this
requirement would impact the burdens contained in this PRA.
5.

Recordkeeping Requirements

Rule 13n-7(b) under the Exchange Act requires an SDR to keep and preserve at least one
copy of all documents, including all documents and policies and procedures required by the
Exchange Act and the rules or regulations thereunder, for a period of not less than five years, the
first two years in a place that is immediately available to representatives of the Commission for
inspection and examination. 1124 This requirement encompasses notices issued by a registered
SDR to its participants under Rule 904.
6.

Collection of Information is Mandatory

1123

The requirement in Rule 904(e) for participants to report information to the registered
SDR upon receiving a notice that the registered SDR resumed its normal operations is
already considered as part of the participant’s reporting obligations under Rule 901 and
thus is already included in the burden estimate for Rule 901.

Correction of Errors in Security-Based Swap Information—Rule 905

Rule 905, as adopted, establishes procedures for correcting errors in reported and
disseminated security-based swap information.
Certain provisions of Rule 905 of Regulation SBSR contain “collection of information
requirements” within the meaning of the PRA. The title of this collection is “Rule 905—
Correction of Errors in Security-Based Swap Information.”
1.

Summary of Collection of Information

Rule 905 establishes duties for security-based swap counterparties and registered SDRs
to correct errors in information that previously has been reported.
Counterparty Reporting Error. Under Rule 905(a)(1), where a side that was not the
reporting side for a security-based swap transaction discovers an error in the information
reported with respect to such security-based swap, the counterparty must promptly notify the
reporting side of the error. Under Rule 905(a)(2), where a reporting side for a security-based
swap transaction discovers an error in the information reported with respect to a security-based
swap, or receives notification from its counterparty of an error, the reporting side must promptly
submit to the entity to which the security-based swap was originally reported an amended report
pertaining to the original transaction. The amended report must be submitted to the registered
SDR in a manner consistent with the policies and procedures of the registered SDR required
pursuant to Rule 907(a)(3).

446

Duty of Registered SDR to Correct. Rule 905(b) sets forth the duties of a registered SDR
relating to corrections. If the registered SDR either discovers an error in a transaction on its
system or receives notice of an error from a reporting side, Rule 905(b)(1) requires the registered
SDR to verify the accuracy of the terms of the security-based swap and, following such
verification, promptly correct the erroneous information contained in its system. Rule 905(b)(2)
further requires that, if such erroneous information relates to a security-based swap that the
registered SDR previously disseminated and falls into any of the categories of information
enumerated in Rule 901(c), the registered SDR must publicly disseminate a corrected transaction
report of the security-based swap promptly following verification of the trade by the
counterparties to the security-based swap, with an indication that the report relates to a
previously disseminated transaction.
2.

Use of Information

The security-based swap transaction information required to be reported pursuant to Rule
905 will be used by registered SDRs, participants, the Commission, and other relevant
authorities. Participants will be able to use such information to evaluate and manage their own
risk positions and satisfy their duties to report corrected information to a registered SDR. A
registered SDR will need the required information to correct security-based swap transaction
records, in order to maintain an accurate record of a participant’s positions as well as to
disseminate corrected information. The Commission and other relevant authorities will need the
corrected information to have an accurate understanding of the market for surveillance and
oversight purposes.
3.

Respondents

447

Rule 905 applies to all participants of registered SDRs. As noted above, the Commission
estimates that there will be approximately 300 reporting sides that incur the duty to report
security-based swap transactions pursuant to Rule 901. In addition, the Commission estimates
that there may be up to 4,800 security-based swap counterparties that are participants of one or
more registered SDRs. Because any of these counterparties who are participants could become
aware of errors in their reported transaction data, the Commission estimates that there may be as
many as 4,800 respondents for purposes of the PRA.
Rule 905 also applies to registered SDRs. As noted above, the Commission estimates
there will be ten registered SDRs.
4.

Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens

The duty to promptly submit amended transaction reports to the appropriate registered
SDR after discovery of an error, as required under Rule 905(a)(2), will impose burdens on
reporting sides. The duty to promptly notify the relevant reporting side after discovery of an
error, as required under Rule 905(a)(1), will impose burdens on non-reporting-side participants.
With respect to reporting sides, the Commission believes that Rule 905(a) will impose an
initial, one-time burden associated with designing and building the reporting side’s reporting
system to be capable of submitting amended security-based swap transactions to a registered
SDR. The Commission believes that designing and building appropriate reporting system
functionality to comply with Rule 905(a)(2) will be a component of, and represent an
incremental “add-on” to, the cost to build a reporting system and develop a compliance function
as required under Rule 901. Based on discussions with industry participants, the Commission
estimates this incremental burden to be equal to 5% of the one-time and annual burdens
associated with designing and building a reporting system that is in compliance with Rule 901,

448

plus 10% of the corresponding one-time and annual burdens associated with developing the
reporting side’s overall compliance program required under Rule 901. This estimate is based on
similar calculations contained in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 1125 updated to reflect
new estimates relating to the number of reportable events and the number of reporting sides.
Thus, for reporting sides, the Commission estimates that Rule 905(a) will impose an initial (firstyear) aggregate burden of 15,015 hours, which is 50.0 burden hours per reporting side, 1126 and an
ongoing aggregate annualized burden of 7,035 hours, which is 23.5 burden hours per reporting
side. 1127
The Commission believes that the actual submission of amended transaction reports
required under Rule 905(a)(2) will not result in a material burden because this will be done
electronically though the reporting system that the reporting side must develop and maintain to
comply with Rule 901. The overall burdens associated with such a reporting system are
addressed in the Commission’s analysis of Rule 901.

1125

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75254.

1126

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75254-55. This figure is calculated as
follows: [(((172 burden hours for one-time development of reporting system) x (0.05)) +
((33 burden hours annual maintenance of reporting system) x (0.05)) + ((180 burden
hours one-time compliance program development) x (0.1)) + ((218 burden hours annual
support of compliance program) x (0.1))) x (300 reporting sides)] = 15,015 burden hours,
which is 50 burden hours per reporting side. The burden hours for annual maintenance of
the reporting system has been updated to reflect new information on the number of
reportable events. See supra note 1075.

1127

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75254-55. This figure is calculated as
follows: [(((33 burden hours annual maintenance of reporting system) x (0.05)) + ((218
burden hours annual support of compliance program) x (0.1))) x (300 reporting sides)] =
7,035 burden hours, which is 23.5 burden hours per reporting side. The burden hours for
annual maintenance of the reporting system has been updated to reflect new information
on the number of reportable events. See supra note 1075.

449

With regard to non-reporting-side participants, the Commission believes that Rule 905(a)
will impose an initial and ongoing burden associated with promptly notifying the relevant
reporting party after discovery of an error as required under Rule 905(a)(1). The Commission
estimates that the annual burden will be 998,640 hours, which corresponds to 208.05 burden
hours per non-reporting-side participant. 1128 This figure is based on the Commission’s estimate
of (1) 4,800 participants; and (2) 1 transaction per day per non-reporting-side participant. 1129
The burdens of Rule 905 on reporting sides and non-reporting-side participants will be reduced
to the extent that complete and accurate information is reported to registered SDRs in the first
instance pursuant to Rule 901.
Rule 905(b) requires a registered SDR to develop protocols regarding the reporting and
correction of erroneous information. The Commission believes, however, that this duty would
represent only a minor extension of other duties for which the Commission is estimating
burdens, and consequently, will not impose substantial additional burdens on a registered SDR.
A registered SDR will be required to have the ability to collect and maintain security-based swap
transaction reports and update relevant records under the rules adopted in the SDR Adopting
Release. Likewise, a registered SDR must have the capacity to disseminate additional, corrected
security-based swap transaction reports under Rule 902. The burdens associated with Rule
1128

This burden was calculated using the same methodology as was used in the Regulation
SBSR Proposing Release, updated to account for new estimates of the number of error
notifications resulting from updates in the number of reportable events. See Regulation
SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75255. This figure is based on the following: [(1.14
error notifications per non-reporting-side participant per day) x (365 days/year) x
(Compliance Clerk at 0.5 hours/report) x (4,800 participants)] = 998,640 burden hours,
which corresponds to 208.05 burden hours per non-reporting-side participant.

1129

This figure is based on the following: [((2,000,000 estimated annual security-based swap
transactions) / (4,800 participants)) / (365 days/year)] = 1.14 transactions per day, on
average.

450

905—including systems development, support, and maintenance—are addressed in the
Commission’s analysis of those other rules. Thus, the Commission believes that Rule 905(b)
will impose only an incremental additional burden on registered SDRs. The Commission
estimates that developing and publicly providing the necessary procedures will impose on each
registered SDR an initial one-time burden on each registered SDR of approximately 730 burden
hours. 1130 The Commission estimates that to review and update such procedures on an ongoing
basis will impose an annual burden on each SDR of approximately 1,460 burden hours. 1131
Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the initial (first-year) aggregate annualized
burden on registered SDRs under Rule 905 will be 21,900 burden hours, which corresponds to
2,190 burden hours for each registered SDR. 1132 The Commission further estimates that the
ongoing aggregate annualized burden on registered SDRs under Rule 905 will be 14,600 burden
hours, which corresponds to 1,460 burden hours for each registered SDR. 1133 This estimated
burden is consistent with what the Commission proposed in the Regulation SBSR Proposing
Release.

(Compliance Attorney at 250 hours) + (Compliance Clerk at 120 hours) + (Sr. System
Analyst at 80 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 40 hours)] = 730 burden hours.

1132

This figure is based on the following: [(730 burden hours to develop protocols) + (1,460
burden hours annual support)) x (10 registered SDRs)] = 21,900 burden hours, which
corresponds to 2,190 burden hours per registered SDR.

1133

This figure is based on the following: [(1,460 burden hours annual support) x (10
registered SDRs)] = 14,600 burden hours, which corresponds to 1,460 burden hours per
registered SDR.

451

Security-based swap transaction reports received pursuant to Rule 905 are subject to Rule
13n-5(b)(4) under the Exchange Act. This rule requires an SDR to maintain the transaction data
and related identifying information for not less than five years after the applicable security-based
swap expires and historical positions for not less than five years. 1134
With respect to information disseminated by a registered SDR in compliance with Rule
905(b)(2), Rule 13n-7(b) under the Exchange Act requires an SDR to keep and preserve at least
one copy of all documents, including all policies and procedures required by the Exchange Act
and the rules or regulations thereunder, for a period of not less than five years, the first two years
in a place that is immediately available to representatives of the Commission for inspection and
examination. 1135 This requirement encompasses amended security-based swap transaction
reports disseminated by the registered SDR.

Confidentiality of Responses to Collection of Information

Information collected pursuant to Rule 905 will be widely available to the extent that it
corrects information previously reported pursuant to Rule 901(c) and incorporated into securitybased swap transaction reports that are publicly disseminated by a registered SDR pursuant to
Rule 902. Most of the information required under Rule 902 will be widely available to the
public to the extent it is incorporated into security-based swap transaction reports that are
publicly disseminated by a registered SDR pursuant to Rule 902. However, Rule 902(c)
prohibits public dissemination of certain kinds of transactions and certain kinds of transaction

information. An SDR, pursuant to Sections 13(n)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13n-4(b)(8)
and 13n-9 thereunder is required to maintain the privacy of this security-based swap information.
To the extent that the Commission receives confidential information pursuant to this collection
of information, such information will be kept confidential, subject to the provisions of applicable
law.
G.

Other Duties of Participants—Rule 906

Rule 906(a), as adopted, establishes procedures designed to ensure that a registered SDR
obtains UICs for both counterparties to a security-based swap. Rule 906(b) requires each
participant of a registered SDR to provide to the registered SDR information sufficient to
identify its ultimate parent(s) and any affiliate(s) of the participant that also are participants of
the registered SDR. Rule 906(c) requires each participant that is a registered security-based
swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant to establish, maintain, and
enforce written policies and procedures (updated at least annually) that are reasonably designed
to ensure compliance with any security-based swap transaction reporting obligations in a manner
consistent with Regulation SBSR.
Certain provisions of Rule 906 of Regulation SBSR contain “collection of information
requirements” within the meaning of the PRA. The title of this collection is “Rule 906—Duties
of All Participants.”
Although the Commission is adopting Rule 906 with certain minor changes from the
version re-proposed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, these changes do not increase the
number of respondents to Rule 906 or affect the estimated burdens on respondents to Rule 906.
Therefore, the Commission is not revising its estimate of the burdens associated with Rule 906.
1.

Summary of Collection of Information

453

Rule 906(a) sets forth a procedure designed to ensure that a registered SDR obtains
relevant UICs for both sides of a security-based swap, not just of the reporting side. Rule 906(a)
requires a registered SDR to identify any security-based swap reported to it for which the
registered SDR does not have a counterparty ID and (if applicable) broker ID, trading desk ID,
and trader ID of each counterparty. Rule 906(a) further requires the registered SDR, once a day,
to send a report to each participant identifying, for each security-based swap to which that
participant is a counterparty, the security-based swap(s) for which the registered SDR lacks
counterparty ID and (if applicable) broker ID, trading desk ID, and trader ID. A participant that
receives such a report must provide the missing ID information to the registered SDR within 24
hours.
Rule 906(b) requires each participant of a registered SDR to provide the registered SDR
with information sufficient to identify the participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any affiliate(s) of
the participant that are also participants of the registered SDR.
Rule 906(c) requires each participant that is a registered security-based swap dealer or
registered major security-based swap participant to establish, maintain, and enforce written
policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with any securitybased swap transaction reporting obligations in a manner consistent with Regulation SBSR. In
addition, Rule 906(c) requires each such participant to review and update its policies and
procedures at least annually.
2.

Use of Information

The information required to be provided by participants pursuant to Rule 906(a) will
complete missing elements of security-based swap transaction reports so that the registered SDR

454

has, and can make available to the Commission and other relevant authorities, accurate and
complete records for reported security-based swaps.
Rule 906(b) will be used to ensure that the registered SDR has, and can make available to
the Commission and other relevant authorities, group-wide security-based swap position
information. This information will assist the Commission and other relevant authorities with
monitoring systemic risks in the security-based swap market.
The policies and procedures required under Rule 906(c) will be used by participants to
aid in their compliance with Regulation SBSR, and also used by the Commission as part of its
ongoing efforts to monitor and enforce compliance with the federal securities laws, including
Regulation SBSR.
3.

Respondents

Rules 906(a) and 906(b) apply to all participants of registered SDRs. Based on the
information currently available to the Commission, the Commission now believes that there may
be up to 4,800 participants. 1136 Rule 906(c) applies to participants that are registered securitybased swap dealers or registered major security-based swap participants. The Commission
estimates that there will be 55 registered security-based swap dealers and registered major
security-based swap dealers.
Rule 906 also imposes certain duties on registered SDRs. As noted above, the
Commission estimates that there will be ten registered SDRs.
4.

1136

Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens

The Commission originally estimated that there would be up to 5,000 participants. As
discussed above, based on more updated and granular information available to the
Commission, this estimate has been revised. See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release,
75 FR at 75256.

455

a.

For Registered SDRs

Rule 906(a) requires a registered SDR, once a day, to send a report to each participant
identifying, for each security-based swap to which that participant is a counterparty, any
security-based swap(s) for which the registered SDR lacks counterparty ID and (if applicable)
broker ID, trading desk ID, and trader ID. The Commission estimates that there will be a onetime, initial burden of 112 burden hours for a registered SDR to create a report template and
develop the necessary systems and processes to produce a daily report required by Rule
906(a). 1137 Further, the Commission estimates that there will be an ongoing annualized burden
of 308 burden hours for a registered SDR to generate and issue the daily reports, and to enter into
its systems the ID information supplied by participants in response to the daily reports. 1138
Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the initial aggregate annualized burden for
registered SDRs under Rule 906(a) will be 4,200 burden hours for all SDR respondents, which
corresponds to 420 burden hours per registered SDR. 1139 The Commission estimates that the

1137

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75256. The Commission has derived
the total estimated burdens based on the following estimates, which are based on the
information provided to the Commission: (Senior Systems Analyst at 40 hours) + (Sr.
Programmer at 40 hours) + (Compliance Manager at 16 hours) + (Director of Compliance
at 8 hours) + (Compliance Attorney at 8 hours) = 112 burden hours.

1138

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75256-57. The Commission has
derived the total estimated burdens based on the following estimates, which are based on
the information provided to the Commission: (Senior Systems Analyst at 24 hours) + (Sr.
Programmer at 24 hours) + (Compliance Clerk at 260 hours) = 308 burden hours.

1139

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75256-57. The Commission derived
its estimate from the following: [(112 + 308 burden hours) x (10 registered SDRs)] =
4,200 burden hours, which corresponds to 420 burden hours per registered SDR.

456

ongoing aggregate annualized burden for registered SDRs under Rule 906(a) will be 3,080
burden hours, which corresponds to 308 burden hours per registered SDR. 1140
b.

For Participants
i.

Rule 906(a)

Rule 906(a) requires any participant of a registered SDR that receives a report from that
registered SDR to provide the missing UICs to the registered SDR within 24 hours. Because all
SDR participants will likely be the non-reporting side for at least some transactions to which
they are a counterparty, the Commission believes that all participants will be impacted by Rule
906(a). The Commission estimates that the initial and ongoing annualized burden under Rule
906(a) for all participants will be 199,728 burden hours, which corresponds to 41.6 burden hours
per participant. 1141 This figure is based on the Commission’s estimates of (1) 4,800 participants;
and (2) approximately 1.14 transactions per day per participant. 1142
ii.

Rule 906(b)

Rule 906(b) requires every participant to provide the registered SDR an initial
parent/affiliate report and subsequent reports, as needed. The Commission estimates that there

1140

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75256-57. The Commission derived
its estimate from the following: [(308 burden hours) x (10 registered SDRs)] = 3,080
burden hours, which corresponds to 308 burden hours per registered SDR.

1141

This burden was calculated using the same methodology as was used in the Regulation
SBSR Proposing Release, updated to account for new estimates of the number of missing
information reports resulting from updates in the number of reportable events. See
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75256-57. This figure is based on the
following: [(1.14 missing information reports per participant per day) x (365 days/year)
x (Compliance Clerk at 0.1 hours/report) x (4,800 participants) = 199,728 burden hours,
which corresponds to 41.6 burden hours per participant.

1142

This figure is based on the following: [((2,000,000 estimated annual security-based swap
transactions) / 4,800 participants)) / (365 days/year)] = 1.14 transactions per day, or
approximately 1 transaction per day.

457

will be 4,800 participants, that each participant will connect to two registered SDRs on average,
and that each participant will submit two reports each year. 1143 Accordingly, the Commission
estimates that the initial and ongoing aggregate annualized burden associated with Rule 906(b)
will be 9,600 burden hours, which corresponds to 2 burden hours per participant. 1144 The
aggregate burden represents an upper estimate for all participants; the actual burden will likely
decrease because certain larger participants are likely to have multiple affiliates, and one member
of the group could report ultimate parent and affiliate information on behalf of all of its affiliates
at the same time.
b.

For Covered Participants

Rule 906(c) requires each participant that is a registered security-based swap dealer or
registered major security-based swap participant (each, a “covered participant”) to establish,
maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure
compliance with any security-based swap transaction reporting obligations in a manner
consistent with Regulation. Rule 906(c) also requires the review and updating of such policies
and procedures at least annually. The Commission estimates that the one-time, initial burden for
each covered participant to adopt written policies and procedures as required under Rule 906(c)
will be approximately 216 burden hours. 1145 As discussed in the Regulation SBSR Proposing
1143

The Commission estimates that, during the first year, each participant will submit an
initial report and one update report and, in subsequent years, will submit two update
reports.

1144

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75257. This figure is based on the
following: [(Compliance Clerk at 0.5 hours per report) x (2 reports/year/SDR
connection) x (2 SDR connections/participant) x (4,800 participants)] = 9,600 burden
hours, which corresponds to 2 burden hours per participant.

1145

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75257. This figure is based on the
following: [(Sr. Programmer at 40 hours) + (Compliance Manager at 40 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney at 40 hours) + (Compliance Clerk at 40 hours) + (Sr. Systems
458

Release, 1146 this figure is based on the estimated number of hours to develop a set of written
policies and procedures, program systems, implement internal controls and oversight, train
relevant employees, and perform necessary testing. In addition, the Commission estimates the
burden of maintaining such policies and procedures, including a full review at least annually, as
required by Rule 906(c), will be approximately 120 burden hours for each covered
participant. 1147 This figure includes an estimate of hours related to reviewing existing policies
and procedures, making necessary updates, conducting ongoing training, maintaining internal
controls systems, and performing necessary testing. Accordingly, the Commission estimates that
the initial aggregate annualized burden associated with Rule 906(c) will be 18,480 burden hours,
which corresponds to 336 burden hours per covered participant. 1148 The Commission estimates
that the ongoing aggregate annualized burden associated with Rule 906(c) will be 6,600 burden
hours, which corresponds to 120 burden hours per covered participant. 1149

Analyst at 32 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 24 hours)] = 216 burden hours per
covered participant.
1146

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75257.

1147

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75257. This figure is based on the
following: [(Sr. Programmer at 8 hours) + (Compliance Manager at 24 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney at 24 hours) + (Compliance Clerk at 24 hours) + (Sr. Systems
Analyst at 16 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 24 hours)] = 120 burden hours per
covered participant.

1148

This figure is based on the following: [(216 + 120 burden hours) x (55 covered
participants)] = 18,480 burden hours.

1149

This figure is based on the following: [(120 burden hours) x (55 covered participants)] =
6,600 burden hours.

459

Therefore, the Commission estimates that the total initial aggregate annualized burden
associated with Rule 906 will be 232,008 burden hours, 1150 and the total ongoing aggregate
annualized burden will be 219,008 burden hours for all participants. 1151
5.

Recordkeeping Requirements

The daily reports that participants complete in order to provide missing UICs to a
registered SDR pursuant to Rule 906(a) and the initial parent/affiliate reports and subsequent
reports required by Rule 906(b) are not subject to any specific recordkeeping requirements for
participants to the extent that these participants are non-registered persons. 1152 With regard to
these reports, as well as any other information that a registered SDR may receive from
participants pursuant to Rule 906, Rule 13n-5(b)(4) requires an SDR to maintain this information
for not less than five years after the applicable security-based swap expires. 1153
The Commission has proposed but not yet adopted recordkeeping requirements for
registered security-based swap dealers and registered major security-based swap participants. 1154
6.

Collection of Information is Mandatory

1150

This figure is based on the following: [(4,200 burden hours for registered SDRs under
Rule 906(a)) + (199,728 burden hours for participants under Rule 906(a)) + (9,600
burden hours for participants under Rule 906(b)) + (18,480 burden hours for covered
participants under Rule 906(c))] = 232,008 burden hours.

1151

This figure is based on the following: [(3,080 burden hours for registered SDRs under
proposed Rule 906(a)) + (199,728 burden hours for participants under proposed Rule
906(a)) + (9,600 burden hours for participants under proposed Rule 906(b)) + (6,600
burden hours for covered participants under proposed Rule 906(c))] = 219,008 burden
hours.

Policies and Procedures of Registered SDRs—Rule 907

Rule 907, as adopted, requires each registered SDR to establish and maintain policies and
procedures addressing various aspects of Regulation SBSR compliance. Certain provisions of
Rule 907 of Regulation SBSR contain “collection of information requirements” within the
meaning of the PRA. The title of this collection is “Rule 907—Policies and Procedures of
Registered SDRs.”
1.

Summary of Collection of Information

Rule 907(a) requires a registered SDR to establish and maintain written policies and
procedures that detail how it will receive and publicly disseminate security-based swap
transaction information. Rule 907(a)(4) requires policies and procedures for assigning “special
circumstances” flags to the necessary transaction reports.
Rule 907(c) requires a registered SDR to make its policies and procedures available on its
website. Rule 907(d) requires a registered SDR to review, and update as necessary, the policies
and procedures that it is required to have by Regulation SBSR at least annually. Rule 907(e)
requires a registered SDR to provide to the Commission, upon request, information or reports
related to the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of data reported to it pursuant to Regulation
SBSR and the registered SDR’s policies and procedures established thereunder.
2.

Use of Information

461

The policies and procedures required under Rules 907(a) and 907(b) will be used by
reporting sides to understand the specific data elements of security-based swap transactions that
they must report and the specific data formats and other reporting protocols that they will be
required to use. These policies and procedures will be used generally by registered SDRs to aid
in their compliance with Regulation SBSR, and also by the Commission as part of its ongoing
efforts to monitor and enforce compliance with the federal securities laws, including Regulation
SBSR. Finally, any information or reports provided to the Commission pursuant to Rule 907(e)
will be used by the Commission to assess the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of reported
transaction data and assist the Commission’s efforts to enforce applicable security-based swap
reporting rules.
3.

Respondents

Rule 907 applies to registered SDRs. As noted above, the Commission estimates that
there will be ten registered SDRs.
4.

Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens

The Commission estimates that the one-time, initial burden for a registered SDR to adopt
written policies and procedures as required under Rule 907 will be approximately 15,000
hours. 1155 As discussed in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, this figure is based on the
estimated number of hours to develop a set of written policies and procedures, program systems,
implement internal controls and oversight, train relevant employees, and perform necessary
1155

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75259. This figure is based on the
following: [(Sr. Programmer at 1,667 hours) + (Compliance Manager at 3,333 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney at 5,000 hours) + (Compliance Clerk at 2,500 hours) + (Sr. System
Analyst at 1,667 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 833 hours)] = 15,000 burden hours
per registered SDR. These burdens are the result of Rule 907 only and do not account for
any burdens that result from the SDR Rules. Such burdens are addressed in a separate
release. See SDR Adopting Release, Section VII.

462

testing. 1156 In addition, the Commission estimates the annual burden of maintaining such
policies and procedures, including a full review at least annually, making available its policies
and procedures on the registered SDR’s website, and information or reports on non-compliance,
as required under Rule 907(e), will be approximately 30,000 hours for each registered SDR. 1157
As discussed in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, this figure includes an estimate of
hours related to reviewing existing policies and procedures, making necessary updates,
conducting ongoing training, maintaining relevant systems and internal controls systems,
performing necessary testing, monitoring participants, and compiling data.
The Commission estimates that the initial annualized burden associated with Rule 907
will be approximately 45,000 hours per registered SDR, which corresponds to an initial
annualized aggregate burden of approximately 450,000 hours. 1158 The Commission estimates
that the ongoing annualized burden associated with Rule 907 will be approximately 30,000 hours
per registered SDR, 1159 which corresponds to an ongoing annualized aggregate burden of
approximately 300,000 hours. 1160

1156

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75259. This figure also includes time
necessary to design and program systems and implement policies and procedures to
assign certain UICs, as required by Rule 907(a)(5).

1157

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75259. This figure is based on the
following: [(Sr. Programmer at 3,333 hours) + (Compliance Manager at 6,667 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney at 10,000 hours) + (Compliance Clerk at 5,000 hours) + (Sr.
System Analyst at 3,333 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 1,667 hours)] = 30,000
burden hours per registered SDR.

1158

This figure is based on the following: [((15,000 burden hours per registered SDR) +
(30,000 burden hours per registered SDR)) x (10 registered SDRs)] = 450,000 initial
annualized aggregate burden hours during the first year.

Recordkeeping Requirements

Rule 13n-7(b) under the Exchange Act requires an SDR to keep and preserve at least one
copy of all documents, including all documents and policies and procedures required by the
Exchange Act and the rules or regulations thereunder, for a period of not less than five years, the
first two years in a place that is immediately available to representatives of the Commission for
inspection and examination. This requirement will encompass policies and procedures
established by a registered SDR pursuant to Rule 907, and any information or reports provided to
the Commission pursuant to Rule 907(e).
6.

Collection of Information is Mandatory

Each collection of information discussed is mandatory.
7.

Confidentiality of Responses to Collection of Information

All of the policies and procedures required by Rule 907 will have to be made available by
a registered SDR on its website and will not, therefore, be confidential. Any information
obtained by the Commission from a registered SDR pursuant to Rule 907(e) relating to the
timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of data reported to the registered SDR will be kept
confidential subject to the provisions of applicable law.
I.

Cross-Border Matters—Rule 908

Rule 908(a), as adopted, defines when a security-based swap transaction will be subject
to regulatory reporting and/or public dissemination. Specifically, Rule 908(a)(1)(i), as adopted,
provides that a security-based swap shall be subject to regulatory reporting and public

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75259. This figure is based on the
following: [(30,000 burden hours per registered SDR) x (10 registered SDRs)] = 300,000
ongoing, annualized aggregate burden hours.

464

dissemination if “[t]here is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on either or both
sides of the transaction.” Rule 908(a)(1)(ii), as adopted, provides that a security-based swap
shall be subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination if “[t]he security-based swap is
submitted to a clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United States.” Rule
908(a)(2), as adopted, provides that a security-based swap not included within the above
provisions would be subject to regulatory reporting but not public dissemination “if there is a
direct or indirect counterparty on either or both sides of the transaction that is a registered
security-based swap dealer or a registered major security-based swap participant.”
Regulation 908(b), as adopted, defines when a person might incur obligations under
Regulation SBSR. Specifically, Rule 908(b) provides that, notwithstanding any other provision
of Regulation SBSR, a person shall not incur any obligation under Regulation SBSR unless it is
a U.S. person, a registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap
participant.
Rules 908(a) and 908(b) do not impose any collection of information requirements. To
the extent that a security-based swap transaction or counterparty is subject to Rule 908(a) or
908(b), respectively, the collection of information burdens are calculated as part of the
underlying rule (e.g., Rule 901, which imposes the basic duty to report security-based swap
transaction information).
Rule 908(c), as adopted, sets forth the requirements surrounding requests for substituted
compliance. As adopted, Rule 908(c)(1) sets forth the general rule that compliance with the
regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements in sections 13(m) and 13A of the Act
(15 U.S.C. 78m(m) and 78m-1), and the rules and regulations thereunder, may be satisfied by
compliance with the rules of a foreign jurisdiction that is the subject of a Commission order

465

described in Rule 908(c)(2), provided that at least one of the direct counterparties is either a nonU.S. person or a foreign branch.
Rule 908(c) contains “collection of information requirements” within the meaning of the
PRA. The title of this collection is “Rule 908(c)—Substituted Compliance.”
1.

Summary of Collection of Information

A party that potentially would comply with requirements under Regulation SBSR
pursuant to a substituted compliance order or any foreign financial regulatory authority or
authorities supervising such a person’s security-based swap activities, may file an application
requesting that the Commission make a substituted compliance determination pursuant to Rule
0-13 under the Exchange Act. 1161 Such entity will be required to provide the Commission with
any supporting documentation as the Commission may request, in addition to information that
the entity believes is necessary for the Commission to make a determination, such as information
demonstrating that the requirements applied in the foreign jurisdiction are comparable to the
Commission’s and describing the methods used by relevant foreign financial regulatory
authorities to monitor compliance with those requirements.
2.

Use of Information

The Commission will use the information collected pursuant to Rule 908(c)(2)(ii) to
evaluate requests for substituted compliance with regard to regulatory reporting and public
dissemination of security-based swaps.
3.

Respondents

In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission preliminarily estimated that
requests for substituted compliance determinations might arise in connection with security-based
1161

See 17 CFR 200.0-13; Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47357-60.

466

swap market participants and transactions in up to 30 discrete jurisdictions. 1162 Because only a
small number of jurisdictions have substantial OTC derivatives markets and are implementing
OTC derivatives reforms, the Commission preliminarily estimated that it would receive
approximately ten requests in the first year for substituted compliance determinations with
respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination pursuant to Rule 908(c)(2)(ii), and two
requests each subsequent year. 1163 Although the range of entities that are allowed to submit
applications for substituted compliance has increased, the Commission does not believe that this
warrants a change in its estimate of the number of requests that the Commission will receive.
The Commission continues to believe that other considerations will determine the number of
applications that it will receive, such as which jurisdictions have regulatory structures similar
enough to the Commission’s as to merit a request and the number of entities potentially impacted
by Regulation SBSR.
4.

Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens

Rule 908(c)(2)(ii), as adopted, applies to any person that requests a substituted
compliance determination with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination of
security-based swaps. In connection with each request, the requesting party must provide the
Commission with any supporting documentation that the entity believes is necessary for the
Commission to make a determination, including information demonstrating that the requirements
applied in the foreign jurisdiction are comparable to the Commission’s and describing the
methods used by relevant foreign financial regulatory authorities to monitor compliance with
1162

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31109-10.

1163

See id. at 31110. Rule 908(c)(2)(ii), as adopted, allows “[a] party that potentially would
comply with requirements under [Regulation SBSR]…or any foreign financial regulatory
authority or authorities supervising such a person’s security-based swap activities may
file an application.”

467

those requirements. The Commission initially estimated, in the Cross-Border Proposing Release,
that the total paperwork burden associated with submitting a request for a substituted compliance
determination with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination will be
approximately 1,120 hours, plus $1,120,000 for 14 requests. 1164 This estimate includes all
collection burdens associated with the request, including burdens associated with analyzing
whether the regulatory requirements of the foreign jurisdiction impose a comparable,
comprehensive system for the regulatory reporting and public dissemination of all security-based
swaps. Furthermore, this estimate assumes that each request will be prepared de novo, without
any benefit of prior work on related subjects. The Commission notes, however, that as such
requests are developed with respect to certain jurisdictions, the cost of preparing such requests
with respect to other foreign jurisdictions could decrease. 1165
Assuming ten requests in the first year, the Commission staff estimated an aggregated
burden for the first year will be 800 hours, plus $800,000 for the services of outside
professionals. 1166 The Commission preliminarily estimated that it would receive 2 requests for
substituted compliance determinations pursuant to Rule 908(c)(2)(ii) in each subsequent year.
1164

The Commission staff estimates that the paperwork burden associated with making a
substituted compliance request pursuant to Rule 908(c)(2)(ii) will be approximately 80 of
in-house counsel time, plus $80,000 for the services of outside professionals (based on
200 hours of outside counsel time x $400). See id., Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78
FR at 31110

1165

If and when the Commission grants a request for substituted compliance, subsequent
applications might be able to leverage work done on the initial application. However, the
Commission is unable to estimate the amount by which the cost could decrease without
knowing the extent to which different jurisdictions have similar regulatory structures.

1166

The Commission staff estimates that the paperwork burden associated with making a
substituted compliance request pursuant to Rule 242.908(c)(2)(ii) will be up to
approximately 800 hours (80 hours of in-house counsel time x 10 respondents), plus
$800,000 for the services of outside professionals (based on 200 hours of outside counsel
time x $400 x 10 respondents). See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31110.

468

Assuming the same approximate time and costs, the aggregate burden for each year following
the first year will be up to 160 hours of company time and $160,000 for the services of outside
professionals. 1167
5.

Recordkeeping Requirements

Rule 908(c)(2)(ii) does not impose any recordkeeping requirements on entities that
submit requests for a substituted compliance determination. The Commission has proposed but
not yet adopted recordkeeping requirements for registered security-based swap dealers.
6.

Collection of Information is Mandatory

The collection of information discussed above is mandatory for any entity seeking a
substituted compliance determination from the Commission regarding regulatory reporting and
public dissemination of security-based swaps.
7.

Confidentiality of Responses to Collection of Information

The Commission generally intends to make public the information submitted to it
pursuant to any request for a substituted compliance determination under Rule 908(c)(2)(ii),
including supporting documentation provided by the requesting party. However, a requesting
party may submit a confidential treatment request pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Exchange
Act to object to public disclosure.

Registration of SDRs as Securities Information Processors—Rule 909

Rule 909 requires a registered SDR also to register with the Commission as a SIP on
Form SDR. Previously, in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission had
1167

The Commission staff estimates that the paperwork burden associated with making a
substituted compliance request pursuant to Rule 242.908(c)(2)(ii) would be up to
approximately 160 hours (80 hours of in-house counsel time x 2 respondents) + plus
$160,000 for the services of outside professionals (based on 200 hours of outside counsel
time x $400 x 2 respondents). See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31110.

469

proposed the use of a separate form, Form SIP. Based on the use of that form, the Commission
stated in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release that Rule 909 contained “collection of
information requirements” within the meaning of the PRA and thus, the Commission
preliminarily estimated certain burdens on registered SDRs that would result from Rule 909. 1168
As a result of the consolidation of SDR and SIP registration on a single form, the Commission
now believes that Rule 909 does not constitute a separate “collection of information” within the
meaning of the PRA. 1169
XXII. Economic Analysis
The Commission is sensitive to the economic consequences and effects, including costs
and benefits, of its rules. Some of these costs and benefits stem from statutory mandates, while
others are affected by the discretion exercised in implementing the mandates. The following
economic analysis identifies and considers the costs and benefits—including the effects on
efficiency, competition, and capital formation—that may result from the rules, as adopted .
These costs and benefits are discussed below and have informed the policy choices described
throughout this release.
The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Exchange Act to require the regulatory reporting and
public dissemination of all security-based swaps. To implement these requirements, Regulation
SBSR requires that all security-based swaps to be reported to a registered SDR, and requires the
registered SDR immediately to disseminate a subset of that information to the public.
Regulation SBSR specifies the security-based swap information that must be reported, who has
the duty to report, and the timeframes for reporting and disseminating information. Regulation
1168

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75261.

1169

See SDR Adopting Release, Section VI(A)(1)(c).

470

SBSR also requires registered SDRs to establish policies and procedures governing the reporting
and dissemination process, including procedures for utilizing unique identification codes for
legal entities, units of legal entities (such as branches, trading desks, and individual traders),
products, and transactions. In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission
highlighted certain overarching benefits to the security-based swap markets that it preliminarily
believed would result from the adoption of Regulation SBSR. These potential benefits include,
generally, improved market quality, improved risk management, greater efficiency, and
improved Commission oversight. 1170
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission re-proposed Regulation SBSR
in its entirety and considered the changes to the initial assessments of costs and benefits
associated with the re-proposed rules. In doing so, the Commission explained that Regulation
SBSR is intended to further the goals highlighted in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release,
while further limiting, to the extent practicable, the overall costs to the security-based swap
market associated with regulatory reporting and public dissemination in cross-border
situations. 1171 The adopted rules are designed to limit overall costs by imposing reporting duties
and the associated costs on those parties who are most likely to have the necessary infrastructure
in place to carry out the reporting function. 1172 As the Commission noted, many of the revisions
1170

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75261-62.

1171

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31196-97.

1172

While certain parties that generally will have the heaviest duties to report transactions
(e.g., registered security-based swap dealers and registered major security-based swap
participants) will incur costs, the costs of those parties generally will be lower than they
would be for other parties (e.g., non-dealers) because those parties may already have the
necessary infrastructure in place to report transactions and they will benefit from
economies of scale due to the high volume of transactions that flows through them
compared to other parties. Although security-based swap dealers and major securitybased swap participants might pass on these costs, at least in part, to their non-reporting
471

set forth in the re-proposal were suggested by commenters to the initial proposal and were
designed, among other things, to better align reporting duties with larger entities that have
greater resources and capability to report and to reduce the potential for duplicative reporting.
The Commission stated that the revisions should help to limit, to the extent practicable, the
overall costs to the security-based swap market associated with reporting in cross-border
situations. 1173
The Commission is now adopting Regulation SBSR, with certain revisions discussed in
Sections I through XVII, supra.
In assessing the economic impact of the rules, the Commission refers to the broader costs
and benefits associated with the application of the adopted rules as “programmatic” costs and
benefits. These include the costs and benefits of applying the substantive Title VII requirements
to the reporting of transactions by market participants, as well as to the functions performed by
infrastructure participants (such as SDRs) in the security-based swap market. In several places
the Commission also considers how the programmatic costs and benefits might change when
comparing the adopted approach to other alternatives suggested by comment letters. The
Commission’s analysis also considers “assessment” costs—those that arise from current and
future market participants expending resources to determine whether they are subject to
Regulation SBSR, and could incur expenses in making this determination even if they ultimately
are not subject to rules for which they made an assessment.

counterparties, the costs that are passed on to non-reporting parties are likely to be lower
than the costs that the non-reporting parties would face if they had direct responsibility to
report these transactions.
1173

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31192.

472

The Commission’s analysis also recognizes that certain market participants are subject to
Regulation SBSR while potentially also being subject to requirements imposed by other
regulators. Concurrent, and potentially duplicative or conflicting, regulatory requirements could
be imposed on persons because of their resident or domicile status or because of the place their
security-based swap transactions are conducted. Rule 908(c) establishes a mechanism whereby
market participants who would be subject to both Regulation SBSR and a foreign regulatory
regime could, subject to certain conditions, “substitute compliance” with the foreign regulatory
regime for compliance with Regulation SBSR.
A.

Broad Economic Considerations

Among the primary economic considerations for promulgating the rules on the regulatory
reporting and public dissemination of security-based swap information are the risks to financial
stability posed by security-based swap activity and exposures and the effect that the level of
transparency in the security-based swap market may have on market participants’ ability to
efficiently execute trades. For example, on one hand, an increased level of transparency may
make trading more efficient since market participants have additional information on which to
base their trading decisions. On the other hand, if post-trade transparency makes hedging of
large trades or trades in illiquid securities more difficult, it may make execution of these trades
less efficient. 1174
As the Commission has noted previously, 1175 the security-based swap market allows
participants opportunities for efficient risk sharing. By transacting in security-based swaps,
firms can lay off financial and commercial risks that they are unwilling to bear to counterparties
1174

See Analysis of Post-Trade Transparency, in which Commission staff describes the
effects of post-trade transparency on relatively illiquid swaps.

1175

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47283-85.

473

who may be better-equipped to bear them. Risk transfer is accomplished through contractual
obligations to exchange cash flows with different risk characteristics. These opportunities for
risk sharing, however, also represent opportunities for risk transmission through a variety of
channels. For instance, a credit event that triggers a large payout to one counterparty by a seller
of credit protection, may render that protection seller unable to meet other payment obligations,
placing its other counterparties under financial strain. In addition to the risk of sequential
counterparty default, security-based swap relationships can transmit risks across asset classes and
jurisdictional boundaries through liquidity and asset price channels.
Unlike most other securities transactions, security-based swaps entail ongoing financial
obligations between counterparties during the life of a transaction that could span several years.
As a result of these ongoing obligations, market participants are exposed not only to the market
risk of assets that underlie a security-based swap contract, but also to the credit risk of their
counterparties until the transaction is terminated. These exposures create a web of financial
relationships in which the failure of a single large firm active in the security-based swap market
can have consequences beyond the firm itself. A default by such a firm, or even the perceived
lack of creditworthiness of that firm, could produce contagion through sequential counterparty
default or reductions in liquidity, willingness to extend credit, and valuations for financial
instruments. 1176
Currently, the security-based swap market is an OTC market without standardized

1176

See, e.g., Markus K. Brunnermeier and Lasse Heje Pedersen, “Market Liquidity and
Funding Liquidity,” Review of Financial Studies (2009); Denis Gromb and Dimitri
Vayanos, “A Model of Financial Market Liquidity,” Journal of the European Economic
Association (2010).

474

reporting or public dissemination requirements. 1177 Market participants observe only the details
of transactions for which they are a counterparty, and there is no comprehensive and widely
available source of information about transactions after they occur (post-trade transparency). As
a result, the ability of a market participant to evaluate a potential transaction depends on its own
transaction history and indicative (non-binding) quotes that it may obtain through fee-based
services, and OTC market participants with the largest order flow have an informational
advantage over other market participants. The value of private information to large dealers may,
in part, explain why security-based swap market participants do not have sufficient incentive to
voluntarily implement post-trade transparency. 1178 Additionally, unless all market participants
are subject to reporting rules, market participants who may prefer a more transparent market
structure may not believe that the benefits of disseminating data about their own limited order
flow justifies the costs associated with building and paying for the necessary infrastructure to
support public dissemination of transaction information.
The discussion below presents an overview of the OTC derivatives markets, a
consideration of the general costs and benefits of the regulatory reporting and public
dissemination requirements, and a discussion of the costs and benefits of each rule within
Regulation SBSR. The economic analysis concludes with a discussion of the potential effects of
Regulation SBSR, as adopted, on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.
1177

There is voluntary reporting as well as voluntary clearing, as discussed in Section
XXII(B). However, transaction level information is not made public through these
channels. Only limited information (e.g., trading volume and notional outstanding) is
available publicly on an aggregate basis, and often with a delay.

1178

Throughout Section XXII, the term “dealers” refers to security-based swap market
participant that engage in dealing activities while the term “registered dealers” are those
required to register with the Commission. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting
Release, 77 FR at 30596; Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47277.

B.

Baseline

To assess the economic impact of the final rules described in this release, the
Commission is using as a baseline the security-based swap market as it exists at the time of this
release, including applicable rules adopted by the Commission but excluding rules that have been
proposed but not yet finalized. The analysis includes the statutory and regulatory provisions that
currently govern the security-based swap market pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. The
Commission also has considered, where appropriate, the impacts on market practice of other
regulatory regimes.
1.

Current Security-Based Swap Market

The Commission’s analysis of the state of the current security-based swap market is
based on data obtained from DTCC-TIW, particularly data regarding the activity of market
participants in the single-name credit default swap (CDS) market during the period from 2008 to
2013. Some of the Commission staff’s analysis regarding the impact of CFTC trade reporting
rules entails the use of open positions and transaction activity data for index credit default swap
(index CDS) and single-name CDS during the period from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2013,
obtained from the DTCC-TIW and through the DTCC public website of weekly stock and
volume reports. 1179 The data for index CDS encompasses CDS on both broad-based security
indices and narrow-based security indices, and “security-based swap” in relevant part
encompasses swaps based on single securities or on narrow-based security indices. 1180

1179

1180

See Section 3(a)(68) of the Exchange Act. See also Product Definitions Adopting
Release, 77 FR at 48208.

476

While other trade repositories may collect data on transactions in total return swaps on
equity and debt, the Commission does not currently have access to such data for these products
(or other products that are security-based swaps). As such, the Commission is unable to analyze
security-based swaps other than those described above. However, the Commission believes that
the single-name CDS data are representative of the market and therefore can directly inform the
analysis of the state of the current security-based swap market. 1181
The Commission believes that the data underlying its analysis provides reasonably
comprehensive information regarding the single-name CDS transactions and composition of the
single-name CDS market participants. The Commission notes that the data available from
DTCC-TIW do not encompass those CDS transactions that both: (1) do not involve U.S.
counterparties 1182; and (2) are based on reference entities domiciled outside the United States
(non-U.S. reference entities). Notwithstanding this limitation, the Commission believes that the
DTCC-TIW data provide information that is sufficient for the purpose of identifying the types of
market participants active in the security-based swap market and the general characteristics of
transactions within that market. 1183
a.

Security-Based Swap Market Participants

The available data supports the characterization of the security-based swap market as one
that relies on intermediation by a small number of entities that engage in dealing activities. In
addition to this small number of dealing entities, thousands of other participants appear as

1181

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31120.

1182

The Commission notes that DTCC-TIW’s entity domicile determinations may not reflect
the definition of “U.S. person” in Rule 900(ss).

1183

Commission staff estimates, using data from 2013, that the transaction data include 77%
of all single-name CDS transactions reported to DTCC-TIW.

477

counterparties to security-based swap contracts in the sample, and include, but are not limited to,
investment companies, pension funds, private (hedge) funds, sovereign entities, and industrial
companies. Most non-dealer users of security-based swaps do not directly engage in the trading
of swaps with other non-dealers, but use dealers, banks, or investment advisers as intermediaries
or agents to establish their positions. Based on an analysis of the counterparties to trades
reported to the DTCC-TIW, there are 1,800 entities that engaged directly in trading between
November 2006 and December 2013.
Table 1, below, highlights that close to three-quarters of these entities (DTCC-defined
“firms” shown in DTCC-TIW, which are referred to here as “transacting agents”) were identified
as investment advisers, of which approximately 40% (about 30% of all transacting agents) were
registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. 1184 Although
investment advisers comprise the vast majority of transacting agents, the transactions that they
executed account for only 9.7% of all single-name CDS trading activity reported to the DTCCTIW, measured by number of transaction-sides. 1185 The vast majority of transactions (84.1%)
measured by number of transaction-sides were executed by ISDA-recognized dealers. 1186
1184

See 15 U.S.C. 80b1-80b21. Transacting agents engage in the security-based swap
market, without relying on an intermediary, on behalf of principals. For example, a
university endowment may hold a position in a security-based swap that is built up by an
investment adviser that transacts on the endowment’s behalf. In this case, the university
endowment is a principal that uses the investment adviser as a transacting agent.

1185

Each transaction has two transaction sides, i.e., two transaction counterparties.

1186

The 1,800 entities included all DTCC-defined “firms” shown in DTCC-TIW as
transaction counterparties that report at least one transaction to DTCC-TIW as of
December 2013. The staff in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis classified
these firms, which are shown as transaction counterparties, by machine matching names
to known third-party databases and by manual classification. This is consistent with the
methodology used in the re-proposal. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at
31120 note 1304. Manual classification was based in part on searches of the EDGAR
and Bloomberg databases, the Commission’s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure

Principal holders of CDS risk exposure are represented by “accounts” in the DTCCTIW. 1188 The staff’s analysis of these accounts in DTCC-TIW shows that the 1,800 transacting
agents classified in Table 1 represent over 10,054 principal risk holders. Table 2, below,
classifies these principal risk holders by their counterparty type and whether they are represented

database, and a firm’s public website or the public website of the account represented by
a firm. The staff also referred to ISDA protocol adherence letters available on the ISDA
website.
1187

For the purpose of this analysis, the ISDA-recognized dealers are those identified by
ISDA as belonging to the G14 or G16 dealer group during the period: JP Morgan Chase
NA (and Bear Stearns), Morgan Stanley, Bank of America NA (and Merrill Lynch),
Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank AG, Barclays Capital, Citigroup, UBS, Credit Suisse
AG, RBS Group, BNP Paribas, HSBC Bank, Lehman Brothers, Société Générale, Credit
Agricole, Wells Fargo, and Nomura. See, e.g., http://www.isda.org/c_and_a/pdf/ISDAOperations-Survey-2010.pdf (last visited September 22, 2014).

1188

“Accounts” as defined in the DTCC-TIW context are not equivalent to “accounts” in the
definition of “U.S. person” provided by Rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i)(C) under the Exchange Act.
They also do not necessarily represent separate legal persons. One entity or legal person
may have multiple accounts. For example, a bank may have one DTCC account for its
U.S. headquarters and one DTCC account for one of its foreign branches.

479

by a registered or unregistered investment adviser. 1189 For instance, 256 banks in Table 1
allocated transactions across 369 accounts, of which 30 were represented by investment advisers.
In the remaining 339 instances, banks traded for their own accounts. Meanwhile, 17 ISDArecognized dealers in Table 1 allocated transactions across 69 accounts.
Among the accounts, there are 1,086 special entities 1190 and 636 investment companies
registered under the Investment Company Act. 1191 Private funds comprise the largest type of
account holders that the Commission was able to classify, and although not verified through a
recognized database, most of the funds that could not be classified appear to be private funds. 1192

1189

Unregistered investment advisers include all investment advisers not registered under the
Investment Advisers Act and may include investment advisers registered with a state or a
foreign authority.

1190

See Section 15F(h)(2)(C) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(2)(C) (defining
“special entity” to include a federal agency; a state, state agency, city, county,
municipality, or other political subdivision of a state; any employee benefit plan; any
governmental plan; or any endowment).

1191

There remain over 4,000 DTCC “accounts” unclassified by type. Although unclassified,
each was manually reviewed to verify that it was not likely to be a special entity and
instead was likely to be an entity such as a corporation, an insurance company, or a bank.

1192

Private funds for the purpose of this analysis encompass various unregistered pooled
investment vehicles, including hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture capital
funds.

Participant Domiciles

The security-based swap market is global in scope, with counterparties located across
multiple jurisdictions. A U.S.-based holding company may conduct dealing activity through a
foreign subsidiary that faces both U.S. and foreign counterparties, and the foreign subsidiary may
be guaranteed by its parent, making the parent responsible for performance under these securitybased swaps.

accounts.

As depicted in Figure 1, over time a greater share of accounts entering the market either
have a foreign domicile, or have a foreign domicile while being managed by a U.S. person. The
increase in foreign accounts may reflect an increase in participation by foreign accountholders
1194

Following publication of the Warehouse Trust Guidance on CDS data access, DTCCTIW surveyed market participants, asking for the physical address associated with each
of their accounts (i.e., where the account is organized as a legal entity). This is
designated the registered office location by the DTCC-TIW. When an account does not
report a registered office location, the Commission has assumed that the settlement
country reported by the investment adviser or parent entity to the fund or account is the
place of domicile. This treatment assumes that the registered office location reflects the
place of domicile for the fund or account.

482

while the increase in foreign accounts managed by U.S. persons may reflect the flexibility with
which market participants can restructure their market participation in response to regulatory
intervention, competitive pressures, and other stimuli. There are, however, alternative
explanations for the shifts in new account domicile that can be observed in Figure 1. Changes in
the domicile of new accounts through time may reflect improvements in reporting by market
participants to DTCC-TIW. 1195 Additionally, because the data include only accounts that are
domiciled in the United States, transact with U.S.-domiciled counterparties, or transact in singlename CDS with U.S. reference entities, changes in the domicile of new accounts may reflect
increased transaction activity between U.S. and non-U.S. counterparties.
ii.

Current Estimates of Dealers and Major Participants

In its economic analysis of rules defining “security-based swap dealer” and “major
security-based swap participant,” the Commission noted, using DTCC-TIW data for the year
ending in December 2012, that it expected 202 entities to engage in dealer de minimis
analysis. 1196 Further, the Commission’s analysis of single-name CDS transactions data
suggested that only a subset of these entities engage in dealing activity and estimated 50
registered dealers as an upper bound based on the threshold for the de minimis exception adopted
in that release. 1197 The Commission also undertook an analysis of the number of security-based
swap market participants likely to register as major security-based swap participants, and

Id. at 47296, note 150 (describing the methodology employed by the Commission to
estimate the number of potential security-based swap dealers).

483

estimated a range of between zero and five such participants. 1198 Based on data for the year
ending in December 2013, the Commission continues to believe that 50 represents an upper
bound on the number of dealers expected to register and between zero and five major
participants will register. As a result of further experience with the DTCC-TIW data, the
Commission now estimates, based on data for the year ending in December 2013, that the
number of participants likely to engage in dealer de minimis analysis is approximately 170.
Forty-eight of these participants are domiciled outside of the United States and have $2 billion in
transactions with U.S. counterparties or that otherwise may have to be counted for purposes of
the de minimis analysis.
iii.

Security-Based Swap Data Repositories

There are currently no SDRs registered with the Commission. However, the CFTC has
provisionally registered four swap data repositories to accept credit derivatives. The
Commission believes that these entities may register with the Commission as SDRs. Because
most participants in the security-based swap market also participate in the swap market, 1199 other
persons might, in the future, seek to register with both the CFTC and the Commission as SDRs.
In addition, once a swap data repository has established infrastructure sufficient to allow it to
register with the CFTC, the costs for it to also register with the Commission as an SDR and adapt
its business for security-based swap activity will likely be low relative to the costs for a wholly
new entrant.

estimate the number of potential major security-based swap participants).

b.

Security-Based Swap Transaction Activity

Single-name CDS contracts make up the vast majority of security-based swap products
and most are written on corporate issuers, corporate debt securities, sovereign countries, or
sovereign debt securities (reference entities and reference securities). Figure 2, below, describes
the percentage of global, notional transaction volume in U.S. single-name CDS reported to the
DTCC-TIW between January 2008 and December 2013, separated by whether transactions are
between two ISDA-recognized dealers (interdealer transactions) or whether a transaction has at
least one non-dealer counterparty.
The level of trading activity with respect to U.S. single-name CDS in terms of notional
volume has declined from more than $6 trillion in 2008 to less than $3 trillion in 2013. 1200
While notional volume has declined over the past six years, the share of interdealer transactions
has remained fairly constant and interdealer transactions continue to represent the bulk of trading
activity, whether measured in terms of notional value or number of transactions (see Figure 2).
The high level of interdealer trading activity reflects the central position of a small
number of dealers who each intermediate trades among many hundreds of counterparties. While
1200

The start of this decline predates the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and the proposal
of rules thereunder. For the purpose of establishing an economic baseline, this seems to
indicate that CDS market demand shrank prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act,
and therefore the causes of trading volume declines may be independent of those related
to the development of security-based swap market regulation. If the security-based swap
market experiences further declines in trading activity, it would be difficult to identify the
effects of the newly-developed security-based swap market regulation apart from changes
in trading activity that may be due to natural market forces or the anticipation of (or
reaction to) proposed (or adopted) Title VII requirements. These estimates differ from
previous estimates as a result of staff experience with transaction-level data provided by
DTCC-TIW. First, the aggregate level of transaction activity presented in Figure 2 more
accurately reflects the notional amounts associated with partial assignments and
terminations of existing security-based swap contracts. Second, the treatment of
assignments in Figure 2 includes the counterparty type (dealer or non-dealer) of
counterparties vacating trades in assignments as well as those entering.

the Commission is unable to quantify the current level of trading costs for single-name CDS, it
appears that the market power enjoyed by dealers as a result of their small number and the large
proportion of order flow they privately observe is a key determinant of trading costs in this
market.

Against this backdrop of declining North American corporate single-name CDS activity,
about half of the trading activity in North American corporate single-name CDS reflected in the
set of data that the Commission analyzed was between counterparties domiciled in the United
States and counterparties domiciled abroad. Basing counterparty domicile on the self-reported
registered office location of the DTCC-TIW accounts, the Commission estimates that only 13%
486

of the global transaction volume by notional volume between 2008 and 2013 was between two
U.S.-domiciled counterparties, compared to 48% entered into between one U.S.-domiciled
counterparty and a foreign-domiciled counterparty and 39% entered into between two foreigndomiciled counterparties (see Figure 3). 1201
When the domicile of DTCC-TIW accounts are instead defined according to the domicile
of their ultimate parents, headquarters, or home offices (e.g., classifying a foreign branch or
foreign subsidiary of a U.S. entity as domiciled in the United States), the fraction of transactions
entered into between two U.S.-domiciled counterparties increases to 29%, and to 53% for
transactions entered into between a U.S.-domiciled counterparty and a foreign-domiciled
counterparty.
Differences in classifications across different definitions of domicile illustrate the effect
of participant structures that operate across jurisdictions. Notably, the proportion of activity
between two foreign-domiciled counterparties drops from 39% to 18% when domicile is defined
as the ultimate parent’s domicile. As noted earlier, foreign subsidiaries of U.S. persons, foreign
branches of U.S. persons, and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign persons, and U.S. branches of foreign
persons may transact with U.S. and foreign counterparties. However, this decrease in share
suggests that the activity of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. persons and foreign branches of U.S.
persons is generally higher than the activity of U.S. subsidiaries of foreign persons and U.S.
branches of foreign persons.
By either of those definitions of domicile, the data indicate that a large fraction of North
American corporate single-name CDS transaction volume is entered into between counterparties
domiciled in two different jurisdictions or between counterparties domiciled outside the United

States. For the purpose of establishing an economic baseline, this observation indicates that a
large fraction of security-based swap activity would be affected by the scope of any cross-border
approach we take in applying the Title VII requirements. Further, the large fraction of North
American corporate single-name CDS transactions between U.S.-domiciled and foreigndomiciled counterparties also highlights the extent to which security-based swap activity
transfers risk across geographical boundaries, both facilitating risk sharing among market
participants and allowing for risk transmission between jurisdictions.

to be clustered at “round” numbers: $1 million, $5 million, $10 million, etc. While large and

Counterparty Reporting

While there is no mandatory reporting requirement for the single-name CDS market yet,
virtually all market participants voluntarily report their trades to DTCC-TIW, in some cases with

the assistance of post-trade processors, which maintains a legal record of transactions. 1204
Among other things, this centralized record-keeping facilitates settlement of obligations between
counterparties when a default event occurs as well as bulk transfers of positions between
accounts at a single firm or between firms. In addition, while there is not yet a mandatory
clearing requirement in the single-name CDS market, market participants may choose to clear
transactions voluntarily. However, neither voluntary reporting nor voluntary clearing results in
data that are available to the public on a trade-by-trade basis.
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission preliminarily estimated that
there would be 1,000 reporting parties 1205 and 15.5 million reportable events per year. 1206 In the
Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission revised its estimate of the number of reporting
sides from 1,000 to 300 and revised its estimate of the number of reportable events from 15.5
million to approximately 5 million.1207 These revised estimates were a result of the Commission
obtaining additional and more granular data regarding participation in the security-based swap
market from DTCC-TIW. As discussed above, since issuing the Cross-Border Proposing
Release, the Commission has obtained additional and even more granular data regarding
participation in the security-based swap market from DTCC-TIW. As a result, the Commission
is now further revising its estimate of the number of reportable events. Accordingly, the

Sources of Security-Based Swap Information

There currently is no robust, widely accessible source of information about individual
security-based swap transactions. Nevertheless, market participants can gather certain limited
information for the single-name CDS 1209 market from a variety of sources. First, indicative
quotes can be obtained through market data vendors such as Bloomberg or Markit. These quotes
typically do not represent firm commitments to buy or sell protection on particular reference
entities. Since there is no commitment to buy or sell associated with indicative quotes, there are
fewer incentives for market participants that post indicative quotes to quote prices that accurately
reflect the fundamental value of the asset to be traded. However, market participants can glean
information from indicative quotes that may inform their trading.
Second, there is limited, publicly-disseminated information about security-based swap
market activity presented at an aggregate level. As mentioned above, market participants

1208

See supra note 1070.

1209

Regulation SBSR would also cover equity swaps (other than broad-based equity index
swaps). However, the Commission has access to limited information concerning the
equity swap market. As a result, the Commission’s analysis is largely focused on the
single-name CDS market, for which the Commission has information.

492

sometimes voluntarily clear their transactions, e.g., through ICE Clear Credit. 1210 To support
their risk management activities, clearing agencies compute and disseminate information such as
end-of-day prices and aggregated volume to their clearing members. ICE Clear Credit also
provides aggregated volume data. 1211 Additionally, some large multilateral organizations
periodically report measures of market activity. For example, the Bank for International
Settlements (“BIS”) reports gross notional outstanding for single-name CDS and equity forwards
and swaps semiannually. 1212
Finally, market intermediaries may draw inferences about security-based swap market
activity from observing their customers’ order flow or through inquiries made by other market
participants who seek liquidity. This source of information is most useful for market participants
with a large market share. As noted above, the ability to observe a larger amount of order flow
allows for more precise estimates of demand.
The paucity of publicly-available security-based swap data suggests a number of frictions
that likely characterize the current state of efficiency, competition, and capital formation in the
security-based swap market. As noted in Section XXII(A), without public dissemination of
transaction information, security-based swap market participants with the largest order flow have
an informational advantage over smaller competitors and counterparties. Moreover, as suggested
by Table 1, there is a great deal of heterogeneity in the level of order flow observed by market
1210

Based on the transaction data from the DTCC-TIW, Commission staff has estimated that,
during the three-year period from January 2011 until December 2013, approximately
21% of all transactions in CDS with North American single-name corporate reference
entities and approximately 21% of all transactions in CDS with European single-name
corporate reference entities were cleared.

participants, with a small group of large dealers participating in most transactions. These large
market participants can use this advantage to consolidate their own market power by strategically
filling orders when it is to their advantage and leaving less profitable trades to competitors.
Asymmetric information and dealer market power can result in financial market
inefficiencies. With only a small number of liquidity suppliers competing for order flow, bid-ask
spreads in the market may be wider than they would be under perfect competition between a
larger number of liquidity suppliers. If this is the case, then it is possible that certain non-dealers
who might otherwise benefit from risk-sharing afforded by security-based swap positions may
avoid participating in the market because it is too costly for them to do so. For instance, if wide
bid-ask spreads in the CDS market reduced the level of credit risk hedging by market
participants, the result could be an inefficient allocation of credit risk in the economy as a whole.
Additionally, financial market participants may avoid risk-sharing opportunities in the securitybased swap market if they determine that lack of oversight by relevant authorities leaves the
market prone to disruption. For example, if the threat of sequential counterparty default reduces
security-based swap dealers’ liquidity, then market participants may reduce their participation if
they perceive a high risk that they will be unable to receive the contractual cash flows associated
with their security-based swap positions. These sources of inefficiency can adversely affect
capital formation if an inability for lenders and investors to efficiently hedge their economic
exposures diminishes their willingness to fund certain borrowers and issuers with risky but
profitable investing opportunities.
Lack of publicly-available transaction information could affect capital formation in other
ways. Information about security-based swap transactions can be used as input into valuation
models. For example, the price of a single-name CDS contract can be used to produce estimates

494

of default risk for a particular firm and these estimates can, in turn, be used by managers and
investors to value the firm’s projects. In the absence of last-sale information in the CDS market,
market participants may build models of default risk using price data from other markets. They
may, for instance, look to the firm’s bond and equity prices, the prices of swaps that may have
similar default risk exposure, or to the prices of comparable assets more generally.

Global Regulatory Efforts
a.

Dealer and Major Swap Participant Definitions for Cross-Border
Security-Based Swaps

The Commission adopted final rules governing the application of the “security-based
swap dealer” and “major security-based swap participant” definitions with respect to crossborder security-based swap activity and exposures. 1213 The final rules generally require, among
other things, that non-U.S. persons assess whether their dealing activities with and exposures
against U.S. persons or with recourse guarantees against U.S. persons rise above de minimis
levels. 1214 In the Cross-Border Adopting Release, the Commission discussed the costs that nonU.S. persons would incur in order to perform this assessment and the likely number of
participants whose activity and exposures would likely be large enough to make such an
assessment prudent. 1215 These costs included amounts related to collecting, analyzing, and
monitoring representations about the U.S.-person status of counterparties, and whether particular
transactions had recourse guarantees against U.S. persons. 1216

International Regulatory Developments

International efforts to coordinate the regulation of the OTC derivatives markets are
underway, and suggest that many foreign participants will face substantive regulation of their
security-based swap activities that resemble rules the Commission is implementing. In 2009,
leaders of the Group of 20 (“G20”)—whose membership includes the United States, the
European Union, and 18 other countries—called for global improvements in the functioning,
transparency, and regulatory oversight of OTC derivatives markets. 1217 In subsequent summits,
the G20 leaders have reiterated their commitment to OTC derivatives regulatory reform and
encouraged international consultation in developing standards for these markets. 1218 The FSB is
a forum for international coordination of OTC derivatives reform and provides progress reports
to the G20. 1219
Jurisdictions with major OTC derivatives markets have taken steps toward substantive
regulation of these markets, though the pace of regulation varies. Rulemaking and legislation
has focused on four general areas: post-trade reporting and public dissemination of transaction

Transaction reporting requirements have entered into force in Europe, Australia,
Singapore, and Japan, with other jurisdictions in the process of proposing legislation and rules to
implement these requirements. For example, in Canada, Ontario, Quebec, and Manitoba have
transaction reporting requirements in force, while other provinces have proposed rules in that
area. The European Union is currently considering updated rules for markets in financial
instruments that will address derivatives market transparency and trading derivatives on
regulated trading platforms.
3.

Cross-Market Participation

A single-name CDS contract covers default events for a single reference entity or
reference security. These entities and securities are often part of broad-based indices on which
market participants write index CDS. Index CDS contracts make payouts that are contingent on
the default of one or more index components and allow participants to gain exposure to the credit
risk of the basket of reference entities that comprise the index, which is a function of the credit
risk of the index components. As a result of this construction, a default event for a reference
entity that is an index component will result in payoffs on both single-name CDS written on the
reference entity and index CDS written on indices that contain the reference entity. Because of
this relationship between the payoffs of single-name and index CDS, prices of these products
depend upon one another.
Because payoffs associated with these single-name CDS and index CDS are dependent,
hedging opportunities exist across these markets. Participants who sell protection on reference
entities through a series of single-name CDS transactions can lay off some of the credit risk of

497

their resulting positions by buying protection on an index that includes those reference entities.
Entities that are active in one market are likely to be active in the other. Commission staff
analysis of approximately 4,200 DTCC-TIW accounts that participated in the market for singlename CDS in 2013 revealed that approximately 2,200 of those accounts, or 52%, also
participated in the market for index CDS. Of the accounts that participated in both markets, data
regarding transactions in 2013 suggest that, conditional on an account transacting in notional
volume of index CDS in the top third of accounts, the probability of the same account landing in
the top third of accounts in terms of single-name CDS notional volume is approximately 62%; by
contrast, the probability of the same account landing in the bottom third of accounts in terms of
single-name CDS notional volume is only 15%.
The CFTC’s cross-border guidance and swap reporting rules have likely influenced the
information that market participants collect and maintain about the swap transactions they enter
into and the counterparties that they face. 1220 Compliance with the CFTC’s cross-border
guidance and swap reporting rules would require swap counterparties to collect and maintain
data items required by the CFTC regulation if they had not done so before. To the extent that the
same or similar information is needed to comply with Regulation SBSR, market participants can
use infrastructure already in place as a result of CFTC regulation to comply with Regulation
SBSR and the costs to these market participants would be reduced.

1220

See “Interpretive Guidance and Policy Statement Regarding Compliance With Certain
Swap Regulations” (July 17, 2013), 78 FR 45292 (July 26, 2013) (“CFTC Cross-Border

(PLF), slip op. at 89 (D.D.C. September 16, 2014).

498

Commenters generally expressed concern about potential differences between CFTC
rules and rules promulgated by the Commission. 1221 In adopting Regulation SBSR, the
Commission has been cognizant of the parallel rules imposed by the CFTC and the costs that
would be imposed on market participants that must comply with both agencies’ rules.
C.

Programmatic Costs and Benefits of Regulation SBSR

The Commission preliminarily identified certain benefits of Regulation SBSR in both the
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release and the Cross-Border Proposing Release. After careful
consideration of all the issues raised by commenters, the Commission continues to believe that
Regulation SBSR will result in certain benefits. These include promoting price discovery and
lowering trading costs by improving the level of information to all market participants and by
providing a means for the Commission and relevant authorities to gain a better understanding of
the trading behaviors of participants in the security-based swap market and to identify large
counterparty exposures. 1222 Additionally, the Commission believes that Regulation SBSR will
improve risk management by those market participants that choose to supplement their existing
risk management programs with publicly disseminated data. Risk management relies on
accurate pricing, and valuation models generally yield better estimates with last-sale information
being available as input.

1.

Regulatory Reporting
a.

Programmatic Benefits

Rule 901, as adopted, requires all security-based swaps that are covered transactions 1223
to be reported to a registered SDR, establishes a “reporting hierarchy” that determines which side
must report the transaction, and sets out the data elements that must be reported. The
Commission believes that requiring regulatory reporting of covered transactions will yield a
number of benefits. First, Rule 901 will provide a means for the Commission and other relevant
authorities to gain a better understanding of the security-based swap market, 1224 including the
size and scope of that market, as the Commission would have access to transaction data held by
any registered SDR. The Commission and other relevant authorities can analyze the securitybased swap market and potentially identify exposure to risks undertaken by individual market
participants or at various levels of aggregation, as well as credit exposures that arise between
counterparties. Additionally, regulatory reporting will help the Commission and other relevant
authorities in the valuation of security-based swaps. For example, an improved ability of
relevant authorities to value security-based swap exposures may assist these authorities in
assessing compliance with rules related to capital requirements by entities that maintain such
exposures on their balance sheets. Taken together, regulatory data will enable the Commission
and other relevant authorities to conduct robust monitoring of the security-based swap market for
potential risks to financial markets and financial market participants.
Second, data reported pursuant to Rule 901 should improve relevant authorities’ ability to
oversee the security-based swap market to detect, deter, and punish market abuse. The
1223

See supra notes 11-12 and accompanying text.

1224

Such relevant authorities are enumerated in Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the Exchange Act, 15
U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(G). See supra note 64.

500

Commission and other relevant authorities will be able, for example, to observe trading activity
at the level of both trading desk and individual trader, using trading desk IDs and trader IDs,
respectively. While the Commission acknowledges commenters’ concerns regarding the costs
associated with establishing and maintaining UICs, it has considered these costs in light of its
belief that aggregation of the information contained in registered SDRs using appropriate
UICs—such as broker ID, trader ID, and trading desk ID—will facilitate the ability of the
Commission and other relevant authorities to examine for noncompliance and pursue
enforcement actions, as appropriate. 1225
Rule 901 could result in benefits by encouraging the creation and widespread use of
generally accepted standards for reference information by security-based swap market
participants and infrastructure providers (such as SDRs and clearing agencies). For example,
Rule 901(c)(1) requires the reporting of a product ID, for security-based swaps that can be
categorized as belonging to a product group. The development and wider usage of product IDs
could result in greater efficiencies for market participants, infrastructure providers, and
regulators, as identifying information about security-based swap products can be conveyed with
a single ID code in place of several, perhaps dozens, of separate data elements. The
development and wider usage of UICs generally will provide market participants with a more
reliable means of identifying to each other the same products, persons, units of persons, and
transactions. The costs associated with misidentifying these aspects of a transaction include
additional time and resources spent to reconcile differing data elements across transaction
records. Misidentification could also result in the cancellation of a transaction if, for example, it

1225

See supra notes 160 and 162.

501

reveals disagreement between counterparties about the economic attributes of the transaction,
such as the reference obligation underlying a CDS contract.
UICs also could lead to greater regulatory efficiencies, as the Commission and other
relevant authorities would have greater ability to aggregate transactions along a number of
different vectors. Relevant authorities will have greater ability to observe patterns and
connections in trading activity, such as whether a trader had engaged in questionable trading
activity across different security-based swap products. The reporting of this information will
facilitate more effective oversight, enforcement, and surveillance of the security-based swap
market by the Commission and other relevant authorities. These identifiers also will facilitate
aggregation and monitoring of the positions of security-based swap counterparties, which could
be of significant benefit to the Commission and other relevant authorities.
The time stamp and transaction ID requirements under Rules 901(f) and 901(g),
respectively, should facilitate data management by the registered SDR, as well as market
supervision and oversight by the Commission and other regulatory authorities. The transaction
ID required by Rule 901(g) also will provide an important benefit by facilitating the linking of
subsequent, related security-based swap transactions that may be submitted to a registered SDR
(e.g., a transaction report regarding a security-based swap life cycle event, or report to correct an
error in a previously submitted report). Counterparties, the registered SDR, the Commission,
and other relevant authorities also will benefit by having the ability to track changes to a
security-based swap over the life of the contract, as each change can be linked to the initially
reported transaction using the transaction ID.
By requiring reporting of pre-enactment and transitional security-based swap transactions
to the extent the information is available, Rule 901(i) will provide the Commission and other

502

relevant authorities with insight as to outstanding notional size, number of transactions, and
number and type of participants in the security-based swap market. To the extent pre-enactment
and transitional security-based swap transaction information is available and reported, Rule
901(i) may contribute to the development of a well regulated market for security-based swaps by
providing a benchmark against which to assess the development of the security-based swap
market over time. The data reported pursuant to Rule 901(i) also could help the Commission
prepare the reports that it is required to provide to Congress. At the same time, Rule 901(i)
limits the scope of the transactions, and the information pertaining to those transactions, that
must be reported in a manner designed to minimize undue burdens on security-based swap
counterparties. First, Rule 901(i) requires reporting only of those security-based swaps that were
open as of the date of enactment (July 21, 2010) or opened thereafter. As discussed in Section
II(C)(2), supra, Rule 901(i) requires reporting of the information required by Rules 901(c) and
901(d) only to the extent such information is available. Finally, the duty to report historical
security-based swaps in a particular asset class is triggered only when there exists a registered
SDR that can accept security-based swaps in that asset class.

Programmatic Costs
i.

Reporting Security-Based Swap Transactions to a
Registered SDR—Rule 901

The security-based swap reporting requirements contained in Rule 901 will impose initial
and ongoing costs on reporting sides. 1226 The Commission continues to believe that certain of

1226

Certain estimates used throughout this Section XXII (e.g., the number of impacted
entities, the number of reportable events, and the hourly cost rates used for each job
category) have been updated from those estimated in the Cross-Border Proposing Release
to reflect the rule text of Regulation SBSR, as adopted, as well as additional information
and data now available to the Commission.

503

these costs would be a function of the number of reportable events and the data elements
required to be submitted for each reportable event. The Commission continues to believe that
security-based swap market participants will face three categories of costs to comply with Rule
901. First, each reporting side will likely have to establish and maintain an internal OMS
capable of capturing relevant security-based swap transaction information so that it could be
reported. Second, each reporting side will have to implement a reporting mechanism. Third,
each reporting side will have to establish an appropriate compliance program and support for
operating any OMS and reporting mechanism. 1227 Such systems and mechanisms would likely
be necessary to report data within the timeframe set forth in Rule 901(j), as it is unlikely that
manual processes could capture and report the numerous required data elements relating to a
security-based swaps. Many market participants may already have OMSs in place to facilitate
voluntary reporting of security-based swap transactions or clearing activity. As a result, any
additional costs related to systems and infrastructure will be limited to those reporting sides that
either invest in new systems or must upgrade existing systems to meet minimum requirements
for reporting. To the extent that the cost estimates discussed below do not take this cost limiting
fact into account, they are an upper bound for the estimated costs.
Although the Commission initially estimated that there would be 1,000 reporting
sides, 1228 in the Cross-Border Proposing Release the Commission revised that estimate to
300. 1229 No comments were received on the number of entities that would be reporting sides
under Regulation SBSR. The Commission notes that, since issuing the Regulation SBSR

504

Proposing Release, the Commission has obtained additional and more granular data regarding its
estimate of the number of reporting sides. These historical data suggest that, among these 300
reporting sides, approximately 50 are likely to be required to register with the Commission as
security-based swap dealers and up to five are likely to register as major security-based swap
participants. 1230 These data further suggest that these 55 potential registrants likely will account
for the vast majority of recent security-based swap transactions and transaction reports that will
need to be reported by reporting sides, and that there are only a limited number of security-based
swap transactions that do not include at least one of these potential registrants on either side. 1231
The Commission estimates that internal order management costs related to Rule 901 will
result in initial one-time aggregate costs of approximately $30,600,000, which corresponds to
approximately $102,000 for each reporting side. 1232 The Commission continues to estimate that
the cost to establish and maintain connectivity to a registered SDR to facilitate the reporting
required by Rule 901 would impose an annual (first-year and ongoing) aggregate cost of

1230

See id. at 31103.

1231

As a result, the Commission generally will use 300 as an estimate of the number of
reporting sides for §§ 900-909 of Regulation SBSR. In cases where a rule is more
limited in its application, for example Rule 906(c), the Commission may use a different
number that reflects some subset of the estimated 300 reporting sides.

1232

This estimate is based on the following: [((Sr. Programmer (160 hours) at $303 per hour)
+ (Sr. Systems Analyst (160 hours) at $260 per hour) + (Compliance Manager (10 hours)
at $283 per hour) + (Director of Compliance (5 hours) at $446 per hour) + (Compliance
Attorney (20 hours) at $334 per hour)) x 300 reporting sides)] = $30,546,000, or
approximately $30,600,000, or approximately $102,000 per reporting side. See
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75264. These estimates have been
adjusted to reflect the Commission’s new estimate of the number of reporting sides. All
hourly cost figures are based upon data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional
Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013 (modified by the SEC staff to account for an
1800-hour-work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee
benefits, and overhead).

505

approximately $60,000,000, which corresponds to $200,000 for each reporting side. 1233 The
Commission continues to estimate, as a result of having to establishing a reporting mechanism
for security-based swap transactions, reporting sides will experience certain development, testing
and support costs. Such costs would amount to an initial one-time aggregate cost of
approximately $14,700,000, which corresponds to an initial one-time cost of approximately
$49,000 for each reporting side. 1234 The Commission estimates that internal order management
costs related to Rule 901 will impose ongoing annual aggregate costs of approximately
$23,100,000, which corresponds to approximately $77,000 per reporting side. 1235 In addition,

1233

This estimate is based on discussions of Commission staff with various market
participants, as well as the Commission’s experience regarding connectivity between
securities market participants for data reporting purposes. The Commission derived the
total estimated expense from the following: ($100,000 hardware- and software-related
expenses, including necessary backup and redundancy, per SDR connection) x (2 SDR
connections per reporting side) x (300 reporting sides) = $60,000,000, or $200,000 per
reporting side. See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75265. These
estimates have been adjusted to reflect the Commission’s new estimate of the number of
reporting sides.

1234

This figure is based on discussions with various market participants and is calculated as
follows: [((Sr. Programmer (80 hours) at $303 per hour) + (Sr. Systems Analyst (80
hours) at $260 per hour) + (Compliance Manager (5 hours) at $283 per hour) + (Director
of Compliance (2 hours) at $446 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney (5 hours) at $334 per
hour) x (300 reporting sides)] = $14,705,100, or approximately $14,700,000, or
approximately $49,000 per reporting side. See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75
FR at 75265, adjusted to reflect the Commission’s new estimate of the number of
reporting sides.

1235

This estimate is based on the following: [((Sr. Programmer (32 hours) at $303 per hour)
+ (Sr. Systems Analyst (32 hours) at $260 per hour) + (Compliance Manager (60 hours)
at $283 per hour) + (Compliance Clerk (240 hours) at $64 per hour) + (Director of
Compliance (24 hours) at $446 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney (48 hours) at $334 per
hour)) x 300 reporting sides)] = $23,127,600, or approximately $23,100,000, or
approximately $77,000 per reporting side. See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75
FR at 75264-5, adjusted to reflect the Commission’s new estimate of the number of
reporting sides.

506

the Commission estimates that all reporting sides will incur an initial and ongoing aggregate
annual cost of $300,000, which corresponds to $1,000 for each reporting side. 1236
The Commission, in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, estimated that reporting
specific security-based swap transactions to a registered SDR as required by Rule 901 will
impose an annual aggregate cost (first-year and ongoing) of approximately $5,400 for each
reporting party. 1237 This estimate was revised in the Cross-Border Proposing Release and this
adopting release to reflect improved information relating to the number of transactions and
reporting sides. The Commission believes that the cost of reporting initial security-based swap
transactions under Rule 901(c) will be approximately $340,000, or approximately $1,100 per
reporting side. 1238 The Commission further believes that the cost of reporting life cycle events
under Rule 901(e) will be approximately $415,000, or approximately $1,400 per reporting
side. 1239 As a result, the Commission believes that the total cost (first-year and ongoing) of

1236

This estimate is based on discussion of Commission staff with various market
participants and is calculated as follows: [$250/gigabyte of storage capacity x (4
gigabytes of storage) x (300 reporting sides)] = $300,000, or $1,000 per reporting side.

Commission’s new estimate of the number of reporting sides.

1237

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR 75208, notes 195 and 299.

1238

The Commission believes that 900,000 of the 2 million reportable events will be the
result of reporting the initial security-based swap transaction under Rule 901(c). As a
result, the Commission estimates: ((900,000 x 0.005 hours per transaction) / (300
reporting sides)) = 15 burden hours per reporting side, or 4,500 total burden hours. The
resulting cost of such reporting would be: [((Compliance Clerk (7.5 hours) at $64 per
hour) + (Sr. Computer Operator (7.5 hours) at $87 per hour)) x (300 reporting sides)] =
approximately $340,000, or $1,133 per reporting side.

1239

The Commission believes that 1,100,000 of the 2 million reportable events will be the
result of reporting life cycle events under Rule 901(e). As a result, the Commission
estimates: ((1,100,000 x 0.005 hours per transaction) / (300 reporting sides)) = 18.33
burden hours per reporting side, or 5,500 total burden hours. The resulting cost of such
reporting would be: [((Compliance Clerk (9.17 hours) at $64 per hour) + (Sr. Computer
507

reporting security-based swap transactions under Rule 901, as adopted, will be approximately
$750,000, or $2,500 per reporting side. 1240
The Commission estimates that designing and implementing an appropriate compliance
and support program will impose an initial one-time aggregate cost of approximately
$16,200,000, which corresponds to a cost of approximately $54,000 for each reporting side. 1241
The Commission estimates that maintaining its compliance and support program would
impose an ongoing annual aggregate cost of approximately $11,550,000, which corresponds to a
cost of approximately $38,500 for each reporting side. 1242

Operator (9.17 hours) at $87 per hour)) x (300 reporting sides)] = approximately
$415,000, or $1,383 per reporting side.
1240

The Commission believes that the per reportable event transaction cost will not change
and that only approximately 2 million of these events will be reported by the reporting
sides. As a result, the Commission now estimates: ((2 million x 0.005 hours per
transaction) / (300 reporting sides)) = 33.3 burden hours per reporting side, or 10,000
total burden hours. The Commission therefore estimates the total cost to be:
[((Compliance Clerk (16.7 hours) at $64 per hour) + (Sr. Computer Operator (16.7 hours)
at $87 per hour)) x (300 reporting sides)] = approximately $750,000, or $2,500 per
reporting side. See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75208, notes 195 and
299. These estimates have been adjusted to reflect the Commission’s new estimates of
the number of reporting sides and number of reportable events.

1241

This figure is based on discussions with various market participants and is calculated as
follows: [((Sr. Programmer (100 hours) at $303 per hour) + (Sr. Systems Analyst (40
hours) at $260 per hour) + (Compliance Manager (20 hours) at $283 per hour) +
(Director of Compliance (10 hours) at $446 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney (10 hours)
at $334 per hour) x (300 reporting sides)] = approximately $16,200,000, or $54,000 per
reporting side. See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75266. These
estimates have been adjusted to reflect the Commission’s new estimate of the number of
reporting sides.

$446 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney (24 hours) at $334 per hour) x (300 reporting
sides)] = $11,563,800, or approximately $11,550,000, or approximately $38,500 per
reporting side. See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75266. These

Summing these costs, the Commission estimates that the initial, aggregate annual costs
associated with Rule 901 would be approximately $157,200,000, which corresponds to
approximately $524,000 per reporting side. 1243 The Commission estimates that the ongoing
aggregate annual costs associated with Rule 901 will be approximately $95,700,000, which
corresponds to approximately $319,000 per reporting side. 1244
The Commission continues to believe that the costs associated with required reporting
pursuant to Regulation SBSR could represent a barrier to entry for new, smaller firms that might
not have the ability to comply with the proposed reporting requirements or for whom the
expected benefits of compliance might not justify the costs of compliance. To the extent that
Regulation SBSR might deter new firms from entering the security-based swap market, this
would be a cost of the regulation and could negatively impact competition. Nevertheless, the
Commission continues to believe that the reporting requirements will not impose insurmountable
barriers to entry, as firms that are reluctant to acquire and build reporting infrastructure could
engage with third-party service providers to carry out any reporting duties incurred under
Regulation SBSR. 1245

509

In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission stated its preliminary belief that
the infrastructure-related costs identified in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release associated
with Rule 901, on a per-entity basis, would remain largely unchanged as a result of the reproposal. The Commission preliminarily estimated and continues to believe that the marginal
burden of reporting additional transactions once a respondent’s reporting infrastructure and
compliance systems are in place would be de minimis when compared to the costs of putting
those systems in place and maintaining them over time. This is because the only additional costs
of reporting an individual transaction would be entering the required data elements into the
firm’s OMS, which could subsequently deliver the required transaction information to a
registered SDR. In many cases, particularly with increased standardization of instruments and
use of electronic trading, transaction information could more frequently be generated and
maintained in electronic form, which could then be provided to a registered SDR through wholly
automated processes. The Commission does not believe that the additional changes made to
Rule 901 in this adopting release will have any measureable impact on the costs previously
discussed in both the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release and the Cross-Border Proposing
Release. As a result, the Commission believes that these previous estimates remain applicable.
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission noted that each reporting side
would be required to report, on average, more security-based swap transactions than envisioned
under the original proposal. The Commission further noted that smaller unregistered
counterparties, that would have been required to report a small number of security-based swap
transactions under the original proposal would, under re-proposed Rule 901(a), be less likely to
have to incur reporting duties under Regulation SBSR, and thus less likely to have to incur the

510

initial infrastructure-related costs of reporting. 1246 The Commission noted its preliminary
agreement with certain commenters 1247 that basing the reporting duty primarily on status as a
security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant rather than on whether or
not the entity is a U.S. person would, in the aggregate, reduce costs to the security-based swap
market.
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission noted two additional factors that
could serve to limit the average per-transaction costs across all affected entities. First, to the
extent that security-based swap instruments become more standardized and trade more
frequently on electronic platforms (rather than manually), the act of reporting transactions to a
registered SDR should become less costly. These trends are likely to reduce the number of
transactions that would necessitate the manual capture of bespoke data elements, which is likely
to take more time and be more expensive than electronic capture. Second, the larger entities that
would incur additional reporting duties under re-proposed Rules 901(a) and 908(a)(1)(iii)—i.e.,
non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants—can
benefit from certain economies of scale in carrying out reporting duties that might elude smaller,
unregistered counterparties. The Commission continues to believe that these factors could limit
the average per-transaction costs across all affected entities. However, the extent of these effects
1246

The Commission notes, however, that non-reporting sides would be required to provide
certain information about a reportable transaction. See Rule 906(a), as originally
proposed (requiring reporting, if applicable, of participant ID, broker ID, trading desk ID,
and trader ID). See also Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75221
(discussing rationale for proposed Rule 906(a)).

1247

See, e.g., DTCC II at 8; ICI Letter at 5; Cleary III at 31. See also Vanguard Letter at 6;
Cleary III at 28 (stating that requiring U.S. end users to report security-based swaps
entered into with non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers would be unduly
burdensome for end users and could negatively impact the competitiveness of affected
U.S. markets).

511

is difficult to quantify. It is difficult to predict how many transactions each reporting side will
report under manual versus electronic capture. Furthermore, the Commission currently does not
have information about the exact reporting systems and the associated cost structures of
reporting sides. Therefore, while the Commission has considered the likely effects of electronic
trade capture and more concentrated reporting obligations qualitatively, as above, the
Commission is not able to quantify these effects.
After reviewing comment letters received in response to the Regulation SBSR Proposing
Release and the Cross-Border Proposing Release, as well as evaluating the most recent data
available to the Commission, the Commission believes that these cost estimates, as adjusted to
account for more recent data on the number of reporting sides, remain valid. The Commission
has received no comments to the contrary.
ii.

Registered SDRs—Receipt and Processing of SecurityBased Swap Transactions—Rule 901

Rule 901, as adopted, requires all security-based swaps that are covered transactions 1248
to be reported to a registered SDR, establishes a “reporting hierarchy” that determines which side
must report the transaction, and sets out the data elements that must be reported. Together,
sections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (h) of Rule 901 set forth the parameters that govern how
reporting sides must report security-based swap transactions. Rule 901(i) addresses the reporting
of pre-enactment and transitional security-based swaps.
In both the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release and the Cross-Border Proposing
Release, the Commission discussed the potential costs to registered SDRs resulting from Rule
901. The Commission preliminarily estimated that the number of registered SDRs would not

1248

See supra notes 11-12 and accompanying text.

512

exceed ten in both releases. No comments discussed the potential number of entities that might
register with the Commission as SDRs and incur duties under Regulation SBSR. The
Commission continues to believe that it is reasonable to estimate ten registered SDRs for
purposes of evaluating the costs and benefits of Regulation SBSR.
As discussed above, Rule 901 imposes certain minor, additional requirements on
registered SDRs, in addition to the major duties imposed on SDRs by Rules 902 and 907 of
Regulation SBSR and the rules adopted as part of the SDR Adopting Release. Rule 901(f)
requires a registered SDR to time stamp, to the lowest second increment practicable but in any
event no greater than a second, its receipt of any information submitted to it pursuant to Rules
901(c), (d), or (e). Rule 901(g) requires a registered SDR to assign a transaction ID to each
security-based swap reported or establish or endorse a methodology for transaction IDs to be
assigned by third parties. Consequently, the Commission estimates that Rules 901(f) and 901(g)
will impose an initial aggregate one-time cost of approximately $360,000, which corresponds to
$36,000 per registered SDR. 1249 With regard to ongoing costs, the Commission estimates that
Rules 901(f) and 901(g) would impose an ongoing aggregate annual cost of $455,000, which
corresponds to $45,500 per registered SDR. 1250 This figure represents an estimate of the support

1249

This figure is calculated follows: [((Sr. Programmer (80 hours) at $303 per hour) + (Sr.
Systems Analyst (20 hours) at $260 per hour) + (Compliance Manager (8 hours) at $283
per hour) + (Director of Compliance (4 hours) at $446 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney
(8 hours) at $334 per hour) x (10 registered SDRs)] = $361,600, or approximately
$360,000. All hourly cost figures are based upon data from SIFMA’s Management &
Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013 (modified by the SEC staff to
account for an 1,800-hour-work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm
size, employee benefits, and overhead). See also Regulation SBSR Proposing Release,
75 FR at 75266, note 309.

This figure is calculated as follows: [((Sr. Programmer (60 hours) at $303 per hour) +

$283 per hour) + (Director of Compliance (12 hours) at $446 per hour) + (Compliance

and maintenance costs for the time stamp and transaction ID assignment elements of a registered
SDR’s systems.
The Commission estimates that the initial aggregate annual cost associated with Rules
901(f) and 901(g) will be approximately $815,000, which corresponds to $81,500 per registered
SDR. 1251 The above costs per registered SDR are generally consistent with those set forth in the
Cross-Border Proposing Release. It is possible, however, that the costs may be lower than
previously estimated, as the Commission is now estimating fewer reportable events per year (5
million in the Cross-Border Proposing Release versus 2 million events to be reported by the
reporting sides). 1252 In addition, to the extent that those persons planning on registering as SDRs
have already expended resources in anticipation of the adoption of Regulation SBSR and as a
result of CFTC regulations that are already in place, the costs to become a registered SDR could
be significantly lower. As a result, the Commission’s estimates should be viewed as an upper
bound of the potential costs of Regulation SBSR.
After reviewing comment letters received in response to the Regulation SBSR Proposing
Release and Cross-Border Proposing Release, as well as evaluating the most recent data
available to the Commission, the Commission continues to believe that its overall approach to

approximately $455,000. See also Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75266,
note 310.
1251

This figure is based on the following: (($36,160 + $45,476) x (10 registered SDRs) =
$816,360, or approximately $815,000, which corresponds to $81,636, or approximately

comments to the contrary.
2.

Public Dissemination

Rule 902 requires the public dissemination of security-based swap transaction
information. Rule 902(a), as adopted, sets out the core requirement that a registered SDR,
immediately upon receipt of a transaction report of a security-based swap or life cycle event,
must publicly disseminate information about the security-based swap or life cycle event, plus any
condition flags contemplated by the registered SDR’s policies and procedures that are required
by Rule 907.
a.

Programmatic Benefits

There are benefits to public dissemination of security-based swap information, as is
required by Rule 902. Among other things, by reducing information asymmetries, post-trade
transparency has the potential to facilitate price discovery and price competition, 1253 lower
implicit transaction costs, 1254 improve valuation of security-based swap products, and increase
liquidity in the security-based swap market. 1255

1253

See Edwards, et al., supra note 1223 supra.

1254

As noted in Section XXII(B)(1)(b), dealing activity in the single-name CDS market is
concentrated among a small number of firms that each enjoy informational advantages as
a result of the large quantity of order flow they privately observe. Implicit transaction
costs are the difference between the transaction price and the fundamental value, which
could reflect adverse selection or could reflect compensation for inventory risk. In
addition to these implicit transaction costs, security-based swap market participants may
face explicit transaction costs such as commissions and other fees that dealers might
charge non-dealers for access to the market.

1255

See infra Section XXII(D)(2)(b). See also Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at
75267.

515

Requiring public dissemination of security-based swap transactions will provide all
market participants and market observers with more extensive and more accurate information
upon which to make trading and valuation determinations. In the absence of post-trade
transparency, larger dealers possess private information in the form of transactions prices and
volumes, and larger dealers enjoy a greater informational advantage than smaller dealers. As
noted above in Section XXII(B), the bulk of security-based swap activity is dealer-intermediated.
Non-dealers and small dealers who perceive the informational advantage of their counterparties
may be less willing to trade. By reducing the information advantage of large dealers, the public
dissemination of security-based swap data may improve the negotiating position of smaller
market participants such as non-dealers and small dealers, allowing them to access liquidity and
risk sharing opportunities in the security-based swap market at lower implicit transaction costs.
While the Commission has not yet adopted rules governing trading of security-based
swaps on centralized venues such as exchanges and SB SEFs, post-trade transparency may have
particular benefits for exchange or SB SEF trading. 1256 In particular, providers of liquidity can
use publicly disseminated transaction data as a key input into their orders and quotations, thereby
increasing the efficiency of price formation. Market participants seeking liquidity can use recent
last-sale prices in the same or similar products as a basis for initiating negotiations with liquidity
providers. Liquidity seekers also can use public dissemination of other market participants’
recent transactions in the same or similar products to evaluate the quality of quotes being offered

of all transactions may suggest to all market participants profitable opportunities to offer or take
liquidity, based on the prices at which recent transactions were effected.
Moreover, the Commission believes that post-trade pricing and volume information could
allow valuation models to be adjusted to reflect how security-based swap counterparties have
valued a security-based swap product at a specific moment in time. Post-trade transparency of
security-based swap transactions also could improve market participants’ and market observers’
ability to value security-based swaps, especially in opaque markets or markets with low liquidity
where recent quotations or last-sale prices may not exist or, if they do exist, may not be widely
available. For example, a single-name CDS contract that expires in five years may yield
information relevant for pricing other five-year CDS on the same firm, and will also provide
information on default probabilities that may help price other CDS on the same firm with
different maturities, or on other firms in the same industry.
By improving valuations, post-trade transparency of security-based swap transactions
could contribute to more efficient capital allocation. In particular, under the post-trade
transparency regime of Regulation SBSR, market observers, whether or not they engage in the
security-based swap transactions, could use information produced and aggregated by the
security-based swap market as an input to both real investment decisions as well as financial
investments in related markets for equity and debt. 1257 Improved valuation, together with more
efficient prices, that may arise as a result of publicly disseminated transaction information, could

directly contribute to efficiency of capital allocation by firms whose obligations are referenced
by security-based swaps.
A number of studies of the corporate bond market have found that post-trade
transparency, resulting from the introduction of TRACE, has reduced implicit transaction
costs. 1258 Post-trade transparency could have the same effect in the security-based swap market.
The Commission acknowledges that the differences between the security-based swap market and
other securities markets might be sufficiently great that post-trade transparency might not have
the same effects in the security-based swap market. 1259 Nevertheless, similarities in the way the
security-based swap market and corporate bond market are structured—both markets evolved as
dealer-centric OTC markets with limited pre- or post-trade transparency—suggest that some of
the benefits that result from post-trade transparency in the corporate bond market also would
arise in the security-based swap market as well.
Public dissemination of security-based swap transactions is also designed to promote
better valuation of security-based swaps themselves, as well as of underlying and related assets.
In transparent markets with sufficient liquidity, valuations generally can be derived from recent
quotations and/or last-sale information. However, in opaque markets or markets with low
liquidity—such as the current market for security-based swaps—recent quotations or last-sale

Trading Costs in Corporate Bonds, J. of Fin. Econ., Vol. 82, at 251-288 (2006).

1259

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission requested comment on
whether post-trade transparency would have a similar effect on the security-based swap
market as it has in other securities markets—and if not, why not. No commenters
responded to the Commission’s request.

518

information may not exist for many products or, if they do exist, may not be widely available. 1260
Therefore, market participants holding assets that trade in opaque markets or markets with low
liquidity frequently rely instead on pricing models to value their positions. These models could
be imprecise or be based on assumptions subject to the evaluator’s discretion. Thus, market
participants holding the same or similar assets but using different valuation models might arrive
at significantly different valuations.
All other things being equal, valuation models—particularly for assets in illiquid markets,
such as corporate bonds or security-based swaps—that include last-sale information in the
valuation models generally will be more informative than models that do not or cannot include
such inputs. Models without such inputs could be imprecise or be based on assumptions subject
to the evaluator’s discretion without having last-sale information to help identify or correct
flawed assumptions. As discussed in Section XXII(B)(1)(d), valuation models typically have
many inputs even in the absence of last-sale information. However, in general, models improve
if the information set is broadened to include additional data related to fundamental value, and
last-sale information is of particular relevance for pricing models. Research suggests that posttrade transparency helps reduce the range of valuations of assets that trade infrequently, 1261 and it
is likely that the security-based swap market participants and market observers will devise means
to incorporate last-sale reports of the asset to be valued, reports of related assets, or reports of
benchmark products that include the asset to be valued or closely related assets into their
valuation models. This should result in more accurate valuations of security-based swaps
1260

See supra Section XXII(B)(1)(b) (describing current level of trading activity and liquidity
in the security-based swap market).

519

generally, as all market participants and market observers would have the benefit of knowing
how counterparties to a security-based swap valued the security-based swap at a specific moment
in the recent past.
In addition, post-trade transparency of security-based swaps that are CDS should promote
better valuation of debt instruments and better understanding of the creditworthiness of debt
issuers generally. CDS are contracts that offer protection against events of default by a debt
issuer, such as a bankruptcy, debt restructuring, or a failure to pay. All other things being equal,
CDS protection on a more creditworthy issuer costs less than CDS protection on a less
creditworthy issuer. Furthermore, the cost of CDS protection on a single issuer may change over
time: If the issuer’s financial position strengthens, it is less likely to default on its debt and the
cost of CDS protection on the issuer generally will decrease; if the issuer’s financial condition
weakens, the cost of CDS protection on the issuer generally will increase. Mandatory post-trade
transparency of CDS transactions will offer market participants and market observers the ability
to assess the market’s view of the creditworthiness of entities underlying CDS contracts, which
often are large and systemically significant debt issuers. Currently, last-sale information of CDS
transactions generally is known only to the participants involved in a transaction (such as dealers
who execute with clients and brokers who may be involved in negotiating transactions). Public
dissemination of security-based swap transactions—both CDS and equity-based swaps—as
required by Regulation SBSR, will reduce the information asymmetry between insiders who are
involved in particular transactions and all others, and is thus designed to promote greater price

520

efficiency in security-based swap markets, the related index swap markets, and the markets for
the underlying securities. 1262
Public dissemination of transactions in CDS that are based on reference entities that issue
TRACE-eligible debt securities should reinforce the pricing signals derived from individual
transactions in debt securities generated by TRACE. Since prices in debt securities of an issuer
and prices of CDS with that debt security as reference entity are related, any pricing signal
received as a result of a trade in one asset market may inform prices in the other. In addition, if
prices of debt securities in TRACE and last-sale information of related CDS are not consistent
with each other, market participants may avail themselves of arbitrage opportunities across these
two markets, thereby aligning the respective prices and enhancing price efficiency in both
markets. Similarly, public dissemination of transactions in single-name security-based swaps
should reinforce the pricing signals derived from public dissemination of transactions in index
swaps, where the index includes those individual securities. In addition, post-trade transparency
of security-based swap CDS under Regulation SBSR should indirectly bring greater transparency
into the market for debt instruments (such as sovereign debt securities) that are not subject to
mandatory public dissemination through TRACE or any other means by providing indirect
pricing information. For example, last-sale information for CDS referencing sovereign debt may
inform prices of the underlying sovereign debt.
b.

Programmatic Costs

Market participants may experience costs as a result of revealing the true size of their
trades if public dissemination of this information makes it more difficult to hedge their positions.
1262

See, e.g., Chakravarty, et al., note 1258, supra (estimating that the proportion of
information about underlying stocks revealed first in option markets ranges from 10 to
20%).
521

Further, public dissemination of true transaction sizes could result in higher costs if it allows
market participants to infer the identities of particular counterparties. Thus, some commenters
have argued for dissemination of the notional amount of block trades through a “masking” or
“size plus” convention comparable to that used by TRACE, in which transactions larger than a
specified size would be reported as “size plus.” 1263 The Commission considered this alternative,
but has elected to require a registered SDR to publicly disseminate (for all dissemination-eligible
transactions 1264), immediately upon receipt of the transaction report, all of the elements required
by Rule 901(c), including the true notional amount of the transaction. The Commission notes,
first of all, that a dissemination cap could deprive the market of important information about
overall exposure. With a cap in place, market participants would not have information about the
true size of very large trades, thereby reducing the precision with which they could estimate the
level of risk arising from those large trades. Furthermore, as noted above in Section VII(B)(4),
the Commission believes that a 24-hour timeframe for reporting of transaction information
during the interim phase of Regulation SBSR should address any concerns about disseminating
the true notional amount of any transaction and give market participants who choose to hedge
adequate time to accomplish a majority of their hedging activity1265 before transaction data are
publicly disseminated. During the interim phase, the Commission will be able to collect and

hedge, they tend to do so within one day. See Hedging Analysis.

522

analyze transaction information to develop an understanding of how market participants are
reacting to the introduction of mandated post-trade transparency.
Under Rule 902(a), a registered SDR will be required to publicly disseminate a condition
flag indicating whether two counterparties to a security-based swap are registered security-based
swap dealers. The Commission received one comment expressing concern that disseminating
such information would reduce the anonymity of counterparties, ultimately resulting in “worse
pricing and reduced liquidity for end-users.” 1266 Public dissemination of this information will
indicate that a transaction involved two counterparties that are dealers. Although flagging
transactions between two registered security-based swap dealers does indeed provide information
to the public that the transaction involved two dealers, thus restricting the set of possible
counterparties, the Commission believes that, since the majority of transactions in the securitybased swap market are between dealers, market observers are unlikely to be able to identify
particular counterparties using this information.
Another potential cost of post-trade transparency is that it may increase inventory risks.
Dealers often enter trades with their customers as a liquidity supplier. Dealers trying to hedge
inventory following a trade might be put in a weaker bargaining position relative to subsequent
counterparties if transactions prices and volumes are publicly-disseminated. With mandated
post-trade transparency, the market will see when a large transaction or a transaction in an
illiquid security occurs and is aware that the dealer who took the other side may attempt to hedge
the resulting position. As a result, other market participants may change their pricing
unfavorably for the dealer, making it more expensive for the dealer to hedge its position. Dealers
could respond either by raising the liquidity premium charged to their clients or refusing to
1266

ISDA IV at 16.

523

accommodate such trades. Such behavior could lead to lower trading volume or reduce the
ability of certain market participants to manage risk, either of which could adversely affect all
market participants. An increase in post-trade transparency could also drive trades to other
markets or instruments that offer the opacity desired by traders, which could increase
fragmentation, since trading would occur at more trading centers, or potentially reduce liquidity.
This possibility is consistent with the argument that large, informed traders may prefer a less
transparent trading environment that allows them to minimize the price impact of their trades.
Public dissemination of security-based swap transaction information, therefore, could cause
certain market participants to trade less frequently or to exit the market completely. A reduction
in market activity by these participants, especially if they are large, informed traders, could have
an adverse effect on market liquidity.
We are currently unable to quantify the costs associated with market exit or reduced
liquidity that might result from post-trade transparency. This is due to two factors: (1) lack of
robust data; and (2) lack of experimental conditions necessary for identifying the impact of posttrade transparency on the costs of hedging. As noted above, Commission staff has undertaken a
study that attempts to identify instances of hedging behavior by dealers in the single-name CDS
market. Subject to the data limitations described in the study, the low levels of such behavior
suggest that, in aggregate, post-trade transparency is unlikely to drive down liquidity or increase
the liquidity premium charged by dealers to non-dealers as a result of increasing the cost of
hedging. 1267 Commission staff has also undertaken a study of the effects of the introduction of
mandatory post-trade transparency in the index CDS market pursuant to CFTC rules. Subject to
the data limitations in the study, and the fact that the security-based swap and the swap markets
1267

See Hedging Analysis.

524

are related but not identical, staff found little empirical evidence that the introduction of
mandatory post-trade transparency in the index CDS market resulted in reduced trading activity,
liquidity, or risk exposure in the index CDS market. 1268 Moreover, studies of the corporate bond
market, another largely OTC market, do not find evidence of market exit or reduced liquidity
associated with post-transparency. 1269
Another potential cost of post-trade transparency as required under Rule 902 is that
market observers could misinterpret or place undue importance on particular last-sale
information that might not accurately reflect the market. For example, if a large market
participant failed, it could be required to liquidate its portfolio at “fire sale” prices. If market
observers were not aware of any unusual conditions surrounding particular transaction prints,
they might interpret fire sale prices to indicate changes to the economic fundamentals of
security-based swap positions that they hold. If some of these market participants mark down
the value of their portfolios, the result could be additional margin calls and further market stress.
In these circumstances, use of valuation models that include last-sale data, but do not condition
those data on the information about unusual conditions could lead to market de-stabilization. 1270
Rule 902(a) requires a registered SDR to publicly disseminate a transaction report of any
security-based swap immediately upon receipt of transaction information about the securitybased swap, except in in certain limited circumstances. 1271 The published transaction report
must consist of all the information reported pursuant to Rule 901(c), plus the execution time

stamp and any necessary flags required by the registered SDR to which the transaction is
reported.
Implementing and complying with the public dissemination requirement of Rule 902 will
add 20% to the start-up and ongoing operational expenses that would otherwise be required of a
registered SDR. 1272 In particular, the Commission continues to estimate that the initial one-time
aggregate costs for development and implementation of the systems needed to disseminate the
required transaction information would be $20,000,000, which corresponds to $2,000,000 per
registered SDR. Further, the Commission continues to estimate that aggregate annual costs for
systems and connectivity upgrades associated with public dissemination would be approximately
$12,000,000, which corresponds to $1,200,000 per registered SDR. Thus the initial aggregate
costs associated with Rule 902 are estimated to be $32,000,000, which corresponds to
$3,200,000 per registered SDR. To the extent that those market participants planning on
registering as SDRs have already expended resources if they voluntarily report their transactions
or because they are registered SDRs with the CFTC, the costs to become a registered SDR could
be significantly lower. As a result, the Commission’s estimates should be viewed as an upper
bound of the potential costs of Regulation SBSR.
c.

Alternative Approaches to Public Dissemination

The Commission considered alternative approaches to the public dissemination of
transactions information. First, the Commission has considered, but is not adopting, an
exemption from Regulation SBSR’s regulatory reporting or public dissemination requirements
for inter-affiliate security-based swaps, although the Commission generally believes that a

1272

See SDR Adopting Release, Section VIII(D)(2). See also Regulation SBSR Proposing
Release, 75 FR at 75269.

526

registered SDR should consider establishing a flag for inter-affiliate security-based swaps to help
market observers better understand the information that is publicly disseminated. 1273
Commenters had raised concerns about the public dissemination of inter-affiliate
transactions, comments that the Commission carefully considered in its adoption of Rule 902. 1274
As an example, one commenter argued that “public reporting of inter-affiliate transactions could
seriously interfere with the internal risk management practices of a corporate group” and that
“[p]ublic disclosure of a transaction between affiliates could prompt other market participants to
act in a way that would prevent the corporate group from following through with its risk
management strategy by, for instance, causing adverse price movements in the market that the
risk-carrying affiliate would use to hedge.” 1275 As stated above, the Commission agrees
generally that corporate groups should engage in appropriate risk management practices.
However, the Commission does not agree that Regulation SBSR, as adopted, is inimical to
effective risk management. The Commission notes that, during the interim phase of Regulation
SBSR, all security-based swaps—regardless of size—must be reported within 24 hours from the
time of execution and—except with regard to transactions falling within Rule 908(a)(2)—
immediately publicly disseminated. As discussed in Section VII above, this reporting timeframe
is designed, in part, to minimize any potential for market disruption resulting from public
dissemination of any security-based swap transaction during the interim phase of Regulation
SBSR. The Commission anticipates that, during the interim period, it will collect and analyze
data concerning the sizes of transactions that potentially affect liquidity in the market. The

1273

1274

See supra Section XI(B).

1275

Cleary II at 17.

527

Commission sees no basis for concluding, at this time, that inter-affiliate security-based swaps
are more difficult to hedge than other types of security-based swaps, or that the hedging of these
transactions presents unique concerns that would not also arise in connection with the hedging of
a security-based swap that was not an inter-affiliate transaction. Therefore, the Commission
does not agree with the commenters’ concern that public dissemination of inter-affiliate securitybased swaps will impede the ability of corporate groups to hedge.
Second, the Commission considered other mechanisms for public dissemination, but has
determined not to adopt any of them. 1276 In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the
Commission discussed a “first touch” approach to public dissemination, whereby a securitybased swap dealer or major security-based swap participant that is a counterparty to a securitybased swap would be responsible for dissemination. Under a “modified first touch” approach, a
platform on which a transaction was effected would be required to publicly disseminate a
transaction occurring on its market. However, under either of these alternate approaches, market
observers would be required to obtain and consolidate information from potentially dozens of
different sources. As the Commission stated in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release:
“Requiring registered SDRs to be the registered entities with the duty to disseminate information
would produce some degree of mandated consolidation of [security-based swap] transaction data
and help to provide consistency in the form of the reported information. This approach is
designed to limit the costs and difficulty to market participants of obtaining and assembling data
feeds from multiple venues that might disseminate information using different formats.” 1277
Moreover, even though the alternative approaches noted above would allow market
1276

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75227-28.

1277

528

participants to circumvent registered SDRs while fulfilling the public dissemination requirement,
neither alternative would reduce costs to market participants, since reporting sides would be
required to report transactions to an SDR to fulfil the regulatory reporting requirement. The
Commission received no comments that disagreed with the proposed approach imposing the duty
to disseminate security-based swap transaction information on registered SDRs, and has adopted
it as proposed.
3.

Interim Phase for Reporting and Public Dissemination

As discussed in more detail above, the rules, as adopted, establish an interim phase of
Regulation SBSR. During this interim phase, all covered transactions—regardless of their
notional size—must be reported to a registered SDR no later than 24 hours after the time of
execution. 1278 The registered SDR will be required to publicly disseminate a report of the
transaction immediately upon receipt of the information, except for the information described in
Rule 902(c).
Commission staff has undertaken an analysis of the inventory management of dealers in
the market for single-name CDS based on transaction data from DTCC-TIW. 1279 The analysis
shows that, when large trades in single-name CDS are hedged using offsetting trades in the
single-name CDS with the same reference entity, the majority of hedging activity takes places
within one day. 1280 The Commission acknowledges the concerns of a commenter that this
1278

If reporting would take place on a non-business day (i.e., a Saturday, Sunday, or U.S.
federal holiday), then reporting would be required by the same time on the next day that
is a business day.

1279

See Hedging Analysis.

1280

The Commission staff analysis represents an update and extension of earlier work by
staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (Chen et al.), which identified same-day
and next-day same-instrument dealer hedging activity within a three-month (May 1,
2010—July 31, 2010) sample of DTCC-TIW transaction data. Similar to the
529

analysis does not consider hedging activity that might occur between markets. 1281 For example,
dealers may use index CDS contracts to hedge exposures in single-name CDS. However, the
Commission notes that the presence of hedging opportunities in other markets – particularly
more liquid markets such as the market for index CDS – may increase the speed with which
dealers are able to hedge security-based swap exposures, and may limit the extent to which
public dissemination of transaction data with 24 hours of execution impairs their ability to hedge
large exposures. 1282
The same commenter further argued that, if single-name CDS on a reference entity trade
infrequently, dealers may not have opportunities to hedge using the same instrument in a short

Commission staff analysis, these authors’ results suggest that “large customer CDS trades
are not typically hedged via offsetting trades in the same instrument soon after they have
been transacted.” The authors conclude by saying that “requiring same day reporting of
CDS trading activity may not significantly disrupt same day hedging activity, since little
such activity occurs in the same instrument.” See Chen et al., supra note 510, at 17.
1281

See ISDA IV at 15 (stating that “participants may enter into risk mitigating transactions
using other products that are more readily available at the time of the initial trade (for
example CD index product [sic], CDS in related reference entities, bonds or loans issued
by the reference entity or a related entity, equities or equity options)).” The commenter
further “interprets the data in the study to imply that such temporary hedges in other asset
classes (rather than offsetting transactions in the precise reference entity originally
traded) are the norm for an illiquid market.” Id.

1282

The Commission notes that the impact of cross-market hedging may depend on the
market characteristics for hedging assets. If dealers use corporate bonds to hedge large
single-name CDS exposures, then the relative illiquidity of the corporate bond market
may make dealers’ ability to hedge sensitive to public dissemination of single-name CDS
transaction information. However, the commenter did not provide support for the
proposition that dealers rely on the corporate bond or equity markets to hedge singlename CDS exposure. Appropriate data are not currently available to the Commission.
By contrast, if dealers use more liquid assets to hedge—such as index CDS—then the
relative liquidity of the market for hedging assets may make it less likely that dealers’
orders are identified as hedging demand. This, in turn, reduces the likelihood that dealers
will face higher costs of hedging as a result of public dissemination of the original
security-based swap transaction.

530

period of time. 1283 The Commission acknowledges that some market participants may take more
than 24 hours to hedge exposures that result from large transactions in security-based swaps. As
noted below, if a liquidity provider engages in a large trade in an illiquid security but cannot
hedge its inventory risk within 24 hours, the result could be higher costs for liquidity provision.
However, based on supplemental staff analysis of single-name CDS transaction data, the vast
majority of large CDS transactions in the Hedging Analysis were written on reference entities
with transaction activity occurring more than once per day, on average. 1284 Hence, based on the
available data, the Commission does not conclude that the liquidity of the single-name CDS
included in the Hedging Analysis was insufficient to allow dealers ample opportunities to hedge
exposures within five days. Taking into consideration staff analysis and comments on this
analysis, the Commission continues to believe that a 24-hour time frame for reporting of
transaction information should allow market participants who choose to hedge adequate time to
accomplish a majority of their hedging activity before transaction data is publicly disseminated.

1283

See id. (stating that “If a reference entity trades less frequently than once per day, and a
particular reference entity/maturity combination trades less frequently than that, it is
unlikely that a dealer could hedge a large transaction using CDS in the same reference
entity even over a period of five days”).

1284

In response to this comment, Commission staff examined the average trading frequency
and volume of the reference entities represented in the sample of large transactions
relative to reference entities in the overall sample. According to this supplemental
analysis, for over 90% of the reference entities in the sample of “seed transactions” (as
defined in the Hedging Analysis,) transaction activity took place, on average, one or more
times per day between April 2013 and March 2014. Commission staff also examined
transaction activity in the six-month period prior to the sample used in the Hedging
Analysis to avoid confounding its measures of trading activity with the large transactions
and subsequent hedging activity it identified within the original study period. In the six
months prior to April 2013, approximately 85% of reference entities in the sample of
seed transactions were involved in transaction activity an average of one or more times
per day.

531

Although any reporting side could take a full 24 hours to report a given trade under the
interim phase, the final rules may provide incentives for reporting sides to submit trade reports in
substantially less than 24 hours. In particular, as discussed above in Section VII(B)(1), because
Rule 902(d) embargos transaction information until the information is transmitted to a registered
SDR, any SB SEF that wants to continue the use of work-ups must ensure that transactions are
reported to a registered SDR no later than the time at which a completed transaction is broadcast
to the users of the SB SEF. Reporting sides may choose to report trades in less than 24 hours
because their gains from work-ups exceed costs stemming from public dissemination.
a.

Programmatic Benefits

The Commission notes that the interim phase of Regulation SBSR will result in increased
transparency in the security-based swap market, as compared to the current market. Several
commenters expressed concern that a public dissemination regime with improper block trade
thresholds could harm market liquidity. 1285 A phased approach seeks to create some measure of
post-trade transparency in the security-based swap market while avoiding the creation of
inappropriate block standards.
This interim phase will afford the Commission the opportunity to use data made available
by registered SDRs to consider the potential impact, across different security-based swap asset
classes, of various public dissemination times on transaction costs, hedging activity, and price
efficiency for trades involving a range of notional amounts in instruments of varying
liquidity. 1286 Analysis of additional data is important for two key reasons. First, while the
1285

See supra note 486.

1286

See ISDA IV at 15 (noting that liquidity of CDS contracts on a reference entity may be a
determinant of the risk management strategies of dealers attempting to hedge exposures
generated when they engage in single-name CDS transactions).

532

Commission has used available data to inform its current approach to regulatory reporting, the
Commission expects the market to evolve in response to substantive regulation pursuant to
Regulation SBSR and other Title VII rulemaking. In particular, additional post-trade
transparency afforded by the interim phase may alter market participants’ trading strategies in
ways that will likely affect what constitutes an appropriate block trade threshold in an
environment with post-trade transparency. Such changes to the regulatory environment for
security-based swap transactions make additional data analysis critical to robust determination of
block thresholds and associated dissemination delays.
Second, the Commission believes that data elements such as reporting and execution time
stamps required under Rule 901 will make data collected from registered SDRs more suitable
than currently available data for examining relationships between reporting delays, notional
amounts and other variables of economic interest. For example, as noted by Commission staff in
its analysis of inventory risk management in the security-based swap market, although the CDS
transaction data currently available to the Commission includes both the date and time at which
DTCC received and recorded the transaction, only the date of the execution is reported to DTCC,
and not the actual time of the execution. 1287 Under Regulation SBSR, Commission staff will be
able to identify not only the execution time, to the second, but also the length of time between
when a transaction is executed and when a registered SDR receives the associated transaction
report.
Accordingly, the Commission is directing its staff to issue a report, for each asset class,
regarding block thresholds and dissemination delays for large notional security-based swap
transactions in each asset class. The reports are intended to inform the Commission’s
1287

See Hedging Analysis.

533

specification of criteria for determining what constitutes a block trade and the appropriate time
delay for reporting block trades. The Commission will take into account the reports, along with
public comment on the reports, in determining block thresholds and associated reporting delays.
Each report will be linked to the availability of data from registered SDRs in that each
report must be complete no later than two years following the initiation of public dissemination
from the first registered SDR in that asset class. The Commission believes that this timeframe is
necessary for a thorough analysis of the transaction data. First, a two-year timeframe will help
ensure that Commission staff’s econometric analysis will have statistical power sufficient to
draw clear conclusions about the effects of notional amount and reporting delay on price impact,
hedging activity, and price efficiency. Second, the Commission believes that this timeframe is
sufficiently large to capture seasonal effects, such as periodic “rolls”, that may affect trading
behavior in the security-based swap market. Finally, a sufficiently long timeframe increases the
likelihood that Commission staff can separate potential market impacts resulting from the
introduction of mandated post-trade transparency from short-term macroeconomic trends and
shocks that also could affect market behavior.
While allowing time for data gathering and analysis by Commission staff that will inform
the Commission about appropriate block thresholds and reporting delays, the interim approach to
reporting and public dissemination may moderate the economic effects flowing from public
dissemination of transaction data. By providing reporting sides up to 24 hours during the interim
phase of Regulation SBSR in which to report their transactions, market observers will experience
delays in obtaining information about market activity compared to an alternative policy of
implementing a requirement for real-time reporting and public dissemination at the present time.
For example, if there is a spike in activity or a significant price movement in a particular

534

security-based swap product, market observers might not become aware of this until 24 hours
afterwards. Larger dealers that observe more order flow and execute more transactions than
other market participants would, during the interim phase, continue to enjoy an informational
advantage over others who are not yet aware of recently executed transactions.
b.

Programmatic Costs

While the Commission has considered whether there could be a reduction in the
programmatic benefits of public dissemination associated with providing too much time before a
security-based swap transaction must be reported and publicly disseminated, the Commission
also has considered that 24 hours might be too little time for liquidity providers to manage
inventory risk. If a liquidity provider who engages in a large trade, or in a trade in an illiquid
security, cannot offset the risk within 24 hours, the costs for providing liquidity could rise,
resulting in less liquidity provision (i.e., less size provided at the desired price, or the same size
provided at worse prices). This result might be avoided in a regulatory environment offering a
longer delay between the time of execution of a security-based swap and the time that it must be
reported and publicly disseminated.
4.

Use of UICs

Rule 903(a) provides that, if an IRSS meeting certain criteria is recognized by the
Commission and issues a UIC, that UIC must be used by all registered SDRs and their
participants in carrying out duties under Regulation SBSR. Under Rule 903(a), if the
Commission has recognized such an IRSS that assigns UICs to persons, each participant of a
registered SDR shall obtain a UIC from or through that system. If no IRSS that can issue
particular types of UICs has been recognized, the registered SDR is required to assign such UICs
using its own methodology.

535

The following UICs are specifically required by Regulation SBSR: counterparty ID,
product ID, transaction ID, broker ID, branch ID, trading desk ID, trader ID, execution agent ID,
platform ID, and ultimate parent ID. The security-based swap market data typically include feebased codes, and all market participants and market observers must pay license fees and agree to
various usage restrictions to obtain the information necessary to interpret the codes. Under Rule
903(b), a registered SDR may permit information to be reported pursuant to Rule 901, and may
publicly disseminate that information pursuant to Rule 902, using codes in place of certain data
elements only if the information necessary to interpret those codes is widely available to users of
the information on a non-fee basis.
a.

Programmatic Benefits

UICs will provide market participants that use a common registered SDR with a uniform
way to refer to their counterparties and other persons or business units that might be involved in
a transaction (such as brokers, trading desks, and individual traders). UICs are designed to allow
registered SDRs, relevant authorities, and other users of data to quickly and reliably aggregate
security-based swap transaction information by UIC along several dimensions (e.g., by product,
by individual trader, or by corporate group (i.e., entities having the same ultimate parent)). The
requirement for a registered SDR to refer to each person, unit of a person, product, or transaction
with a single identifying code is designed to facilitate the performance of market analysis
studies, surveillance activities, and systemic risk monitoring by relevant authorities through the
streamlined presentation of security-based swap transaction data. These benefits apply on an
SDR level, as each registered SDR is required to assign UICs using its own methodology if a
relevant UIC is not available from an IRSS.

536

To the extent that multiple SDRs use the same UICs, these benefits would apply across
SDRs. In particular, because the Commission has recognized the GLEIS—through which LEIs
can be obtained—as an IRSS that meets the criteria of Rule 903, if an entity has an LEI issued by
or through the GLEIS, then that LEI must be used for all purposes under Regulation SBSR. The
Commission believes that this will facilitate aggregation by relevant authorities for surveillance
and monitoring purposes. Nevertheless, the Commission acknowledges potential impediments to
uniformity of UICs across registered SDRs. While registered SDRs are required to use an LEI
issued by the GLEIS to identify a counterparty to a reported transaction, this requirement extends
to only those counterparties that have been assigned an LEI by the GLEIS. Under Rule 903(a),
these counterparties will include all SDR participants that are U.S. persons, including special
entities and investment advisers, as well as all SDR participants that are registered security-based
swap dealers and registered major security-based swap participants. Additionally, these
counterparties will include non-U.S. subsidiaries of U.S. persons, when their performance under
security-based swaps is guaranteed by a U.S. affiliate. For a person who is a counterparty to a
security-based swap reported on a mandatory basis to a registered SDR, who does not meet these
conditions, and who has not obtained an LEI from the GLEIS, a registered SDR will be required
to assign a UIC to that market participant using its own methodology. For such counterparties,
this could result in the proliferation of multiple UIC assignments for the same entity to the extent
that they are counterparties to security-based swaps that are reported across several SDRs that
each assign a unique UIC.
This could pose challenges to the relevant authorities and other users of data to quickly
and reliably aggregate security-based swap transaction information, and potentially impede the
performance of market analysis studies and surveillance activities. In particular, mapping the

537

unique identifiers across SDRs would entail a manual process of connecting like entities initially,
and maintaining such a mapping over time to the extent that an entity’s organizational structure
changes in way that requires a change to the UIC. This manual process could slow or introduce
errors into the analysis of transaction activity or economic exposures of such counterparties.
Requiring all participants and the entities to which they provide guarantees to utilize LEIs under
Regulation SBSR should minimize these potential difficulties. Using the same LEI for these
counterparties across all registered SDRs eliminates the need for such mapping.
Even absent uniformity of UICs, the use of such codes by a registered SDR and its
participants could give rise to other significant potential benefits. The use of codes could
improve the accuracy of the trade reporting system by streamlining the provision of data to the
registered SDR. The product ID, for example, replaces several data elements that otherwise
would have to be reported separately, thus enforcing the internal consistency of those data
elements and reducing the likelihood of reporting errors.
In adopting Rule 903, the Commission has considered not only the benefits of using
unique identification codes generally, but also the benefits of ensuring that such codes can be
readily understood. Rule 903(b), as adopted, provides that a registered SDR may permit the use
of codes in place of certain data elements for use in regulatory reporting and public
dissemination of security-base swap transaction information only if the information necessary to
interpret such codes is widely available to users of the information on a non-fee basis. This
provision is intended to prevent any person who develops identification codes that might be used
for the reporting or public dissemination of security-based swap transactions to charge fees or
require other compensation from market participants, registered SDRs, other market
infrastructure providers, and users of security-based swap data. Open access to UICs will

538

promote the usage of public information about the security-based swap market, thereby
furthering the statutory goals of Title VII. Rule 903(b) eliminates the possibility that market
participants could be compelled to include fee-based codes in the transaction information that
they are required to provide to a registered SDR, or that registered SDRs could be compelled to
pay fees to code creators to be able to interpret the transaction information that is reported to
them, or that market observers are compelled to pay fees to code creators to be able to interpret
the security-based swap transaction information that is publicly disseminated. Rule 903(b) is
designed to reduce barriers to entry into the security-based swap market 1288 by counterparties as
well as service providers, because it minimizes the need for them to pay fees to code creators as
a cost of entry.
b.

Programmatic Costs

Rule 903 could also impose certain costs on current security-based swap market
participants. Currently, private coding systems exist in the security-based swap market. 1289 To
the extent that owners of these private coding systems do not make information to understand
these codes widely available on a non-fee basis, Rule 903 would prohibit the use of such codes in
the reporting or public dissemination of security-based swap transaction information carried out
pursuant to Regulation SBSR. As a result of Rule 903, owners of these coding systems that
otherwise might be used to report security-based swap transaction information will be restricted
1288

The fees that a new entrant would have to pay for the use of fee-based codes are a cost
that may deter a potential market participant from entering the security-based swap
market. Currently, there is no mandated post-trade transparency and the security-based
swap market is an OTC market and opaque, which is a barrier to enter for the market, as
new entrants are at an informational disadvantage compared to established market
participants, especially large dealers with significant order flow.

1289

The Commission is aware of one such product identification system that involves sixdigit reference entity identifiers and three-digit reference obligations identifiers as well as
a standard three-digit maturity identifier.

539

in their ability to profit from utilization of their codes for reporting under Regulation SBSR,
although such codes could still be used for other purposes. To the extent that these owners
currently generate revenue through fees charged to users of security-based swap data, Rule 903
could lower their revenues and cause them to increase revenues from other sources, including
from those entities that wish to have identifiers assigned to them. Thus, Rule 903 may result in a
reallocation of the costs associated with developing and maintaining UICs from users of data to
producers of data.
Further, to the extent that market participants who currently utilized fee-based codes must
reconfigure their systems and internal processes to use other codes (such as those issued by a
registered SDR) that are compliant with Rule 903(b), the costs of such reconfiguration can be
attributed to Rule 903(b). One commenter believed that reporting these UICs would require
“great cost and effort” from firms, including the costs associated with establishing and
maintaining UICs in the absence of a global standard. 1290 The Commission also acknowledges
commenter concerns that there could be a certain degree of cost and effort associated with
incorporating new UICs into firms’ internal processes and record-keeping systems. 1291
However, the Commission believes that these costs are justified in the context of the
programmatic benefits discussed in Section XXII(C)(4)(a), supra, such as the ability of relevant
authorities to easily aggregate transaction reports on a variety of dimensions. The costs of
developing such UICs are included in the discussion of the implementation of Rules 901

1290

See ISDA III at 2.

1291

See supra Section XXII(C)(1)(c); Section XXII(E)(1)(a) (detailing the data elements that
must be reported); Section XXII(C)(6)(d) (detailing the requirement that SDRs develop
policies and procedures for the reporting of the required data elements). See also note
160, supra.

540

(detailing the data elements that must be reported 1292) and 907 (detailing the requirement that
SDRs develop policies and procedures for the reporting of the required data elements 1293).
Any person who is a participant of a registered SDR must obtain an LEI from or through
the GLEIS. Based on transaction data from DTCC-TIW, the Commission believes that no fewer
than 3,500 of approximately 4,800 accounts that participated in the market for single-name CDS
in 2013 currently have LEIs and are likely to maintain these LEIs in the absence of Regulation
SBSR. 1294 Therefore, the Commission believes that no more than approximately 1,300 DTCCTIW accounts will have to obtain LEIs in order to comply with Rule 903(a). For these
participants, the assignment of an LEI will result in one-time costs assessed by local operation
units (“LOUs”) of the GLEIS associated with registering a new LEI. In addition to registration
costs, LOUs assess an annual fee for LEI maintenance. The Commission assumes that no market
participants that currently have LEIs would continue to maintain their LEIs in the absence of
Rule 903(a) in order to arrive at an upper bound on the ongoing costs associated with Rule
903(a).
The prices for registering a new LEI and maintaining an existing LEI vary by LOU.
Commission staff collected registration and maintenance charges for nearly all of the pre-LOUs
currently endorsed by the interim GLEIS. 1295 Based on these charges, the Commission

1292

See supra Section XXII(C)(1).

1293

See supra Section XXII(C)(6)(d).

1294

See supra note 1109. Commission staff used counterparty information provided by Avox
to match account numbers in the DTCC-TIW 2013 transactions data to their LEIs. Of
4,760 participating accounts, 3,533 had LEI information in their Avox counterparty
record.

1295

See “Endorsed Pre-LOUs of the Interim Global Legal Entity Identifier System (GLEIS)”,
January 2, 2015 (available at
http://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/lou_20131003_2.pdf).

541

estimates a per-entity registration cost of between $84 and $220 and a per-entity maintenance
cost of between $48 and $156. 1296
The Commission is aware of two factors that may reduce these costs over time. First, the
GLEIS operates on a cost-recovery model. If the marginal cost of an LEI is low, then an
increase in the volume of LEIs will reduce the average cost of obtaining an LEI. These cost
savings will be passed through to market participants in the form of lower prices. Second, the
ability of market participants to port LEIs to the LOU of their choice will result in competitive
pressure that may limit the prices that LOUs are able to charge for services. The governance
system of the GLEIS is in place to help ensure that these economic factors will be operative.
The Commission expects that, in addition to the costs of obtaining an LEI from an LOU,
each entity that registers a new LEI as a result of Rule 903(a) will incur start-up and ongoing
administrative costs of no more than $334 per year. 1297 The Commission believes, therefore, that
the upper bound on aggregate costs to market participants arising from the obligation to obtain
an LEI lies between $500,000 and $700,000 in the first year and between $1,600,000 and
$2,100,000 in subsequent years. 1298
1296

Commission staff converted all foreign currency amounts to U.S. dollars and added taxes
and surcharges where these amounts were available.

1297

This estimate is based on one hour of a compliance attorney at $334 per hour and is based
upon data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry
2013 (modified by the SEC staff to account for an 1,800-hour-work-year and multiplied
by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead).

1298

The lower end of the range for costs in the first year is calculated as: [(LEI Registration)
$84 + (Administration) $334] x 1,300 participants = $543,400. The upper end of the
range for costs in the first year is calculated as: [(LEI Registration) $220 +
(Administration) $334] x 1,300 participants = $720,200. The lower end of the range for
costs in subsequent years is calculated as: [(LEI Maintenance) $48 + (Administration)
$334] x 4,800 participants = $1,833,600. The upper end of the range for costs in
subsequent years is calculated as: [(LEI Maintenance) $156 + (Administration) $334] x
4,800 participants = $2,352,000.

Cross-Border Aspects of Regulation SBSR

Rule 908(a)(1), as adopted, identifies the security-based swaps that will be subject to
regulatory reporting and public dissemination. Rule 908(a)(2), as adopted, identifies the
security-based swaps that will be subject to regulatory reporting but will not be publicly
disseminated. Rule 908(b) provides that non-U.S. persons (except for non-U.S. persons that are
registered security-based swap dealers or registered major security-based swap participants) have
no duties under Regulation SBSR. Rule 908(c) provides that the Title VII requirements relating
to regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps may be satisfied by
compliance with the rules of a foreign jurisdiction if the Commission determines that the
jurisdiction has requirements that are comparable to those of Regulation SBSR.
As discussed further in Section XXII(D), the security-based swap market is a global
market characterized by a high level of interconnectedness and significant information
asymmetries. Because U.S. market participants and transactions regulated under Title VII are a
subset of the overall global security-based swap market and the swap markets more generally,
concerns surrounding risk and liquidity spillovers are part of the framework in which the
Commission analyzes the effects of these rules. Additionally, relevant authorities in other
jurisdictions are currently engaged in implementing their own regulatory reforms of the OTC
derivatives markets. Because a large portion of security-based swap activity involves both U.S.person and non-U.S. person counterparties, a key consideration in the Commission’s analysis of
the economic effects of these rules is the extent to which their application complements or
conflicts with rules promulgated by foreign regulators.

543

a.

Programmatic Benefits

Rule 908 provides that a transaction will be subject to regulatory reporting if there is a
direct or indirect counterparty on either or both sides that is a U.S. person, a registered securitybased swap dealer, or a registered major security-based swap participant, or if the transaction is
submitted to a clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United States.
The Commission anticipates that regulatory data that it receives from registered SDRs
will aid in its understanding of counterparty relationships in the global security-based swap
market that are most likely to affect the U.S. financial markets. Such market data will allow the
Commission to view, for example, large security-based swap exposures of U.S. persons,
registered security-based swap dealers, registered major security-based swap participants, and
U.S. clearing agencies that could have the potential to destabilize U.S. financial markets.
Moreover, because registered security-based swap dealers and members of U.S. clearing
agencies are likely to participate in other asset markets, regulatory reporting could help the
Commission estimate the risk that a corporate event could impair the ability of these market
participants to trade in other asset markets. An improved ability to measure such risks could
help the Commission evaluate the ability of the Title VII regulatory regime to limit the risk of
contagion between the security-based swap market and other asset markets.
A second key programmatic benefit of regulatory reporting is that it would aid the
Commission in detecting and taking appropriate action against market abuse. With
comprehensive data on transaction volumes and prices involving U.S. persons, the Commission
could help ensure that all market participants are able to benefit from the risk-sharing afforded
by the security-based swap market on fair terms.

544

Finally, security-based swap transaction data reported to registered SDRs would aid the
Commission and other relevant authorities in enforcing other Title VII rules and deter
noncompliance. For example, the Cross-Border Adopting Release set forth de minimis levels of
activity and exposures above which market participants would have to either register as securitybased swap dealers or as major security-based swap participants. 1299 Regulatory reporting could
help deter participants that engage in high transaction volume with counterparties that are
expected to have a significant portion of their financial and legal relationships exist within the
United States from avoiding the obligation to register with the Commission when their activity
surpasses these thresholds.
Rule 908(a)(2) determines the scope of transactions subject to public dissemination
requirements. A security-based swap must be publicly disseminated if there is a direct or
indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on either or both sides of the transaction, or if the
transaction is submitted to a clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United
States. Certain of the programmatic benefits of public dissemination are similar to those of
regulatory reporting. For instance, public dissemination of transaction prices will enable U.S.
persons to compare a quote provided by a registered security-based swap dealer against recent
transaction prices for security-based swaps referencing the same or similar underlying entities.
In addition, market participants will be able to analyze whether the price they paid for credit
protection is commensurate with prices revealed by transaction activity immediately following
their transaction. In both of these cases, public dissemination enables market participants to
evaluate the quality of the prices that dealers offer, providing registered security-based swap
dealers with additional incentives to quote narrower spreads.
1299

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47301.

545

Rule 908(c) provides that the Title VII requirements relating to regulatory reporting and
public dissemination of security-based swaps may be satisfied by compliance with the rules of a
foreign jurisdiction if the Commission determines that the jurisdiction has requirements that are
comparable to those of Regulation SBSR. In addition, to the extent that a market participant is
able to take advantage of a substituted compliance determination made under Rule 908(c), the
Commission does believe some cost reduction may be realized. If a market participant does not
report to an SDR registered with the Commission, such market participant (whether it be a
reporting side or not) would be able to avoid those costs detailed in this adopting release. A
market participant evaluating whether or not to take advantage of substituted compliance would
consider these potential cost reductions along with the costs it would incur in assessing the
feasibility of substituted compliance and meeting any conditions attached to a substituted
compliance determination by the Commission. 1300 While, the Commission is, at this time,
unable to estimate the net savings—as no substituted compliance determinations have been
made—the highest level of savings possible for a reporting side that avails itself of substituted
compliance is the aggregate cost of regulatory reporting under the final rules. 1301
b.

Programmatic Costs

Rules 908(a)(1) and (2) require regulatory reporting of transactions that involve U.S.
person counterparties, are submitted to U.S. clearing agencies, or that involve registered securitybased swap dealers or registered major security-based swap participants.
Other jurisdictions are developing rules relating to post-trade transparency for securitybased swaps at different paces. The Commission is mindful that, in the near term and until full
1300

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31202.

1301

See supra Section XXII(C)(1) (discussing the quantifiable costs of regulatory reporting).

546

implementation of post-trade transparency requirements in the other jurisdictions that are
comparable to those in Regulation SBSR, Rule 908(a)(1) may intensify incentives for non-U.S.
market participants to avoid contact with U.S. counterparties (whether acting directly or as
guarantors of non-U.S. persons) in an effort to avoid the public dissemination requirements.
This could result in reduced liquidity for U.S. market participants. 1302
The Commission cannot readily quantify the costs that might result from reduced market
access for U.S. persons or counterparties whose security-based swap activities benefit from
recourse to U.S. persons because the Commission does not know what rules other jurisdictions
may implement or the times at which they may implement their rules. However, while the
Commission has not quantified these costs, it assessed them qualitatively and considered them in
formulating the scope for requirements under the final rules. 1303
As discussed in Section XXII(C)(5), supra, the Commission believes that most of the
costs related to the cross-border application of Regulation SBSR are subsumed in the costs of
Rules 901 and 902, with one exception. Specifically, requests for a substituted compliance
determination would result in costs of preparing such requests. The Commission estimates the
costs of submitting a request pursuant to Rule 908(c) would be approximately $110,000. 1304 The
1302

The efficiency implications for public dissemination of cross-border activity is discussed
in Section XXII(D)(4)(b), infra.

1303

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR at 47278-372 (discussing recourse
guarantees).

1304

This estimate is based on information indicating that the average costs associated with
preparing and submitting an application to the Commission for an order for exemptive
relief under Section 36 of the Exchange Act in accordance with the procedures set forth
in Rule 0-12 under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.0-12. A substituted compliance
request contemplated by Rule 908(c) would be made under Rule 0-13 under the
Exchange Act, which sets forth procedures similar to those used by the Commission in
considering exemptive order applications under Section 36. The Commission estimates
that preparation of a request would require approximately 80 hours of in-house counsel
547

Commission further estimates that it will receive 10 requests in the first year and two requests
each subsequent year, for a total cost in the first year of $1,100,000 and a total cost in each
subsequent year of $220,000. Once such request is made, however, other market participants in
the same jurisdiction that wish to rely on substituted compliance with respect to regulatory
reporting and public dissemination would be able to rely on the Commission’s substituted
compliance determination. Accordingly, the assessment costs would only need to be incurred
once with respect to the same area of a foreign regulatory system.
c.

Assessment Costs

The Commission believes that the assessment costs associated with determining the
status of counterparties and the location of transactions should be primarily one-time costs of
establishing a practice or compliance procedure. As discussed in the Cross-Border Proposing
Release, 1305 the assessment costs associated with the substituted compliance would, in part, flow
from the assessment of whether the counterparties to a security-based swap transaction satisfy
the conditions of Rule 908(a). This assessment may be done by an in-house counsel reviewing

time and 200 hours of outside counsel time. Such estimate takes into account the time
required to prepare supporting documents necessary for the Commission to make a
substituted compliance determination, including, without limitation, information
regarding applicable requirements established by the foreign financial regulatory
authority or authorities, as well as the methods used by the foreign financial regulatory
authority or authorities to monitor compliance with these rules. Based upon data from
SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013 (modified
by the SEC staff to account for an 1,800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to
account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead), the Commission
estimates that the average national hourly rate for an in-house attorney is $380. The
Commission estimates the costs for outside legal services to be $400 per hour.
Accordingly, the Commission estimates the total cost to submit a request for a substituted
compliance determination to be approximately $110,000 ($30,400 (based on 80 hours of
in-house counsel time x $380) + $80,000 (based on 200 hours of outside counsel time x
$400)).
1305

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31202.

548

readily ascertainable information. The Commission believes that the cost involved in making
such assessment should not exceed one hour of in-house counsel's time or $380. 1306
The Commission believes that market participants will likely incur costs arising from the
need to identify and maintain records concerning the status of their counterparties and the
location of any clearing agency used. The Commission anticipates that potential applicants for
substituted compliance are likely to request representations from their transaction counterparties
to determine the counterparties’ status. The Commission believes that the assessment costs
associated with determining the status of counterparties should be primarily one-time costs of
establishing a practice or compliance procedure of requesting and collecting representations from
trading counterparties and maintaining the representations collected as part of the recordkeeping
procedures and limited ongoing costs associated with requesting and collecting
representations. 1307 As discussed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission
believes that such one-time costs would be approximately $15,160. 1308 The Commission
believes that requesting and collecting representations would be part of the standardized
transaction process reflected in the policies and procedures regarding security-based swap sales
and trading practices and should not result in separate assessment costs. 1309 To the extent that
market participants have incurred costs relating to similar or same assessments for other Title VII
requirements, their assessment costs with respect to substituted compliance may be less.

a.

Operating Hours of Registered SDRs—Rule 904

Paragraphs (c) to (e) of Rule 904 specify requirements for receiving, handling, and
disseminating reported data during a registered SDR’s normal and special closing hours. The
Commission believes that these provisions will provide benefits in that they clarify how securitybased swaps executed while a registered SDR is in normal or special closing hours would be
reported and disseminated. The Commission believes that the costs of requirements under these
rules will be related to providing notice to participants of its normal and special closing hours
and to provide notice to participants that the SDR is available to accept transaction data after its
system is unavailable.
One commenter asserted that the proposed requirement for a registered SDR to receive
and hold in the queue the data required to be reported during its closing hours “exceeds the
capabilities of currently-existing reporting infrastructures.” 1310 However, the Commission notes
that this comment was submitted in January 2011; since the receipt of this comment, swap data
repositories that are provisionally registered with the CFTC that are likely also to register as
SDRs with the Commission appear to have developed the capability of receiving and holding
data in queue during their closing hours. 1311 Thus, the Commission continues to believe that
requiring registered SDRs to hold data in queue during their closing hours would not create a
significant burden for registered SDRs.
Rule 904, as adopted, requires a registered SDR to have systems in place to receive and
disseminate information regarding security-based swap data on a near-continuous basis, except
during “normal closing hours” and “special closing hours.” A registered SDR will be permitted
1310

Markit I at 4.

1311

See supra note 668.

550

to establish “normal closing hours,” which may occur only when, in the estimation of the
registered SDR, the U.S. markets and other major markets are inactive. In addition, a registered
SDR will be permitted to declare, on an ad hoc basis, special closing hours to perform routine
system maintenance, subject to certain requirements. The re-proposal of Regulation SBSR in the
Cross-Border Proposing Release only made minor technical changes to Rule 904.
The Commission continues to believe that a registered SDR will not incur significant
costs in connection with Rule 904. The requirement for a registered SDR to provide reasonable
advance notice to participants and to the public of its normal and special closing hours, and to
provide notice to participants that the SDR is available to accept transaction data after its system
was unavailable will likely entail only a modest annual cost. The Commission estimates that the
ongoing aggregate annual cost would be $45,000, which corresponds to $4,500 per registered
SDR. 1312
The Commission does not believe there are significant one-time costs related to Rule 904.
The Commission believes that, other than the costs related to the notice provisions cited above,
any additional costs are subsumed in the costs associated with Rules 901 and 902. For example,
the requirement for reporting sides to report information to the registered SDR upon receiving a
notice that the registered SDR has resumed its normal operations would be part of the reporting
sides’ reporting obligations under Rule 901. The requirement to disseminate transaction reports
held in queue should not present any costs in addition to those already contained in Rule 902.
The Commission believes that the systems of the SDR would already have to account for system
upgrades and maintenance, power outages, system overloads or other malfunctions or
1312

The Commission derived this number as follows: [(Operations Specialist (36 hours) at
$125 per hour) x (10 registered SDRs)] = $45,000, which corresponds to $4,500 per
registered SDR.

551

contingencies and as a result there would not be any additional quantifiable costs to also account
for normal closing hours. Furthermore, to the extent that market participants have already
expended resources in anticipation of the adoption of Regulation SBSR, the costs could be
significantly lower. As a result, the Commission’s estimates should be viewed as an upper
bound of the potential costs of Regulation SBSR.
After reviewing comment letters received in response to the Regulation SBSR Proposing
Release and the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission continues to believe that these
cost estimates pertaining to Rule 904, as adopted, remain valid. The Commission has received
no comments to the contrary.
b.

Error Reporting—Rule 905

Rule 905 requires any counterparty to a security-based swap that discovers an error in
previously-reported information to take action to ensure that corrected information is provided to
the registered SDR to which the initial transaction was reported. The rule also requires a
registered SDR to verify any error reports that it receives and correct and, if necessary, publicly
disseminate a corrected transaction report. This rule should enhance the overall reliability of
security-based swap transaction data that must be maintained by registered SDRs. For registered
SDRs, the ability to verify disputed information, process a transaction report cancellation, accept
a new security-based swap transaction report, and update relevant records are all capabilities that
the registered SDR must implement to comply with its obligations under Regulation SBSR.
Likewise, to comply with Rule 905, a registered SDR must disseminate a corrected transaction
report in instances where the initial report included erroneous primary trade information. This
will allow market observers to receive updated transaction information from the same source that

552

publicly disseminated the original transaction and allow them to integrate updated transaction
information into their understanding of the security-based swap market.
Requiring participants to promptly correct erroneous transaction information should help
ensure that the Commission and other relevant authorities have an accurate view of risks in the
security-based swap market. Correcting inaccurate security-based swap transaction data held by
a registered SDR also could benefit market participants by helping them to accurately value the
security-based swaps they carry on their books.
The Commission believes that the costs of requirements under these rules will be related
to developing and publicly providing the necessary protocols for carrying out error correction
and reporting.
Rule 905(a), as adopted, establishes procedures for correcting errors in reported and
disseminated security-based swap information, recognizing that that any system for transaction
reporting must accommodate for the possibility that certain data elements may be incorrectly
reported. Rule 905(b), as adopted, sets forth the duties of a registered SDR to verify disputed
information and make necessary corrections. If the registered SDR either discovers an error in a
transaction on its system or receives notice of an error from a counterparty, Rule 905(b)(1)
requires the registered SDR to verify the accuracy of the terms of the security-based swap and,
following such verification, promptly correct the erroneous information contained in its system.
Rule 905(b)(2) will further require that, if the erroneous transaction information contained any
data that fall into the categories enumerated in Rule 901(c) as information required to be
reported, the registered SDR would be required to publicly disseminate a corrected transaction
report of the security-based swap promptly following verification of the trade by the
counterparties to the security-based swap.

553

The Commission continues to believe that promptly submitting an amended transaction
report to the appropriate registered SDR after discovery of an error as required under Rule
905(a)(2) will impose costs on reporting sides. Likewise, the Commission continues to believes
that promptly notifying the relevant reporting side after discovery of an error as required under
Rule 905(a)(1) will impose costs on non-reporting-party participants.
With respect to reporting side, the Commission continues to believe that Rule 905(a) will
impose an initial, one-time cost associated with designing and building the reporting entity’s
reporting system to be capable of submitting amended security-based swap transactions to a
registered SDR. In addition, reporting sides will face ongoing costs associated with supporting
and maintaining the error reporting function. 1313
The Commission continues to believe that designing and building appropriate reporting
system functionality to comply with Rule 905(a)(2) will be a component of, and represent an
incremental “add-on” to, the cost to build a reporting system and develop a compliance function
as required under Rule 901.
The Commission estimates this incremental burden to be equal to 5% of the one-time and
annual costs associated with designing and building a reporting system that is in compliance with
Rule 901, 1314 plus 10% of the corresponding one-time and annual costs associated with
developing the reporting side’s overall compliance program required under Rule 901. 1315 Thus,
1313

The Commission continues to believe that the actual submission of amended transaction
reports required under Rule 905(a)(2) would not result in material, independent costs
because this would be done electronically though the reporting system that the reporting
party must develop and maintain to comply with Rule 901. The costs associated with
such a reporting system are addressed in the Commission’s analysis of Rule 901. See
supra Section XXII(C)(1)(b).

1314

554

for reporting sides, the Commission estimates that Rule 905(a) will impose an initial (first-year)
aggregate cost of $3,547,500, which is approximately $11,825 per reporting side, 1316 and an
ongoing aggregate annual cost of $1,192,500, which is approximately $4,000 per reporting
side. 1317
With regard to participants who are not assigned the duty to report a particular
transaction, the Commission believes that Rule 905(a) will impose an initial and ongoing cost
associated with promptly notifying the relevant reporting side after discovery of an error as
required under Rule 905(a)(1). The Commission estimates that such annual cost will be
approximately $64,000,000, which corresponds to approximately $13,000 per participant. 1318
This figure is based on the Commission’s estimates of (1) 4,800 participants; and (2) 1.14
transactions per day per participant. 1319
Rule 905 also imposes duties on security-based swap counterparties and registered SDRs
to correct errors in reported and disseminated information.

1316

This figure is calculated as follows: [((($49,000 one-time reporting system development
costs) x (0.05)) + (($2,500 annual maintenance of reporting system) x (0.05)) + (($54,000
one-time compliance program development) x (0.1)) + (($38,500 annual support of
compliance program) x (0.1))) x (300 reporting sides)] = $3,547,500, or $11,825 per
reporting side.

1317

This figure is calculated as follows: [((($2,500 annual maintenance of reporting system)
x (0.05)) + ((38,500 annual support of compliance program) x (0.1))) x (300 reporting
sides)] = $1,192,500, or approximately $4,000 per reporting side.

1318

This figure is based on the following: [(1.14 error notifications per non-reporting-side
participant per day) x (365 days/year) x (Compliance Clerk (0.5 hours/report) at $64 per
hour) x (4,800 participants)] = $63,912,960, or approximately $64,000,000, which
corresponds to approximately $13,000 per participant.

1319

This figure is based on the following: [((2 million estimated annual security-based swap
transactions) / (4,800 participants)) / (365 days/year)] = 1.14 transactions per day.

555

The costs associated with establishing these capabilities, including systems development,
support, and maintenance, are largely addressed in the Commission’s analysis of those rules. 1320
The Commission estimates that to develop and publicly provide the necessary protocols for
carrying out these functions would impose on each registered SDR a cost of approximately
$200,000. 1321 The Commission estimates that to review and update such protocols will impose
an annual cost on each registered SDR of $400,000. 1322
Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the initial aggregate annual cost on
registered SDRs under Rule 905, as adopted, will be approximately $6,000,000, which
corresponds to approximately $600,000 for each registered SDR. 1323 The Commission further
estimates that the ongoing aggregate annual cost on registered SDRs under Rule 905, as adopted,
will be approximately $4,000,000, which corresponds to approximately $400,000 for each
registered SDR.
c.

Other Participants’ Duties—Rule 906

Rule 906(a) requires a registered SDR to send a notice to security-based swap
counterparties that are participants of that SDR about any UIC information missing from
1320

See SDR Adopting Release, Sections VIII and IX.

1321

This figure is based on the following: [(Sr. Programmer (80 hours) at $303 per hour) +
(Compliance Manager (160 hours) at $283 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney (250 hours)
at $334 per hour) + (Compliance Clerk (120 hours) at $64 per hour) + (Sr. Systems
Analyst (80 hours) at $260 per hour) + (Director of Compliance (40 hours) at $446 per
hour) = $199,340, or approximately $200,000 per registered SDR.

1322

This figure is based on the following: [(Sr. Programmer (160 hours) at $303 per hour) +
(Compliance Manager (320 hours) at $283 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney (500 hours)
at $334 per hour) + (Compliance Clerk (240 hours) at $64 per hour) + (Sr. Systems
Analyst (160 hours) at $260 per hour) + (Director of Compliance (80 hours) at $446 per
hour)] = $398,680, or approximately $400,000 per registered SDR.

1323

This figure is based on the following: [($199,340 to develop protocols) + ($398,680 for
annual support)) x (10 registered SDRs)] = $5,980,200, or approximately $6,000,000,
which corresponds to approximately $600,000 per registered SDR.

556

transaction reports. Rule 906(a) also obligates such participants to provide the missing UIC
information to the registered SDR upon receipt of such notice. Rule 906(a) is designed to enable
a registered SDR to obtain a complete record of the necessary information for each securitybased swap transaction and thereby enable the Commission and other relevant authorities to
obtain a comprehensive picture of security-based swap transactions, which will facilitate
surveillance and supervision of the security-based swap markets. More complete security-based
swap records may provide the Commission necessary information to investigate specific
transactions and market participants.
Rule 906(b) is designed to enhance the Commission’s ability to monitor and surveil the
security-based swap markets by requiring each participant of a registered SDR to report the
identity of its ultimate parent and any affiliates that also are participants of that registered SDR.
Obtaining this ultimate parent and affiliate information will be helpful for understanding the risk
exposures of not only individual participants, but also for related participants operating within a
larger financial group. The Commission expects these costs of requiring participants to provide
ultimate parent and affiliate information to registered SDRs will be modest and, in any event,
believes that the costs of providing this information are justified. Having information on the
ultimate parent and affiliate would enhance the ability of the Commission to monitor securitybased swap exposures within ownership groups, allowing it to better assess the overall risk
exposure of these groups. The Commission is also attempting to reduce these burdens by
requiring participants to report the identity only of their ultimate parent(s) but not any
intermediate parent(s). The Commission further notes that a participant is not required to

557

provide any information about an affiliate, other than its counterparty ID. 1324 The participant is
not required to provide any transaction or other information on the affiliate’s behalf.
Rule 906(c) is designed to enhance the overall reliability security-based swap transaction
data that is required to be reported to a registered SDR pursuant to Rule 901 by requiring
registered security-based swap dealers and registered major security-based swap participants to
establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures addressing compliance with
Regulation SBSR. Rule 901(a) should result in reliable reporting of security-based swap
transaction data by requiring key participants to focus internal procedures on the reporting
function. Reliable reporting would benefit counterparties, relevant authorities, and the market
generally, by reducing the likelihood of errors in regulatory and publicly disseminated data. This
could allow relevant authorities and the public to have confidence in the data and minimize the
need to make corrections in the future.
The Commission believes that the costs of requirements under these rules will be related
to developing the written policies and procedures necessary to satisfy Rule 901’s reporting
requirements. Once development is complete, SDRs will face ongoing costs associated with
maintaining and enforcing these policies and procedures.
Rule 906(a) requires a registered SDR, once a day, to send a report to each participant
identifying, for each security-based swap to which that participant is a counterparty, any
security-based swap(s) for which the registered SDR lacks counterparty ID and (if applicable)
broker ID, trading desk ID, and trader ID. Rule 906(a) requires a participant that receives such a
1324

The Commission does not believe that the change in Rule 906(b) from “participant ID” to
“counterparty ID” will result in any change in the cost to participants. The information to
be provided is similar in scope and will, in the Commission’s estimation, better
accomplish the objective of ensuring that a registered SDR can identify each counterparty
to a security-based swap.

558

report to provide the missing information to the registered SDR within 24 hours. Rule 906(b)
requires participants to provide a registered SDR with information identifying the participant’s
affiliate(s) that are also participants of the registered SDR, as well as its ultimate parent(s).
Additionally, under Rule 906(b), participants are required to promptly notify the registered SDR
of any changes to the information previously provided. Rule 906(c) requires a participant that is
a registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant to
establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to
ensure compliance with any security-based swap transaction reporting obligations in a manner
consistent with Regulation SBSR.
Rule 906(a) requires a participant that receives a daily report from a registered SDR to
provide the missing UICs to the registered SDR within 24 hours. The Commission believes that
Rule 906(a) will result in an initial and ongoing aggregate annual cost for all participants since
even participants that are the reporting side for some transactions will be the non-reporting side
for other transactions. The Commission estimates that Rule 906(a) will result in an initial and
ongoing aggregate annual cost for participants of approximately $12,800,000, which corresponds
to a cost of approximately $2,700 per participant. 1325 This figure was based on the
Commission’s preliminary estimates of (1) 4,800 participants and (2) 1.14 transactions per day
per participant. 1326

1325

This figure is based on the following: [(1.14 missing information reports per participant
per day) x (365 days/year) x (Compliance Clerk (0.1 hours) at $64 per hour) x (4,800
participants)] = $12,782,592, or approximately $12,800,000, which corresponds to
approximately $2,700 per participant.

1326

This figure is based on the following: [((2 million estimated annual security-based swap
transactions) / (4,800 participants)) / (365 days/year)] = 1.14 transactions per day. See
supra Section XXI.

559

Rule 906(b) requires every participant to provide a registered SDR an initial
parent/affiliate report, using ultimate parent IDs and counterparty IDs, and updating that
information, as necessary. The Commission continues to believe that the cost for each
participant to submit an initial or update report will be $32. 1327 The Commission estimates that
each participant will submit two reports each year. 1328 In addition, the Commission estimates
that there may be 4,800 security-based swap participants and that each one may connect to two
registered SDRs. Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the initial and ongoing aggregate
annual cost associated with Rule 906(b) will be $614,400, which corresponds to $128 per
participant. 1329
Rule 906(c) requires each participant of a registered SDR that is a registered securitybased swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant to establish, maintain, and
enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with
any security-based swap transaction reporting obligations in a manner consistent with Regulation
SBSR. 1330 Rule 906(c) also requires the review and updating of such policies and procedures at
least annually. The Commission continues to estimate that developing and implementing written
policies and procedures as required under the Rule 906 could result in a one-time initial cost to
1327

This figure is based on the following: [(Compliance Clerk (0.5 hours) at $64 per hour) x
(1 report)] = $32.

1328

During the first year, the Commission believes each participant would submit its initial
report and one update report. In subsequent years, the Commission estimates that each
participant would submit two update reports.

1329

This figure is based on the following: [($32/report) x (2 reports/year/registered SDR
connection) x (2 registered SDR connections/participant) x (4,800 participants)] =
$614,400, which corresponds to $128 per participant.

1330

As is explained in the Paperwork Reduction Act discussion, the Commission estimates
that there will be approximately 50 registered security-based swap dealers and 5
registered major security-based swap participants for a total of 55 respondents. See supra
Section XXII(C)(1)(b)(i).

560

each registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant of
approximately $58,000. 1331 This figure includes the estimated cost to develop a set of written
policies and procedures, program systems, implement internal controls and oversight, train
relevant employees, and perform necessary testing. 1332 In addition, the Commission estimates
that the annual cost to maintain such policies and procedures, including a full review at least
annually, as required under the adopted rule, will be approximately $34,000 for each registered
security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant. 1333 This figure is
based on an estimate of the cost to review existing policies and procedures, make any necessary
updates, conduct ongoing training, maintain relevant systems and internal controls systems, and
perform necessary testing.
Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the initial aggregate annual cost associated
with Rule 906(c) would be approximately $5,060,000, which corresponds to $92,000 per covered
participant. 1334 The Commission further estimates that the ongoing aggregate annual cost

1331

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: [(Sr. Programmer (40 hours) at
$303 per hour) + (Compliance Manager (40 hours) at $283 per hour) + (Compliance
Attorney (40 hours) at $334 per hour) + (Compliance Clerk (40 hours) at $64 per hour) +
(Sr. Systems Analyst (32 hours) at $260 per hour) + (Director of Compliance (24 hours)
at $446 per hour)] = $58,384, or approximately $58,000 per covered participant.

1332

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 30994, note 256.

1333

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: [(Sr. Programmer (8 hours) at
$303 per hour) + (Compliance Manager (24 hours) at $283 per hour) + (Compliance
Attorney (24 hours) at $334 per hour) + (Compliance Clerk (24 hours) at $64 per hour) +
(Sr. Systems Analyst (16 hours) at $260 per hour) + (Director of Compliance (24 hours)
at $446 per hour)] = $33,632, or approximately $34,000 per covered participant.

1334

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: [($58,000 + $34,000) x (55
covered participants)] = $5,060,000, or approximately $92,000 per covered participant.

561

associated with Rule 906(c) will be approximately $1,870,000, which corresponds to $34,000 per
covered participant. 1335
Rule 906(a) requires a registered SDR, once a day, to send a report to each participant
identifying, for each security-based swap to which that participant is a counterparty, the securitybased swap(s) for which the registered SDR lacks counterparty ID and (if applicable) broker ID,
branch ID, execution agent ID, trading desk ID, and trader ID. Under Rule 906(a), a participant
that receives such a report will be required to provide the missing ID information to the
registered SDR within 24 hours.
The Commission believes that each registered SDR would face a one-time, initial cost of
approximately $33,000 to create a report template and develop the necessary systems and
processes to produce a daily report required by Rule 906(a). 1336 The Commission further
believes that there will be an ongoing annual cost for a registered SDR to generate and issue the
daily reports, and to enter into its systems the ID information supplied by participants in response
to the daily reports, of approximately $30,000. 1337
The Commission continues to estimate that the initial aggregate annual cost for registered
SDRs associated with Rule 906(a) would be approximately $630,000, which corresponds to

1335

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: [($34,000) x (55 covered
participants)] = $1,870,000.

1336

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: [(Senior Systems Analyst (40
hours) at $260 per hour) + (Sr. Programmer (40 hours) at $303 per hour) + (Compliance
Manager (16 hours) at $283 per hour) + (Director of Compliance (8 hours) at $446 per
hour) + (Compliance Attorney (8 hours) at $334)] = $33,288, or approximately $33,000
per registered SDR.

1337

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: [(Senior Systems Analyst (24
hours) at $260 per hour) + (Sr. Programmer (24 hours) at $303 per hour) + (Compliance
Clerk (260 hours) at $64 per hour)] = $30,152, or approximately $30,000 per registered
SDR.

562

$63,000 per registered SDR. 1338 The Commission estimates that the ongoing aggregate annual
cost for registered SDRs associated with Rule 906(a) will be approximately $300,000, which
corresponds to $30,000 per for registered SDR.
d.

Registered SDR Policies and Procedures—Rule 907

Rule 907(a) requires a registered SDR to establish and maintain written policies and
procedures with respect to the receipt, reporting, and dissemination of security-based swap
transaction data pursuant to Regulation SBSR. Under Rules 907(a)(1) and (2), a registered
SDR’s policies and procedures must specify the data elements of a security-based swap that must
be reported and the reporting format that must be used for submitting information. Under Rule
907(a)(3), the registered SDR’s policies and procedures must specify procedures for reporting
life cycle events and corrections to previously submitted information. Rule 907(a)(4) requires
policies and procedures for flagging transactions having special characteristics. Rules 907(a)(5)
requires policies and procedures for assigning UICs in a manner consistent with Rule 903. Rule
907(a)(6) requires policies and procedures for periodically obtaining from each of its participants
the ultimate parent and affiliate information required to be submitted to the SDR by Rule 906(b).
By requiring SDRs to establish and maintain policies and procedures pursuant to Rule
907(a)(1), SDRs likely will have to consult with their participants in devising flexible and
efficient methods of obtaining high quality transaction data from market participants. This rule
allows SDRs to adjust their policies and procedures as market conventions and technologies
change. For example, registered SDRs will have the flexibility to incorporate new reporting
methodologies more quickly. In addition, Rule 907(a)(1) should reduce the likelihood that
1338

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: [($33,288 + $30,152) x (10
registered SDRs)] = $634,400, or approximately $630,000, which corresponds to
$63,440, or approximately $63,000 per registered SDR.

563

financial innovation that leads to a new security-based swap products will disrupt regulatory
reporting and public dissemination of transaction information related to the new product.
At the same time, the Commission believes that there are benefits to enforcing minimum
standards for reporting transaction information, standards that will be established as a result of
the requirement that SDRs develop policies and procedures in accordance with Rule 907. As
noted in Section XXII(B)(1)(a)(iii), the Commission anticipates that a small number of registered
SDRs will serve the security-based swap market. These SDRs may enjoy market power relative
to their participants, and we believe that imposing minimum standards on them is reasonable to
mitigate the risk that imperfect competition leads to low quality data collection.
Further, the requirement in Rule 907(c) that a registered SDR make publicly available on
its website the policies and procedures required by Regulation SBSR will allow the public to
better understand and interpret the data publicly disseminated by SDRs. For example, under
Rule 907(a)(4)(i), a registered SDR will have policies and procedures that identify the
characteristics of a security-based swap that could, in the fair and reasonable estimation of the
registered SDR, cause a person without knowledge of these characteristics to receive a distorted
view of the market. Making publicly available a description of the flags that it requires will
allow the public to interpret the flags they observe in publicly disseminated data. Rule 907(d)
requires registered SDRs to review, and update as necessary, the policies and procedures
required by Regulation SBSR at least annually, and indicate the date on which they were last
reviewed.
Finally, Rule 907(e) requires a registered SDR to provide to the Commission, upon
request, information or reports related to the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of data
reported to the registered SDR pursuant to Regulation SBSR and the registered SDR’s policies

564

and procedures established thereunder. Rule 907(e) will assist the Commission in examining for
compliance with Regulation SBSR and in bringing enforcement or other administrative actions
as necessary or appropriate. Required data submissions that are untimely, inaccurate, or
incomplete could diminish the value of publicly disseminated reports that are designed to
promote transparency and price discovery.
The Commission believes that the costs of requirements under Rule 907(a) are related to
developing policies and procedures. Rules 907(c) and 907(d) require a registered SDR to update
its policies and procedures as necessary and to post these policies and procedures on its website.
Rule 907(e) requires a registered SDR to provide the Commission with information related to the
timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of data reported to it pursuant to Regulation SBSR and
the registered SDR’s policies and procedures established thereunder.
Under Regulation SBSR, registered SDRs have the flexibility to determine the precise
means through which they will accept reports of security-based swap transaction data. Rather
than setting—by rule—a fixed schedule of data elements that must be reported as well as the
specific reporting language or reporting protocols that must be used, Regulation SBSR instead
requires registered SDRs to establish and maintain policies and procedures that detail these
requirements. Persons seeking to register as SDRs may have ongoing discussions with their
participants—both before and after registration—about the appropriate means of permitting
reporting in a manner that captures all the elements required by Rule 901 while minimizing the
administrative burden on reporting sides. Also, the data elements necessary to understand a trade
could evolve over time as new contracts are developed, or that the most efficient means of
reporting also could evolve as new technologies or reporting languages are devised. In light of
these considerations, the Commission believes that registered SDRs and, to the extent that SDRs

565

seek discussion with them, market participants will be in a better position to define the necessary
reporting elements over time as the security-based swap market evolves.
As discussed above in Section IV, the Commission considered the alternative of requiring
reporting parties to use a single reporting language or protocol in submitting data to registered
SDRs, and three commenters encouraged the use of the FpML standard. 1339
While specifying a single, acceptable standard would remove any ambiguity surrounding
data formats that reporting parties could use for transaction reports, the Commission has chosen
not to adopt such an approach, for three reasons. First, market participants may have preferences
over the different open-source structured data formats available. By allowing registered SDRs to
choose from among formats widely used by participants, the adopted approach allows SDRs to
coordinate with their participants to select standards that allow reporting parties to efficiently
carry out their obligations under Rule 901. Second, allowing SDRs flexibility in the formats
they accept should help ensure that they can accommodate innovations in the security-based
swap market that lead to changes in data elements that must be reported under Rule 901. Third,
the Commission believes that, so long as registered SDRs can make security-based swap
transaction data accessible to the Commission using a uniform format and taxonomy, it may not
be necessary to require reporting sides to report transaction data to registered SDRs using a
single format or taxonomy. This approach gives a registered SDR the opportunity to
differentiate its services by offering reporting sides the ability to report using different formats
and taxonomies, if the SDR can convert these transaction reports into the uniform format and
taxonomy pursuant to which the Commission will require the SDR to make transaction data
accessible to the Commission.

The Commission believes that ten registered SDRs will be subject to Rule 907, and that
developing and implementing written policies and procedures as required under Rule 907, will
result in an initial, one-time cost to each registered SDR of approximately $4,100,000. 1340 This
figure includes the estimated cost to develop a set of written policies and procedures, program
systems, implement internal controls and oversight, train relevant employees, perform necessary
testing, monitor participants, and compile data. In addition, the Commission believes that its
estimate for maintaining such policies and procedures, including a full review at least annually;
making its policies and procedures publicly available on its website; and providing the
Commission, upon request, information or reports related to the timeliness, accuracy, and
completeness of data reported to it pursuant to Regulation SBSR, and the registered SDR’s
policies and procedures is reasonable. As a result, the Commission believes its preliminary
estimate of approximately $8,200,000 for each registered SDR is valid. 1341 This figure is based
on an estimate of the cost to review existing policies and procedures, make necessary updates,
1340

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: [(Sr. Programmer (1,667
hours) at $303 per hour) + (Compliance Manager (3,333 hours) at $283 per hour) +
(Compliance Attorney (5,000 hours) at $334 per hour) + (Compliance Clerk (2,500
hours) at $64 per hour) + (Sr. Systems Analyst (1,667 hours) at $260 per hour) +
(Director of Compliance (833 hours) at $446 per hour)] = $4,083,278, or approximately
$4,100,000 per registered SDR. The Commission believes that potential SDRs that have
similar policies and procedures in place may find that these costs would be lower, while
potential SDRs that do not have similar policies and procedures in place may find that the
potential costs would be higher.

1341

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: [(Sr. Programmer (3,333
hours) at $303 per hour) + (Compliance Manager (6,667 hours) at $283 per hour) +
(Compliance Attorney (10,000 hours) at $334 per hour) + Compliance Clerk (5,000
hours) at $64 per hour) + (Sr. Systems Analyst (3,333 hours) at $260 per hour) +
(Director of Compliance (1,667 hours) at $446 per hour)] = $8,166,722, or approximately
$8,200,000 per registered SDR. The Commission believes that potential SDRs that have
similar policies and procedures in place may find that these costs would be lower, while
potential SDRs that do not have similar policies and procedures in place may find that the
potential costs would be higher.

567

conduct ongoing training, maintain relevant systems and internal controls systems, perform
necessary testing, monitor participants, and collect data. 1342 Accordingly, the Commission
estimates that the initial annual cost associated with Rule 907 will be approximately $12,250,000
per registered SDR, which corresponds to an initial annual aggregate cost of approximately
$122,500,000. 1343 The Commission estimates that the ongoing annual cost associated with Rule
907 will be approximately $8,200,000 per registered SDR, which corresponds to an ongoing
annual aggregate cost of approximately $82,000,000. 1344 These figures are based, in part, on the
Commission’s experience with other rules that require entities to establish and maintain
compliance with policies and procedures. 1345
Finally, the Commission continues to believe that the Rule 907(e) requirement that a
registered SDR must provide to the Commission, upon request, such information as the
Commission determines necessary or appropriate for the Commission to perform the duties of
the Commission, registered SDRs will incur costs. The Commission notes, however, that any
such costs are already covered by rules governing SDRs adopted in the SDR Adopting Release

1342

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission also included “calculate and
publish block trade thresholds” as one of the items in the list of items that an SDR would
need to undertake on an ongoing basis with respect to its policies and procedures under
Rule 907. See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75276-77. Although the
Commission is not adopting Rule 907(b) at this time, the costs discussed herein pertain to
all of the policies and procedures of a registered SDR. The Commission does not believe
that not adopting Rule 907(b), which applies only to policies and procedures relating to
block trades, would have had a measureable impact on the costs related to developing the
policies and procedures of the registered SDR. As a result, the Commission believes that
its cost estimate continues to be valid.

1343

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: [((4,083,278) + ($8,166,722))
x (10 registered SDRs)] = $122,500,000, or approximately $123,000,000.

1344

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: [($8,166,722) x (10 registered
SDRs)] = $81,667,220, or approximately $82,000,000.

1345

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 30994, note 256.

568

and, thus, do not need to be separately considered here. Specifically, Rule 13n-5(b) requires a
registered SDR to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to satisfy itself that the transaction data that has been submitted to the SDR is complete
and accurate, and also to ensure that the transaction data and positions that it maintains are
complete and accurate. 1346 The Commission further believes that these capabilities will enable a
registered SDR to provide the Commission information or reports as may be requested pursuant
to Rule 907(e). The Commission believes that Rule 907(e) will not impose any costs on a
registered SDR beyond those imposed by Rule 13n-5(b). Furthermore, to the extent that market
participants have already expended resources in anticipation of the adoption of Regulation
SBSR, the costs could be significantly lower. As a result, the Commission’s estimates should be
viewed as an upper bound of the potential costs of Regulation SBSR.
After reviewing comment letters received in response to the Regulation SBSR Proposing
Release and the Cross-Border Proposing Release, as well as evaluating the most recent data
available to the Commission, the Commission continues to believe that these cost estimates
related to Rule 907, as adopted, remain valid.
e.

SIP Registration by Registered SDRs—Rule 909

Rule 909 requires a registered SDR to register with the Commission as a SIP. SIP
registration of a registered SDR will help ensure fair access to important security-based swap
transaction data reported to and publicly disseminated by the registered SDR. Specifically,
requiring a registered SDR to register with the Commission as a SIP will subject it to Section
11A(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, 1347 which provides that a registered SIP must notify the
1346

See SDR Adopting Release, Rules 13n-5(b)(1)(iii) and 13n-5(b)(3).

1347

15 U.S.C. 78k-1(b)(5).

569

Commission whenever it prohibits or limits any person’s access to its services. If the
Commission finds that the person has been discriminated against unfairly, the Commission can
require the SIP to provide access to that person. 1348 Section 11A(b)(6) of the Exchange Act 1349
also provides the Commission authority to take certain regulatory action as may be necessary or
appropriate against a registered SIP. 1350 Potential users of security-based swap market data will
benefit from the Commission having the additional authority over a registered SDR/SIP provided
by Sections 11A(b)(5) and 11A(b)(6) to help ensure that these persons offer their security-based
swap market data on terms that are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory.
Because the Commission is adopting a revised Form SDR that incorporates certain
requests for information derived from Form SIP and will not require submission of a separate
Form SIP, all programmatic costs of completing Form SDR are included in the Commission’s
SDR Adopting Release. 1351 As proposed and re-proposed, Regulation SBSR would have
required the use of a separate form, existing Form SIP, for this purpose. In response to
comments, however, the Commission is adopting a revised Form SDR that incorporates certain
requests for information derived from Form SIP, and will not require submission of a separate
Form SIP. All programmatic costs of completing Form SDR are scored in the SDR Adopting
Release. 1352 Therefore, final Rule 909 itself imposes no programmatic costs on registered SDRs.

Definitions—Rule 900

The Commission believes that Rule 900 will not entail any material costs to market
participants. Rule 900 defines terms used in Regulation SBSR and does not, in itself, impose
any obligations or duties. To the extent that the scope of a particular definition subjects a person
to one or more provisions of Regulation SBSR, the costs and benefits of that rule are assessed
(and, where feasible, calculated) in light of the scope of persons affected. With respect to the
definition of “U.S. person,” the Commission believes that the Commission’s Title VII rules
would benefit from having the same terms throughout and could, therefore, reduce assessment
costs for market participants that might be subject to these rules.
D.

Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation
1.

Introduction

Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act 1353 requires the Commission, whenever it engages in
rulemaking and is required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, also to consider, in addition to the protection of investors,
whether the action would promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation (“ECCF”). In
addition, Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act 1354 requires the Commission, when making rules
under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact of such rules on competition. Section 23(a)(2)
also prohibits the Commission from adopting any rule that would impose a burden on
competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act.
Regulation SBSR’s effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation are often
closely related to one another, and it is difficult to distinguish between the effects of the final
1353

15 U.S.C. 78c(f).

1354

15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).

571

rules on each of these elements. For example, elements of a security-based swap market
structure that foster competition between liquidity suppliers may result in narrower spreads and
higher trading volume, eventually resulting in greater price efficiency. Similarly, a securitybased swap market that provides low-cost opportunities for firms to hedge commercial and
financial risks as a result of low implicit transaction costs may encourage capital formation by
allowing these firms to share risks with market participants that are better able to bear them,
thereby reducing their need to engage in precautionary savings. However, as the last example
indicates, the final rules’ effects on capital formation often arise indirectly through their effects
on efficiency and competition.
The following discussion of the effects of Regulation SBSR on efficiency, competition,
and capital formation considers the regime that Regulation SBSR establishes for regulatory
reporting and public dissemination as well as the particular means of implementation that the
Commission has chosen, relative to alternative means of implementation considered. Because
the various elements of these rules will affect the behavior of counterparties, infrastructure
providers, and market participants in general, the Commission has considered the economic
effects at each of these levels, including cases in which policy alternatives that may be privately
efficient for individual actors, may nevertheless fail to be efficient for the overall market.
Regulation SBSR establishes a regime for regulatory reporting and public dissemination
of security-based swap transaction data. Under the final rules, the Commission and other
relevant authorities will have access to detailed information about security-based swap
transaction activity and about the risk exposures of security-based swap counterparties to both
reference entities and to each other. At the same time, the public will enjoy unprecedented
access to pricing and volume data of security-based swap transactions. Post-trade transparency

572

in the security-based swap market will reduce information asymmetries, thereby allowing even
small counterparties to base their trading decisions on information about activity in the broader
market, which they would not be able to observe without post-trade transparency. Moreover,
public dissemination of security-based swap transactions could be used as an input to economic
decisions in other markets (e.g., the corporate equity or bond markets).
2.

Regulatory Reporting

As a result of the final rules, the Commission and other relevant authorities will have
access, through registered SDRs, to comprehensive information about the security-based swap
market. This information should improve relevant authorities’ ability to oversee the securitybased swap market both for systemic risk purposes and to detect, deter, and address market
abuse.
Regulatory access to security-based swap data will facilitate monitoring of risk exposures
with implications for financial stability that market participants do not internalize. For example,
Regulation SBSR will provide relevant authorities with visibility into the security-based swap
positions of a participant’s ultimate parent. Regulation SBSR also will allow relevant authorities
to detect unusual activity at a very granular level, by trading desk or even individual trader.
Similarly, by filtering exposures to single-name CDS via the product ID, relevant authorities will
be able to better understand any potential risk to financial stability that could arise if a corporate
default triggers CDS payouts between counterparties. Information about the activity and
exposures of security-based swap market participants could allow the Commission or other
relevant authorities to take actions that reduce the likelihood of disruption to the smooth
functioning of financial markets or to reduce the magnitude of such disruptions when they do

573

occur. 1355 If such disruptions also impair capital formation by reducing the ability or willingness
of financial intermediaries or other market participants to borrow or lend, then market oversight
that reduces financial instability may also facilitate capital formation.
The opacity of the security-based swap market can contribute to uncertainty during
periods of financial crisis. In the absence of information about the outstanding obligations
between counterparties to security-based swaps, financial market participants may face
uncertainty over the extent to which large financial institutions are exposed to each other’s credit
risk. This environment may create incentives for financial market participants to reduce risk
exposures and seek safer assets (such as cash or Treasury securities), which could lead to a
significant reduction in investment in capital goods. 1356 Under a robust regime of regulatory
reporting, the Commission and other relevant authorities will have greater means to identify the
extent of the relevant exposures and the interrelatedness of risks in the security-based swap
market, which could be particularly important in times of financial stress. Providing relevant
authorities access to information about outstanding obligations that result from security-based
swap activity could allow these authorities to assist in the event of counterparty default. This
knowledge could reduce market participants’ uncertainty in times of stress, if, for example, it
suggests to them a more orderly wind-down of risk exposures of the defaulting counterparty. To
the extent that reduced uncertainty results in more efficient risk-sharing it may reduce market
participants’ demand for safe assets, as described above, and hence may improve the
environment for capital formation.
1355

See supra Section XXII(B)(1)(d) (describing current state of efficiency in the securitybased swap market).

1356

If financial market participants invest their money in cash or Treasury securities, rather
than riskier assets such as stocks or corporate bonds, this may make it more difficult for
companies to raise capital and invest in capital goods.

574

Regulatory reporting will also enable the Commission and other relevant authorities to
improve their monitoring of market practices. This could have direct effects on competition in
the security-based swap market. Absent regulation by the Commission and other relevant
authorities, potential market participants may consider the potential costs of market abuse to be a
barrier that discourages their entry into the security-based swap market. The knowledge that the
Commission and other relevant authorities are able to conduct surveillance on the basis of
regulatory reporting may lower their barriers to entry since surveillance and the resulting
increased probability of detection may deter potential market abuse in the security-based swap
market. This could result in broader participation and improved efficiency, competition, and
capital formation due to the availability of more risk-sharing opportunities between market
participants.
3.

Public Dissemination

Regulation SBSR establishes a requirement for public dissemination of security-based
swap transaction information. Currently, public access to security-based swap transaction
information is limited to aggregate pricing and volume data made available by clearing agencies
and DTCC-TIW, as well as infrequent reporting by large multilateral organizations. There is no
comprehensive or widely available source of transaction-by-transaction pricing and volume
information.
The Commission believes that public availability of pricing and volume data for
individual security-based swaps, as required by Title VII, should promote efficiency and
competition by enabling information produced by activity in the security-based swap markets to
be used as an input to myriad economic decisions, when currently limited transaction

575

information is generally available only to large dealers who observe customer order flow. 1357
Thus, smaller market participants, being able to view all security-based swap transactions
disseminated by registered SDRs, can observe from recently executed prices whether there may
be profitable opportunities to enter the market, thereby increasing competition. In addition, a
firm may use information about the pricing of CDS written on its debt to decide on the
appropriate opportunity cost of capital to apply to the cash flows of new investment projects,
thereby promoting efficiency. Similarly, a lender may use information about credit risk
embedded in the pricing of CDS written on a borrower’s existing debt to inform the lender’s
decision of whether or not to extend additional financing, thereby also promoting efficiency.
As discussed in Section XXII(C)(2)(a), public dissemination of security-based swap
transactions also may promote better valuation of underlying and related assets by allowing for
the inclusion of last-sale information into valuation models. Models without the input of lastsale information could be imprecise or be based on assumptions subject to the evaluator’s
discretion without having last-sale information to help identify or correct flawed assumptions.
As a result, otherwise identical market participants holding the same asset but using different
valuation models might arrive at significantly different valuations. This could result in these
market participants developing very different views of their risk exposures, resulting in
inefficient economic decisions. The Commission anticipates that market observers will
incorporate last-sale information that is publicly disseminated by registered SDRs into their
valuation models for the same and related assets. Such last-sale information will assist them in
developing and validating their pricing models and improve the accuracy of the valuations that

1357

See supra Section XXII(B)(1)(d) (discussing sources of security-based swap information
and efficiency in the current security-based swap market).

576

they use for a variety of purposes, such as making new investment decisions or managing the
risk of existing positions. Efficient allocation of capital relies on accurate valuation of asset
prices. Overvaluation of assets could result in a misallocation of capital, as investors seek to
purchase or hold an asset that cannot deliver the anticipated risk-adjusted return. By the same
token, undervalued assets represent investment opportunities that might go unpursued, because
investors do not realize that a more attractive risk-adjusted return may be available. To the
extent that post-trade transparency enables asset valuations to move closer to their fundamental
values, capital should be more efficiently allocated.
Information revealed through public dissemination of security-based swap transaction
details takes on two key characteristics. First, use of a piece of information by one economic
agent does not necessarily preclude use of the same information by another. Second, once
information is made public under Regulation SBSR, it is, by definition, non-excludable.
Dissemination cannot be limited only to those that have direct access to the information (such as
dealers who observe significant order flow) or to larger market participants who are willing to
pay for the information. These characteristics make it difficult for parties who report transaction
data to capture the value that market participants and market observers may gain from receipt of
publicly disseminated security-based swap data. As a result, public dissemination of securitybased swap transaction information is prone to inefficient supply—for example, parties have an
incentive to make incomplete reports of their activity. By establishing minimum requirements
for what is reported and publicly disseminated, the Commission believes that Regulation SBSR
will limit the degree of this inefficient supply.
Public dissemination will also likely affect efficiency and competition within the
security-based market. A primary economic effect of the final rules on public dissemination of

577

transaction information is to reduce the degree of information asymmetry between market
participants. Information asymmetries are currently endemic in the security-based swap market.
Large dealers can observe a significant amount of order flow provided by their customers and
know the prices at which their various customers have traded with them. Other market
participants, including the customers of large dealers, generally do not know the prices that other
market participants have paid or would be willing to pay for particular security-based swaps,
what products are being transacted, or in what volumes. Large dealers collectively, who are able
to observe their customers’ orders and executions, may be able use this information to adjust the
prices that they quote to extract profits at the expense of their customers. 1358 Customers, with
very limited ability to obtain information about the prices or sizes of others’ transactions, are in
an inferior bargaining position to the dealers that they face. To the extent that dealer private
information counters the incentives for market participants to efficiently share risks using
security-based swaps, it represents a dead-weight loss and not a simple reallocation of gains from
trade between dealers and their customers. 1359 Post-trade transparency increases the bargaining
power of customers because knowledge of last-sale prices in the same or similar instruments
allows them to establish a baseline for negotiations with any dealer.
Post-trade transparency in other financial markets has been shown to improve
competition and efficiency by decreasing implicit transaction costs and improving the bargaining
power of investors and other non-dealers. For example, a number of studies of the corporate
1358

See, e.g., Bessembinder et al., supra note 1259.

1359

A dead-weight loss means that the economy in aggregate is worse off. If market
participants do not share risks efficiently as a result of their inferior bargaining position
relative to dealers, then risks are not transferred to those market participants who are in
the best position to bear them. A dead-weight loss results when the benefits that accrue
to dealers as a result of their private information are less than the costs of inefficient risk
sharing, or when dealers do not benefit at the equal expense of other market participants.

578

bond market have found that post-trade transparency, resulting from the introduction of FINRA’s
TRACE system, reduced implicit transaction costs. 1360 Reduced implicit transaction costs could
encourage market entry, particularly of smaller dealers and non-dealers, and potentially increase
risk sharing and price competition, thereby promoting efficiency. To the extent that the current
security-based swap market is similar to the corporate bond market prior to the introduction of
TRACE, post-trade transparency could have similar effects in the security-based swap
market. 1361
Regulation SBSR will permit all market observers for the first time to see last-sale
information of security-based swap transactions, thereby reducing the information asymmetry
between dealers and non-dealers. 1362 Non-dealers may be able to use publicly disseminated
information to negotiate more favorable prices from dealers or to decline to enter into securitybased swaps offered at unfavorable prices, thereby improving the efficiency of risk sharing in the
security-based swap market. Additionally, public dissemination could assist dealers in deriving
better quotations, as knowledge of the prices and volumes at which other market participants
have executed transactions could serve as a valuable input for quotations in the same or similar
instruments. 1363 As a result, dealers will have a better sense of the market and may not need to
build large margins into their quotations to compensate for uncertainty in providing quotations.
Increased competition from new entrants and quotations that more accurately reflect fundamental
1360

See Edwards, et al., supra note 1223.

1361

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission requested comment on
whether post-trade transparency would have a similar effect on the security-based swap
market as it has in other securities markets—and if not, why not. See 75 FR at 75226.
No commenters responded to the Commission’s request.

1362

A similar information asymmetry, but to a lesser and varying degree, exists between
larger and smaller dealers, and it would also be reduced.

1363

See supra Section XXII(B)(2)(a) (discussing the benefits of improved valuation).

579

value could lead to lower implicit transaction costs for security-based swaps, which will
encourage efficient risk sharing and promote price efficiency. 1364
The Commission recognizes, however, that the final rules will not eliminate entirely the
informational advantage of large intermediaries. These market participants will still have the
advantage of seeing order flows or inquiries that are not ultimately executed and disseminated.
They also will be able to see their completed transactions against customers in real time, while
market observers who consume the transaction data that is publicly disseminated by registered
SDRs might not—during the interim phase of Regulation SBSR—learn of these transactions
until up to 24 hours after they are executed. In addition, an executing intermediary may derive
an informational advantage from knowing the identities of both its counterparties and other
customers who submit orders or make inquiries about liquidity.
The Commission also acknowledges that implementing post-trade transparency in the
security-based swap market could cause some market participants to execute fewer securitybased swaps in the U.S. market or to exit the U.S. market completely and execute their
transactions in foreign markets instead. To the extent that such events occur, these could be
viewed as costs of the final rules that could have a detrimental impact on efficiency, competition,
and capital formation. For example, certain market participants that are currently active in the
market might not find it desirable for information about their security-based swaps to be publicly
known. If market participants respond to the final rules by reducing their trading activity or
exiting the market, or if the final rules raise barriers to entry, the result could be reduced
competition between the remaining market participants. Besides reduced price competition, exit
by certain participants from the market also could result in a less efficient allocation of credit
1364

See Edwards, et al., supra note 1223.

580

risk. This could have implications for capital formation if market participants engage in
precautionary savings and self-insurance rather than hedging their risks by using capital
resources offered by third parties through security-based swaps. 1365
Public dissemination of security-based swap transactions also may promote efficient
valuation of various financial instruments. As a result of the final rules, all market participants
and market observers will have the benefit of knowing how counterparties to a particular
security-based swap valued the security-based swap at a specific moment in the recent past, and
can incorporate this last-sale information into their own valuations for that security-based swap,
as well as any related or underlying instrument. 1366 To the extent that last-sale information
results in valuations that are more informationally efficient, they may help improve financial
stability by making risk management by financial institutions more efficient. This in turn could
enhance the ability of market participants to accurately measure financial exposures to each of
their counterparties.
Public dissemination of security-based swap transaction information could improve the
efficiency of the security-based swap market through more efficient deployment of assets used as
collateral for security-based swap transactions. Appropriate collateral allocation is dependent on
accurate valuation of security-based swaps. As the value of a security-based swap changes, the
likelihood of one party having to make a payout to the other party also changes, which could
impact the amount of collateral that one counterparty owes to the other. Hence, misvaluation of
1365

The Commission notes there are also plausible cases in which Regulation SBSR might
increase the efficiency of risk allocation while also reducing transaction volume. Market
participants might determine, as a result of observing publicly disseminated price and
volume data, that engaging in a security-based swap transaction is an inefficient means of
managing financial or commercial risks.

1366

See supra Section XXII(C)(2).

581

a security-based swap contract could lead to inefficient allocation of collateral across
counterparties. To the extent that public dissemination of security-based swap transactions will
help enable better valuations, instances of overcollateralization or undercollateralization should
decrease. Furthermore, the better investors can judge the performance of collective investment
vehicles because of better valuations, the more efficiently they can allocate their investment
capital among available funds.
Post-trade transparency of security-based swaps should promote more efficient valuation
of securities on which security-based swaps are based. A clear example of this is the market for
single-name CDS, where post-trade transparency may lead to better estimates of the
creditworthiness of debt issuers. All other things being equal, CDS protection on a more
creditworthy issuer costs less than CDS protection on a less creditworthy issuer. Furthermore,
the cost of CDS protection on a single issuer may change over time, reflecting, in part, the
financial position of the issuer. Mandatory post-trade transparency of CDS transactions will
offer market participants and market observers the ability to dynamically assess the market’s
view of the creditworthiness of the reference entities that underlie CDS contracts, thus promoting
efficiency in the market for cash bonds. For example, public dissemination of transactions in
CDS on reference entities that issue TRACE-eligible debt securities will help reinforce the
pricing signals derived from individual transactions in debt securities generated by TRACE.
Market participants can arbitrage disparities in prices reflected in TRACE and as suggested in
last-sale information of related CDS, helping create more overall efficiency in the market for
credit. Similarly, public dissemination of transactions in single-name CDS should reinforce the
pricing signals derived from public dissemination of index CDS transactions. Post-trade
transparency of security-based swap CDS under Regulation SBSR could indirectly bring greater

582

transparency into the market for debt instruments (such as sovereign debt securities) that are not
subject to mandatory public dissemination through TRACE or any other means.
Finally, business owners and managers can use information gleaned from the publicly
disseminated security-based swap transaction data to make more-informed investment decisions
in physical assets and capital goods, as opposed to investment in financial assets, thereby
promoting efficient resource allocation and capital formation in the real economy. Transparent
security-based swap prices may also make it easier for firms to obtain new financing for business
opportunities, by providing information and reducing uncertainty about the value and
profitability of a firm’s investments. 1367

Implementation of Regulatory Reporting and Public Dissemination
a.

Role of Registered SDRs

In adopting Regulation SBSR, the Commission has attempted to design the duties of
registered SDRs to promote efficiency of the reporting and public dissemination requirements
and thereby minimize any adverse impacts on competition and capital formation. At the same
time, the Commission acknowledges that, to the extent that the final rules place regulatory
obligations on registered SDRs, these obligations may constitute a barrier to entry that, at the
margin, reduces competition between registered SDRs. Regulation SBSR requires a registered
SDR to publicly disseminate specified information about reported security-based swap
transactions immediately upon receipt. The Commission believes that this requirement will help
promote an efficient allocation of public dissemination responsibilities for a number of reasons.
First, registered SDRs—because of their role in the regulatory reporting function—already
possess all of the information necessary to carry out public dissemination and would not have to
1367

See Bond, et al., note 1258, supra.

583

collect additional information from other parties. Second, placing the duty to publicly
disseminate on registered SDRs eliminates the need for the development of other infrastructure
and mechanisms for public dissemination of security-base swap transaction information in
addition to the infrastructure that is required to support regulatory reporting. 1368 Third, users of
publicly disseminated security-based swap data will be required to consolidate transaction data
from only a small number of registered SDRs, rather than a potentially larger number of
dissemination agents that might exist under an alternative regime. Under Rules 907(a)(1) and
907(a)(2), registered SDRs have the flexibility to determine the precise means through which
they will accept reports of security-based swap transaction data. This degree of flexibility has
implications for the efficiency of data collection. Registered SDRs could choose to innovate and
adopt new reporting formats that could lower costs to market participants while maintaining the
required level of information and data integrity. Moreover, in an effort to attract business,
registered SDRs could decide to accept data from market participants in a wide variety of
formats, taking on additional data management and systems burdens. Indeed, such an outcome
could represent an efficient allocation of the costs of data management, in which a handful of
registered SDRs invest in technologies to transform data rather than approximately 300 reporting
sides making similar changes to their systems in an effort to provide identical reports to each
SDR. The Commission acknowledges, however, that the same features that support a market
structure that yields only a handful of registered SDRs could temper the incentives of these
registered SDRs to compete on reporting efficiency. For example, registered SDRs could decide
to accept data from customers in only one specific format. The Commission further anticipates
efficiency gains if data elements necessary to understand a trade evolve over time as new
1368

See supra Section XXII(C)(2)(c).

584

security-based swap contracts are developed. Additionally, this approach may support
competition among security-based swap counterparties by maintaining low barriers to entry with
respect to reporting obligations under Regulation SBSR.
Further, the final rules do not presume a market structure for registered SDRs. On one
hand, this means that market participants, the Commission, and other relevant authorities cannot
rely on efficiency gains from receiving security-based swap transaction data from a single,
consolidated source, but must instead consolidate fragmented data from multiple SDRs. On the
other hand, a monopoly in the market for SDR services could preclude innovations that may lead
to higher quality outputs or lower costs for reporting parties, SDR participants more generally,
the Commission, and other relevant authorities.
b.

Interim Phase of Reporting Requirements and Block Rules

As discussed above in Section VII, the Commission is adopting rules for regulatory
reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps that are intended only as the interim
phase of implementation of these Title VII requirements. At a later date, the Commission
anticipates seeking additional comment on potential block thresholds and associated block rules
(such as the time delay for disseminating block trades and the time period for the mandatory
reporting and public dissemination of non-block trades).
Immediately implementing a complete regime that includes block trade thresholds and
final reporting timeframes could improve efficiency, competition, and capital formation by
increasing price transparency in the security-based swap market sooner. Several commenters,
however, argued that requiring post-trade transparency for security-based swaps with incorrectly

585

designed block trade thresholds could significantly damage the market, 1369 and the Commission
is concerned that disruptions to the market that could result from establishing block trading rules
without the benefit of comprehensive data analysis could cause certain market participants to
limit their security-based swap activity or to withdraw from the market entirely. This in turn
could lead to reduced competition, higher prices, and inefficient allocations of risk and capital.
Currently, there are no data that can be used to directly assess the impact of mandated
post-trade transparency of security-based swap transactions on market behavior, because there is
no widely available post-trade data to which the security-based swap market can react. 1370 The
Commission anticipates that the initial phase of Regulation SBSR will yield at least some useful
data about how much time market participants believe they need to hedge transactions and how
other market participants react when they see transactions of different sizes with different delays
after the time of execution. The phased approach is designed to introduce mandatory post-trade
transparency in the security-based swap market while allowing the Commission sufficient time
to gather and analyze data regarding potential block thresholds and dissemination delays.
The Commission acknowledges that allowing up to 24 hours for reporting a securitybased swap means that market participants not involved in that particular transaction, and other
market observers, will not have access to information about the transactions for up to 24 hours
after the initial execution, depending upon the specific time when the transaction is reported.
This delay could impact the development of more vigorous price competition in the securitybased swap market because market participants who are involved in transactions would have

security-based swap market has included indirect evidence from the swap market and
from the security-based swap market. See Analysis of Post-Trade Transparency;
Hedging Analysis.

586

access to potentially market-moving information up to 24 hours before those who are not. The
Commission believes, however, that allowing up to 24 hours for transactions to be reported and
publicly disseminated still represents a significant improvement over the status quo, where
market participants report transactions to data repositories only on a voluntary basis and
information about transaction is not publicly disseminated.
c.

Use of UICs and Rule 903

Regulation SBSR requires the use of several UICs in the reporting of security-based swap
transactions. Use of UICs improves efficiency of data intake by registered SDRs and data
analysis by relevant authorities and other users of data, as the reported security-based swap
transaction information can be readily aggregated by UIC along several dimensions (e.g.,
product ID, trading desk ID, or trader ID). The efficiency gain in aggregation applies primarily
at the SDR level in cases where the SDR uses its own UICs that are not otherwise applied at
other SDRs (assuming that no IRSS exists to provide such UICs). To the extent that multiple
SDRs were to use the same UICs—because they use UICs provided by an IRSS, such as the
GLEIS, or because SDRs agree to recognize UICs assigned by another SDR 1371—the efficiency
gain would extend to aggregation across SDRs, although this is not required under Regulation
SBSR. The efficiency gains described in this section may be limited to regulatory reporting and
only extend to public dissemination to the extent that the relevant information is being publicly
disseminated. Additionally, minimizing the operational risks arising from inconsistent

1371

For example, assume that a person becomes a participant of a registered SDR and obtains
UICs for its trading desks and individual traders from that SDR. Later, that person
becomes a participant at a second registered SDR. The second SDR could issue its own
set of UICs for this person’s trading desks and individual traders, or it could recognize
and permit use of the same UICs that had been assigned by the first registered SDR.

587

identification of persons, units of persons, products, or transactions by counterparties and market
infrastructure providers would enhance efficiency.
Under Rule 903(b), as adopted, a registered SDR may permit information to be reported
to it, and may publicly disseminate information, using codes in place of certain data elements
only if the information necessary to interpret such codes is widely available to users of the
information on a non-fee basis. If information to understand embedded codes is not widely
available on a non-fee basis, information asymmetries would likely continue to exist between
large market participants who pay for the codes and other market participants. Rents paid for the
use of codes could decrease transparency and increase barriers to entry to the security-based
swap market, because the cost of necessary licenses may reduce the incentives for smaller
potential market participants to enter the market. Preventing this barrier to entry from forming
should help promote competition by facilitating the entry of new market participants.
One commenter suggested that alternatives could be developed to the status quo of using
fee-based codes in security-based swap market data. 1372 The Commission welcomes the
development of such alternatives, and believes that Rule 903(b), as adopted, may encourage such
development.
d.

Rules Assigning the Duty to Report

Rule 901(a) assigns the reporting obligation for security-based swaps other than clearing
transactions and platform-executed transactions that are submitted to clearing. The reporting
hierarchy in Rule 901(a) is designed to increase efficiency for market participants, as well as the
Commission and other relevant authorities, by locating the duty to report with counterparties
1372

See Bloomberg Letter at 2 (stating that it would be possible to develop a public domain
symbology for security-based swap reference entities that relied on products in the public
domain to “provide an unchanging, unique, global and inexpensive identifier”).

588

who are most likely to have the resources and who are best able to support the reporting function.
Furthermore, Rule 901(a) seeks to increase efficiency by leveraging existing infrastructure to
support security-based swap reporting, where practicable.
The Commission anticipates that the majority of security-based swaps covered by Rule
901(a), as adopted, will include a registered security-based swap dealer or registered major
security-based swap participant on at least one side. Many of the entities that are likely to
register as security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap participants already have
committed time and resources building the infrastructure to support reporting security-based
swaps and some reporting to DTCC-TIW is occurring on a voluntary basis. 1373 Moreover, many
such entities currently report swaps pursuant to the CFTC’s swap data reporting rules. Rule
901(a) is designed, as much as practicable, to allow these market participants to use these
existing reporting capabilities and to minimize the chance that a market participant with limited
involvement in the security-based swaps market might incur the duty to report. This approach
could lead to lower barriers to entry into the market compared to the approach contemplated in
the SBSR Proposing Release. 1374 Also, by reducing infrastructure costs imposed on smaller
market participants, this approach also could promote competition by reducing the likelihood
that these smaller entrants without existing reporting capabilities would be required to incur
fixed costs necessary to develop reporting capabilities. Finally, to the extent that non-registered
persons are not required to devote resources to support transaction reporting—because reporting
is carried out instead by registered security-based swap dealers and registered major security1373

As discussed in Section XXII(B)(1), supra, the data in DTCC-TIW are self-reported and
the vast majority of trades involves at least one dealer as a counterparty. Further, both
transaction counterparties submit records for confirmation, covering all likely registrants.

1374

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31194.

589

based swap participants who, due to economies of scale and the presence of existing reporting
capabilities, are likely to face relatively lower costs of reporting—such resources could be put to
more efficient uses. 1375
The Commission recognizes that this approach puts smaller market participants on the
same rung of the hierarchy with entities that likely meet the definition of “security-based swap
dealer” and will have to register with the Commission as such in the future. In theory, this could
force these smaller market participants into a negotiation with the “likely dealers,” because Rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(1) requires both sides to select the reporting side. The Commission believes that
this outcome will be unlikely in practice. The Commission understands that voluntary reporting
practices in the security-based swap market are broadly consistent with the principle behind the
reporting hierarchy in Rule 901(a)(2)(ii): that the more sophisticated market participant should
report the transaction. Moreover, market participants who are active in the security-based swap
market are likely also to be active in the swap market, where CFTC rules have established a
reporting hierarchy that assigns the heaviest reporting duties to swap dealers and major swap
participants. 1376 Because practices have already been established for larger market participants
to assume reporting duties, it is likely that these practices will be applied in the security-based
swap market even before the Commission adopts registration rules for security-based swap
dealers and major security-based swap participants.
One of the general principles underlying Rule 901(a) is that, if a person has the duty to
report information under Regulation SBSR, it should also have the ability to choose the
registered SDR to which it reports. The Commission believes that this approach will promote
1375

See supra Section XXII(C) (discussing the costs that reporting sides are likely to incur).

1376

See 17 CFR 45.8 (providing a hierarchy for regulatory reporting of swaps); 17 CFR
43.3(a).

590

efficiency and competition, because it enables each person with a duty to report a security-based
swap to connect and report transactions to the registered SDR (or SDRs) that offer it the highest
quality services and/or the lowest fees to the extent that there is more than one SDR. Two
commenters believed that the Commission could promote competition by allowing a
counterparty to a security-based swap—typically a security-based swap dealer—to choose the
registered SDR that receives information reported under Regulation SBSR. 1377 The Commission
agrees with the views of the commenters that allowing a counterparty to choose the registered
SDR that received information reported under Regulation SBSR could promote competition.
Rule 901(a), as adopted, reflects this approach by allowing the person with the duty to report to
choose the registered SDR to which it reports.
Finally, the Commission believes that, if Rule 901(a) affects capital formation at all, it
would be in only a limited and indirect way. The Commission does not see—and no commenter
has presented any evidence to suggest—that the economic considerations of how, where, and by
whom security-based swap transactions will be reported to registered SDRs will have any direct
bearing on how, how often, and at what prices market participants might be willing to transact.
As mentioned above, by placing the reporting duty on the person with the most direct access to
required information, Rule 901(a) is designed to minimize reporting burdens, which could
facilitate a more efficient allocation of capital by reducing expenditures on security-based swap
reporting infrastructure.
e.

Embargo Rule

Rule 902(d), the Embargo Rule, prohibits the release of security-based swap transaction
information to persons (other than a counterparty or post-trade processor) until that information
1377

See DTCC VI at 8-9; DTCC VIII; MarkitSERV III at 4-5.

591

has been transmitted to a registered SDR. The Embargo Rule is designed to promote
competition among market participants in the security-based swap market by prohibiting persons
who obtain knowledge of a security-based swap transaction shortly after execution from
providing information about that transaction to third parties before that information is provided
to a registered SDR so that it can be publicly disseminated. In the absence of the Embargo Rule,
selected third parties who are told about executions could obtain an informational advantage
relative to other market participants, reducing the ability of these other market participants to
compete in the market. The potential benefits of Regulation SBSR with respect to competition
would suffer in the absence of the Embargo Rule, because market participants who gain earlier
access to information could maintain a high degree of information asymmetry in the market.
Rule 902(d), as adopted, includes a carve-out for post-trade processors, such as entities
involved in comparing or clearing transactions. This carve-out is designed to promote efficiency
in the processing of security-based swap transactions by recognizing that the policy goals of the
Embargo Rule are not served by impeding the ability of security-based swap counterparties to
obtain post-trade processing services. Post-trade processors must obtain information about a
transaction to carry out their functions, even if the transaction has not yet been reported to a
registered SDR. In the absence of the carve-out, efficiency could be harmed if post-trade
processors were barred from obtaining information about the transaction until it had been
publicly disseminated by a registered SDR. Without this carve-out, Regulation SBSR could
cause the services and functions provided by post-trade processors to be delayed. This could
result in a disruption of current market practices, where post-trade processors provide a variety
of services to security-based swap counterparties, and thus a reduction in security-based swap
market efficiency.

592

Impact of Cross-Border Aspects of Regulation SBSR
a.

General Considerations

The security-based swap market is global in nature, and dealers and other market
participants are highly interconnected within this global market. This interconnectedness
provides a myriad of paths for liquidity and risk to move throughout the financial system and
makes it difficult, in many cases, to precisely identify the impact of a particular entity’s activity
on financial stability or liquidity. As a corollary to this, it is difficult to isolate risk and liquidity
problems to one geographical segment of the market. Further, as we noted in Section
XXII(B)(1), security-based swap market participants in one jurisdiction can conduct activity
through branches or subsidiaries located in another. These features of the market form the basis
of the Commission’s analysis of the effects of rule 908 on competition, efficiency and capital
formation.
b.

Regulatory Reporting and Public Dissemination

Rule 908(a) generally applies regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements
depending on the characteristics of the counterparties involved in a transaction. The regulatory
reporting requirement allows the Commission and other relevant authorities the ability to
monitor risk and conduct market surveillance. Because the security-based swap market
represents a conduit through which financial risks from foreign markets can manifest themselves
in the United States, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to focus on those transactions
that are likely to serve as routes for risk transmission to the United States, either because a direct
or indirect counterparty is a U.S. person, is registered with the Commission as a security-based
swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, or if the transaction is submitted to a
clearing agency having its principal place of business within the United States. A regulatory

593

reporting requirement that did not include within its scope such transactions would provide the
Commission with such an incomplete view of transaction activity with potential to undermine
the stability of U.S. financial markets that it would likely undermine the beneficial effects of a
regulatory requirement on efficiency, competition and capital formation.
Under Regulation SBSR, as adopted, many of the provisions of Regulation SBSR will
apply to a cross-border security-based swap if one of the direct counterparties, even if a non-U.S.
person, is guaranteed by a U.S. person. For example, Rule 908(a)(1)(i) requires regulatory
reporting of a security-based swap if there is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a U.S.
person on either or both sides of the transaction. Because guarantees extended by U.S. persons
on transactions executed abroad can nevertheless import risk into the United States, regulatory
reporting of security-based swaps should extend to any security-based swap transaction having
an indirect counterparty (i.e., a guarantor) that is a U.S. person. This will improve the
Commission’s ability to monitor risks posed by activity guaranteed by U.S. persons and, as a
result, reduce any adverse impacts on efficiency, competition, and capital formation that might
arise without this ability or that might arise from attempts by certain market participants to shift
activity into guaranteed foreign subsidiaries in order to evade Regulation SBSR.
Under the approach taken in this release, market participants could avoid regulatory
reporting and public dissemination requirements by shifting activity into unguaranteed foreign
subsidiaries, assuming there was no other basis for Regulation SBSR to apply, such as the direct
counterparty being a U.S. person. Thus, the Commission’s action in distinguishing between
guaranteed and unguaranteed foreign subsidiaries of U.S. parent entities could affect how these
parent entities allocate capital across the organization. For example, a U.S. parent could
separately capitalize a foreign subsidiary to engage in transactions with non-U.S. persons. If the

594

U.S. parent takes such action solely as a response to Title VII regulation, it is unlikely that such a
move would improve the efficiency with which the parent allocates its capital.
The primary economic effects of public dissemination of transaction information are
related to improving market transparency. Rule 908(a) defines a scope of transactions subject to
this requirement in the cross-border context that considers the benefits of public dissemination,
including effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. The scope defined by Rule
908(a) also considers the potential costs that market participants could incur if counterparties
restructure their operations so that their activity falls outside of the scope of Regulation SBSR
and continues in a more opaque market. Such a response could result in lessened competition in
the security-based swap market within the United States, less efficient risk-sharing and pricing,
and impaired capital formation.
The public dissemination requirements under Regulation SBSR could affect the behavior
of foreign market participants in ways that reduce market access for U.S. persons. For example,
some non-U.S. persons might seek to minimize their contact with U.S. persons in an effort to
avoid having their transactions publicly disseminated. Moreover, to the extent that the
Commission’s rules treat the foreign business of U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons differently
from their respective U.S. business, market participants could perceive an incentive to restructure
their business to separate their foreign and U.S. operations.
Programmatic benefits of this scope, beyond those already noted as benefits of regulatory
reporting, are related to the ability of market observers to condition their beliefs about the

595

security-based swap market on realized transaction prices. 1378 Post-trade transparency in the
U.S. security-based swap market could have spillover benefits in foreign markets, even if those
foreign markets impose no (or only limited) post-trade transparency requirements. 1379 Post-trade
transparency provided by Regulation SBSR will make transaction data available to any market
observer in the world. These data will also allow global market observers to use security-based
swap prices as an input for valuation models and trading decisions for the same or related
instruments, thereby improving the efficiency of these processes. 1380
Relevant authorities in other jurisdictions are currently engaged in implementing their
own regulatory reforms of the OTC derivatives markets that could apply to participants in those
foreign markets. Regulatory differences among jurisdictions in the global security-based swap
markets could create incentives for business restructuring. To the extent that such restructuring
results from regulatory incentives rather than economic fundamentals, efficiency in the real
economy could be reduced. Conflicting regulations or unnecessary duplication of regulation also
might lead to fragmented markets. 1381

1378

The effects of public dissemination are discussed more generally in Section XXII(C)(2);
the economic effects of Rule 908 that relate to efficiency, competition, and capital
formation are examined in Section XXII(D)(4)(i).

Even if the substance of statutory and regulatory efforts across jurisdictions is
comparable, different jurisdictions may impose new regulatory requirements on different
timelines. To the extent that these timelines or the underlying requirements differ, market
participants might have the opportunity to take advantage of these differences by making
strategic choices, at least in the short term, with respect to their transaction counterparties and
business models. For example, at a larger scale, firms may choose whether to participate in or
withdraw from the U.S. security-based swap market. As a result of exits, registered securitybased swap dealers that are U.S. persons might have less access to foreign markets, unless they
were to restructure their business to conduct foreign transactions through unguaranteed foreign
subsidiaries whose transactions with non-U.S. persons would not be subject to the regulatory
reporting and public dissemination under Regulation SBSR.
These potential restructurings could impact competition in the U.S. market. On one
hand, the ability to restructure one’s business rather than exit the U.S. market entirely to avoid
application of Title VII to an entity’s non-U.S. operations could reduce the number of entities
that exit the market, thus mitigating the negative effects on competition described above. On the
other hand, non-registered U.S. persons may find that the only non-U.S. person registered
security-based swap dealers that are willing to deal with them are those whose security-based
swap business is sufficiently large to afford the compliance costs associated with regulatory
reporting and public dissemination requirements. To the extent that smaller dealers have an
incentive to exit the market, the overall level of competition in the market could decline.

firms are able to choose their regulatory structure, regulatory burdens are shifted onto
those entities that cannot engage in regulatory arbitrage).

597

The Commission is mindful that, in the near term and until full implementation of
comparable requirements for regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based
swaps in other jurisdictions, the rules may generate incentives for market participants to
restructure and reduce contact with U.S. market participants. As a result, for example, U.S.
market participants seeking to hedge risk could face higher prices for hedging or fewer
opportunities to hedge at all, which could impede capital formation. Another result could be
inefficiency in risk allocation, because those market participants who are best placed to take on
risks shared through security-based swap activity might be discouraged from doing so because of
perceived necessity to avoid regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements under
Title VII. Furthermore, U.S. market participants that are able to restructure their business across
national boundaries to avoid regulation are likely to be the largest financial institutions that can
bear the greatest risks. The remaining firms will likely be smaller and have less capital with
which to offer liquidity to the market.
Restructuring of business lines to take advantage of low-transparency regimes also would
impede transparency, as fewer transactions would be subject to public dissemination under
Regulation SBSR. Market participants who had relocated abroad would still be able to free-ride
on price formation generated by the public dissemination of others’ transactions in the same or
similar instruments while not contributing any transactions of their own. The value of regulatory
reporting and public dissemination in the U.S. market would be reduced to the extent that
liquidity migrates to jurisdictions that are less-transparent. 1382

1382

By the same token, regulatory reporting and public dissemination in the U.S. securitybased swap market could have spillover benefits in foreign markets that trade the same or
similar instruments as the U.S. market, even if those foreign markets impose no (or only
limited) requirements. See supra note 1259.

598

c.

Substituted Compliance

Rule 908(c) provides that the Title VII requirements relating to regulatory reporting and
public dissemination of security-based swaps may be satisfied by compliance with the rules of a
foreign jurisdiction if the Commission issues an order determining that the jurisdiction has
requirements that comparable to those of Regulation SBSR. Rule 908(c) is designed to promote
efficiency, competition, and capital formation in the security-based swap market, to the extent
practical, given the state of regulatory reform of the OTC derivatives market being applied by
specific foreign jurisdictions.
The Commission believes a regulatory regime that allows for substituted compliance
under comparable foreign rules promotes efficiency by reducing the need for certain market
participants to double report security-based swaps (i.e., once to a foreign trade repository or
foreign regulatory authority and again to a registered SDR). Substituted compliance also has the
potential to improve market and price efficiency by reducing or even eliminating instances of the
same transaction being publicly disseminated under two separate systems. The Commission
assumes that market observers will obtain and utilize last-sale information about security-based
swaps from any available sources around the globe. Without substituted compliance, a securitybased swap that met the jurisdictional requirements of Rule 908(a)(2) of Regulation SBSR as
well as the public dissemination rules of a foreign jurisdiction would be publicly disseminated in
both jurisdictions. It might be difficult or impossible for market observers to understand that the
two trade reports represent the same transaction, which would thus distort their view of the
market. If the Commission were to issue a substituted compliance order with respect to that
jurisdiction, market observers would see only a single report (emanating from the foreign
jurisdiction) of that transaction.

599

While the rules governing substituted compliance are not designed to promote efficiency
at the regulatory level, they are designed at least to minimize detractions from regulatory
efficiency. Under substituted compliance, certain cross-border transactions that otherwise would
be reported to an SEC-registered SDR would instead be reported to a foreign trade repository or
foreign regulatory authority. Final Rule 908(c) requires, among other things, direct electronic
access to the foreign security-based swap data in order to make a substituted compliance
determination. However, there could be some difficulties in normalizing and aggregating the
data from SEC-registered SDRs with the data from the foreign trade repositories or foreign
regulatory authorities.
Overall, the Commission believes that, on balance, there will be certain positive impacts
on efficiency from allowing substituted compliance. The principle behind this approach is that
the Commission would grant substituted compliance with respect to regulatory reporting and
public dissemination of security-based swaps in another jurisdiction only if the requirements of
that jurisdiction are comparable to otherwise applicable requirements in Regulation SBSR. If a
foreign jurisdiction does not have a comparable regime for regulatory reporting and public
dissemination of security-based swaps, allowing the possibility of substituted compliance could,
on balance, erode any impacts of Regulation SBSR on efficiency, to the extent that the foreign
jurisdiction’s regulatory outcomes for regulatory reporting and public dissemination differ from
those under Regulation SBSR. This result could be viewed as privately efficient by market
participants who might otherwise restructure their activities to avoid public dissemination.
However, the result also would be that many transactions with significant connections to the U.S.
market would remain opaque, thus reducing opportunities for greater price competition and price
discovery. Moreover, granting substituted compliance in such cases could provide incentives for

600

foreign jurisdictions to impose lower regulatory standards for security-based swaps than those
mandated by Title VII. Under the rules, as adopted, the Commission may not grant substituted
compliance unless the foreign jurisdiction’s rules are comparable to otherwise applicable
requirements.
Under Rule 908(c), the Commission could make a determination of comparability for
regulatory reporting and public dissemination either separately or together. A few commenters
argued that the Commission should separate them, which would, for example, permit substituted
compliance for regulatory reporting for a foreign jurisdiction, but not for public
dissemination. 1383 The Commission agrees with the commenter’s suggestions and has
determined to take such an approach. Permitting substituted compliance for regulatory reporting
but not for public dissemination might be privately efficient for firms, who would be obligated to
report transactions to a foreign jurisdiction for regulatory purposes, but would be obligated to
only report to a registered SDR only those data elements necessary for public dissemination
under Regulation SBSR. The Commission could, for instance, permit transactions to be reported
into a foreign jurisdiction with no or only limited public dissemination requirements.
One commenter correctly pointed out that there are a few classes of security-based swap
for which Regulation SBSR requires regulatory reporting but not public dissemination and
argued, therefore, that the Commission should permit itself to grant substituted compliance for
regulatory reporting only (and not public dissemination) for these classes. 1384 The Commission
agrees with the commenter and is adopting Rule 908(c) with certain revisions that will allow the
Commission to issue a substituted compliance order with respect to regulatory reporting but not
1383

See supra note 917.

1384

See IIB Letter at 25. See also Rule 902(c).

601

public dissemination in such cases. 1385 This revision should increase the scope of transactions
that may enjoy the efficiency benefits of substituted compliance discussed above.
E.

Aggregate Quantifiable Total Costs

Based on the foregoing, the Commission estimates that Regulation SBSR will impose an
initial one-time cost of approximately $194,500,000 on all entities. 1386 The Commission
estimates that Regulation SBSR will impose a total ongoing annual aggregate cost of
approximately $275,500,000 for all entities. 1387 With regard to registered SDRs, the
Commission estimates that Regulation SBSR will impose an initial aggregate one-time cost of

1385

See supra Section XV(E)(6).

1386

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: [($360,000 (Rule 901 one-time
costs on registered SDRs)) + ($20,000,000 (Rule 902 one-time costs on registered
SDRs)) + ($2,000,000 (Rule 905 one-time costs on registered SDRs)) + ($330,000 (Rule
906 one-time costs on registered SDRs)) + ($41,000,000 (Rule 907 one-time costs on
registered SDRs)) + ($3,190,000 (Rule 906 one-time costs on covered participants) +
($121,800,000 (Rule 901 one-time costs on reporting sides) + ($720,200 (Rule 903 onetime costs on SDR participants)) + ($3,547,500 (Rule 905 one-time costs on reporting
sides) + ($1,540,000 (Rule 908(c) one-time costs on requesting entities)] = $194,487,700,
or approximately $194,500,000.

1387

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: [($455,000 (Rule 901 ongoing
annual costs on registered SDRs)) + ($12,000,000 (Rule 902 ongoing annual costs on
registered SDRs)) + ($45,000 (Rule 904 ongoing annual costs on registered SDRs)) +
($4,000,000 (Rule 905 ongoing annual costs on registered SDRs)) + ($300,000 (Rule 906
ongoing annual costs on registered SDRs)) + ($82,000,000 (Rule 907 ongoing annual
costs on registered SDRs)) + ($1,870,000 (Rule 906 ongoing annual costs on covered
participants)) + ($95,700,000 (Rule 901 ongoing annual costs on reporting sides)) +

ongoing annual costs on reporting sides)) + ($64,000,000 (Rule 905 ongoing annual costs
on non-reporting sides)) + ($13,400,000 (Rule 906 ongoing annual costs on all
participants)) + ($1,540,000 (Rule 908(c) costs of requests in the first year)] =
$275,444,500 or approximately $275,500,000.

approximately $63,700,000, 1388 and an ongoing aggregate annual cost of approximately
$98,800,000. 1389
XXIII. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) requires federal agencies, in promulgating rules,
to consider the impact of those rules on small entities. Section 603(a) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 1390 as amended by the RFA, generally requires the Commission to undertake a
regulatory flexibility analysis of all proposed rules, or proposed rule amendments, to determine
the impact of such rulemaking on “small entities.” 1391 Section 605(b) of the RFA 1392 states that
this requirement shall not apply to any proposed rule or proposed rule amendment which, if
adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

1388

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: [($360,000 (Rule 901 one-time
costs on registered SDRs)) + ($20,000,000 (Rule 902 one-time costs on registered
SDRs)) + ($2,000,000 (Rule 905 one-time costs on registered SDRs)) + ($330,000 (Rule
906 one-time costs on registered SDRs)) + ($41,000,000 (Rule 907 one-time costs on
registered SDRs))] = $63,690,000 or approximately $63,700,000.

1389

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: [($455,000 (Rule 901 ongoing
annual costs on registered SDRs)) + ($1,000,000 (Rule 902 ongoing annual costs on
registered SDRs)) + ($45,000 (Rule 904 ongoing annual costs on registered SDRs)) +
($4,000,000 (Rule 905 ongoing annual costs on registered SDRs)) + ($300,000 (Rule 906
ongoing annual costs on registered SDRs)) + ($82,000,000 (Rule 907 ongoing annual
costs on registered SDRs))] = $98,800,000.

1390

5 U.S.C. 603(a).

1391

Although Section 601(b) of the RFA defines the term “small entity,” the statute permits
agencies to formulate their own definitions. The Commission has adopted definitions for
the term “small entity” for the purposes of Commission rulemaking in accordance with
the RFA. Those definitions, as relevant to this proposed rulemaking, are set forth in Rule
0-10 under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.0-10. See Securities Exchange Act Release
No. 18451 (January 28, 1982), 47 FR 5215 (February 4, 1982) (File No. AS-305).

1392

5 U.S.C. 605(b).

603

In developing the final rules contained in Regulation SBSR, the Commission has
considered their potential impact on small entities. For purposes of Commission rulemaking in
connection with the RFA, a small entity includes: (1) when used with reference to an “issuer” or
a “person,” other than an investment company, an “issuer” or “person” that, on the last day of its
most recent fiscal year, had total assets of $5 million or less; 1393 or (2) a broker-dealer with total
capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the prior
fiscal year as of which its audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to Rule 17a-5(d)
under the Exchange Act, 1394 or, if not required to file such statements, a broker-dealer with total
capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last day of the
preceding fiscal year (or in the time that it has been in business, if shorter); and is not affiliated
with any person (other than a natural person) that is not a small business or small
organization. 1395
The Regulation SBSR Proposing Release stated that, based on input from security-based
swap market participants and its own information, the Commission preliminarily believed that
the majority of security-based swap transactions have at least one counterparty that is either a
security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, and that these entities,
whether registered broker-dealers or not, would exceed the thresholds defining “small entities”
set out above. 1396 Thus, the Commission noted that it preliminarily believed that neither of these
types of entities would likely qualify as small entities for purposes of the RFA. 1397 Moreover, in
1393

See 17 CFR 240.0-10(a).

the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission noted that, even in cases where one of
the counterparties to a security-based swap was outside of the categories of security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant, the Commission preliminarily did not believe
any such entities would be “small entities” as defined in Commission Rule 0-10. 1398 In this
regard, the Commission noted that feedback from industry participants and the Commission’s
own information about the security-based swap market (including a survey conducted by the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) indicated that only persons or entities with assets
significantly in excess of $5 million participate in the security-based swap market. 1399 As a
result, the Commission stated its preliminarily belief that the vast majority of, if not all, securitybased swap transactions are between large entities for purposes of the RFA. 1400
Similarly, in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated its
preliminarily belief that the entities likely to register as SDRs would not be small entities. 1401
Based on input from security-based swap market participants and its own information, the
Commission stated its preliminarily belief that most if not all the registered SDRs would be part
of large business entities, and that all registered SDRs would have assets exceeding $5 million
and total capital exceeding $500,000. 1402 On this basis, the Commission preliminarily believed
that the number of security-based swap transactions involving a small entity as that term is
defined for purposes of the RFA would be de minimis and that no aspect of proposed Regulation
SBSR would be likely to alter the type of counterparties presently engaging in security-based

swap transactions. 1403 Therefore, the Commission preliminarily did not believe that proposed
Regulation SBSR would impact any small entities. 1404
As a result, in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission certified that
Regulation SBSR would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities for purposes of the RFA and requested written comments regarding this
certification. 1405 Specifically, the Commission requested that commenters describe the nature of
any impact on small entities, indicate whether they believe that participants and registered SDRs
are unlikely to be small entities, and provide empirical data to support their responses. 1406 The
Commission did not receive any comments contrary to its conclusion.
The Commission continues to believe that few if any security-based swap counterparties
that would incur duties under Regulation SBSR, as adopted, are “small entities” as defined in
Commission Rule 0-10. Feedback from industry participants and the Commission’s own
information about the security-based swap market indicate that only persons or entities with
assets significantly in excess of $5 million participate in the security-based swap market. 1407 The
Commission continues to believe that the vast majority of, if not all, security-based swap
transactions are between large entities for purposes of the RFA.
Based on input from security-based swap market participants and its own information,
the Commission continues to believe that registered SDRs would be part of large business
entities, and that all registered SDRs would have assets exceeding $5 million and total capital

exceeding $500,000. Therefore, the Commission continues to believe that none of the registered
SDRs would be small entities.
The Commission believes that the number of security-based swap transactions involving
a small entity as that term is defined for purposes of the RFA would be de minimis. Moreover,
the Commission does not believe that any aspect of Regulation SBSR would be likely to alter the
type of counterparties presently engaging in security-based swap transactions. Therefore, the
Commission does not believe that Regulation SBSR would impact any small entities.
For the foregoing reasons, the Commission certifies that Regulation SBSR would not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for purposes of the
RFA.

by operation of § 242.908(a)(1)(ii)), or, if 24 hours after the time of execution or acceptance, as

618

applicable, would fall on a day that is not a business day, by the same time on the next day that is
a business day. The reporting timeframe for paragraph (e) of this section shall be 24 hours after
the occurrence of the life cycle event or the adjustment due to the life cycle event.
Appendix to 17 CFR 242.901 Reports regarding the establishment of block thresholds and
reporting delays for regulatory reporting of security-based swap transaction data.
This appendix sets forth guidelines applicable to reports that the Commission has directed
its staff to make in connection with the determination of block thresholds and reporting delays
for security-based swap transaction data. The Commission intends to use these reports to inform
its specification of the criteria for determining what constitutes a large notional security-based
swap transaction (block trade) for particular markets and contracts; and the appropriate time
delay for reporting large notional security-based swap transactions (block trades) to the public in
order to implement regulatory requirements under Section 13 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78m). In
producing these reports, the staff shall consider security-based swap data collected by the
Commission pursuant to other Title VII rules, as well as any other applicable information as the
staff may determine to be appropriate for its analysis.
(a) Report topics. As appropriate, based on the availability of data and information, the
reports should address the following topics for each asset class:
(1) Price impact. In connection with the Commission’s obligation to specify criteria for
determining what constitutes a block trade and the appropriate reporting delay for block trades,
the report generally should assess the effect of notional amount and observed reporting delay on
price impact of trades in the security-based swap market.
(2) Hedging. In connection with the Commission’s obligation to specify criteria for
determining what constitutes a block trade and the appropriate reporting delay for block trades,

619

the report generally should consider potential relationships between observed reporting delays
and the incidence and cost of hedging large trades in the security-based swap market, and
whether these relationships differ for interdealer trades and dealer to customer trades.
(3) Price efficiency. In connection with the Commission’s obligation to specify criteria
for determining what constitutes a block trade and the appropriate reporting delay for block
trades, the report generally should assess the relationship between reporting delays and the speed
with which transaction information is impounded into market prices, estimating this relationship
for trades of different notional amounts.
(4) Other topics. Any other analysis of security-based swap data and information, such as
security-based swap market liquidity and price volatility, that the Commission or the staff deem
relevant to the specification of:
(i) The criteria for determining what constitutes a large notional security-based swap
transaction (block trade) for particular markets and contracts; and
(ii) The appropriate time delay for reporting large notional security-based swap
transactions (block trades).
(b) Timing of reports. Each report shall be complete no later than two years following
the initiation of public dissemination of security-based swap transaction data by the first
registered SDR in that asset class.
(c) Public comment on the report. Following completion of the report, the report shall be
published in the Federal Register for public comment.
§ 242.902 Public dissemination of transaction reports.
(a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a registered securitybased swap data repository shall publicly disseminate a transaction report of a security-based

620

swap, or a life cycle event or adjustment due to a life cycle event, immediately upon receipt of
information about the security-based swap, or upon re-opening following a period when the
registered security-based swap data repository was closed. The transaction report shall consist of
all the information reported pursuant to § 242.901(c), plus any condition flags contemplated by
the registered security-based swap data repository’s policies and procedures that are required by
§ 242.907.
(b) [Reserved].
(c) Non-disseminated information. A registered security-based swap data repository shall
not disseminate:
(1) The identity of any counterparty to a security-based swap;
(2) With respect to a security-based swap that is not cleared at a registered clearing
agency and that is reported to the registered security-based swap data repository, any information
disclosing the business transactions and market positions of any person;
(3) Any information regarding a security-based swap reported pursuant to § 242.901(i);
(4) Any non-mandatory report;
(5) Any information regarding a security-based swap that is required to be reported
pursuant to §§ 242.901 and 242.908(a)(1) but is not required to be publicly disseminated
pursuant to § 242.908(a)(2);
(6) Any information regarding a clearing transaction that arises from the acceptance of a
security-based swap for clearing by a registered clearing agency or that results from netting other
clearing transactions; or
(7) Any information regarding the allocation of a security-based swap.

621

(d) Temporary restriction on other market data sources. No person shall make available
to one or more persons (other than a counterparty or a post-trade processor) transaction
information relating to a security-based swap before the primary trade information about the
security-based swap is sent to a registered security-based swap data repository.
§ 242.903 Coded information.
(a) If an internationally recognized standards-setting system that imposes fees and usage
restrictions on persons that obtain UICs for their own usage that are fair and reasonable and not
unreasonably discriminatory and that meets the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section is
recognized by the Commission and has assigned a UIC to a person, unit of a person, or product
(or has endorsed a methodology for assigning transaction IDs), the registered security-based
swap data repository shall employ that UIC (or methodology for assigning transaction IDs). If
no such system has been recognized by the Commission, or a recognized system has not assigned
a UIC to a particular person, unit of a person, or product (or has not endorsed a methodology for
assigning transaction IDs), the registered security-based swap data repository shall assign a UIC
to that person, unit of person, or product using its own methodology (or endorse a methodology
for assigning transaction IDs). If the Commission has recognized such a system that assigns
UICs to persons, each participant of a registered security-based swap data repository shall obtain
a UIC from or through that system for identifying itself, and each participant that acts as a
guarantor of a direct counterparty’s performance of any obligation under a security-based swap
that is subject to § 242.908(a) shall, if the direct counterparty has not already done so, obtain a
UIC for identifying the direct counterparty from or through that system, if that system permits
third-party registration without a requirement to obtain prior permission of the direct
counterparty.

622

(b) A registered security-based swap data repository may permit information to be
reported pursuant to § 242.901, and may publicly disseminate that information pursuant to
§ 242.902, using codes in place of certain data elements, provided that the information necessary
to interpret such codes is widely available to users of the information on a non-fee basis.
§ 242.904 Operating hours of registered security-based swap data repositories.
A registered security-based swap data repository shall have systems in place to
continuously receive and disseminate information regarding security-based swaps pursuant to
§§ 242.900 through 242.909, subject to the following exceptions:
(a) A registered security-based swap data repository may establish normal closing hours
during periods when, in its estimation, the U.S. market and major foreign markets are inactive.
A registered security-based swap data repository shall provide reasonable advance notice to
participants and to the public of its normal closing hours.
(b) A registered security-based swap data repository may declare, on an ad hoc basis,
special closing hours to perform system maintenance that cannot wait until normal closing hours.
A registered security-based swap data repository shall, to the extent reasonably possible under
the circumstances, avoid scheduling special closing hours during periods when, in its estimation,
the U.S. market and major foreign markets are most active; and provide reasonable advance
notice of its special closing hours to participants and to the public.
(c) During normal closing hours, and to the extent reasonably practicable during special
closing hours, a registered security-based swap data repository shall have the capability to
receive and hold in queue information regarding security-based swaps that has been reported
pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.909.

623

(d) When a registered security-based swap data repository re-opens following normal
closing hours or special closing hours, it shall disseminate transaction reports of security-based
swaps held in queue, in accordance with the requirements of § 242.902.
(e) If a registered security-based swap data repository could not receive and hold in queue
transaction information that was required to be reported pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.909,
it must immediately upon re-opening send a message to all participants that it has resumed
normal operations. Thereafter, any participant that had an obligation to report information to the
registered security-based swap data repository pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.909, but
could not do so because of the registered security-based swap data repository’s inability to
receive and hold in queue data, must promptly report the information to the registered securitybased swap data repository.
§ 242.905 Correction of errors in security-based swap information.
(a) Duty to correct. Any counterparty to a security-based swap that discovers an error in
information previously reported pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.909 shall correct such error
in accordance with the following procedures:
(1) If a side that was not the reporting side for a security-based swap transaction
discovers an error in the information reported with respect to such security-based swap, the
counterparty shall promptly notify the reporting side of the error; and
(2) If the reporting side discovers an error in the information reported with respect to a
security-based swap, or receives notification from its counterparty of an error, the reporting side
shall promptly submit to the entity to which the security-based swap was originally reported an
amended report pertaining to the original transaction report. If the reporting side reported the
initial transaction to a registered security-based swap data repository, the reporting side shall

624

submit an amended report to the registered security-based swap data repository in a manner
consistent with the policies and procedures contemplated by § 242.907(a)(3).
(b) Duty of security-based swap data repository to correct. A registered security-based
swap data repository shall:
(1) Upon discovery of an error or receipt of a notice of an error, verify the accuracy of the
terms of the security-based swap and, following such verification, promptly correct the erroneous
information regarding such security-based swap contained in its system; and
(2) If such erroneous information relates to a security-based swap that the registered
security-based swap data repository previously disseminated and falls into any of the categories
of information enumerated in § 242.901(c), publicly disseminate a corrected transaction report of
the security-based swap promptly following verification of the trade by the counterparties to the
security-based swap, with an indication that the report relates to a previously disseminated
transaction.
§ 242.906 Other duties of participants.
(a) Identifying missing UIC information. A registered security-based swap data
repository shall identify any security-based swap reported to it for which the registered securitybased swap data repository does not have the counterparty ID and (if applicable) the broker ID,
branch ID, execution agent ID, trading desk ID, and trader ID of each direct counterparty. Once
a day, the registered security-based swap data repository shall send a report to each participant of
the registered security-based swap data repository or, if applicable, an execution agent,
identifying, for each security-based swap to which that participant is a counterparty, the securitybased swap(s) for which the registered security-based swap data repository lacks counterparty ID
and (if applicable) broker ID, branch ID, execution agent ID, desk ID, and trader ID. A

625

participant of a registered security-based swap data repository that receives such a report shall
provide the missing information with respect to its side of each security-based swap referenced
in the report to the registered security-based swap data repository within 24 hours.
(b) Duty to provide ultimate parent and affiliate information. Each participant of a
registered security-based swap data repository shall provide to the registered security-based swap
data repository information sufficient to identify its ultimate parent(s) and any affiliate(s) of the
participant that also are participants of the registered security-based swap data repository, using
ultimate parent IDs and counterparty IDs. Any such participant shall promptly notify the
registered security-based swap data repository of any changes to that information.
(c) Policies and procedures of registered security-based swap dealers and registered
major security-based swap participants. Each participant of a registered security-based swap
data repository that is a registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based
swap participant shall establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are
reasonably designed to ensure that it complies with any obligations to report information to a
registered security-based swap data repository in a manner consistent with §§ 242.900 through
242.909. Each such participant shall review and update its policies and procedures at least
annually.
§ 242.907 Policies and procedures of registered security-based swap data repositories.
(a) General policies and procedures. With respect to the receipt, reporting, and
dissemination of data pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.909, a registered security-based swap
data repository shall establish and maintain written policies and procedures:
(1) That enumerate the specific data elements of a security-based swap that must be
reported, which shall include, at a minimum, the data elements specified in § 242.901(c) and (d);

626

(2) That specify one or more acceptable data formats (each of which must be an opensource structured data format that is widely used by participants), connectivity requirements, and
other protocols for submitting information;
(3) For specifying procedures for reporting life cycle events and corrections to previously
submitted information, making corresponding updates or corrections to transaction records, and
applying an appropriate flag to the transaction report to indicate that the report is an error
correction required to be disseminated by § 242.905(b)(2), or is a life cycle event, or any
adjustment due to a life cycle event, required to be disseminated by § 242.902(a);
(4) For:
(i) Identifying characteristic(s) of a security-based swap, or circumstances associated
with the execution or reporting of the security-based swap, that could, in the fair and reasonable
estimation of the registered security-based swap data repository, cause a person without
knowledge of these characteristic(s) or circumstance(s), to receive a distorted view of the market;
(ii) Establishing flags to denote such characteristic(s) or circumstance(s);
(iii) Directing participants that report security-based swaps to apply such flags, as
appropriate, in their reports to the registered security-based swap data repository; and
(iv) Applying such flags:
(A) To disseminated reports to help to prevent a distorted view of the market; or
(B) In the case of a transaction referenced in § 242.902(c), to suppress the report from
public dissemination entirely, as appropriate;
(5) For assigning UICs in a manner consistent with § 242.903; and

627

(6) For periodically obtaining from each participant information that identifies the
participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any participant(s) with which the participant is affiliated,
using ultimate parent IDs and counterparty IDs.
(b) [Reserved].
(c) Public availability of policies and procedures. A registered security-based swap data
repository shall make the policies and procedures required by §§ 242.900 through 242.909
publicly available on its website.
(d) Updating of policies and procedures. A registered security-based swap data
repository shall review, and update as necessary, the policies and procedures required by
§§ 242.900 through 242.909 at least annually. Such policies and procedures shall indicate the
date on which they were last reviewed.
(e) A registered security-based swap data repository shall provide to the Commission,
upon request, information or reports related to the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of data
reported to it pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.909 and the registered security-based swap
data repository’s policies and procedures thereunder.
§ 242.908 Cross-border matters.
(a) Application of Regulation SBSR to cross-border transactions. (1) A security-based
swap shall be subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination if:
(i) There is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on either or both sides of
the transaction; or
(ii) The security-based swap is accepted for clearing by a clearing agency having its
principal place of business in the United States.

628

(2) A security-based swap that is not included within paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall
be subject to regulatory reporting but not public dissemination if there is a direct or indirect
counterparty on either or both sides of the transaction that is a registered security-based swap
dealer or a registered major security-based swap participant.
(b) Limitation on obligations. Notwithstanding any other provision of §§ 242.900
through 242.909, a person shall not incur any obligation under §§ 242.900 through 242.909
unless it is:
(1) A U.S. person; or
(2) A registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap
participant.
(c) Substituted compliance—(1) General. Compliance with the regulatory reporting and
public dissemination requirements in sections 13(m) and 13A of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(m) and
78m-1), and the rules and regulations thereunder, may be satisfied by compliance with the rules
of a foreign jurisdiction that is the subject of a Commission order described in paragraph (c)(2)
of this section, provided that at least one of the direct counterparties to the security-based swap is
either a non-U.S. person or a foreign branch.
(2) Procedure. (i) The Commission may, conditionally or unconditionally, by order,
make a substituted compliance determination regarding regulatory reporting and public
dissemination of security-based swaps with respect to a foreign jurisdiction if that jurisdiction’s
requirements for the regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps are
comparable to otherwise applicable requirements. The Commission may, conditionally or
unconditionally, by order, make a substituted compliance determination regarding regulatory
reporting of security-based swaps that are subject to § 242.908(a)(2) with respect to a foreign

629

jurisdiction if that jurisdiction’s requirements for the regulatory reporting of security-based
swaps are comparable to otherwise applicable requirements.
(ii) A party that potentially would comply with requirements under §§ 242.900 through
242.909 pursuant to a substituted compliance order or any foreign financial regulatory authority
or authorities supervising such a person’s security-based swap activities may file an application,
pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 240.0-13 of this chapter, requesting that the Commission
make a substituted compliance determination regarding regulatory reporting and public
dissemination with respect to a foreign jurisdiction the rules of which also would require
reporting and public dissemination of those security-based swaps.
(iii) In making such a substituted compliance determination, the Commission shall take
into account such factors as the Commission determines are appropriate, such as the scope and
objectives of the relevant foreign regulatory requirements, as well as the effectiveness of the
supervisory compliance program administered, and the enforcement authority exercised, by the
foreign financial regulatory authority to support oversight of its regulatory reporting and public
dissemination system for security-based swaps. The Commission shall not make such a
substituted compliance determination unless it finds that:
(A) The data elements that are required to be reported pursuant to the rules of the foreign
jurisdiction are comparable to those required to be reported pursuant to § 242.901;
(B) The rules of the foreign jurisdiction require the security-based swap to be reported
and publicly disseminated in a manner and a timeframe comparable to those required by
§§ 242.900 through 242.909 (or, in the case of transactions that are subject to § 242.908(a)(2) but
not to § 242.908(a)(1), the rules of the foreign jurisdiction require the security-based swap to be

630

reported in a manner and a timeframe comparable to those required by §§ 242.900 through
242.909);
(C) The Commission has direct electronic access to the security-based swap data held by
a trade repository or foreign regulatory authority to which security-based swaps are reported
pursuant to the rules of that foreign jurisdiction; and
(D) Any trade repository or foreign regulatory authority in the foreign jurisdiction that
receives and maintains required transaction reports of security-based swaps pursuant to the laws
of that foreign jurisdiction is subject to requirements regarding data collection and maintenance;
systems capacity, integrity, resiliency, availability, and security; and recordkeeping that are
comparable to the requirements imposed on security-based swap data repositories by the
Commission’s rules and regulations.
(iv) Before issuing a substituted compliance order pursuant to this section, the
Commission shall have entered into memoranda of understanding and/or other arrangements
with the relevant foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities under such foreign financial
regulatory system addressing supervisory and enforcement cooperation and other matters arising
under the substituted compliance determination.
(v) The Commission may, on its own initiative, modify or withdraw such order at any
time, after appropriate notice and opportunity for comment.

631

§ 242.909 Registration of security-based swap data repository as a securities information
processor.
A registered security-based swap data repository shall also register with the Commission
as a securities information processor on Form SDR (§ 249.1500 of this chapter).

By the Commission.
