IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION,
Plaintiff,
Civil Action No.: 16-cv-02463
v.
INFINEX VENTURES, INC., and
RONALD SALEM

Defendants.

COMPLAINT
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) alleges as
follows:
SUMMARY
1.

In 2014, Defendant Infinex Ventures, Inc. (“Infinex”) and its sole officer and

employee, Defendant Ronald Salem (“Salem”), made a series of false and misleading public
statements claiming that Infinex had operations and funding to develop a marijuana business.
2.

In March 2014, Salem incorporated a new entity, Marijuana Funding Inc.

(“MFI”), and then caused Infinex to release a series of three press releases in May and June 2014
announcing its negotiations with, and ultimate acquisition of, MFI.
3.

In those press releases, Infinex and Salem described MFI as a private company

that specialized in funding companies in the marijuana industry. In the final release, Infinex
claimed to have “secured access to $100 million for marijuana funding” through MFI.

Case 1:16-cv-02463 Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 USDC Colorado Page 2 of 9

4.

Before and after issuing these press releases, Infinex released false financial

information claiming that it had generated revenue of approximately $107,000 for the month of
April 2014 and had sales of $512,000 for the full second quarter of 2014.
5.

In fact, Salem controlled MFI, and neither Infinex nor MFI had any operations,

specialized expertise, revenue, or funding.
6.

By virtue of the conduct alleged herein, the Defendants, directly or indirectly,

engaged in acts, practices, and courses of business that violated Section 10(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder [17
C.F.R. 240.l0b-5(b)].
7.

Unless Defendants are permanently restrained and enjoined, they are likely to

again engage in acts, practices, and courses of business similar to those set forth in this
Complaint and otherwise violate Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 therunder.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
8.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e) and

27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].
9.

Defendants, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of

interstate commerce, or of the mails, in connection with the acts, practices, transactions, and
courses of business alleged in this Complaint.
10.

Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), and Section 27 of

the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa].
11.

Infinex Ventures, Inc. had its principal and sole office in this District. Certain of

the acts, practices, transactions and courses of business constituting violations alleged in this
Complaint occurred in this District.

DEFENDANTS
12.

Infinex is a Nevada corporation with its principal executive offices in Denver,

Colorado. Nevada Secretary of State records list Infinex’s corporate status as “revoked” for
failure to pay required fees. Infinex is controlled by RS Capital, LLC, a Colorado limited
liability company. Infinex stock trades on the OTC Pink market, operated by OTC Markets
Group, Inc. (“OTC Markets”), under the symbol “INFX.” Infinex’s stock is a “penny stock” as
defined by Section 3(a)(51) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(51) and Rule 3a51-1
thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.3a51-1].
13.

Salem, age 40, is a resident of San Diego, California. Salem has been Infinex’s

President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Director since at least March 2014. Salem is
the manager and only known member of RS Capital, LLC. Salem was the sole employee of
Infinex and MFI during the relevant period. Salem was quoted in each of Infinex’s false and
misleading press releases and caused them to be disseminated.
FACTS
Background
14.

On April 24, 2014, Infinex filed a quarterly report for the first quarter of 2014

with OTC Markets. That report disclosed new ownership and management and reported no
sales, revenue or assets. It identified Ronald Salem as the company’s new President, Chief
Executive Officer, Secretary and Director, and Salem certified the report as the company’s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The report stated that “[o]n March 15, 2014 RS
Capital took over control of the company…” and identified Salem as the manager of RS Capital,
LLC.

15.

OTC Markets operates financial markets that do not have actual physical

locations where stock can be bought and sold. Buyers and sellers of securities listed on its
markets trade with one another through various communication modes such as the telephone,
email, and proprietary electronic trading systems. Issuers are able to provide financial and other
information to investors by filing reports and releases with OTC Markets that are disseminated
through its website.
May 5, 2014 Financial Report
16.

Within weeks after reporting its change of control and reporting no revenue, on

May 5, 2014, Infinex filed interim financials for the month of April 2014 with OTC Markets in
which it reported revenue of $106,875. Infinex did not disclose any details as to how it
generated the purported revenue. The company’s claims regarding revenue were false; in fact,
Infinex had no operations that could have generated the revenue.
17.

Salem was Infinex’s sole officer and employee at the time these statements were

made, had ultimate authority over the statements, and was the person who filed them with OTC
Markets to be published on their website.
May 22, 2014 Press Release
18.

After filing this false financial information, Infinex released a series of three false

and misleading press releases concerning its purported entry into the marijuana business. Salem
approved and paid for the dissemination of each false and misleading press release and is quoted
in each one. Each of the releases was distributed to the public through services offered by
MacReport Media Publishing, Inc. and Marketwired L.P. and were thereafter available on the
internet.

19.

In a May 22, 2014 press release, Infinex announced that it had “entered

meaningful negotiations for the acquisition of Marijuana Funding Inc.” and reported that MFI
“has extensive lending and finance programs that are focused on growing the Marijuana
industry.” Infinex further claimed that “[t]he purchase would allow the Company to expand its
offerings into markets that it has not done business with in the past.” Infinex also claimed that
“[t]he program will allow the company to receive not only financing charge revenue, but also
revenue from the sales of Cannabis products as it acquires marijuana dispensaries and other
manufacturers in the Cannabis industry.” The release included the following quote from Salem:
“As the restrictions [state law and regulations on marijuana sale and usage] continue to lighten,
we are going to be able to continue the further expansion of these companies by providing
working capital and equipment financing available today through Marijuana Funding, Inc. …
This program is sure to bring in significant revenue going into the third and fourth quarters of
2014. This fits right in with our plan to model to grow [sic] shareholder value via strong
revenues.”
20.

These statements were false and misleading because MFI had no operations,

revenue, or prospects, and the acquisition of MFI would not bring additional value to Infinex.
Salem had incorporated MFI on May 15, 2014. Salem was the sole employee of both
companies, and the purported acquisition was paid for with the issuance of 100 million Infinex
shares in the name of MFI. Investors could not know that Infinex was acquiring nothing of value
and had effectively paid nothing for MFI since the shares were to be issued in the name of MFI
and would be owned by Infinex upon closing of the transaction. Also, since MFI had no
operations or financing prospects, the claim that the acquisition of MFI would enable Infinex to

5

Case 1:16-cv-02463 Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 USDC Colorado Page 6 of 9

generate significant revenue in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 was also false and
misleading.
June 2, 2014 Press Release
21.

On June 2, 2014, Infinex issued a press release announcing that it had “acquired

the privately held company Marijuana Funding Inc.” and claimed that MFI “specializes in the
funding of companies in the burgeoning Medical and Recreational Marijuana Industries. The
company works with both conventional and non-traditional loans as well as private equity and
possible public offerings.” These claims were false and misleading since MFI was formed and
controlled by Salem, its only employee, and had no operations or legitimate prospects.
June 6, 2014 Press Release
22.

On June 6, 2014, Infinex issued a press release in which it claimed to have

funding that it was offering to marijuana businesses. Infinex claimed that, through MFI, it had
“secured access to over $100 million in funding to put towards projects” in the marijuana
industry and claimed that “[t]he company has an aggressive program, offering from 7.99% to
13% on a 30 year note ranging from $250,000 to $5,000,000 per site, all with credit scores as
low as 650.” These claims were false and misleading because, in fact, MFI and Infinex had no
actual rights to any source of funds, no rights to profit from any funding that was actually
arranged, and were not able to offer any financing.
September 17, 2014 Financial Report
23.

Infinex’s only additional public disclosure came on September 17, 2014 when it

filed unaudited annual reports for 2012 and 2013 and a quarterly report for the second quarter of
2014 with OTC Markets. Salem signed and certified the report as Infinex’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer and caused them to be filed with OTC Markets. Both reports

6

Case 1:16-cv-02463 Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 USDC Colorado Page 7 of 9

disclosed minimal sales ($123,159 for 2012 and $276,060 for 2013) with a small net loss for
2012 ($71,611) and a small net profit for 2013 ($45,362). Infinex did not disclose the source of
the purported sales or any detail concerning the business in which Infinex was purportedly
engaged during those periods. The quarterly report for the second quarter reported sales of
$511,972 for the quarter, with a net loss of $26,102. The report did not reveal any facts about
the source of those sales and did not contain any disclosure related to Infinex’s purported
marijuana business. Infinex’s claims in these reports of revenue and sales were false and
misleading in light of Infinex’s lack of operations.
24.

Salem and Infinex knowingly or recklessly made each of the above false or

misleading statements regarding Infinex’s business and rights to financing. Salem was the only
employee of both Infinex and MFI and knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that neither
company had any business operations, revenue or funding and that there was no basis for the
statements he made on behalf of Infinex. Salem was Infinex’s sole officer and his scienter is
imputed to Infinex.
25.

Each of these false and misleading statements was material because each

statement focused on Infinex’s purported operations and ability to do business in the future.
Investors would have been less likely to buy or retain Infinex stock if they had known that
Infinex had no business operations, revenue or funding.
26.

Infinex’s stock was traded throughout the period when Infinex and Salem made

the false and misleading statements and created a significant risk of investor losses. The false
and misleading statements had a significant impact on trading in Infinex’s stock, with average
daily trading volume of approximately 91,000 shares for April 2014, the month before the false
and misleading statements began, rising to approximately 302,000 shares for May 2014 and

7

Case 1:16-cv-02463 Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 USDC Colorado Page 8 of 9

approximately 575,000 for June 2014. Infinex’s trading price and average daily trading volume
declined significantly thereafter.
CLAIM FOR RELIEF

or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mails, in connection with the purchase or
sale of a security, made untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state material facts

made, not misleading.
