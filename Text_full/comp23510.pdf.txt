Defendants

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (''the Commission") alleges:
SUMMARY OF THE ACTION
1.

From 20 IO through at least December 2012, defendants Joseph Andrew Paul and

John D. Ellis, Jr. orchestrated a fraudulent scheme in which they raised more than $3.9 million
from more than a dozen investors through their jointly owned investment advisory firm, PaulEllis Investment Associates LLC ("PEIA").
2.

In a variety of different offering materials, Paul and Ellis provided prospective

clients with false and wholly fabricated information that misrepresented, among other things,
PEIA' s investment strategies, assets under management, and investment performance.
3.

For example, Paul and Ellis falsely claimed that PEIA managed as much as $164

million in client assets and that its investment strategies generated annual returns ranging from
8.5% to more than 56%. In reality, PEIA never managed more than $4 million and these
purported returns grossly exceeded any actual returns PEIA generated, and were simply made up
by Paul and Ellis.
4.

In furtherance of the scheme, Paul and Ellis recruited defendants James S. Quay

Case 2:16-cv-01326-CMR Document 1 Filed 04/01/16 Page 2 of 15

and Donald H. Ellison to solicit investors for PEIA through Aptus Planning LLC, a firm owned
by Quay and Ellison which purportedly provided financial planning for senior citizens.
5.

At the time Quay started marketing PEIA, he was a convicted felon and a

disbarred attorney. During the course of marketing PEIA, Quay was enjoined from violating the
securities laws after being sued by the Commission for engaging in a separate securities fraud.
In order to conceal Quay's true identity from potential investors, Quay and Ellison
misrepresented Quay as an attorney, "Stephen Jameson." Using this fictitious name, Quay and
Ellison were able to raise nearly $1.3 million from investors for PEIA.
6.

Paul and Ellis initially invested some of the funds they, and Quay and Ellison,

fraudulently raised for PEIA. However, during the later stages of the fraud, Paul and Ellis
ceased investing these monies and misappropriated the remaining funds, spending thousands of
dollars to pay legal bills, employee salaries, and personal expenses. They also diverted $385,900
to Quay, who used the funds for his own personal trading. As a result of the fraudulent conduct
by Paul, Ellis, Quay, and Ellison, PEIA investors lost more than $1.9 million.
7.

As a result of the conduct described in this Complaint, Paul, Ellis, Quay, and

Ellison have violated, and unless restrained and enjoined will continue to violate, Section l 7(a)
of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)]; Section lO(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and Rule lOb-5
thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.lOb-5]; and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") [15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-6(1) and 80b-6(2)]. Additionally, Ellis has
violated, and unless restrained and enjoined will continue to violate, Section 207 of the Advisers
Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-7].
8.

As a result of the conduct described in this Complaint, Paul and Ellis have aided

and abetted PEIA's violations of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. § 80b-6(4)] and
Rule 206(4)-l(a)(5) thereunder [17 C.F.R. 275.206(4)-l(a)(5)].
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
9.

The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b) and 20(d) of the

Aptus Planning LLC ("Aptus") was a Florida limited liability company, with its

principal place of business in Tampa, Florida, founded and operated by Quay and Ellison.

Florida Department of State dissolved Aptus for failing to file its annual report.

FACTS
A.

Paul and Ellis Create and Distribute Fraudulent Offering Materials

19.

From 2010 through at least November 2012, Paul and Ellis orchestrated a

fraudulent scheme in which they falsely marketed themselves as experienced money managers
with a highly successful track record of investing in exchange-traded funds ("ETFs") through
their jointly owned, registered investment adviser, PEIA.
20.

During this period, Paul and Ellis created a variety of offering materials to solicit

investor funds, including a 67-page PEIA prospectus, marketing brochures, PowerPoint
presentations, and a PEIA website (collectively referred to as "PEIA Offering Materials").
21.

The PEIA Offering Materials contained misrepresentations about PEIA' s

investment strategy, assets under management, and investment performance, including:
(a)

Charts depicting wholly fabricated annual returns for each of PEIA's
investment strategies, ranging from 8.51 % to 56.24%;

(b)

Claims that Paul and Ellis had extensive experience generating these high
returns through PEIA' s proprietary investment strategies; and

(c)

Claims that PEIA had between $150 million to $164 million in "assets
under advisement" when, in reality, Paul and Ellis never managed more
than $4 million dollars.

22.

Each of these claims was false. Paul and Ellis copied most of the information

relating to the investment strategies from the website of another registered investment adviser,
5

Case 2:16-cv-01326-CMR Document 1 Filed 04/01/16 Page 6 of 15

and "cut and pasted" the performance numbers from other sources into the PEIA Offering
Materials.
23.

To solicit investor funds, Paul and Ellis distributed the fraudulent PEIA Offering

Materials to numerous registered advisers, broker-dealers, and financial planning firms.
24.

Between December 2009 and November 2011, Ellis filed several Forms ADV for

PEIA with the Commission that also grossly overstated PEIA's assets under management.

B.

Paul and Ellis Make Material Misstatements in Soliciting Summit's
Investment in PEIA

25.

In mid-September 2010, officers of Summit met with Paul and Ellis to discuss

retaining PEIA as an investment adviser.
26.

During the meeting, Paul and Ellis used a PowerPoint presentation containing

misrepresentations regarding, among other things, PEIA' s assets under management and
historical performance. For example, the PowerPoint presentation stated that PEIA had $150
million iii "assets under advisement," and contained a table purporting to show that PEIA's
"Strategic Growth Portfolio" generated average annual returns of25.13% between 2000 and
2009.
27.

Summit retained PEIA as its investment adviser and began to invest in PEIA' s

"Strategic Growth Portfolio." PEIA and Summit entered into an advisory agreement whereby
PEIA agreed to manage Summit's invested funds for a fee.
28.

In December 2010, Summit officers again met with Paul and Ellis to discuss

investing additional funds in PEIA. At this meeting, Paul and Ellis recommended PEIA' s
"Quantitative Portfolio." Paul and Ellis provided the Summit officers with a PowerPoint
presentation falsely stating that the Quantitative Portfolio had generated annual returns from 36%
to 107% between 2008 and 2010.
29.

Summit thereafter invested additional sums with PEIA, with its final investment

made on April 1, 2011.

6

Case 2:16-cv-01326-CMR Document 1 Filed 04/01/16 Page 7 of 15

30.

Through their misrepresentations regarding PEIA, Paul and Ellis obtained a total

of approximately $2,672,573 from Summit. Paul and Ellis invested, and ultimately lost much of
Summit's investment. By November 2, 2011, when Summit withdrew the last of its funds from
PEIA, it had suffered losses of approximately $744,330, or about 28% percent of its principal
investment. Paul and Ellis also charged Summit nearly $9,000 in advisory fees.
31.

In 2012, Summit filed a lawsuit against Paul, Ellis, and PEIA, alleging, among

other claims, violations of Section lO(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule lOb-5 thereunder, arising
in part from misrepresentations Paul and Ellis made to Summit in S<?liciting Summit's investment
with PEIA. See Summit Trust Co. v. Paul Ellis Investment Associates, LLC, et al., No. 12-cv6672 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 29, 2012). On August 2, 2013, the court entered a default judgment against
Paul, Ellis, and PEIA in the amount of $761,426.16 and concluded that they had violated the
securities laws.

C.

Paul, Ellis, Quay, and Ellison Make Material Misstatements In Soliciting
Aptus Clients to Invest in PEIA

32.

In 2011, Paul and Ellis began marketing PEIA to Quay and Ellison, the co-owners

of Aptus, a firm that purportedly provided financial planning for senior citizens. Paul and Ellis
sought to have Quay and Ellison recommend PEIA's "Volatility Arbitrage Portfolio" ("VAP")
strategy to Aptus' clients and prospective clients.
33.

Paul and Ellis provided Quay and Ellison with a four-page marketing brochure

entitled "Aptus Planning Portfolios: Volatility Arbitrage Portfolio" (the "VAP Brochure"), which
described the V AP as a conservative investment strategy that involved risking only 10% of an
investor's principal investment. The VAP Brochure falsely stated that between 2008 and July
2011, PEIA used this strategy to generate average annual returns of 46.70%.
34.

Paul and Ellis began marketing the V AP strategy in mid-2011 and created the

VAP Brochure so that Quay and Ellison could use it to market PEIA' s investment advisory
services to their current and prospective clients. Neither Quay nor Ellison did any due diligence
regarding the claims in the V AP Brochure or into PEIA.
7

Case 2:16-cv-01326-CMR Document 1 Filed 04/01/16 Page 8 of 15

35.

Subsequently, Quay and Ellison began soliciting potential investors for PEIA by

hosting free dinner seminars arranged at a restaurant in the Tampa area. Many of the attendees
were senior citizens who Quay and Ellison targeted through mass mailings.
36.

At such seminars, Ellison introduced Quay, and Quay referred to himself, as

attorney "Stephen Jameson." Quay and Ellison also distributed documents to prospective
investors listing Jameson and Ellison as directors of Aptus. At no time did Quay and Ellison tell
prospective investors that Jameson was not Quay's real name. Quay and Ellison concealed
Quay's real name and instead used a fictitious name to prevent prospective investors from
researching Quay's background and discovering his tax fraud conviction and disbarment.
37.

Following each dinner presentation, Quay and Ellison invited prospective

investors to schedule individual consultations at Aptus' office to discuss their financial planning
needs. During these individual consultations, while continuing to conceal Quay's identity, Quay
and Ellison used the VAP Brochure to promote PEIA' s Volatility Arbitrage Portfolio and touted
Paul's and Ellis' experience as successful money managers. Paul and Ellis attended at least one
of these consultations.
38.

On at least one occasion, Quay provided an investor with a proposal that Quay

authored that contained additional false claims about PEIA's Volatility Arbitrage Portfolio,
including that PEIA' s options trading strategy: "will [p]rovide double digit returns with
extremely low risk;" "[e]xposes less than 5% of your portfolio to market risk;" and was
"averaging triple digit returns."
39.

Fourteen investors solicited by Quay and Ellison invested a total of approximately

$1,295,000 with PEIA. These "Aptus investors" typically agreed that PEIA would receive as
compensation 50% of their monthly returns. Paul and Ellis, in tum, agreed to share 65% of their
fees with Quay and Ellison.

D.

Paul and Ellis Steal the Aptus Investors' Money

40.

Between July 2011 and February 2012, the Aptus investors collectively wired

nearly $1.3 million to a PEIA bank account at Bank A controlled by Ellis.

8

Case 2:16-cv-01326-CMR Document 1 Filed 04/01/16 Page 9 of 15

41.

Ellis then transferred approximately two-thirds of the approximately $1.3 million

to a PEIA brokerage account. From July 2011 through February 2012, Paul and Ellis invested
the funds in the PEIA brokerage account in various securities, including ETFs and ETF options.
However, Paul and Ellis did not invest the remaining one-third of the Aptus investor funds,
approximately $450,000, instead using some of this money to pay various personal and business
expenses. For example, between July 2011 and February 2012, Ellis wired more than $68,000 to
an Aptus account controlled by Quay. And Ellis paid over $50,000 to two Philadelphia law
firms, $47,000 in apparent compensation to Paul, Ellis, and one other PEIA employee, and spent
thousands of dollars in ATM withdrawals and debit card purchases for personal expenses.
42.

By April 2012, Paul and Ellis had spent nearly $190,000 of the approximately

$450,000 in Aptus investor funds that they did not invest as promised. These expenditures also
far exceeded any performance fees to which Paul, Ellis, Quay, or Ellison possibly could have
been entitled.
43.

In April 2012, the brokerage firm holding PEIA's brokerage accounts closed

PEIA' s accounts because of concerns about money laundering. Thereafter, Ellis wired the
remaining balance of the Aptus investor money, approximately $635,000, to a PEIA bank
account at Bank B.
44.

By the end of May 2012, Paul and Ellis combined PEIA's remaining Aptus

investor funds, totaling more than $895,000, in PEIA's Bank B bank account. Paul and Ellis
never invested the funds again. Instead, between May 2012 and November 2012, Paul and Ellis
used these funds to pay business and other personal expenses, including: over $55,000 in
multiple wire payments to Quay and Ellison; $68,500 in PEIA salary payments; thousands of
dollars in transfers to various third parties; and numerous cash and debit card withdrawals.

E.

Quay's Unauthorized Trading and Material Misrepresentations

45.

On May 17, 2012, Ellis wired $385,900 to a bank account controlled by Quay,

who at the time had two outstanding margin calls totaling $192,910 in a brokerage account he
9

Case 2:16-cv-01326-CMR Document 1 Filed 04/01/16 Page 10 of 15

controlled. Quay immediately transferred the $385,900 into the brokerage account (satisfying
the margin calls), and used the Aptus investor funds to trade in Apple securities. By July 12,
2012, the Aptus investor funds were gone.
46.

After Quay already had suffered significant trading losses, he told a few of the

Aptus investors that he had invested a portion of their funds in his "option credit spread
strategy." Quay lied to these investors about the performance of this investment, claiming that
he was generating positive returns when, in reality, the remaining funds had already been lost.
For example, on July 20, 2012, Quay wrote to an investor claiming his investment strategy was
"performing as expected in the 2-4% weekly range," and signing the letter "Steve." In a letter
dated October 18, 2012 and signed by Aptus Planning LLC, Quay wrote, "[w]e expect solid
continued growth throughout the remainder of the year from our Apple credit spread strategy."
One Aptus investor redeemed his entire investment early in the scheme, and another redeemed
less than I 0% of the funds she invested. The remaining Aptus investors lost their entire
investment with PEIA.
