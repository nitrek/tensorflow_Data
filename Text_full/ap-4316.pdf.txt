ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17591
In the Matter of
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
SIERRA RESOURCE GROUP, INC.

On September 29, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondent pursuant to Section 12( j) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that Respondent has securities registered with the Commission
and is delinquent in its periodic filings.
On October 19, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service
establishing that the OIP was served on Respondent by October 3, 2016, in accordance with 17
C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2). Respondent’s answer was therefore due by October 17, 2016. OIP at 3;
see 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(a)-(b), .220(b). To date, Respondent has not filed an answer.
I ORDER Respondent to SHOW CAUSE by November 10, 2016, why the registration of
its securities should not be revoked by default due to its failure to file an answer or otherwise
defend this proceeding. If Respondent fails to respond to this order, it will be deemed in default
and the registration of its securities will be revoked. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2),
.220(f ).
