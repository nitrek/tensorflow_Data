In the Matter of
ZPR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, INC.,
and MAX E. ZAVANELLI

ORDER GRANTING PARTIAL STAY AND DENYING MOTION TO ADDUCE
ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE
On October 30, 2015, the Commission issued an opinion and order finding ZPR
Investment Management, Inc. (“ZPRIM”), and its former president and owner, Max E. Zavanelli
(“Zavanelli”), liable for, among other things, ZPRIM’s false or misleading claims of compliance
with the Global Investment Performance Standards (“GIPS”) in magazine advertisements and
newsletters that failed to provide returns information required by the GIPS Advertising
Guidelines. The Commission also found Respondents liable for ZPRIM’s false claim, made in a
Morningstar report for the period ending March 31, 2011, that it was not under Commission
investigation.1 The Commission barred Zavanelli from the securities industry, censured ZPRIM,
imposed cease-and-desist orders, and ordered ZPRIM and Zavanelli to pay, respectively,
$250,000 and $570,000 civil money penalties. On June 9, 2016, the Commission denied
Respondent’s motion for reconsideration.2
Respondents have filed a motion for a stay of the Commission’s order pending judicial
review. They also have filed a motion for leave to adduce additional evidence under Rule 452 of

2015) (explaining that ZPRIM violated Advisers Act Sections 206(1), (2), and (4), and Advisers
Act Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5) through its false or misleading claims of GIPS compliance and its false
claim in the Morningstar report that it was not under Commission investigation and that, with
respect to the magazine articles and newsletters, Zavanelli directly violated Sections 206(1) and
(2) and aided and abetted and caused ZPRIM’s violations).

the Commission’s Rules of Practice.3 For the reasons set forth below, we order a partial stay of
the Commission’s October 30, 2015 order and deny the motion to adduce additional evidence.
I.

Motion for a Stay

The Commission considers four factors in determining whether to grant a stay: (i)
whether there is a strong likelihood that the moving party will succeed on the merits of its
appeal; (ii) whether the moving party will suffer irreparable harm without a stay; (iii) whether
any person will suffer substantial harm as a result of a stay; and (iv) whether a stay is likely to
serve the public interest.4 The party seeking a stay has the burden of establishing that relief is
warranted. 5
In their stay motion, Respondents contend that they have shown a “substantial indication
of probable success” with respect to two claims. But the Commission’s October 30, 2015
opinion and June 9, 2016 order considered each of these claims and determined that these
arguments were without merit.
Respondents argue that the “total mix” of information available through other sources
requires a finding that the misrepresentations and omissions in ZPRIM’s advertisements were not
material. The Commission rejected this argument for three reasons. First, the Commission
concluded that “[i]nvestors should not be required to search for additional information that a firm
represents it has already provided through its claims of GIPS compliance.”6 Second, the
Commission found that ZPRIM “did not correct” those claims because it never publicly
acknowledged that they “were false, distributed corrected advertisements addressing [them], or
even directed recipients of its advertisement to the information required by the Guidelines that it
omitted from the advertisements.”7 Third, the Commission explained that “[e]ven if we were
inclined to consider information outside the advertisements and found that the exact information
omitted from the advertisements was available online or otherwise, we do not believe that
ZPRIM adequately drew attention to it here.”8
Respondents argue further that the First Circuit’s decision in Flannery v. SEC,9 decided
after the Commission’s October 30, 2015 opinion, supports their argument that they are likely to
succeed on appeal. The Commission rejected Respondents’ arguments based on Flannery in its
order denying reconsideration. The Commission found that Flannery has no bearing on liability

under the Advisers Act, that the information Respondents provided in subsequent disclosures or
on their website does not render the misstatements in their advertisements immaterial, and that
Flannery is distinguishable on its facts.10
Respondents also argue that they are likely to prevail on their claim that ZPRIM did not
act with scienter when it falsely stated in the Morningstar report for the period ending March
2011 that there was no pending Commission investigation. The Commission rejected this
argument, finding that the person who completed the Morningstar report “knew that ZPRIM was
under investigation,” but “intentionally failed to disclose it.”11
For these reasons, the Respondents have failed to establish a strong likelihood of success
on the merits of their appeal.
Furthermore, Respondents have failed to show that they will suffer irreparable injury
absent a stay. While Respondents acknowledge that “financial detriment” does not rise to the
level of irreparable harm, they argue that the civil money penalties assessed against Respondents
coupled with the bar of Zavanelli “could result in the demise of the firm.” But to warrant a stay,
“the injury must be both certain and great; it must be actual and not theoretical.”12
The possible harm to others and the public interest also weigh against granting a stay. As
explained in the Commission’s opinion, the sanctions imposed on the Respondents are in the
public interest. The Commission found that “[d]espite his knowledge and familiarity with GIPS,
Zavanelli flouted the requirements of the GIPS Advertising Guidelines.”13 His misconduct was
therefore “egregious and he acted with a high degree of scienter.”14 His misconduct also
“harmed the market generally because he disseminated false information regarding his firm’s
GIPS compliance and denied investors the ability to make direct comparisons between ZPRIM’s
performance and that of other investment advisers.”15 Accordingly, Zavanelli’s “serious
misconduct demonstrate[d] his unfitness for the securities industry in general.”16 Because the
“risks to customers from misrepresentations of the sort in which Zavanelli engaged exist
throughout the industry,” the Commission determined that an industry bar was necessary “to
protect investors from future violations by Zavanelli.”17 Likewise, the Commission found a
sufficient risk of future violations necessary to impose cease-and-desist orders.18 Given these

findings, the public interest supports keeping these sanctions in place during the pendency of any
appeal.
Nonetheless, the Commission “has at times stayed monetary sanctions pending appeal
without reference to the applicant’s likelihood of success on the merits” or the other components
of the four-factor test.19 Under the circumstances and in our discretion, we elect to stay the civil
penalties pending the filing of a petition for review with a United States Court of Appeals and,
upon the timely filing of such a petition, pending determination of that appeal.
II.

Motion to Adduce Additional Evidence

Respondents also seek leave to adduce additional evidence pursuant Rule 452 of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice. Specifically, Respondents seek to admit a summary of records
“that reflect the names of prospective clients and dates when information was forwarded to them
by the firm.” Respondents contend that this evidence would show that “information containing
performance data of ZPRIM was sent ‘immediately’ to each prospective client that responded to
an advertisement . . . .” Rule 452 does not apply under these circumstances. A party to an
administrative proceeding may, pursuant to Rule 452, move for leave to adduce additional
evidence “at any time prior to the issuance of a decision by the Commission.”20 That time has
passed.21
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the requirement in the Commission's October 30,
2015 order that ZPRIM and Zavanelli pay, respectively, $250,000 and $570,000 civil money
penalties is stayed for sixty days from June 9, 2016; and it is further
ORDERED that, if ZPRIM and Zavanelli file a timely petition for review with a United
States Court of Appeals, the stay of the civil money penalties shall continue pending the
determination of that appeal and the issuance of the court’s mandate; and it is further
