IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION,
Plaintiff,
Civil Action No.
v.
Jury Trial Demanded
ANDREW K.PROCTOR,and
ATLAS JG,LLC,
Defendants.

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission")alleges as follows:
SUMMARY
This matter involves an offering fraud conducted by Defendant Andrew K.
Proctor("Proctor")and Defendant Atlas JG, LLC("Atlas"), a Delaware limited liability
company formed by Proctor in 2006.
2.

From 2007 through 2011,Proctor, through Atlas, raised more than $22 million

from at least 200 overseas investors through a fraudulent offering of purported bonds promising
annual returns of eight to nine percent.
3.

Proctor induced investors to purchase these fraudulent securities by making

materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning, among other things, the
use of investor funds.
4.

Proctor told prospective investors that their funds would be used to purchase

receivables from homebuilding subcontractors at a discount, and that Atlas would profit from

Case 1:16-cv-00437-UNA Document 1 Filed 06/14/16 Page 2 of 10 PageID #: 2

the difference between the discounted price and the amount ultimately collected from
homebuilders.
5.

In actuality, Atlas used less than ten percent ofthe funds raised to buy receivables

from homebuilding subcontractors as promised, the last purchase occurring in 2008. However,
Proctor continued to fraudulently raise funds from investors for several years thereafter.
6.

Contrary to what investors were told, Proctor used at least $11.2 million of

investor funds to make so-called "interest" and "principal" payments to investors. He used the
balance of the proceeds raised to, among other things, fund offshore investments in Asia,
speculate in stock options and other derivatives, and finance his lifestyle. Proctor took at least
$2.8 million to pay personal expenses, including his mortgage, his credit card bills, and his
children's tuition.
7.

By knowingly or recklessly engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint,

Defendants Proctor and Atlas violated, and unless enjoined will continue to violate, Section
17(a) ofthe Securities Act of 1933("Securities Act")[15 U.S.C. §77q(a)] and Section 10(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934("Exchange Act")[15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule lOb-5

DEFENDANTS
11.

Andrew K.Proctor, age 59, resides in Perris, California. Proctor is the founder

and sole managing member of Defendant Atlas. On January 11, 2005, Proctor pled guilty to
one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud in the Central District of
California in connection with a penny stock pump-and-dump scheme and was sentenced to six
months of home detention, a $20,000 fine, and three years of probation. In addition, Proctor
was barred by the Commission from participating in the penny stock market.
12.

Atlas JG,LLC is a Delaware limited liability company formed by Proctor in

2006. From 2007 through 2011, Atlas issued at least four series of purported bonds.
13.

The Commission,Proctor and Atlas have agreed that the running of any statute of

limitations applicable to any action against Proctor and Atlas authorized, instituted or brought
by the Commission arising out ofthe Commission's investigation of the facts described herein,
including any sanctions or relief that may be imposed therein, has been tolled and suspended for
the period from November 1, 2014 through June 15, 2016.
FACTS
A.

Formation of Atlas JG,LLC

14.

During the real estate boom ofthe early 2000s, large U.S. homebuilders often

Case 1:16-cv-00437-UNA Document 1 Filed 06/14/16 Page 4 of 10 PageID #: 4

took months to pay their subcontractors. Without a stream of payment, subcontractors could not
accept new work because they were unable to meet their cash needs.
15.

In 2006, Proctor formed Atlas, purportedly to provide capital to subcontractors

while the subcontractors waited for builders to pay for the work they had performed.
16.

At all relevant times, Atlas acted by and through Proctor.

17.

Through a friend, Proctor was introduced to an individual in Hong Kong("Hong

Kong Business Associate")who was a principal of a British Virgin Islands corporation that
purported to be in the business of natural resources trading and logistics. The Hong Kong
Business Associate assisted Proctor in marketing Atlas bonds to investors in Taiwan.
18.

During the period from 2007 through 2011, Proctor issued at least four series of

purported bonds to over 200 overseas investors—all of whom appear to be located in Taiwan—
raising approximately $22.3 million.
19.

Proctor engaged a registered transfer agent located in Delaware to serve as Atlas'

transfer agent, paying agent, and registrar.
20.

To purchase the bonds, investors completed and signed subscription agreements,

which were sent to Proctor and countersigned by him in the U.S. on behalf of Atlas.
21.

Investors wired their purchase payments directly to an Atlas escrow account held

at the transfer agent in Delaware. After an investment, purported interest and redemption
payments were sent to investors from this same Delaware account.
B.

Material Misrepresentations And Omissions

22.

Proctor drafted written offering documents that were used to solicit investors for

Atlas. The offering documents for each ofthe four bond series consisted of a bond purchase
agreement, a short six-page summary of the offering, and a subscription agreement.

4

Case 1:16-cv-00437-UNA Document 1 Filed 06/14/16 Page 5 of 10 PageID #: 5

23.

In the written offering documents, Proctor claimed that Atlas would make money

by purchasing receivables from homebuilding subcontractors at a discount: Atlas would
purchase a subcontractor's receivable due from the homebuilder, along with the attached lien
rights, for approximately 75-90% of the receivable. Proctor claimed that when the homebuilder
paid the subcontractor, the funds would be paid to Atlas, and Atlas' profit would be the 10-25%
difference between the amount it paid the subcontractor for the receivable and the amount paid
in full by the homebuilder to satisfy its obligation. Proctor claimed that investor returns would
be generated from these profits.
24.

The offering documents for each ofthe four bond series contained the same

disclosures regarding the use of investor proceeds: "The proceeds ofthe Offering are to be used
to purchase receivables with lien rights due from national homebuilding companies from
[sub]contractors for completed work and materials supplied."
25.

The offering documents stated that investors would receive eight to nine percent

annual interest paid quarterly and that the bonds would mature in five years (the first series on
December 31, 2012, the second on December 31, 2013, the third on December 31, 2014, and the
fourth on December 31, 2015).
26.

The offering documents provided that investors could redeem prior to the

maturity date with 60 days written notice or, at maturity, Atlas would repay the principal
investment in full.
27.

The offering documents also stated that Atlas could engage a placement agent and

pay a 1.25% fee to that placement agent.
C.

Misuse of Investor Funds

28.

Contrary to what investors were told, Proctor used more than 90% ofinvestor

Case 1:16-cv-00437-UNA Document 1 Filed 06/14/16 Page 6 of 10 PageID #: 6

funds for purposes other than the purchase of receivables from homebuilding subcontractors.
29.

Between 2007 and 2011, Atlas used only $1.9 million of investor funds to

purchase homebuilding receivables, and all ofthose purchases occurred in 2007 and 2008.
30.

In May 2008, Proctor used Atlas funds to enroll himself in a class on writing call

options—a highly risky form of derivatives trading.
31.

Less than three weeks later, Proctor began purchasing stock options and other

derivatives with investor money.
32.

Proctor moved investor funds through a web of shell companies and accounts that

made tracing and detection of his activities difficult.
33.

From 2008 through 2011, Proctor funneled approximately $3.1 million from Atlas

bank accounts to two brokerage accounts in the name of Ocean Funding LLC,a Delaware
company that Proctor controlled. Proctor used this $3.1 million to speculate in the stock and
options market.
34.

For example,from May 28 to July 25, 2008, Proctor executed several hundred

stock and options transactions, including in complex instruments such as calls, spreads, and
straddles. Proctor lost nearly $1 million on this trading alone.
35.

From December 2007 through September 2011, Proctor also channeled over $7

million to his Hong Kong Business Associate's natural resources company. Ofthis amount,
approximately $2.7 million was purportedly for various coal shipping investments;
approximately $2.2 was purportedly for payment of"marketing fees;" and the remaining
balance of $2.1 million was purportedly for payment of various "agent deposit[s]," "collateral,"
and "advance[s]."
36.

In addition, from January 2010 through July 2012, Proctor transferred more than

Case 1:16-cv-00437-UNA Document 1 Filed 06/14/16 Page 7 of 10 PageID #: 7

$3 million to Commercial Acceptance LLC,a Delaware company that he controlled. The
majority ofthose funds were then purportedly used to finance coal trading activities in Asia.
For example, on January 10, 2011, Proctor wired $600,000 from an Atlas bank account to
Commercial Acceptance LLC. Two days later, Commercial Acceptance LLC wired $500,000
to the Hong Kong Business Associate's natural resources company referencing "Indonesian
Coal Trade."
37.

Further, between December 2007 and the end of 2014, Proctor withdrew

approximately $2.8 million from Atlas bank accounts and deposited the funds with two entities
that Proctor personally controlled. Neither company provided any services to Atlas. Proctor
falsely described the transfers as administrative, advisory, and management fees, or bond fees
and advances.
38.

In reality, Proctor spent the $2.8 million that he transferred to these two entities to

benefit himself and his family. Proctor used the funds to make tuition payments for his
children, pay down his mortgage and credit card bills, and generally fund his lifestyle.
39.

During the period from 2007 through 2014, while misusing investor funds,

Proctor returned approximately $4.9 million in principal to investors and paid approximately
$6.3 million to investors in purported interest to maintain the appearance that the investments
were performing as represented.
