FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
Respondent.

On Petition for Review of an Order of the
Securities and Exchange Commission

BRIEF OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION, RESPONDENT
_____________________________________________
INTRODUCTION
Investment advisers must register with the Securities and Exchange
Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80b-1 et seq.,
unless they qualify for one of several exemptions. See Section 203(a), 15 U.S.C.
80b-3(a). This case involves an exemption that is available to any adviser that has
had fewer than fifteen clients during the past twelve months and does not hold

itself out to the public as an investment adviser. See Section 203(b)(3), 15 U.S.C.
80b-3(b)(3). The Act does not specify how to count “clients” for purposes of this
“private adviser exemption.”
The scope of the exemption is ambiguous as applied to advisers to certain
pooled investment vehicles, such as private limited partnerships and similar
entities known as “hedge funds.” Questions have arisen regarding whether an
adviser, through the use of such a vehicle, may avoid registration under the Act on
the theory that it has a single “client”—even where the adviser is effectively
offering its services to fifteen or more persons whose assets are managed through
the pooled vehicle. This issue is particularly significant where an adviser both
offers interests in such a pooled investment vehicle to investors based on the
adviser’s skill and experience as an investment manager, and permits investors to
withdraw their funds on short notice, as would be true in the case of an individual
investment account managed by a registered adviser.
Over a period of many years, the Commission’s staff received numerous
requests for guidance as to the application of the exemption to pooled investment
vehicles. In general, these requests reflected the natural concern that, for purposes
of counting clients under the Act, the proper construction of the statute might well
require an adviser to count as its clients the investors whose assets were brought
2

under management through an investment vehicle operated by the adviser, rather
than counting only the vehicle itself.
In 1985, the Commission adopted a rule to address the uncertainty regarding
this issue. The rule established a safe harbor that allowed advisers to count each
pooled investment vehicle as a single client, so long as the investment advice was
provided based on the objectives of the vehicle rather than the objectives of its
individual investors or owners. See Rule 203(b)(3)-1(b)(3), 17 C.F.R.
275.203(b)(3)-1(b)(3). The Commission recognized in proposing the safe harbor
that “a different approach could be followed in counting clients.” Investment
Advisers Act Release No. 956 (Feb. 22, 1985), 50 Fed. Reg. 8740, 8741 (Mar. 5,
1985).
In light of dramatic changes and growth in the hedge fund market since
1985, and particularly in the past five years, the Commission has now determined
to take a different approach to counting clients in the case of advisers to certain
hedge funds. In the rulemaking on review in this case, commenced after a lengthy
staff study, the Commission withdrew the 1985 safe harbor and adopted
amendments to rules under the Advisers Act to require advisers to “look through”
a pooled investment vehicle and count each investor as a “client” if the vehicle is a
“private fund.” See Registration Under the Advisers Act of Certain Hedge Fund

Advisers, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 2333 (Dec. 2, 2004), 69 Fed. Reg.
72054, 72065 (Dec. 10, 2004) (“Adopting Release”). Private funds, a category of
pooled investment vehicles that encompasses most hedge funds, generally include
entities that engage in securities transactions privately with each of their investors
(because they are excepted from regulation under the Investment Company Act of
1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq., by provisions that preclude the public offering of
their securities); that are marketed on the basis of the skill and expertise of the
investment adviser; and that offer investors a short-term right to withdraw their
assets from management. Id. at 72068-69.
The prior safe harbor, as the Commission stated, had become inconsistent
with the apparent purpose of Section 203(b)(3) to exempt a category of advisers
whose activities were not sufficiently large or national in scope to justify federal
regulation. Id. at 72066-67. The Commission’s action was in response to (i) a
dramatic growth in hedge funds and the impact on markets of trading by hedge
fund advisers, (ii) an increase in fraud involving hedge fund advisers, and (iii) the
broader exposure of smaller, non-traditional hedge fund investors to the risks of
hedge fund investing. Id. at 72058-61.
The rule and rule amendments close a “loophole,” which has arisen under
the Commission’s safe harbor, allowing hedge fund advisers to avoid registration
4

in situations where the assets of hedge fund investors are managed similarly (or in
many instances identically) to the manner in which a registered adviser manages
the assets of clients who directly open accounts with the adviser. Id. at 72068-70.
The Commission was concerned that the objectives of the Advisers Act “would be
substantially undermined if an adviser with more than fifteen clients could evade
its registration obligation through the simple expedient of having those clients
invest in a limited partnership or similar fund vehicle.” Id. at 72068. Not only do
the rule and rule amendments close this loophole but they do so, as the
Commission emphasized, “without imposing burdens on the legitimate investment
activities of hedge funds.” Id. at 72059. The rule and rule amendments do not
regulate the trading or investment strategies of hedge funds themselves; they
regulate certain hedge fund advisers. Id. at 72060. 1/
Petitioners’ challenges to the rule and rule amendments have no merit.
Petitioners’ main argument is that Congress expressed an unambiguous intent in
Section 203(b)(3) that precludes the Commission from adopting the rule and rule
amendments. Petitioners erroneously rely, however, on unwarranted inferences
drawn from the exemptive provisions of a different statute, the Investment

For this reason, petitioners’ pervasive references to the “Hedge Fund Rule”

Company Act, and on a Supreme Court case, Lowe v. SEC, 472 U.S. 181 (1985),
which involved a different provision of the Advisers Act not at issue here. Under
well-settled principles of statutory construction and administrative law, the
Commission had the authority to interpret an ambiguous statutory provision,
Section 203(b)(3), and the Commission’s reasonable interpretation of this
provision is entitled to deference.

COUNTERSTATEMENT OF THE CASE
A.

The Proposed Rule and Rule Amendments

After a year-long study ordered by the Commission, the Commission’s staff
published a report in September 2003 recommending the registration of hedge
fund advisers. See Implications of the Growth of Hedge Funds, Staff Report to the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Sept. 2003), available at
http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/hedgefunds.htm (“Staff Report”). After considering
its staff’s recommendation, on July 20, 2004, the Commission proposed regulatory
action. See Investment Advisers Act Release No. 2266 (July 20, 2004), 69 Fed.
Reg. 45172 (July 28, 2004) (“Proposing Release”).
Recognizing that “[o]ur current regulatory program for hedge funds and
hedge fund advisers is inadequate” because “it relies almost entirely on
enforcement actions brought after the fraud has occurred and investor assets are
gone,” the Commission proposed a rule and rule amendments that would modify
and rescind the 1985 safe harbor as it applied to advisers of “private funds” and
would require advisers to such funds to “look through” and count the investors in
their funds in determining whether they are exempt from registration under the
Act. Id. at 45177, 45182-87. Proposed Rule 203(b)(3)-2 defined a “private fund”
as one (i) excepted from the definition of an investment company under Section
7

3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act; 2/ (ii) that offers
redemption rights of less than two years; and (iii) whose interests are offered to
investors based on the investment advisory skills, ability or expertise of the fund’s
investment adviser. Id. The Commission stated that, by requiring advisers to
private funds to “look through” the funds to count each investor as a client, most
hedge fund advisers would be required to register under the Act, thus extending
the protections of the Act’s registration provisions to these hedge fund investors
and the securities markets in general. Id. at 45177-82.
In response to the Proposing Release, the Commission received letters from
over 160 commenters, including investors, hedge fund and other investment
advisers, trade associations and law firms. See Adopting Release at 72058.

2/

Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act, 15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(1),
excepts from the definition of an “investment company” issuers with fewer
than 100 “beneficial owners” that do not make a public offering of their
securities. Section 3(c)(7), 15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(7), which was added as part
of the 1996 National Securities Markets Improvement Act, Pub. L. No. 104290, 110 Stat. 3416 (1996) (“NSMIA”), excepts from the definition of an
“investment company” issuers that do not make a public offering of their
securities and whose “owners” are exclusively “qualified purchasers.”
“Qualified purchasers” are defined as, inter alia, natural persons who own
at least $5,000,000 in investments. See 15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(51)(A).

B.

The Final Rule and Rule Amendments

On December 2, 2004, the Commission adopted the rule and rule
amendments substantially as proposed. The Adopting Release may be
summarized as follows:
1.

The Need for Regulatory Action
a.

Growth in Hedge Funds and Impact of Hedge Fund
Advisers on the Markets

Hedge funds have grown exponentially since 1985. Id. at 72055-56. From
1999 to 2004, hedge fund assets grew 260 percent, and, in 2003 alone, hedge fund
assets grew over 30 percent. Id. Hedge fund assets already equal over one-fifth of
the amount of assets of mutual funds that invest in equity securities. Id. at 72056.
As a result, hedge fund advisers have become significant participants in the
national securities markets; their trading represents a reported 10 to 20 percent of
the equity trading volume in the United States. Id.
b.

Increase in Fraud Cases Involving Hedge Fund
Advisers

This increased growth and participation of hedge funds in the national
securities markets has been accompanied by an increase in Commission
enforcement actions involving hedge fund advisers. Id. at 72056-57. From 1999
to 2004, the Commission instituted 51 enforcement actions alleging that hedge
9

fund advisers defrauded either their own investors or other market participants in
amounts estimated to exceed $1.1 billion. Id. at 72056. Even though most of
these actions involved hedge fund advisers defrauding their own investors, the
Commission found that hedge fund advisers were “key participants” in the recent
scandals regarding “late trading” and “market timing” of mutual fund shares that
harmed mutual fund investors. Id. 3/ The Commission noted that “the frequency
with which hedge funds and their advisers appear in these cases and continue to
turn up in the [Commission’s] investigations is alarming,” and estimated that
almost 400 hedge funds and 87 hedge fund advisers were involved in these cases.
Id. at 72057.

3/

“Market timing” refers to the practice of “(a) frequent buying and selling of
shares of the same mutual fund or (b) buying or selling mutual fund shares
in order to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing,” both of which “can
dilute the value of the[] shares” of mutual fund shareholders, “disrupt the
management of the mutual fund’s investment portfolio and cause the
targeted mutual fund to incur costs borne by other shareholders to
accommodate frequent buying and selling of shares by the market timer.”
Banc of Am. Cap. Mgmt., LLC, Securities Act Release No. 8538, 2005 WL
310495, at *4 (Feb. 9, 2005). “Late trading” refers to the practice of
“placing orders to buy or sell mutual fund shares after the time as of which a
mutual fund has calculated its [net asset value] (usually as of the close of
trading at 4:00 p.m. ET), but receiving the price based on the prior [net asset
value] already determined as of 4:00 p.m.,” thus allowing “the trader to
profit from market events that occur after 4:00 p.m. but that are not reflected
in that day’s price.” Id. at *5.
10

c.

Broader Exposure of “Retail” Investors to the Risks
of Hedge Fund Investing

The Commission found that, due to three recent developments, “[h]edge
fund investors are no longer limited to the very wealthy,” as a larger segment of
the investing public, including smaller investors, pensioners, and other nontraditional hedge fund investors, has started investing, directly and indirectly, in
hedge funds. Id. at 72057-58. First, some hedge funds are expanding their
marketing activities to attract these non-traditional investors by, for example,
decreasing their minimum investment requirements. Id. at 72057. Second, “funds
of hedge funds,” which make hedge funds available to more non-traditional
investors, have recently developed. Id. Third, a number of public and private
pension funds, universities, endowments, foundations, and other charitable
organizations have begun to invest in hedge funds or have increased their
investments in hedge funds. Id. at 72057-58. 4/
4/

Reports since the Commission adopted the rule confirm that this
“retailization” of the hedge fund industry is, in fact, occurring. See, e.g.,
Jane J. Kim, Hedge Funds Target Smaller Investors, Wall St. J., Apr. 27,
2005, at D1; Jenny Anderson & Riva D. Atlas, If I Only Had a Hedge Fund:
Is This the New Emerald City, or the Road to the Next Crash?, N.Y. Times,
Mar. 27, 2005, at Bus. 1 (“[W]ith the newest funds of funds, investors with
as little as $25,000 to spend can gain entree.”); Matt Ackermann, Banks to
Boost Alternative Investment Options, American Banker-Bond Buyer, Feb.
2005, at 8 (quoting one investment adviser as stating that “The
‘retailization’ of hedge funds is happening now.”).

2.

Registration of Hedge Fund Advisers Will Address the
Need for Regulatory Action.
a.

Compiling Census Information About Certain Hedge
Fund Advisers

Registration under the Advisers Act will provide the Commission the ability
to collect important information that it now lacks. Id. at 72061. As the
Commission noted,
Registered advisers must file Form ADV with us, the data from which
will provide us with information we need to better understand the
operation of hedge fund advisers, to plan examinations, to better
develop regulatory policy, and to provide data and information to
members of Congress and other government agencies.
Id.
b.

Deterring Fraud by Certain Hedge Fund Advisers
Through Commission Examinations

Registration of certain hedge fund advisers will help deter fraud by enabling
the Commission to conduct examinations that “permit us to identify compliance
problems at an early stage, identify practices that may be harmful to investors, and
provide a deterrent to unlawful conduct.” Id. at 72061. While the Commission
acknowledged that registration will not eliminate all fraudulent conduct by hedge
fund advisers, it noted that the prospect of Commission examinations “increases
the risk of getting caught, and thus will deter wrongdoers.” Id.

12

c.

Keeping Unfit Persons from Advising Certain Hedge
Funds

Registration of certain hedge fund advisers will allow the Commission to
screen certain individuals associated with an adviser and thereby to deny
registration if they have been convicted of any felony or other crime bearing on
their fitness to manage investors’ funds or had a disciplinary event subjecting them
to disqualification. Id. at 72063. The Commission considered this authority to be
particularly pertinent to the registration of hedge fund advisers because the
fraudulent schemes in several of the Commission’s enforcement actions involving
hedge fund advisers “appear to have been perpetrated by unscrupulous persons”
who “may have been attracted to hedge funds because they could operate without
regulatory scrutiny of their past activities.” Id.
d.

Requiring Certain Hedge Fund Advisers To Adopt
Compliance Controls

Registration under the Advisers Act also carries the additional benefit of
subjecting certain hedge fund advisers to Rule 206(4)-7, 17 C.F.R. 275.206(4)-7,
which requires registered advisers to adopt compliance controls and procedures
designed to prevent violations of the Act, and to designate a chief compliance
officer. Adopting Release at 72063-64. The Commission found that while the
“development and maintenance of compliance controls involves costs,” these are
13

costs that all registered advisers must bear, including those that are much smaller
and have substantially fewer resources than hedge fund advisers, who commonly
receive a two percent management fee and a performance fee of twenty percent or
more. Id.
e.

Limiting “Retailization”

Registration under the Act also will have the “salutary effect of resulting in
all direct investors in most hedge funds meeting minimum standards of rule 2053, under the Advisers Act, because hedge fund advisers typically charge
performance fees.” Id. at 72064. Rule 205-3, 17 C.F.R. 275.205-3, applies to
registered advisers and provides that each beneficial owner of a private investment
company—one that is excepted from the definition of an “investment company”
under Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act because it has fewer than
100 beneficial owners and does not publicly offer its securities—who pays a
performance fee must have a net worth of at least $1.5 million or have at least
$750,000 of assets under management with the adviser. Thus, an adviser to a
private fund that wishes to charge a performance fee will not be able to market
interests in the fund to “retail” investors. 5/
5/

This concern is not implicated with respect to advisers to “qualified
purchaser” funds, which are exempt from registration under the Investment
Company Act pursuant to Section 3(c)(7) of that Act, because each owner is
14

3.

The Commission’s Authority To Adopt Rule 203(b)(3)-2

Rule 203(b)(3)-2 and the rule amendments were adopted pursuant to the
Commission’s broad rulemaking authority under Sections 206(4) and 211(a) of the
Act. See Adopting Release at 72068. As discussed below (infra pp. 18-38), the
Commission carefully considered and correctly rejected challenges to its authority.
See Adopting Release at 72067-70.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
Under Section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 706, this
Court considers whether an order of the Commission is arbitrary, capricious, an
abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. See AT&T Corp. v.
FCC, 236 F.3d 729, 734-35 (D.C. Cir. 2001). Under Section 213 of the Advisers
Act, 15 U.S.C. 80b-13, the Commission’s findings of fact are conclusive if
supported by substantial evidence. Cf. Nat’l Rural Elec. Coop. Ass’n v. SEC, 276
F.3d 609, 614 (D.C. Cir. 2002). The Commission’s conclusions of law with
respect to the statutes it administers are “binding in the courts unless procedurally
defective, arbitrary or capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary to the
generally required to have investments of at least $5,000,000. See Sections
2(a)(51) and 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, 15 U.S.C. 80a2(a)(51) and 80a-3(c)(7). Section 205, 15 U.S.C. 80b-5, allows an adviser
to enter into a performance fee arrangement with a fund relying on Section
3(c)(7).
15

statute.” United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 227 (2001) (citing Chevron,
U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984)). The Commission’s
reasonable interpretation of a statute it administers is entitled to deference under
Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-45. As discussed infra p. 39, petitioners are incorrect in
arguing (Br. 35 n.10) that the Commission’s interpretation of the private adviser
exemption in Section 203(b)(3) is not entitled to Chevron deference.
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
1.

The Commission had the authority to adopt a rule interpreting the

private adviser exemption in Section 203(b)(3) of the Act. Whether, and in what
circumstances, Section 203(b)(3) requires looking through an entity such as a
private fund has long been an open question. As enacted in 1940, neither the
statute itself nor the legislative history defined the term “client” or otherwise set
forth a method for counting “clients” for purposes of applying the exemption.
Congressional enactments since 1940, as well as a court of appeals decision and
regulatory actions by the Commission and its staff, only confirm this ambiguity.
Petitioners erroneously argue that Section 203(b)(3) precludes a “look
through” method of counting clients. Their resort to dictionary definitions of
“client,” however, ignores the ambiguity inherent in applying Section 203(b)(3) to
pooled investment vehicles, and in fact, confirms that Section 203(b)(3) is open to
16

interpretation. In addition, petitioners incorrectly argue that, because Congress
chose to exempt certain privately-offered investment pools from regulation under
the Investment Company Act, Congress also intended that advisers to such funds
would be exempt from registration under the Advisers Act. Finally, petitioners’
arguments as to the scope of Section 203(b)(3) based on Congressional silence
lack merit.
Petitioners’ extensive reliance on Lowe v. SEC, 472 U.S. 181 (1985), to
attack the Commission’s authority also misses the mark. Lowe involved a
different issue and different statutory provision. Lowe’s discussion of
“personalized” versus “impersonal” advice cannot properly be extricated from the
Court’s consideration of the issue in that case—whether a publisher’s newsletter
that provides “impersonal” advice can be considered a bona fide publication of
general circulation such that the publisher falls within a statutory exclusion to the
definition of an investment adviser under the Act. This distinction is irrelevant to
advisers to “private funds,” which provide advisory services to their investors by
directly managing their assets through the fund vehicle.
2.

The Commission’s interpretation of the private adviser exemption is

reasonable. The Commission found that, in light of recent changes relating to
hedge funds and hedge fund advisers, the safe harbor created in 1985 had become
17

inconsistent with the statutory purpose. The rule and rule amendments reasonably
close a loophole by which hedge fund advisers that provide the same advisory
services to each client could evade registration by simply pooling their investors
into a limited partnership or similar fund vehicle.
Petitioners’ contention that the Commission’s rulemaking creates
conflicting fiduciary duties ignores the Commission’s express statement that the
rule and rule amendments do not create or alter any duties. In addition, petitioners
misplace their reliance on a 1999 report of the President’s Working Group on
Financial Markets, because, as the Commission found, the Working Group was
not entrusted with protecting investors or the securities markets, and much has
changed in the hedge fund industry and the market impact of hedge fund advisers
since 1999. Finally, petitioners’ argument that the rulemaking violated Section
210(c) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 80b-10(c) (prohibiting the disclosure of a client’s
identity except in certain circumstances), should be rejected as waived, and in any
event, lacks merit.
3.

Petitioners’ various procedural arguments are baseless. For example,

the 49-day comment period was not too short; a remark by Chairman Donaldson
did not chill opposition where 80 commenters—including petitioners—opposed
the rule; and the Commission reasonably estimated the costs of compliance.

ARGUMENT
I.

THE COMMISSION HAD THE AUTHORITY TO ADOPT A RULE
INTERPRETING THE SCOPE OF THE PRIVATE ADVISER
EXEMPTION TO REGISTRATION IN SECTION 203(b)(3) OF THE
ADVISERS ACT.
In adopting the rule and rule amendments, the Commission principally

relied on its broad rulemaking authority under Sections 211(a) and 206(4) of the
Act. See Adopting Release at 72068. Section 211(a) of the Advisers Act
authorizes the Commission to “make, issue, amend, and rescind such rules * * * as
are necessary or appropriate to the exercise of the functions and powers conferred
upon the Commission elsewhere in this title,” and, in exercising this authority, to
“classify persons and matters within its jurisdiction and prescribe different
requirements for different classes of persons or matters.” 15 U.S.C. 80b-11(a).
Section 206(4) of the Act authorizes the Commission to adopt rules that are
“reasonably designed to prevent” fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts, 15
U.S.C. 80b-6(4).
Petitioners contend that the Commission’s action exceeded this authority
because the rule and rule amendments contradict what they claim are the “clearly
expressed intentions of Congress” (Br. 2) to foreclose looking through an
investment entity to count individual investors as the adviser’s “clients” for

19

purposes of determining whether the private adviser exemption is available. This
contention regarding the scope of the exemption is without merit.
A.

Congress Left Open the Scope of Section 203(b)(3) with Respect
to the Method of Counting “Clients.”

The language of Section 203(b)(3) does not, as petitioners claim, prohibit
the Commission from directing advisers to “look through” fund vehicles and count
the individual investors in the funds as clients for purposes of applying the private
adviser exemption. Rather, whether (and in what circumstances) Section
203(b)(3) requires looking through an entity has long been an open question.
1.

The Advisers Act, as Adopted and Amended, Does Not
Preclude “Looking Through” a Fund Vehicle for Purposes
of Counting Clients.

Section 203(b)(3), enacted in 1940, provides an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Act for any investment adviser “who during the
course of the preceding twelve months has had fewer than fifteen clients and who
does not hold himself out generally to the public as an investment adviser.”
Investment Advisers Act, § 203(b)(3), Aug. 22, 1940, ch. 686, Title II, 54 Stat.
847, 850 (1940). The statute does not define “client.” Further, the legislative
history of the Advisers Act does not define “client” or otherwise set forth a
method for counting “clients.” Moreover, since hedge funds did not exist until

20

1949 (see Adopting Release at 72069), it is difficult to surmise whether Congress
would have viewed a hedge fund rather than the fund’s investors as the client for
purposes of this exemption. Thus, Section 203(b)(3) is ambiguous as to a method
for counting clients.
Congress has never resolved this ambiguity despite subsequently amending
the Act generally and this provision specifically. For example, Congress amended
Section 203(b)(3) in 1980 to provide that, in the case of a business development
company, “no shareholder, partner, or beneficial owner * * * shall be deemed to
be a client of such investment adviser unless such person is a client of such
investment adviser separate and apart from his status as a shareholder, partner or
beneficial owner.” An Act To Amend the Federal Securities Laws To Provide
Incentives for Small Business Investment, and for Other Purposes, Pub. L. No. 96477, § 202, 94 Stat. 2275, 2290 (1980). 6/ This provision would have been
superfluous if, as petitioners claim, Congress intended that a shareholder, partner,
or beneficial owner of a legal entity could never be counted to determine whether
the exemption applied.
6/

“‘Business development companies’ are entities whose principal activities
are investing in and providing managerial assistance to small, growing
businesses.” Reginald L. Thomas & Paul F. Roye, Regulation of Business
Development Companies Under the Investment Company Act, 55 S. Cal. L.
Rev. 895, 895 (1982).
21

Petitioners criticize (Br. 43-45) the Commission’s reliance on this
amendment to Section 203(b)(3) as “just wrong,” and “disingenuous.” To the
contrary, the 1980 business development provision is the only amendment to the
private adviser exemption that deals directly with how to count clients. That
Congress felt it necessary to indicate who is an adviser’s “client” for counting
purposes demonstrates, regardless of the specific entity at issue, the ambiguity
inherent in applying the exemption. Petitioners point to legislative history (Br. 45)
stating that the amendment should not be construed as suggesting whether
advisers to entities other than a business development company “should or should
not” be regarded as clients for purposes of the exemption. This legislative history
actually supports the Commission’s argument. Unlike petitioners, the
Commission does not contend that the exemption clearly contemplates only one
method of counting clients—nor is the Commission required to make this
showing. Rather, to establish its authority to interpret the scope of Section
203(b)(3), the Commission need only demonstrate that Section 203(b)(3) is
ambiguous. See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-45. Both the 1980 amendment itself
and the legislative history confirm that it is.
Moreover, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has recognized that
the scope of Section 203(b)(3) is open to interpretation. In Abrahamson v.
22

Fleschner, 568 F.2d 862 (2d Cir. 1977), overruled in part on other grounds by
TransAmerica Mortgage Advisors v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11 (1979), the court held that
general partners of limited partnerships investing in securities were investment
advisers under Section 202(a)(11) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 80b-2(a)(11). 568 F.2d at
870-71. The court originally characterized the individual limited partners as the
clients of the general partner, see [1976-77] Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶95,889, at
91,282 n.16, but subsequently withdrew this characterization, 568 F.2d at 872
n.16, leaving open the question of whether the partnership or the individual
partners should be counted as clients for purposes of the exemption. 7/
Finally, in 1960, Congress added Section 208(d) to the Act, which makes it
unlawful for any person “indirectly, or through or by any other person, to do any
act or thing which it would be unlawful for such person to do directly under the
provisions of this [Act], or any rule or regulation thereunder.” An Act To Amend
Certain Provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as Amended, Pub. L.
86-750, § 11, 74 Stat. 885, 887 (1960). As the Commission recognized, this
amendment indicates that “[a]lthough Congress in 1940 may not have anticipated

The court’s original opinion stated, “the general partners * * * were the
investment advisers to the limited partners.” The court’s amended opinion
deleted “to the limited partners.” See Robert Hacker & Ronald Rotunda,

the client counting questions that arose from the development of hedge funds and
other pooled investment vehicles, by 1960 it clearly anticipated that, in certain
cases, enforcement of the Act may require the Commission or courts to ‘look
through’ legal artifices to address the substance of a transaction or relationship.”
Adopting Release at 72069.
In an attempt to counter this demonstration of the ambiguity in the scope of
the private adviser exemption, petitioners argue (Br. 33) that because, as enacted
in 1940, the Act originally provided an additional exemption for advisers “whose
only clients are investment companies,” Congress must not have contemplated
counting individual investors as clients. As the Commission pointed out,
however, “[t]his language does not * * * undermine the Commission’s
interpretation of section 203(b)(3) with respect to counting the number of clients
in a hedge fund.” Adopting Release at 72069 n.171. Although this language may
suggest that Congress intended that, with respect to investment companies, the
legal entity be counted as the client, it does not mean that Congress must have
intended that, with respect to private funds (which are excepted from the definition
of “investment company” under the Investment Company Act), the legal entity be
counted as the client. Id. Moreover, Congress may have exempted advisers to
investment companies from registration for a variety of reasons. For example,
24

Congress could have determined that regulation of advisers to investment
companies under the Advisers Act would not be necessary because investment
companies were to be subject to extensive regulation under the Investment
Company Act, which Congress enacted together with the Advisers Act. Id. That
Congress exempted from registration advisers to extensively-regulated and
publicly-offered registered investment companies does not demonstrate that
Congress intended to exempt from registration advisers to private entities that did
not even exist at the time, are not otherwise regulated, and offer their securities
privately to investors. Further, as noted above, if Congress’s intent were clear in
1940, then the 1980 amendments to Section 203(b)(3) would have been
superfluous.
For the same reason, petitioners’ reliance (Br. 34) on the 1970 amendment
to the Act that removed the registration exemption for advisers to investment
companies and made the private adviser exemption expressly unavailable to them
is misplaced. Petitioners contend that this amendment was necessary only if
Congress understood that an investment company’s investors were not to be
counted as “clients” of the adviser under the Advisers Act. That is incorrect.
Congress could have passed the amendment precisely because the exemption was
ambiguous as to whether a fund’s investors should be counted as the adviser’s
25

clients. Rather than amending the exemption to resolve the ambiguity of the
proper method of counting clients in all circumstances, Congress only resolved the
ambiguity in certain limited situations, leaving the issue open as to the scope of
Section 203(b)(3) in other situations—such as its applicability to hedge fund
advisers. Indeed, the legislative history of this provision disavows any effect of
this amendment on “the existing exemptions from registration for investment
advisers * * * other than those advising investment companies who neither hold
themselves out generally to the public as such nor have 15 or more clients.” H.R.
Rep. No. 91-1382, at 39 (1970). Accord S. Rep. No. 91-184, at 44-45 (1969).
2.

The Commission Has Interpreted the Advisers Act To
Allow “Looking Through” in Certain Circumstances.

Prior to 1985, there was widespread uncertainty regarding the application of
the private adviser exemption to pooled investment vehicles organized as limited
partnerships or limited liability companies—including uncertainty within the
investment adviser community, whose members recognized that the exemption
might well have required “looking through” in certain circumstances. As noted,
the Second Circuit’s original opinion in Abrahamson characterized the individual
limited partners as the clients of the general partner, see [1976-77] Fed. Sec. L.

26

Rep. (CCH) ¶95,889, at 91,282 n.16. 8/ Moreover, the Commission staff received
numerous requests for guidance. In response, the staff issued no-action letters
which resolved the ambiguity in favor of requiring an investment adviser to look
through an entity and count each individual advisee or investor as a separate client
for purposes of applying the private adviser exemption. See Adopting Release at
72067 n.157 (listing no-action letters).
To resolve this uncertainty, in 1985, the Commission created the safe harbor
in Rule 203(b)(3)-1. See Rule 203(b)(3)-1(b)(3), 17 C.F.R. 275.203(b)(3)1(b)(3). The safe harbor allowed advisers to count a legal organization as a single
client so long as the investment advice was provided based on the objectives of the
organization and not on the objectives of individual investors or partners. Id. At
that time, the Commission did not consider it inconsistent with the Act to exempt
advisers to certain pooled investment vehicles from registration. See Investment
Advisers Act Release No. 956 (Feb. 25, 1985), 50 Fed. Reg. 8740, 8741 (Mar. 5,
1985); Adopting Release at 72068. Nonetheless, in proposing the safe harbor, the

rehearing in Abrahamson were pending, that the Commission had not yet
taken a position with respect to whether a partnership should be counted as
a client. Supplemental Brief of the Securities and Exchange Commission

Commission stated that, although it was taking the approach of allowing advisers
to count the fund vehicle as their clients, “a different approach could be followed
in counting clients.” 50 Fed. Reg. at 8741.
Petitioners assert (Br. 24-25) that the Commission’s “different approach” is
contrary to how it treats clients “for all purposes other than determining whether
an adviser to a hedge fund falls within the fewer-than-fifteen-clients exemption
* * * .” Petitioners’ assertion, however, is incorrect. The Commission has, in fact,
required advisers to “look through” a fund vehicle in other circumstances. For
example, since 1985, the Commission has directed advisers to “look through” fund
vehicles to determine whether each investor meets the qualified client criteria to
charge a performance fee. See Rule 205-3(b), 17 C.F.R. 275.205-3(b); Investment
Advisers Act Release No. 996 (Nov. 14, 1985), 50 Fed. Reg. 48556 (Nov. 26,
1985). In addition, the Commission requires advisers to “look through” a fund to
deliver to each limited partner custody account statements for funds and securities
of limited partnerships for which the adviser acts as general partner. See Rule
206(4)-2(a)(3)(iii), 17 C.F.R. 275.206(4)-2(a)(3)(iii); Investment Advisers Act

B.

Petitioners’ Reliance on Dictionary Definitions, Provisions
of the Investment Company Act, and Congressional Inaction
Is Misplaced.

Petitioners advance a number of other erroneous arguments in an
unsuccessful attempt to show that Congress expressed a clear intent with respect
to Section 203(b)(3).
First, petitioners contend (Br. 27), based on dictionary definitions, that
“[t]he term ‘client’ requires no interpretation.” This contention ignores the fact
that, as discussed above, there has long been an open question as to whether, and
in what circumstances, Section 203(b)(3) requires looking through a pooled
investment vehicle. Indeed, as noted above, Congress recognized this ambiguity
when it amended Section 203(b)(3) in 1980. Further, dictionary definitions cannot
be expected to, and do not, address either how clients should be counted or the
definition of client in a situation where, as here, advisory services are provided
through an affiliated vehicle.
In any event, as the Commission correctly recognized, resort to dictionary
definitions confirms that the exemption is open to interpretation. Adopting

(2004); United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U.S. 200, 213
(2001). This is particularly true in the context of the present rule, which is
not premised solely on a construction of the term “client,” but is based on a
reading of the private adviser exemption in Section 203(b)(3) as a whole.
29

Release at 72069 n.172. As the Supreme Court has held, “[t]he existence of
alternative dictionary definitions * * * each making some sense under the statute,
itself indicates that the statute is open to interpretation.” Nat’l R.R. Passenger
Corp. v. Boston & Maine Corp., 503 U.S. 407, 418 (1992). Here, alternative
definitions of the term “client” include “[o]ne who consults a legal advisor in
order to obtain his professional advice or assistance, or submits his cause to his
management,” Webster’s New International Dictionary 502 (2d ed. 1934), as well
as “one who depends on the services of any professional or business man, as a
customer.” Funk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary 500 (1937). An investor
in a hedge fund “submits his cause”—i.e., his money—to the management of the
hedge fund adviser, and, in this manner, also “depends on” the adviser’s “services
* * * as a customer.”
Second, petitioners argue that Congress, in enacting the statutory scheme to
regulate investment companies and advisers, chose not to impose registration
requirements on hedge fund advisers. See Br. 31. See also Br. 9-14, 23, 32. The
fatal flaw in this argument is the assumption that Congress, in providing an
exemption from regulation under a different statute, the Investment Company Act,
intended (solely by implication) to provide an exemption from regulation under
the Advisers Act. See, e.g., Br. 31-32. Thus, petitioners exhaustively demonstrate
30

(Br. 9-12, 31-32) that private investment companies with fewer than 100
beneficial owners are exempt from the Investment Company Act. All this proves,
however, is that hedge funds themselves, to the extent that they are private
investment companies with fewer than 100 beneficial owners, are excluded from
regulation as investment companies by virtue of Section 3(c)(1) of that Act. The
hedge fund adviser rule does not change this. It does not subject any hedge funds
to regulation as investment companies. Indeed, as the Commission emphasized in
the Adopting Release, by requiring registration of advisers to private funds, the
rule does not “require an adviser to follow or avoid any particular investment
strategies,” or “require or prohibit specific investments.” Adopting Release at
72060. The Section 3(c)(1) exclusion in the Investment Company Act, therefore,
does not support petitioners’ contention that Congress intended to exempt advisers
to hedge funds from regulation under the Advisers Act. For the same reason,
petitioners’ reliance (Br. 32) on the Investment Company Act exclusion for
qualified purchasers in Section 3(c)(7) (see supra p. 14 n.5) is misplaced.
Third, petitioners’ main contention (Br. 13-14, 23, 32) appears to be that
Congress codified the safe harbor contained in former Rule 203(b)(3)-1 through
inaction by “not amend[ing] section 203(b)(3) to require hedge fund advisers to
register despite being aware that many hedge fund advisers are advising large
31

pools of money without being registered” and by adding the Section 3(c)(7)
exclusion for qualified purchasers to the Investment Company Act in 1996 in
NSMIA. Br. 23 (quoting the dissenting Commissioners at Adopting Release at
72097-98), 32. Specifically, petitioners contend that Congress added Section
3(c)(7) to the Investment Company Act with the knowledge that “many advisers to
such pools were not registered under the Advisers Act,” and that “allowing them
to continue in their unregistered state was entirely consistent with Congress’s
objective of minimizing regulatory restrictions on such pools of money.” Br. 23.
As petitioners’ argument concedes, Congress did not amend Section
203(b)(3) to clarify how the private adviser exemption should be applied to
advisers to hedge funds (even though, in enacting NSMIA, Congress amended
other provisions in the Advisers Act). Even if there were some indication that
Congress had considered this issue, however, at most Congress can only have
acquiesced in the Commission’s authority to resolve the ambiguity of applying
Section 203(b)(3) in these circumstances—authority that the Commission had, in
fact, exercised in a prior rulemaking. The Supreme Court held in a similar
situation in Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983), that “even an unequivocal
ratification—short of statutory incorporation—of [an agency’s policy choice]
32

would not connote approval or disapproval of an agency’s later decision to rescind
the regulation.” Id. at 45. This is particularly true where, as here, (i) petitioners
rely on Congressional amendment of a different statute, and (ii) even when
Congress had amended Section 203(b)(3), in 1970 and in 1980, the legislative
history indicates that these amendments do not suggest how to apply the
exemption in other circumstances (see supra pp.22, 26). Thus, the Commission
was free to resolve the ambiguity in applying Section 203(b)(3) to hedge fund
advisers by rescinding the 1985 safe harbor and requiring certain hedge fund
advisers to look through.
Further, petitioners’ argument is contrary to other Supreme Court precedent.
The Supreme Court has held that, because “Congressional inaction cannot amend
a duly enacted statute,” such Congressional acquiescence arguments “deserve little
weight in the interpretive process.” Cent. Bank of Denv., N.A. v. First Interstate
Bank of Denv., N.A., 511 U.S. 164, 186-87 (1994) (citation omitted). As a result,
the Court has accepted such arguments only in very limited circumstances. See,
e.g., Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 599-601 (1983) (holding that
Congress ratified an agency’s long-standing position when it failed to enact 13
bills introduced to overturn the agency’s position and, instead, enacted a provision
that adopted this position in a different context); FDA v. Brown & Williamson
33

Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 143-44, 156-57 (2000) (holding that Congress’s
“tobacco-specific legislation has effectively ratified the FDA’s previous position
that it lacks jurisdiction to regulate tobacco” in part because Congress “considered
and rejected bills that would have granted the FDA such jurisdiction”). Here,
however, there is no indication that Congress introduced, considered, or rejected
bills addressing the application of Section 203(b)(3) to qualified purchaser funds
or hedge funds, or even considered the provision’s use of the term “client.”
C.

Petitioners’ Invitation To Extend Lowe v. SEC, Which Dealt With
a Different Statutory Provision, Should Be Rejected.

Petitioners’ extensive reliance (Br. 14-16, 28-30, 35-36) on Lowe v. SEC,
472 U.S. 181 (1985), is a red herring. As the Commission stated, “Lowe involved
a different issue and a different statutory provision—the meaning of the exclusion
from the definition of investment adviser in section 202(a)(11)(D) [of the Advisers
Act] for ‘the publisher of any bona fide newspaper, news magazine or business or
financial publication of general and regular circulation.’” Adopting Release at
72069 n.174 (quoting 15 U.S.C. 80b-2(11)(d)). Lowe did not purport to interpret
“client,” which does not even appear in that section. Lowe dealt only with
publishers. Hedge fund advisers provide services that are on the opposite end of
the spectrum from those of publishers. Publishers give investment advice for a set

34

subscription fee through the general circulation of publications. Thus, they
publish speech that others rely upon to make their own investment decisions. On
the other hand, a hedge fund adviser directly manages the assets of the investors in
the fund, making all strategic investment and trading decisions, usually for a
percentage of the profits that its management generates, without publishing
anything. Indeed, hedge fund advisers effectively cannot publish their advice and
remain unregistered under the Act, because such action could be viewed as
“hold[ing] [themselves] out generally to the public as an investment adviser,” thus
potentially precluding them from claiming exemption from registration under
Section 203(b)(3). 15 U.S.C. 80b-3(b)(3). By no means can Lowe control the
scope of the exemption in Section 203(b)(3).
Lowe held that the publisher of an investment newsletter was excluded from
the definition of an “investment adviser” under the Act because the Court viewed
the newsletter as a “bona fide newspaper, news magazine or business or financial
publication of general and regular circulation.” 472 U.S. at 208-09, 211. In so
holding, the Court avoided the constitutional question whether “an injunction
against the publication and distribution of petitioners’ newsletters” (which the
petitioners characterized as consisting of “impersonal investment advice and

35

commentary”) “is prohibited by the First Amendment.” Id. at 188-89. Lowe also
stated, based on the majority’s interpretation of the Act’s legislative history, that
[a]lthough neither the text of the Act nor its legislative history defines
the precise scope of this exclusion [for publishers of bona fide
publications], two points seem tolerably clear. Congress did not
intend to exclude publications that are distributed by investment
advisers as a normal part of the business of servicing their clients.
The legislative history plainly demonstrates that Congress was
primarily interested in regulating the business of rendering
personalized investment advice, including publishing activities that
are a normal incident thereto. On the other hand, Congress, plainly
sensitive to First Amendment concerns, wanted to make clear that it
did not seek to regulate the press through the licensing of
nonpersonalized publishing activities.
Id. at 204. 10/
This Court should reject petitioners’ attempt to extend Lowe, which does
not discuss or offer any definition of the term “client,” to limit the Commission’s
rulemaking authority to interpret the Act’s use of the term “client” in a separate
and unrelated provision. According to petitioners (Br. 30), the Commission is
prohibited from applying a “look through” method of counting clients because
10/

In criticizing the majority’s use of legislative history, the concurrence in
Lowe noted that the Senate Report “make[s] clear that a personal
relationship between adviser and client is not a sine qua non of an
investment adviser under the statute: the Report states that the Act
‘recognizes that with respect to a certain class of investment advisers, a
type of personalized relationship may exist with their clients.’” Lowe, 472
U.S. at 221 (White, J. concurring) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1775, 76th Cong.,
3d Sess. 22 (1940)) (emphasis in original).
36

“client” is limited to the recipient of personalized advice, and it is the hedge fund
itself—not the individual investors in the fund—that petitioners claim receives
personalized advice. Lowe’s discussion of “personalized” versus “impersonal”
advice, however, is solely for the purpose of determining which type of publishers
fall within the definition of an investment adviser. See Section 202(a)(11)
(defining an “investment adviser” as one who “engages in the business of advising
others, either directly or through publications or writings”) (emphasis added);
Lowe, 472 U.S. at 188-89 (stating the issue before the Court as whether an
“investment adviser” may “be so broadly defined as to encompass the distribution
of impersonal investment advice and commentary in a public market”). It has
nothing to do with an adviser, such as a hedge fund adviser, which clearly falls
within the statutory definition of an investment adviser because it directly
manages a pool of securities. See id. at 191-92 n.31 (one of the functions of
investment advisers is to exercise “‘control over the client’s funds, with the power
to make the ultimate determination with respect to the sale and purchase of
securities for the client’s portfolio’”) (quoting H.R. Doc. No. 477, 76th Cong., 2d
Sess. 13 (1939)); id. at 210 n.57 (noting that it was “significant” to the Court’s
holding, inter alia, that “the Commission has not established that petitioners have
had authority over the funds of subscribers,” or “that petitioners have been
37

delegated decisionmaking authority to handle subscribers’ portfolios or
accounts”). See also Abrahamson, 568 F.2d at 870-71 (the definition of an
investment adviser includes persons who “advise” customers by exercising control
over purchases and sales made with their money); United States v. Elliott, 62 F.3d
1304, 1309-11 (11th Cir. 1996) (relying on Abrahamson in holding that the Elliott
defendants “clearly * * * provided investment advice to their customers, both by
advising them in their choice among * * * investment vehicles and by controlling
the investments underlying those investment vehicles”) (emphasis added).
Once it is established that an adviser—such as petitioner Kimball &
Winthrop here—directly manages a number of investors’ assets sufficient to
render it an “investment adviser” under the Act, Lowe does not direct how to
determine who is the adviser’s “client” for any purpose. Such direct management
of investors’ assets is by no means “impersonal” advice. Lowe does not dictate
that the adviser’s “clients” are only those who have a person-to-person
relationship with the adviser. It is therefore entirely consistent with Lowe to
conclude that, with respect to “private funds” (see infra pp. 42-43), each investor
(often a limited partner in a fund organized as a limited partnership), who is
receiving the same asset management services from the adviser, can be considered

38

the adviser’s “client” for purposes of the Section 203(b)(3) private adviser
exemption.
II.

THE COMMISSION’S INTERPRETATION OF THE PRIVATE
ADVISER EXEMPTION IN SECTION 203(b)(3) IS REASONABLE
AND THEREFORE IS ENTITLED TO CHEVRON DEFERENCE.
Petitioners claim (Br. 35 n.10) that because the Commission’s authority is at

issue in this case, the Commission’s interpretation of the ambiguous Section
203(b)(3) is not entitled to Chevron deference. The Supreme Court has held,
however, that Chevron deference applies to agencies’ interpretations of the
statutes they administer, including those that implicate the agencies’ jurisdiction or
authority. See CFTC v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 844-45 (1986); NLRB v. City
Disposal Sys. Inc., 465 U.S. 822, 829-30 & n.7 (1984). See also Miss. Power &
Light Co. v. Miss. ex rel. Moore, 487 U.S. 354, 381 (1988) (Scalia, J. concurring)
(“[I]t is settled law that the rule of deference applies even to an agency’s
interpretation of its own statutory authority or jurisdiction.”). And this Court has
so held as well. See, e.g., Transmission Access Policy Study Group v. FERC, 225
F.3d 667, 694 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (“the deferential standard of Chevron * * * applies
to an agency’s interpretation of its own statutory jurisdiction”).

A.

The Commission’s Interpretation Is Reasonable.

The Commission reasonably concluded that, to be consistent with the
objectives of the Act, it needed to close a loophole that had arisen due to changed
circumstances since the safe harbor was adopted in 1985. See Motor Vehicle
Mfrs., 463 U.S. at 42 (recognizing that an agency has the authority to change a
prior policy). In adopting the Act in 1940, Congress noted the “national concern”
regarding the impact that investment advisers have on the national securities
exchanges, markets, banking system, and economy. See Section 201, 15 U.S.C.
80b-1. Consistent with this concern, Congress, in Section 203(b)(3), exempted
from registration a category of advisers whose activities were not sufficiently large
or national in scope to justify federal regulation. See Adopting Release at 7206667.
It was reasonable for the Commission to conclude that it would be
inconsistent with the statute to allow advisers to funds that had numerous
investors and whose trading activities were national in scope to escape regulation.
See id. at 72056 (finding that hedge fund advisers are significant participants in
the securities markets as managers of assets and traders of securities, with some
reports estimating that hedge funds represent 10 to 20 percent of the equity trading
volume in the U.S.). As the Commission further noted, under the safe harbor, an
40

adviser with fifteen clients and $100 million in assets under management could
move those client assets into a hedge fund it advises and, because the adviser
would now have one client, withdraw its Advisers Act registration. Id. at 72069.
If those clients’ assets had been managed similarly or identically before and after
they were moved into the hedge fund, the only thing to have changed in this
scenario is the registration status of the adviser, thus undermining the purpose of
the exemption. Id. Indeed, as the Commission pointed out, under the current safe
harbor, an adviser could advise hundreds of investors with hundreds of millions of
dollars in assets under management and still claim exemption from registration.
Id. at 72065 & n.134. As the Commission noted, such use of a legal artifice to
avoid registering under the Act could be viewed as violating Section 208(d) of the
Act, which makes it unlawful for a person “to indirectly * * * do any act or thing
which it would be unlawful for such person to do directly under the provisions of
this [Act] * * * .” Id. at 72069. 11/
11/

Further demonstrating the reasonableness of the Commission’s
interpretation, as the Commission pointed out, the current safe harbor is
inconsistent with Congress’s allocation of regulatory authority between the
Commission and state regulators when it adopted NSMIA in 1996. Id. at
72066. As the Commission explained, through continued application of the
safe harbor, hedge fund advisers are able to manage hundreds of millions of
dollars of client assets and yet be registered only with state regulators even
though NSMIA allocated oversight responsibility for advisers with more
than $25,000,000 of assets under management to the Commission. Id. at
41

There is no merit to petitioners’ argument (Br. 38) that the Commission’s
rulemaking is unreasonable because, according to petitioners, “[t]he Rule itself
provides no explanation for the [Commission’s] change in position based on a
reason involving the adviser-client-security holder relationship itself.” To the
contrary, the rule is reasonably related to the objectives of the Act and is carefully
tailored to require the registration of “those advisers whose activities involving
‘private funds’ most directly suggest the need for registration.” Adopting Release
at 72068. As the Commission stated, the definition of a “private fund” is limited
to those funds that: (i) by definition, engage in securities transactions privately
with each of their investors because they are excepted from the definition of
investment company under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment
Company Act; (ii) offer investors a short-term right of two years or less to
withdraw their assets from management in a manner similar to clients that directly
open an account with an adviser; and (iii) are marketed based on the skills, ability,
and expertise of the adviser to the fund, thereby confirming the direct link between
the adviser’s management services and the individual investors. Id. at 72068-69.
As noted above, the Commission concluded that “[t]he Act’s objectives would be
substantially undermined if an adviser with more than fifteen clients could evade
72066 & n.145.
42

its registration obligation through the simple expedient of having those clients
invest in a limited partnership or similar fund vehicle.” Id. at 72068. The
Commission further stated that “[t]his concern is amplified where the adviser
solicits investments directly in the fund vehicle based on the adviser’s investment
management skills, and offers investors the ability to redeem their assets on a
short-term basis, as they would be permitted to do if they opened an account
directly with the adviser.” Id.
Indeed, the Commission found that a hedge fund adviser “may not treat all
of its hedge fund investors the same,” and that, as a result, “today each account of
a hedge fund investor may bear many of the characteristics of separate investment
accounts, which, of course, must be counted as separate clients for purposes of
section 203(b)(3).” Id. at 72069-70. Specifically, some hedge funds may offer
investors different levels of access to risk and portfolio information, different
lock-up periods, and different fee amounts. Id. at 72069-70 & nn.180-83. The
Commission also found evidence of “side pocket” arrangements, in which a
particular set of assets is segregated to provide different investors with distinct
investment experiences. Id. at 72069-70 & n.183. 12/ Petitioners’ attempt (Br. 39)
12/

The Wall Street Journal recently reported on the widespread existence of
“side letters” in the industry. See Carrick Mollencamp & David Reilly,
Tracking the Numbers/Street Sleuth: Some Big Investors Get to Use the
43

to minimize these findings is unwarranted. It is sufficient that the Commission, in
its expertise, identified the existence of such arrangements and noted their import
to its decision to adopt the rule and rule amendments.
Contrary to petitioners’ erroneous assertion (Br. 45-46), the Commission
did not state that the purpose of the Section 203(b)(3) exemption was to exempt
only advisers to “friends and family.” Rather, the Commission stated that
Congress intended “to create a limited exemption for advisers whose activities
were not national in scope and who provided advice to only a small number of
clients, many of whom are likely to be friends and family members.” Adopting
Release at 72066. See also id. at 72067 (providing “friends and family” as an
example of the type of clients to an adviser “whose activities were not sufficiently
large or national in scope * * * to implicate the policy objectives identified in
section 201 of the Act”). Nor did the Commission create this purpose out of
“whole cloth,” as petitioners claim (Br. 46). The Commission relied primarily on
Section 201 of the Act, which sets forth Congress’s findings establishing the
“national concern” to justify federal regulation of advisers, and reasonably
concluded that Congress must have intended to exempt from registration those

Side Door—During Hedge Fund Boom, Not Everyone Is Equal, Wall St. J.,
Mar. 14, 2005, at C1.
44

advisers who would not implicate this “national concern.” Adopting Release at
72066 n.138. 13/ Petitioners’ claim (Br. 46) that advisers to “friends and family”
would not be subject to regulation under the Act because their advice would not be
given for compensation also is incorrect: there is no reason, in the record or in
common experience, to assume that such advisers necessarily would be providing
gratuitous advisory services. See Philip A. Loomis, Jr., The Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 28 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 214,
246 n.100 (1959) (stating that Section 203(b) was “presumably intended to exempt
a man who advises a few friends and is paid something by them for his trouble”).
B.

Petitioners’ Arguments That the Rule and Rule Amendments
Are Not Reasonable Lack Merit.

First, petitioners argue (Br. 37) that the rule unreasonably creates an
“intractable ethical box,” because it would be impossible for advisers to reconcile
conflicts between duties owed to an entity and duties owed to security holders. As
petitioners acknowledge (Br. 37), however, the Commission stated that the rule
applies only when counting clients for purposes of interpreting the scope of the
13/

While not controlling, the legislative history of Section 3(c)(1) of the
Investment Company Act, as the Commission noted, indicates that Congress
did not consider “privately placed investment companies, owned by a
limited number of investors likely to be drawn from persons with personal,
familial, or similar ties” to “rise to the level of federal interest.” Id. at
72066 n.139.
45

private adviser exemption. The rule does not create any new duties or alter any
duties that otherwise exist. Adopting Release at 72070 & n.187.
Moreover, petitioners assert (Br. 37), based on Lowe, that “it is plainly
unreasonable for the SEC to define as a ‘client’ * * * a person who does not have a
personalized investment relationship with the adviser.” As discussed above
(supra pp. 34-39), petitioners misplace their reliance on Lowe. In any event, in
SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180 (1963), in which the
Supreme Court first recognized the fiduciary duties created by the Advisers Act,
the Court held that an adviser, which published a newsletter and traded securities
in advance of its published advice, owed a fiduciary duty to subscribers to its
newsletter. Id. at 181, 191-93. In addition, the Court in Lowe conceded that
“admittedly” the definition of an investment adviser “is broad enough to
encompass publishers,” but must be read together with the exclusion for bona fide
publications “in order to locate the place where Congress drew the line * * * .”
472 U.S. at 208-09 n.53. The Court indicated that even a publisher of impersonal
newsletters would be an investment adviser under the Act if the newsletters
“contained any false or misleading information,” “were designed to tout any
securities in which [the publisher] had an interest,” or have “been timed to specific
market activity, or to events affecting or having the ability to affect the securities
46

industry.” Id. at 209. If subscribers to an impersonal newsletter can be considered
“clients” of the adviser (and thereby in a fiduciary relationship with the adviser), it
is reasonable to count investors in hedge funds, who have a much more direct
relationship with the hedge fund adviser, as “clients” of the adviser.
Second, petitioners argue (Br. 40) that the Commission’s interpretation is
unreasonable in light of the 1999 report of the President’s Working Group on
Financial Markets which stated that registration of hedge fund advisers “would not
seem to be an appropriate method to monitor hedge fund activity,” and a July 2004
statement by Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that
nothing has changed since the Working Group’s report to warrant a different
conclusion. As the Commission noted, the Working Group’s principal concerns
were the stability of financial markets and the exposure of banks and other
financial institutions to the counterparty risks of dealing with highly leveraged
entities, while the focus of the Advisers Act is on the prevention of fraud against
investors. Adopting Release at 72058 n.43. In addition, the Commission is the
only member of the Working Group entrusted with the role of protecting investors
and overseeing the nation’s securities markets. Id. Moreover, the Commission
found that things had changed since the Working Group’s report was issued in
1999: “the size of the hedge fund industry has doubled, the exposure of investors
47

to hedge funds has broadened, and the incidence of fraud we discover involving
hedge fund advisers has increased.” Id.
Third, petitioners contend (Br. 41, 43) that the rule and rule amendments are
unreasonable because, according to petitioners, two amendments violate the
prohibition in Section 210(c) of the Act against “requiring routine disclosure by an
investment adviser of the identity, investments or affairs of the adviser’s clients.”
Petitioners’ argument concerns: (i) an amendment that deems the records of the
hedge fund to be records of the adviser; and (ii) an amendment that extends a preexisting requirement in Form ADV—that advisers list the name of investmentrelated limited partnerships and limited liability companies to which the adviser
serves as a general partner or manager—to include other “private funds.”
Petitioners have waived this argument by failing to raise it before the
Commission. See Advisers Act Section 213(a), 15 U.S.C. 80b-13(a); KPMG, LLP
v. SEC, 289 F.3d 109, 117 (D.C. Cir. 2002). Here, neither petitioners nor any
other of the 160 commenters raised this point before the Commission, and
petitioners have provided no explanation for their failure to do so.
Moreover, it is not surprising that none of the commenters raised this point
before the Commission, because: (i) a Commission rule allows advisers to
maintain their records by code, rather than by name; and (ii) the Commission
48

amended Form ADV merely to conform with prior practice recognizing that
advisers may use fund vehicles as an instrumentality to provide advisory services.
Thus, petitioners’ argument regarding the rule amendment that deems the
records of a private fund to be records of the adviser is without merit because it
ignores Rule 204-2(d), 17 C.F.R. 275.204-2(d), which was adopted to implement
Section 210(c) and provides that advisers may maintain records that identify
clients by code rather than by name.
Petitioners’ complaint regarding the amendment to Form ADV is also
baseless. This particular amendment is merely a technical and minor amendment
to conform Form ADV with prior practice. An adviser may use a limited
partnership or limited liability company as an instrumentality to provide advisory
services. Section 7.B. of Form ADV was amended in 2000 to require registered
advisers who “are * * * a general partner in an investment-related limited
partnership or manager of an investment-related limited liability company,” to,
inter alia, identify the limited partnership or limited liability company. See
Investment Advisers Act Release No. 1897 (Sept. 12, 2000), 65 Fed. Reg. 57438,
57467 (Sept. 22, 2000) (emphasis in original). No commenters objected to this
change to Form ADV in 2000, and to our knowledge no adviser (other than
petitioners) has asserted that this aspect of the Form violates Section 210(c) since
49

the amendment went into effect. In the amendment at issue here, the Commission
amended Section 7.B to include the inquiry “or do you advise any other ‘private
fund,’ as defined under SEC rule 203(b)(3)-1,” and to require advisers who
provide an affirmative response to this question to complete Section 7.B of
Schedule D for each “other private fund” for which the adviser acts as the general
partner. Adopting Release at 72089 (emphasis added). Thus, the rule minimally
amends Form ADV consistent with the Commission’s recognition of an
investment vehicle as the instrumentality of the adviser. See Proposing Release at
45186.
Finally, even if these rule amendments were found to violate Section 210(c)
of the Act, this would not invalidate the entire rulemaking. The appropriate
remedy would be a remand to the Commission limited to addressing the Section
210(c) issue.
III.

THE COMMISSION DID NOT ACT ARBITRARILY OR
CAPRICIOUSLY IN ADOPTING THE RULE AND RULE
AMENDMENTS.
Petitioners’ arguments (Br. 46-54) that the Commission’s adoption of Rule

203(b)(3)-2 was arbitrary and capricious do not come close to providing a basis
for the Court to set aside the rule. Under this standard, an agency is required to
examine the relevant data and articulate a “rational connection between the facts
50

found and the choice made.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs., 463 U.S. at 43 (citation
omitted). As the Supreme Court has explained, “[t]he scope of review under the
‘arbitrary and capricious’ standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its
judgment for that of the agency.” Id. See also, e.g., Ctr. for Sci. in the Pub.
Interest v. Dep’t of the Treasury, 797 F.2d 995, 1004 (D.C. Cir. 1986).
A.

The Commission’s Decision To Adopt the Rule and Rule
Amendments Was Rational.

In adopting the rule and rule amendments, the Commission examined the
relevant facts and articulated a detailed and rational explanation for its action. As
discussed supra pp. 9-11, the Commission found that a combination of three
factual developments supported increased regulation of hedge fund advisers: (i)
enormous growth in the hedge fund industry and in the impact of hedge fund
advisers on the markets; (ii) an increase in fraud involving hedge fund advisers;
and (iii) broader exposure of non-traditional hedge fund investors to the risks
associated with hedge funds. Adopting Release at 72055-58. The Commission
determined that registration of certain hedge fund advisers will address these
concerns by: (i) serving as a census that will fill the current information gap; (ii)
deterring fraud by giving the Commission the ability to conduct examinations; (iii)
allowing the Commission to screen certain individuals associated with an adviser

51

and thereby to deny registration where appropriate; (iv) requiring certain hedge
fund advisers to adopt compliance controls and procedures, and to designate a
chief compliance officer; and (v) making the net worth requirements in Rule 2053, 17 C.F.R. 275.205-3, applicable to all direct investors in hedge funds that
charge a performance fee. Adopting Release at 72061-64.
B.

Petitioners’s Arguments That the Commission’s Decision
Was Arbitrary and Capricious Are Baseless.
1.

The Commission’s Findings Do Not Contradict the Staff
Report.

Petitioners argue (Br. 47-48) that the Commission’s findings were
“essentially contrary to” the findings of the Staff Report. The Commission, of
course, is not bound by a report by its staff. In any event, petitioners’ assertions
lack merit.
Petitioners assert (Br. 47) that the Staff Report indicated that most of the
industry growth was occurring among institutional investors and found “no
evidence” that “retailization” was, in fact, occurring. Although the Staff Report
indicated that institutional investors were responsible for most of the growth in the
industry and found no evidence of “significant numbers of retail investors
investing directly in hedge funds” id. at 80 (emphasis added), petitioners ignore
the staff’s conclusions that, despite these findings, the lowering of minimum
52

investment requirements, the development of “funds of hedge funds,” and the
growing number of pension funds, universities, endowments, foundations, and
other charitable organizations that invest in hedge funds, could pose some
increased, and potentially inappropriate, risk for retail investors. Id. at 80-83. The
Commission made the same findings in the Adopting Release, in concluding that
the broader exposure of non-traditional hedge fund investors raised the possibility
of increased, and potentially inappropriate, risk that these investors were ill-suited
to bear. Adopting Release at 72057-58. The Commission’s conclusion is a policy
judgment that the Commission—using its expert knowledge—is uniquely
positioned to make. See FPC v. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., 365 U.S.
1, 29 (1961); Domestic Sec., Inc. v. SEC, 333 F.3d 239, 249 (D.C. Cir. 2003).
Petitioners also criticize (Br. 47) the Commission’s reliance on an increase
in fraud involving hedge funds and hedge fund advisers as contrary to the Staff
Report’s conclusion that in 2003 there was no evidence that hedge funds or their
advisers engaged “disproportionately” in fraudulent activity. The Commission did
not contradict the Staff Report’s finding. Rather, the Commission noted that the
Staff Report predates the discovery that hedge funds and their advisers were
involved, with “alarming” frequency, in the late trading and market timing
scandals. Adopting Release at 72056-57, 72062. The Commission also criticized
53

the notion “that the Commission should wait to act until hedge fund frauds do
comprise a disproportionate amount of fraudulent activity.” Id. at 72062.
2.

The Commission Did Not Consider Improper Factors in
Adopting the Rule and Rule Amendments.

Petitioners argue (Br. 48-49) that it was improper for the Commission to
rely upon its concerns regarding growth in the hedge fund industry, an increase in
fraud, and “retailization” in adopting the rule and rule amendments. For example,
again relying on provisions of the Investment Company Act, petitioners argue that:
(i) growth in the hedge fund industry is not a sufficient justification for regulation
because Congress provided the impetus for this growth by adopting Section
3(c)(7) in 1996; and (ii) the Commission cannot consider the danger of
retailization to justify registration of hedge fund advisers because the marketing of
hedge fund interests is not regulated due to the Section 3(c)(1) and Section 3(c)(7)
exemptions under the Investment Company Act. These arguments, however, rest
on the faulty premise (see supra pp. 30-31) that Congress’s exemptions from
regulation of private investment companies under the Investment Company Act
somehow preclude the Commission from requiring certain investment advisers to
register under the Advisers Act.

54

In addition, petitioners claim (Br. 49-50) that the Commission
inappropriately relied on the market timing and late trading scandals (see supra
pp. 9-10 & n.3), and made an “irrational link” between these mutual fund scandals
and hedge fund adviser registration. The rule, however, was not based on any
particular scandal, but on an increase in fraud involving hedge fund advisers
which included, inter alia, their participation in these scandals. Moreover, this
link was rational, because the Commission found hedge fund advisers to be “key
participants” in these scandals, and noted that some “may have been part of a
scheme to defraud mutual fund investors and aided and abetted others in
defrauding them, in violation of federal securities laws.” Adopting Release at
72056, 72062 n.91. Petitioners’ argument also ignores: the deterrent effect that
registration and the possibility of a Commission examination may have on
advisers’ conduct; the Commission’s ability to keep unfit persons from using
hedge funds to perpetrate frauds; and the requirement that registered advisers
adopt compliance policies and procedures, and designate a chief compliance
officer. Id. at 72061-63. For the same reason, petitioners’ related attack (Br. 50)
on the Commission’s ability to deter and detect fraud, pointing to the
Commission’s failure to prevent these scandals, is misguided. The Commission
rejected this argument as unsupported and “as illogical as an assertion that because
55

police officers are unable to prevent or detect all crime, they should be removed
from their beats.” Adopting Release at 72062.
Finally, petitioners make the remarkable argument (Br. 49) that because the
Advisers Act’s anti-fraud provision applies to all advisers—whether registered or
unregistered—“Congress * * * did not give the SEC the authority to impose the
statutory requirement of registration as a method for investigating or deterring
adviser fraud.” Petitioners’ argument ignores Section 206(4) of the Act, which
grants the Commission the authority to adopt rules that are “reasonably designed
to prevent, such acts, practices, and courses of business as are fraudulent,
deceptive, or manipulative.” 15 U.S.C. 80b-6(4). The purpose of the registration
provisions of the Advisers Act clearly includes the deterrence of fraudulent
activity by investment advisers. Congress amended the Act in 1960 to strengthen
the registration provisions and their ability to deter fraud by requiring registered
advisers to maintain certain books and records, and by granting the Commission
the power to conduct routine inspections. See Pub. L. 86-750, § 6, 74 Stat. 886; S.
Rep. No. 1760, at 4 (1960) (“The prospect of an unannounced visit of a
Government inspector is an effective stimulus for honesty and bookkeeping
veracity.”).

56

3.

The Commission Did Not Chill Opposition to the Rule
and Rule Amendments.

Petitioners make a number of unfounded attacks on the process by which
the Commission adopted Rule 203(b)(3)-2 and the rule amendments. Petitioners
first contend (Br. 50-51) that opposition to the rule was chilled because
commenters were given insufficient time to comment on the proposed rulemaking.
Notice of a proposed rulemaking “is adequate if it provides ‘interested persons an
opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data,
views or arguments.’” Omnipoint Corp. v. FCC, 78 F.3d 620, 629 (D.C. Cir.
1996) (quoting 5 U.S.C. 553(c)). The Court has upheld comment periods much
shorter than the 49 days commenters had here after publication in the Federal
Register to consider and comment on the proposed rulemaking. See, e.g., Conn.
Light & Power Co. v. NRC, 673 F.2d 525, 534 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (30 days). See
also Phillips Petroleum Co. v. EPA, 803 F.2d 545, 559 (10th Cir. 1986) (“Courts
have uniformly upheld comment periods of 45 days or less.”). Moreover,
petitioners, who submitted comments, cannot show that they were harmed. See,
e.g., Omnipoint Corp., 78 F.3d at 630.
Petitioners also contend (Br. 51) that Chairman Donaldson discouraged the
submission of evidence by stating that opponents had something to hide, thus

57

(according to petitioners) implying that anyone who opposed the rule “would be
targets of SEC scrutiny” once the rule was adopted. Petitioners’ suggestion that
the Chairman would direct the Commission to retaliate against opponents to the
rule violates the “well-settled presumption of administrative regularity,” pursuant
to which “courts assume administrative officials ‘to be men [and women] of
conscience and intellectual discipline, capable of judging a particular controversy
fairly on the basis of its own circumstances.’” Louisiana Ass’n of Indep.
Producers & Royalty Owners v. FERC, 958 F.2d 1101, 1119 (D.C. Cir. 1992)
(quoting Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 55 (1975)) (alteration in original).
Further, petitioners’ argument is contradicted by the more than 80
commenters—including petitioners—who opposed the rule. See Adopting
Release at 72059. 14/
Petitioners also assert (Br. 51) that the Commission’s Adopting Release
“ominously suggested the same prospect of SEC attention to those who opposed
the rule * * * .” It is, however, logically impossible for a statement in the

14/

Petitioners’ first comment letter mockingly compared the Commission’s
staff to a nursery-rhyme character. See Comment Letter of Phillip Goldstein
(Sept. 10, 2004). Petitioners’ second comment letter attached the Supreme
Court’s decision in Lowe, “so that the Commission’s legal wizards can
familiarize themselves with it.” Comment Letter of Phillip Goldstein (Sept.
25, 2004).
58

Commission’s release, issued when it adopted the rule, to chill opposition to the
rule while it was still under the Commission’s consideration.
4.

The Commission’s Analysis of the Costs of Compliance
with the Rule and Rule Amendments Was Reasonable.

This Court has recognized that a petitioner’s “burden to show error is high”
when challenging an agency’s economic analysis “in the regulation promulgation
process * * * .” Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. EPA, 286 F.3d 554, 563 (D.C. Cir. 2002).
The Commission is entitled to “great deference” in determining “highly complex
and technical matters” within its area of expertise. Domestic Sec., 333 F.3d at
248. See also NRDC, Inc. v. SEC, 606 F.2d 1031, 1058 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (noting
the “inherent uncertainties in quantifying the net cost of gathering and
disseminating information” even “with respect to the SEC’s financial disclosure
requirements, which have been in effect for decades”).
Petitioners argue (Br. 54) that the Commission “vastly understated the costs
of compliance with the registration requirement.” Petitioners complain (Br. 5253) that the Commission improperly accepted estimates that costs would be low
and “ignored” estimates of high costs. To the contrary, the Commission properly
evaluated conflicting evidence and made findings crediting some and rejecting

59

others. “[T]he resolution of conflicting evidence is for the Commission, not the
court.” Domestic Sec., 333 F.3d at 249.
For example, the Commission estimated that the average cost for a hedge
fund adviser to establish a compliance infrastructure would be $20,000 in
professional fees and $25,000 in internal costs. Adopting Release at 72081. The
Commission noted that commenters who challenged these estimates either did not
provide any competing estimates or data, or were estimating for the cost of hiring
a dedicated chief compliance officer, which, as explained below, the Commission
found was not necessary in all circumstances. Id. An agency is not required to
dispute criticisms of its cost-benefit analysis that were unsupported by competing
data or analysis. See Sierra Club v. EPA, 353 F.3d 976, 989 (D.C. Cir. 2004).
The Commission recognized that ongoing costs of compliance would vary
depending on a number of factors, especially firm size. Adopting Release at
72082. The Commission accepted the comments of small hedge fund advisers
who estimated that their annual compliance costs would be approximately
$25,000, but could be as high as $50,000. Id. Again, however, the Commission
noted that “other small firms,” which stated that their fees would be higher, “did
not provide us with quantified estimates.” Id. at 72082 n.338. See Sierra Club,
353 F.3d at 989. The Commission also rejected some commenters’ assertions that
60

there would be substantial costs associated with hedge fund advisers’ responses to
a Commission examination, reasonably determining that the claims of advisers
that they used 160 hours of internal staff time or spent an estimated $300,000 to
$500,000 in out-of-pocket costs in undergoing a Commission examination were
not “representative of our registrants’ experiences * * * .” Adopting Release at
72082. See Domestic Sec., 333 F.3d at 249.
Petitioners also complain (Br. 54), quoting the dissenting Commissioners,
that the Commission “failed to offer any quantitative estimate for the costs
associated with the requirement to have a chief compliance officer.” The
Commission adequately addressed this issue. The Commission explained that the
rule does not require a full-time chief compliance officer, and does not require
advisers to hire a new employee to fill the role. Adopting Release at 72081.
Rather, depending on the size of the firm, the complexity of its compliance
environment, and the qualifications of current staff, the role of chief compliance
officer could be filled in-house. Id. Because firm size is a key factor in this
determination, and because there is not a currently-available comprehensive
database of hedge fund advisers, the Commission was not able to determine how
many advisers would need to hire a new chief compliance officer. Id. Likewise,
the Commission lacked information regarding the costs of shifting responsibilities
61

among staff—which was not provided by commenters challenging the cost
estimates—that would have enabled it to better estimate the costs to smaller firms
of designating a chief compliance officer from existing staff. Id. at 72081-82. 15/
Petitioners also argue (Br. 52) that the Commission should have conducted
a study of the larger hedge fund advisers which are already registered under the
Act. An agency “has wide latitude in determining the extent of data-gathering
necessary to solve a problem.” Allied Local & Reg’l Mfrs. Caucus v. EPA, 215
F.3d 61, 71 (D.C. Cir. 2000). Petitioners do not explain how the lack of such a
study casts a shadow on the Commission’s cost-benefit analysis regarding the
impact of the rule and rule amendments on advisers of all sizes—especially
smaller advisers. As the Commission found, the costs of compliance would vary
greatly depending on a firm’s size and current compliance structure. 16/
15/

Quoting the dissenting Commissioners, petitioners claim (Br. 53) that in
noting that commenters did not provide the Commission with contrary
information, the Commission improperly “shift[ed] responsibility for the
cost-benefit analysis to commenters.” It is not unreasonable, however, for
an agency to indicate that it has imperfect information, note that opponents
of the rule who presumably would have competing information have not
provided any, and make a decision based on the information actually before
the agency. See, e.g., Professional Pilots Fed’n v. FAA, 118 F.3d 758, 765
(D.C. Cir. 1997) (An agency “simply cannot be faulted for failing to explain
away data that are not part of the record.”).

16/

Contrary to another of petitioners’ arguments (Br. 53 n.16), we are unaware
of any precedent that would require the Commission to consider cost
