REGISTERED SECURITIES ASSOCIATION -- REVIEW OF DISCIPLINARY
PROCEEDINGS
Failure to appear for testimony
Insufficient net capital
Failure to file application for approval of material change in business operations
Associated person of member firm failed to appear for on-the-record testimony, allowed
his firm to conduct a securities business with insufficient net capital, and failed to file an
application for approval of a material change in business operations. Held, association’s
findings of violation and imposition of sanctions are sustained.
APPEARANCES:
Robert J. Stumpf, Jr., Esq., of Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton LLP, for Rani T.
Jarkas.
Alan Lawhead, Esq., Andrew Love, Esq., and Gary Dernelle, Esq., for FINRA.
Appeal filed: November 9, 2015
Last brief received: February 17, 2016

2
Rani T. Jarkas (“Jarkas”) has appealed a decision by FINRA’s National Adjudicatory
Council (“NAC”) finding that he failed to appear for on-the-record testimony (“OTR”) on two
occasions in violation of FINRA Rules 8210 and 2010; allowed Global Crown Capital, LLC
(“Global Crown” or the “Firm”), a member firm that he owned and controlled, to conduct a
securities business without maintaining sufficient net capital in violation of NASD Rule 2110
and FINRA Rule 2010; and failed to file an application with FINRA for approval of a material
change to Global Crown’s business operations in violation of NASD Rules 1017 and 2110.1
FINRA barred Jarkas for the first violation. For the latter two violations, FINRA assessed
sanctions but did not to impose them in light of the bar for the first violation.2 FINRA also
ordered that Jarkas pay his proportionate share of hearing costs totaling $5,436.14 and $1,542.02
in appeal costs.3
Jarkas generally contends that he was not required to attend the OTRs and was not
responsible for the Firm’s compliance with the net capital rule. We reject Jarkas’s contentions
and, based upon our independent review of the record, sustain FINRA’s findings of violation,
with one exception, and the sanctions imposed.4
I.
A.

Facts

Jarkas and Global Crown

In 2002, Jarkas founded Global Crown, a registered broker-dealer and investment
adviser, with co-owners who did not participate in the Firm’s business. Jarkas served as Global
Crown’s CEO and was registered with the Firm as a general securities principal. He managed
the Firm and oversaw its finances, bill payments, and outside accountant. Jarkas was also the
broker of record for certain institutional accounts and a small number of retail accounts.
1

The NASD and FINRA conduct rules that apply in this case are those that existed at the
time of the conduct at issue, i.e., 2008 through 2009. NASD Rule 2110 and FINRA Rule 2010
both require that member firms and their associated persons “observe high standards of
commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.”
2

FINRA assessed a two-year suspension and $50,000 fine for allowing the Firm to violate
the net capital rule, and a 30 business-day suspension and $5,000 fine for failing to file an
application for approval of a material change in business operations.
3

Global Crown was not a party to the disciplinary action. FINRA suspended Global
Crown in September 2009 for failing to: file its year-end 2008 audit report; file accurate FOCUS
reports for the third and fourth quarters of 2008 and first quarter of 2009; comply with an
arbitration award or settlement agreement; and comply with FINRA requests for information.
FINRA expelled Global Crown from membership six months later. Global Crown also
voluntarily withdrew its FINRA registration in September 2009.
4

FINRA’s Department of Enforcement did not allege or establish a net capital violation on
one of the seven days for which FINRA found a violation, so we do not sustain FINRA’s finding
as to that specific day. We sustain the FINRA’s findings of violation as to the other six days.
See infra note 10.

3
On June 9, 2003, Jarkas signed Global Crown’s membership agreement with FINRA’s
predecessor, the NASD, undertaking to operate the Firm as an introducing broker-dealer with a
minimum net capital of $50,000.
B.

Global Crown’s Proprietary Trading Activity

Global Crown was not approved under the membership agreement, or any time thereafter
by the NASD or FINRA, to conduct proprietary trading, which requires a minimum net capital of
$100,000 under Rule 15c3-1(a)(2)(iii) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).
Jarkas does not dispute that as the Firm’s CEO, he was responsible for filing an application
under NASD Rule 1017 for approval to engage in activities, such as proprietary trading, that
increased the Firm’s net capital requirement.
Yet without having filed such an application, Jarkas engaged in proprietary trading from
August through September 2008, by opening and holding 30 securities positions in the Firm’s
average price account for multiple business days without allocating them to customer accounts.5
Jarkas eventually liquidated some of the positions for a profit or loss to the Firm and allocated
the remaining positions to customer accounts.6
As a result of Jarkas’s proprietary trading, the Firm’s minimum net capital requirement
increased from $50,000 to $100,000.7 The Firm did not meet that requirement on the following
four days in 2008 on which it conducted a securities business (i.e., effected securities
transactions): (1) on August 27, it had negative $86,606.97 net capital; (2) on August 29, it had
$93,097.89 net capital; (3) on September 29, it had negative $63,892.08 net capital; and (4) on

5

The Firm used the average price account to open securities positions for customers during
the trading day, and then allocate those positions to customers’ accounts by the end of the day,
thereby leaving the account flat. The average price account was designed solely to benefit
Global Crown customers by facilitating customer transactions at reduced commissions and fees.
The Firm’s supervisory procedures required its brokers, including Jarkas, to identify a customer
for each order prior to execution. Jarkas did not comply with that requirement for the 30 trades
at issue.
6

Jarkas does not dispute any of the details about his 30 trades; he contends only that they
should not be deemed proprietary. We find that Jarkas’s 30 trades were, in fact, proprietary for
the reasons discussed below.
7

Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1(a)(2)(iii), 17 C.F.R. § 240.15c3-1(a)(2)(iii) (A broker-dealer
must “maintain net capital of not less than $100,000” if it “effects more than ten transactions in
any one calendar year for its own investment account.”); William K. Cantrell, Exchange Act
Release No. 38570, 1997 SEC LEXIS 990, at *1-2, 12-13 (May 5, 1997) (finding that a brokerdealer that engaged in unauthorized proprietary trading automatically increased its minimum net
capital requirement from $5,000 to $100,000).

4
September 30, it had negative $290,192.03 net capital.8 Jarkas does not dispute these net capital
positions or that his Firm effected securities transactions on these days.
C.

FINRA’s FINOP Examination of Global Crown

In April 2009, while concluding its 2008 routine examination of the Firm, FINRA staff
received a Notice of Levy from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) against Global Crown,
stating that the Firm owed $244,246.07 for its failure to pay payroll taxes for the quarters ended
June and September 2008. FINRA staff commenced a special Financial and Operations
Principal (“FINOP”) examination to determine the impact of the levy on the Firm’s net capital
position. As part of that examination, FINRA staff reviewed the Firm’s FOCUS filings for the
quarters ending December 31, 2008, and March 31, 2009, and discovered that Global Crown had
not recorded its payroll taxes as a liability in its books and records and its corresponding IRS
levy in its net capital computations.
On April 27, 2009, FINRA staff faxed and mailed Global Crown a letter stating that the
Firm “does not appear to be in compliance with the Net Capital Rule” based on the IRS Notice
and the Firm’s most recent FOCUS filing. The letter warned Global Crown that a “firm out of
compliance with the Net Capital Rule is required by the terms of the rule to immediately cease
conducting a securities business.”
That same day, FINRA staff also called Jarkas, who told the staff that he was unaware of
the IRS tax lien and that the Firm would receive a capital contribution within a day to address the
net capital deficiency. On April 28, 2009, Global Crown received a wire transfer of $249,980
from Jarkas’s silent partner and provided documentation of the transfer and a new net capital
calculation to FINRA staff.
FINRA staff then sent Global Crown a series of FINRA Rule 8210 requests for
documents and information that would allow the staff to determine the accuracy of Global
Crown’s net capital computation, including whether the Firm had any unbooked liabilities for
amounts owed to the IRS for periods after the second and third quarters of 2008. The staff sent
the first request on April 28. In response, Global Crown provided some but not all of the
documents requested, and refused to provide the silent partner’s bank statements.
Global Crown blocked FINRA staff from continuing their onsite examination on May 1,
2009. The Firm informed the staff that it would only provide records if FINRA first withdrew its
April 27 letter advising the Firm that it did not appear to be in compliance with the net capital
rule. Despite receiving five subsequent Rule 8210 requests from FINRA, Global Crown
provided very little further information.9

8

In calculating the Firm’s net capital for September 30, 2008, FINRA staff included an
IRS payroll tax liability owed for the tax period ending September 30, 2008, that the Firm had
not included in its net capital calculation. That tax liability is discussed further below.
9

The only documents that the Firm provided were an invoice in response to one of ten
requests in FINRA’s Rule 8210 letter to the Firm dated May 5, and documentation concerning
(continued . . .)

5
Based on the available records, FINRA staff calculated Global Crown’s net capital and
found deficiencies on the following two days in 2009 on which the Firm conducted a securities
business: (1) on March 31, net capital of negative $358,775.31; and (2) on April 27, net capital
of negative $360,704.02.10 FINRA staff included the IRS tax lien discussed above in both
calculations, and two additional IRS tax liens that it had discovered in the latter calculation.11
Jarkas does not dispute these net capital calculations or that his Firm effected securities
transactions on these days. FINRA staff determined that the Firm did not effect securities
transactions on April 28.
D.

Jarkas’s Failure to Appear for On-the-Record Testimony

On October 21, 2009, FINRA staff sent Jarkas a FINRA Rule 8210 request that he appear
for an OTR at FINRA’s San Francisco office on November 11, 2009. The request stated that
Jarkas was “obligated to appear” for the OTR, and that if he was unavailable on November 11,
he must notify FINRA staff “to agree on another mutually acceptable date and time.” The
request warned Jarkas that “[u]nless and until a postponement is agreed to,” he is “still obligated
to appear” on November 11, and that if he failed to appear “he may be subject to an FINRA
disciplinary action and the imposition of sanctions.” It is undisputed that Jarkas did not appear
for the OTR on November 11, and that he and FINRA did not agree on a mutually acceptable
alternative date for the OTR.
On November 12, 2009, FINRA staff sent Jarkas a second Rule 8210 request that he
appear for an OTR at FINRA’s San Francisco office on November 30, 2009. The request
provided the same warnings and instructions as the first Rule 8210 request. It is again
undisputed that Jarkas did not appear for the OTR on November 30, and that he and FINRA did
not agree on an alternative date. The FINRA disciplinary action followed.

Analysis

Standard of Review

We base our findings on an independent review of the record and apply the
preponderance of the evidence standard for self-regulatory organization (“SRO”) disciplinary
actions.12 Under Exchange Act Section 19(e)(1), in reviewing an SRO disciplinary action, we

letter dated May 12.

FINRA found that Global Crown also had a net capital deficiency on April 28, 2009, but
FINRA’s Department of Enforcement alleged that Jarkas caused the Firm to conduct a securities
business without maintaining sufficient net capital on only the six dates discussed above (August
27 and 29, 2008, September 29 and 30, 2008, March 31, 2009, and April 27, 2009).

The two additional liens that FINRA discovered totaled $226,821.37.

determine whether the aggrieved person engaged in the conduct found by the SRO, whether such
conduct violates the relevant SRO rules, and whether such SRO rules are, and were applied in a
manner, consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act.13
B.

Jarkas engaged in the conduct found by FINRA.

We find that Jarkas engaged in the conduct found by FINRA, with one exception noted
below. The preponderance of evidence supports FINRA’s finding that Jarkas engaged in
proprietary trading in August and September 2008 without seeking prior approval from FINRA.
The record demonstrates, and Jarkas does not dispute, that he opened and held 30 securities
positions in Global Crown’s average price account for multiple business days in August and
September 2008 without allocating those positions to customer accounts. By making those
proprietary trades, Jarkas caused the Firm’s minimum net capital requirement to increase to
$100,000. Jarkas, however, did not file an NASD Rule 1017 application with FINRA seeking
approval for the Firm to conduct proprietary trading. Jarkas does not dispute that, as Global
Crown’s CEO, he was responsible for filing that application with FINRA; he did not delegate
that responsibility to anyone else at the Firm.
We also sustain FINRA’s finding that Jarkas was responsible for Global Crown’s
operation of a securities business on six days in 2008 and 2009 on which it had less than the
minimum required net capital, and that Jarkas’s proprietary trading caused the Firm’s minimum
net capital requirement to increase in 2008 to $100,000. Because Jarkas oversaw the Firm’s
finances and made the proprietary trades, he knew or should have known that the Firm’s
minimum net capital requirement had increased and that the Firm did not meet that requirement
on (1) August 27, 2008, when it had negative $86,606.97 net capital; (2) August 29, 2008, when
it had $93,097.89 net capital; (3) September 29, 2008, when it had negative $63,892.08 net
capital; and (4) September 30, 2008, when it had negative $290,192.03 net capital. The record
supports, and Jarkas does not dispute, these net capital positions and that Global Crown
conducted a securities business on these days.
Jarkas also caused the Firm’s failure to pay its payroll taxes for the last three quarters of
2008 and first quarter of 2009. Jarkas oversaw the Firm’s bill payment (including payments to
the IRS) and decided in 2008 to terminate the Firm’s payroll company and instead have the Firm
handle payroll processing internally. Because Jarkas oversaw the Firm’s finances, he knew or
should have known that the Firm did not include its tax liability in its net capital calculations,
and that the Firm had negative $358,775.31 net capital on March 31, 2009, and negative
$360,704.02 net capital on April 27, 2009. The record supports, and Jarkas does not dispute,
these net capital positions and that Global Crown conducted a securities business on these days.14

13
14

15 U.S.C. § 78s(e)(1).

We do not sustain FINRA’s finding that Global Crown conducted a securities business on
April 28, 2009. The preponderance of the evidence in the record does not demonstrate that
Global Crown effected any securities transactions on that day.

7
Finally, we sustain FINRA’s findings that Jarkas failed to appear for two OTRs. As
described above, the evidence in the record supports FINRA’s findings that Jarkas neither
appeared for his OTRs on the two dates that FINRA requested—November 11 and 30, 2009—
nor did he and FINRA agree on a mutually acceptable alternative date for the OTRs.
C.

Jarkas’s conduct violated the FINRA and NASD Rules as found by FINRA.

We sustain all three of FINRA’s findings of violation. We find that Jarkas violated
NASD Rule 2110 and FINRA Rule 2010 by allowing his Firm to conduct a securities business
without maintaining sufficient net capital; NASD Rules 1017 and 2110 by allowing his Firm to
materially change its business operations without filing an application for approval; and FINRA
Rules 8210 and 2010 by failing to appear for two scheduled OTRs.
1.

Jarkas violated NASD Rule 2110 and FINRA Rule 2010 by allowing Global
Crown to conduct a securities business without maintaining sufficient net
capital.

NASD Rule 2110 and FINRA Rule 2010 require that member firms and their associated
persons “observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of
trade.”15 An associated person violates those rules if, among other things, he is responsible for
his firm’s violation of Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1, known as the “net capital rule.”16
Under Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1(a)(2)(iii), a broker-dealer must “maintain net capital of
not less than $100,000” if it “effects more than ten transactions in any one calendar year for its
own investment account.”17 A broker-dealer effects a transaction for its own account when it
holds transactions for multiple business days without allocating them to customer accounts, thus
absorbing the market risk from the transactions; or liquidates positions instead of allocating them
to customer accounts, resulting in a profit or loss to the firm.18 We find that Global Crown
15

FINRA Rule 2010 (“A member, in the conduct of its business, shall observe high
standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.”); FINRA Rule 140(a)
(“Persons associated with a member shall have the same duties and obligations as a member
under the Rules.”). NASD Rules 2110 and 115(a) set forth the same respective provisions as
FINRA Rules 2010 and 140(a).

his firm to conduct a securities business without sufficient net capital); Paul Joseph Benz,
Exchange Act Release No. 51046, 2005 SEC LEXIS 116, at *10 (Jan. 14, 2005) (finding that
firm’s president violated NASD Rule 2110 because he was responsible for his firm’s violation of
the net capital rule). The net capital rule was promulgated under Exchange Act Section 15(c)(3),
15 U.S.C. § 78o(c)(3), which prohibits broker-dealers from effecting any securities transactions
in contravention of Commission rules providing financial responsibility safeguards.
17

17 C.F.R. § 240.15c3-1(a)(2)(iii).

18

See, e.g., Cantrell, 1997 SEC LEXIS 990, at *4-10 (finding that a firm traded for its own
investment account when it held trades in its “error account” for multiple days after they had
(continued . . .)

8
effected the 30 transactions discussed above for its “own investment account” because it held all
of the transactions for multiple business days without allocating them to customer accounts and
liquidated some of those transactions at a profit or loss to the Firm. Global Crown, therefore,
violated the net capital rule by conducting a securities business with less than $100,000 net
capital on four days in 2008: August 27 and 29, and September 29 and 30.
Jarkas was responsible for these net capital violations. He placed the 30 trades that
increased the Firm’s net capital requirements. Because he was responsible for the Firm’s
finances, he knew or should have known that his trading increased the Firm’s net capital
requirement to $100,000, and that the Firm did not meet that requirement on those four days in
August and September 2008.19 Violations of the net capital rule do not require a finding of
scienter.20
Second, Global Crown violated Rule 15c3-1 when it conducted a securities business with
negative net capital on March 31 and April 27, 2009. These violations resulted largely from the
Firm’s failure to pay its payroll taxes for the last three quarters of 2008 and first quarter of 2009.
Jarkas, who oversaw the Firm’s finances and bill payment, decided to terminate the Firm’s
payroll company in 2008, and instead have the Firm handle payroll processing, including the
deposit of payroll tax deduction with the IRS. Jarkas therefore knew or should have known
about the Firm’s failure to deposit the payroll tax deduction and account for that error in its net
capital calculation. As a result, Jarkas was responsible for Global Crown’s net capital violation
on March 31 and April 27, 2009.
We do not sustain FINRA’s additional finding that Jarkas violated NASD Rule 2110 and
FINRA Rule 2010 by allowing Global Crown to conduct a securities business without
maintaining sufficient net capital on April 28, 2009. FINRA’s Department of Enforcement did
not allege in its complaint that Global Crown violated the net capital rule on April 28. In any
event, FINRA staff determined during its examination that the Firm did not conduct a securities
business that day. The net capital rule applies only to those days on which a broker-dealer is

(. . . continued)

been rejected by customers as unauthorized, placing the firm “at risk” until the trades were
liquidated); Carrol P. Teig, Exchange Act Release No. 12812, 1976 SEC LEXIS 809, at *7-8
(Sept. 17, 1976) (finding that where securities refused by a customer were placed in an “error
account” to be sold “at a later time,” the account was, in fact, the broker-dealer’s proprietary
account for purposes of the net-capital rule).

the Firm’s violation [of Rule 15c3-1]. Benz had actual knowledge of the Firm’s net capital

complied with all regulatory requirements.”).

conducting a securities business.21 The Firm, therefore, could not have violated the net capital
rule on April 28.
Jarkas argues that he did not intend to conduct proprietary trading, that the Firm’s FINOP
was responsible for compliance with the net capital rule, that he had no knowledge of the IRS tax
liens, that the net capital violations were technical, and that the Firm’s CCO was responsible for
the day-to-day operations of the firm at the time of the violations. We reject each of Jarkas’s
contentions.
Because intent is not required to violate the net capital rule,22 it is irrelevant whether
Jarkas intended to conduct proprietary trading when he caused the Firm to open and hold the 30
securities positions discussed above. In any event, Global Crown had negative net capital on
three of the four days in 2008 that it violated the net capital rule, and thus would have violated
the rule regardless of whether Global Crown was required to maintain $50,000 in net capital or,
as a result of Jarkas’s proprietary trading, $100,000.
Jarkas contends that the Firm’s FINOP was responsible for determining whether the
Firm’s net capital requirements had changed because of changes in the Firm’s business. Because
Jarkas oversaw the Firm’s finances, he knew or should have known that the Firm had negative
net capital on the days in question. Moreover, it was Jarkas’s own trading that changed the
Firm’s business and he should have recognized the potential regulatory implications of that
trading and, at the very least, alerted the FINOP. As we have stated, “officers of securities firms
bear a heavy responsibility in ensuring that the firm complies with all applicable rules and
regulations,” including “the net capital requirements.”23
Jarkas contends that, to the extent any net capital violations resulted from the IRS tax
liens, he had no knowledge of the liens until FINRA staff contacted him on April 27, 2009, and
he immediately remedied the situation with a capital contribution. Intent is not required to
violate the net capital rule. And even if Jarkas did not know about the IRS liens, he knew about
the Firm’s payroll tax obligation. As discussed, Jarkas oversaw the Firm’s finances and bill

payment, and made the decision to terminate the Firm’s payroll company in 2008. Jarkas knew
or should have known that Global Crown had failed to deposit the payroll tax deduction and, as a
result, that the payroll tax owed was not taken into account when calculating the Firm’s net
capital.
Jarkas contends that any net capital violations were, at most, only “technical” violations,
and that it is not unusual for a firm’s net capital position to fluctuate widely on a daily basis. But
the net capital rule requires “moment-to-moment” compliance,24 and, in any event, the Firm’s
significant net capital deficiencies were not the by-product of daily fluctuations; instead, they
resulted from Jarkas’s proprietary trading and the Firm’s significant tax liabilities.
Jarkas contends that the alleged violations in late August 2008 occurred when he was just
returning to work, on a limited basis, after being diagnosed with a serious medical condition in
March and being incapacitated in July. Jarkas contends that during this time, he had given most
of the day-to-day responsibility for running the Firm to its then Chief Compliance Officer and
General Counsel, Henry Carter. But as FINRA held, Jarkas cannot shift responsibility to Carter
for the Firm’s net capital deficiencies. Jarkas produced no evidence showing that Carter had
access to the Firm’s financial information. To the contrary, the record reflects that Carter had a
very limited role in preparing the Firm’s financial statements and had been restricted from
accessing the Firm’s books and records. And Carter testified that he was restricted from seeing
the information that supported the FOCUS report.
Accordingly, we find that Jarkas violated NASD Rule 2110 and FINRA Rule 2010 by
allowing his Firm to conduct a securities business on six days (August 27 and 29, 2008,
September 29 and 30, 2008, March 31, 2009, and April 27, 2009) without maintaining sufficient
net capital.
2.

Jarkas violated NASD Rules 1017 and 2110 by failing to file an application
with FINRA for approval of a material change in business operations.

NASD Rule 1017 requires member firms to file an application with FINRA for approval
of “a material change in business operations,”25 which includes activities such as proprietary
trading that increase the firm’s net capital requirement.26 A violation of NASD Rule 1017 also
violates NASD Rule 2110.27
Here, Jarkas’s proprietary trading in August and September 2008 increased the Firm’s net
capital requirement to $100,000, and thus caused a material change in Global Crown’s business

operations. Because Global Crown did not first seek approval of the change from FINRA, it
violated NASD Rule 1017. Jarkas was responsible for that violation because, as Global Crown’s
CEO, he was responsible for filing Rule 1017 applications for the Firm.28 Accordingly, we find
that Jarkas violated NASD Rules 1017 and 2110.
3.

Jarkas violated FINRA Rules 8210 and 2010 by failing to appear for two
OTRs.

FINRA Rule 8210 requires associated persons, like Jarkas, to provide FINRA with
information orally, in writing, or electronically, and to testify, if necessary, under oath or
affirmation with respect to any matter involved in an investigation, complaint, examination, or
proceeding.29 An associated person violates Rule 8210 if he fails to provide the information or
testimony requested.30 A violation of Rule 8210 is also a violation of FINRA Rule 2010.31
Here, FINRA sent Jarkas two Rule 8210 requests requiring his appearance at OTRs
scheduled for November 11 and 30, 2009, and Jarkas failed to appear for those OTRs. We
therefore sustain FINRA’s finding that Jarkas violated FINRA Rules 8210 and 2010.
Jarkas contends that he was not required to appear for the scheduled OTRs because the
Firm’s General Counsel, Melvin K. Patterson, obtained a postponement from FINRA.
Specifically, Patterson testified that he called FINRA’s David Lee on or about November 11,
2009, and explained that Jarkas was unavailable for the OTR scheduled for that day because he
was ill, and that it was unclear “when he will be available.” Patterson testified that Lee
responded, “okay,” which Patterson testified that he understood to mean that Jarkas did not have
to appear for the OTR. Jarkas contends that after this conversation, FINRA did not contact him
again until January 2011 when it instituted the disciplinary action.32

Jarkas also claimed on appeal to the NAC that he did not receive FINRA’s Rule 8210
request scheduling the second OTR for November 30, 2009. But that request was sent by U.S.
first class and certified mail to Jarkas’s personal and business addresses of record with FINRA,
and FINRA obtained a signed return receipt confirming that it was received at both addresses.

Lee testified, however, that he had no such conversation with Patterson, and the FINRA
hearing panel “credit[ed] Lee’s testimony over Patterson’s, finding it unlikely that Lee would
simply say ‘okay’ to an open-ended postponement, without documentation of the medical
condition.”33 We find it unlikely that such an important conversation would go undocumented
by either party. Indeed, the record reflects that FINRA staff and Patterson routinely exchanged
letters memorializing their conversations, including those concerning OTRs for other persons at
the Firm. We defer to the hearing panel’s credibility determination, and find no basis to disagree
with that determination or the panel’s decision to credit Lee’s version of events over
Patterson’s.34

The relevant FINRA and NASD Rules are, and were applied in a manner,
consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act.

We find that the relevant FINRA and NASD Rules are, and were applied in a manner,
consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act. FINRA Rule 8210 is the principal means by
which FINRA obtains information from FINRA member firms and associated persons in order to
detect and address industry misconduct.35 The rule therefore is consistent with the purposes of
the Exchange Act, which requires SROs such as FINRA to design rules to protect investors and

(. . . continued)

Jarkas suggests that he did not receive the request for the second OTR because he had
“relocate[ed] to the East Coast.” But the two requests for OTRs were served on Jarkas in
October and November 2009, respectively, and Jarkas testified that he was living in California
until the end of that year. In any event, Jarkas testified that he never updated his address of
record with FINRA. It was Jarkas’s responsibility to update his CRD address of record with
FINRA and FINRA’s service of process on a CRD address generally provides constructive
notice to associated persons. See, e.g., David Kristian Evansen, Exchange Act Release No.
75531, 2015 SEC LEXIS 3080, at *29 (July 27, 2015) (“We reject [respondent’s] claim that the
Rule 8210 requests were deficient because FINRA sent them to his CRD address on record

receive mail at his CRD address on record.”).

the public interest, among other things.36 Here, FINRA found that Jarkas failed to appear for two
planned OTRs, which hampered FINRA’s ability to investigate possible violations of Exchange
Act Rule 15c3-1. Rule 15c3-1 requires registered brokers-dealers to maintain a minimum
amount of net capital to ensure that they maintain sufficient liquid assets to promptly satisfy their
liabilities (such as claims by customers, creditors, and other broker-dealers).37 FINRA applied
Rule 8210 in a manner that was consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act—the
protection of investors—when FINRA requested that Jarkas appear at the OTRs so that it could
continue an investigation of potential net capital violations.
We find that NASD Rule 1017 is consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act
because it requires member firms to file an application with FINRA for approval of “a material
change in business operations.”38 Such material changes raise investor protection concerns.39
As we have stated, “it is in the public interest for [FINRA] to review these changes in its
members’ business structure” so that it can “ensure that its members’ businesses operate in a
manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Act” and “prevent members from
expanding beyond their capabilities to the detriment of the markets and investors.”40 We also
find that FINRA applied NASD Rule 1017 in a manner consistent with the purposes of the
Exchange Act because proprietary trading is the kind of change in business operations that is in
the public interest for FINRA to first approve.41
Finally, we find that NASD Rule 2110 and FINRA Rule 2010, which both require that
member firms and their associated persons “observe high standards of commercial honor and just
and equitable principles of trade,” are consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act because
they reflects the mandate of Exchange Act Section 15A(b)(6). Exchange Act Section 15A(b)(6)
requires, among other things, that FINRA design its rules to “promote just and equitable

legal requirements” and, thus, prohibits dishonest practices even if those practices may not be
illegal or violate a specific rule.43 Therefore, NASD Rule 2110 and FINRA Rule 2010 are
consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act. We also find that FINRA applied NASD
Rule 2110 and FINRA Rule 2010 in a manner consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act.

Sanctions.

Standard of Review

Under Exchange Act Section 19(e)(2), we will sustain a FINRA sanction unless we find
that it is “excessive or oppressive” or imposes an unnecessary or inappropriate burden on
competition.44 As part of this review, we consider any aggravating or mitigating factors45 and
whether the sanctions imposed by FINRA are remedial in nature and not punitive.46 Although
the Commission is not bound by FINRA’s Sanction Guidelines, we use them as a benchmark in
conducting our review under Exchange Act Section 19(e)(2).47
We sustain the sanctions FINRA assessed on Jarkas for all violations: a bar for violating
FINRA Rules 8210 and 2110 for failing to appear for two OTRs; a two-year suspension and
$50,000 fine for violating NASD Rule 2110 and FINRA Rule 2010 for allowing the Firm to
violate the net capital rule; and a 30 business-day suspension and $5,000 fine for violating
NASD Rules 1017 and 2110 for failing to file an application for approval of a material change in
business operations. And we sustain FINRA’s decision to impose only the bar and not the
sanctions assessed for the latter two violations.

B.

The bar imposed for violating FINRA Rules 8210 and 2110
is neither excessive nor oppressive.

Even when an individual has provided a partial response to requests made by FINRA
under Rule 8210, the Guidelines state that a bar is standard “unless the person can demonstrate
that the information provided substantially complied with all aspects of the request.”48 The
Guidelines note further that an adjudicator should “consider suspending the individual in any or
all capacities for up to two years” where mitigation exists.49
The Guidelines identify three “principal considerations” for determining sanctions where
an individual has provided a partial but incomplete response to Rule 8210 requests. They are
(1) the “[i]mportance of the information requested that was not provided as viewed from
FINRA’s perspective, and whether the information provided was relevant and responsive to the
request”; (2) the “[n]umber of requests made, the time the respondent took to respond, and the
degree of regulatory pressure required to obtain a response”; and (3) “[w]hether the respondent
thoroughly explains valid reason(s) for the deficiencies in the response.”50
All three principal considerations weigh heavily in favor of a bar. First, the information
that FINRA sought was important because it concerned the Firm’s compliance with the net
capital rule. The purpose of that rule “is to ensure that a broker-dealer has sufficient liquidity to
protect the assets of its customers and to be able to cover its indebtedness to other brokerdealers.”51 The rule also protects customers and other market participants by enabling firms that
“fall below the minimum net capital requirements to liquidate in an orderly fashion without the
need for a formal proceeding or financial assistance from the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation.”52
Second, FINRA made two requests for Jarkas’ testimony, both of which Jarkas ignored
without responding to FINRA. And third, Jarkas has provided no valid explanation for failing to
respond or attend the OTRs.
Jarkas disputes these latter two findings. He contends that his counsel, Patterson,
obtained a postponement upon calling FINRA staff member, Lee, on or about November 11. But
as discussed above, we defer to the hearing panel’s decision to credit Lee’s testimony that no

Guidelines at 33 (emphasis added). Because Jarkas attended an OTR on March 5, 2009,
during FINRA’s routine examination of the Firm, FINRA considered his subsequent failure to
attend the OTRs during the special FINOP examination to be an incomplete response to requests
made by FINRA under Rule 8210.

16
such conversation with Patterson took place, and Jarkas has provided no evidence, and the record
reflects none, of any attempt to schedule testimony on any postponed date.
Jarkas also alleges a number of mitigating factors that we should consider in evaluating
the sanctions imposed. We find that none of the circumstances or facts identified is mitigating.
Jarkas contends that Patterson provided him with legal advice that he need not attend the
OTRs because in September 2009—after FINRA opened its special FINOP examination but
before FINRA sent the first OTR request—Jarkas withdrew his FINRA registration.53 Patterson
testified that he provided this advice after reviewing Article V, Section 4 of FINRA’s By-laws,
which state that FINRA’s jurisdiction over an associated person continues for two years after the
person ceases to be registered with FINRA, and that the person “shall continue to be subject to
the filing of a complaint” based upon “such person’s failure . . . to provide information requested
by” FINRA while subject to its jurisdiction.54 Patterson testified that the plain language of
Section 4 “seemed to suggest that the jurisdiction of FINRA was that they could file a
complaint” for two years after Jarkas withdrew his registration in September 2009, and that he
relayed this information to Jarkas. Nonetheless, Patterson testified that he advised Jarkas that the
language of Section 4 means that Jarkas did not have to attend the OTR,55 but that Jarkas should
“[b]ear in mind that FINRA may take a different viewpoint.”
It does not appear that Jarkas actually relied on Patterson’s advice as a basis for not
attending the OTRs.56 Rather, Jarkas testified that he “never implied that [he] would never”
Relatedly, Jarkas contends that we should consider that “he was no longer registered”
with FINRA when he participated in the hearing. We do not find his participation in the hearing
to be a mitigating factor, even if he was no longer registered. Jarkas continued to be subject to
FINRA’s jurisdiction. FINRA By-laws, Article V, Section 4(a). And Jarkas’s current
registration status is not an assurance against future misconduct.
53

54

FINRA By-laws, Article V, Section 4(a).

Patterson was wrong. The plain language of Section 4 states the opposite. FINRA Bylaws, Article V, Section 4(a); NASD Notice to Members 99-77, 1999 NASD LEXIS 49, at *5
(Sept. 1999) (stating that FINRA “may request information from, or file a formal disciplinary
action against, persons who are no longer registered with a member for at least two years after
their termination from the member”); Robert Marcus Lane, Exchange Act Release No. 74269,
2015 SEC LEXIS 558, at *68 n.82 (Feb. 13, 2015) (finding that respondents was subject to
FINRA’s jurisdiction where Rule 8210 requests were made within two years after they
terminated their registrations).
56

Although reliance on counsel is not a defense to the Rule 8210 violation itself, it may be
mitigating as to sanctions. Howard Brett Berger, Exchange Act Release No. 58950, 2008 SEC
LEXIS 3141, at *38-40 (Nov. 14, 2008) (“[S]cienter is not an element of a Rule 8210 violation.
An advice-of-counsel claim is not relevant to liability . . . , but instead, only potentially as to
sanctions.”), petition denied, 347 F. App’x 692 (2d Cir. 2009); Guidelines at 6 (listing as
Principal Consideration 7, “[w]hether the respondent demonstrated reasonable reliance on
competent legal or accounting advice”).

17
attend the OTR; he “just wanted to see how we could work it out, if [he] could send something in
writing, if [he] could be on the phone, could [they] postpone it, delay it or what have you.”
We also find that Patterson’s advice—even if Jarkas relied on it—does not mitigate
Jarkas’s conduct because it left open the possibility that FINRA may, in fact, have retained
jurisdiction to require Jarkas’s testimony. Indeed, Patterson’s advice that “FINRA may take a
different viewpoint,” combined with the warnings in FINRA’s Rule 8210 letters that Jarkas “may
be subject to a FINRA disciplinary action and the imposition of sanctions” if he “fail[ed] to
appear,” put Jarkas on notice that there were risks attendant to not appearing for testimony.57
Jarkas then contends that we should consider it mitigating that during the time FINRA
scheduled the OTRs, he “was petrified” about his medical condition and that his medical
condition prevented him from attending the OTRs in November 2009. Although we credit
Jarkas’s assertion that he was under stress at the time of his misconduct, the record does not
reflect that stress or his medical condition affected his decision not to attend the OTRs. Rather,
Jarkas claims that he did not attend the OTRs for the alternative reasons that we rejected above
(i.e., the Firm’s General Counsel had obtained a postponement and advised Jarkas that he need
not attend). Furthermore, the record reflects that at the time, Jarkas was in remission after
receiving treatment for a serious medical condition a year earlier. And while it is true that
Jarkas’s doctors had detected a new serious medical condition in March 2009, that new condition
did not prevent Jarkas from working or traveling internationally that year. Jarkas did not seek
treatment for the new condition until February 2010. In any event, even if an illness prevented
Jarkas from attending the scheduled OTRs, Jarkas was required to notify FINRA staff to agree
on another mutually acceptable date and time. Jarkas failed to do so.58

57

See Toni Valentino, Exchange Act Release No. 49255, 2004 SEC LEXIS 330 at *13-14
(Feb. 13, 2004) (finding that respondent could not claim that she relied in good faith on advice of
counsel not to attend an OTR because when she “registered with NASD, she agreed that she
understood and consented to abide by its rules, including the requirement to provide information
requested by NASD for its investigations,” and NASD warned her in Rule 8210 letters “that
failure to appear could result in disciplinary action against her”).
58

Jarkas suggests that we should consider that he appeared for an OTR in March 2009.
Although the Guidelines list as a mitigating factor “[w]hether the respondent provided
substantial assistance to FINRA in its examination and/or investigation of the underlying
misconduct,” Guidelines at 7, we have repeatedly held that “associated persons do not provide
substantial assistance by fulfilling their obligations to cooperate with [FINRA] investigations.”
Kent M. Houston, Exchange Act Release No. 71589A, 2014 SEC LEXIS 863, at *32 (Feb. 20,
2014); Philippe N. Keyes, Exchange Act Release No. 54723, 2006 SEC LEXIS 2631, at*24
(Nov. 8, 2006) (Respondent’s “cooperation in the [NASD] investigation was consistent with the
responsibilities he agreed to when he became an associated person and does not constitute
substantial assistance.”). Also, the OTR in March related to a different FINRA examination—
not the examination concerning the Firm’s net capital position, and Jarkas’s testimony in March
was not responsive to FINRA’s subsequent Rule 8210 requests concerning the investigation into
the Firm’s net capital position.
(continued . . .)

18
Jarkas also contends that we should consider FINRA’s misconduct in “in shutting down”
the Firm on April 27, 2009, and preventing it from trading “for three and one-half weeks even
after [FINRA] confirmed Global Crown’s receipt of new capital . . . .” But it was Global Crown
that blocked FINRA’s efforts to determine the accuracy of its net capital calculations by
providing incomplete responses to FINRA’s Rule 8210 requests and then refusing to cooperate
altogether. As FINRA later discovered, the Firm continued to lack sufficient net capital even
after it received the $249,980 wire transfer on April 28, 2009, because it had not paid its payroll
taxes for the year prior to the transfer. In any event, even if FINRA had wrongfully suspended
the Firm from trading in April, such conduct would not justify Jarkas’s decision not to attend the
OTRs six months later.
Finally, we conclude that the bar is remedial and not punitive. We have stressed the
importance of Rule 8210 to FINRA’s “obligation to police the activities of its members and
associated persons.”59 Without subpoena power, FINRA “must rely on Rule 8210 to obtain
information from its members necessary to carry out its investigations and fulfill its regulatory
mandate.”60 It is therefore “critically important to the self-regulatory system that members and
associated persons cooperate with [FINRA] investigations.”61 Failure to respond to Rule 8210
requests “impedes [FINRA’s] ability to detect misconduct that threatens investors and ets.”62

(. . . continued)

Relatedly, Jarkas contends that we should consider that he has a “sincere desire to rebuild
[his] relationship with FINRA,” as demonstrated by his participation in the hearing “against
medical advice and even though [he] had not been registered with FINRA for four years.” In the
same vein he says that we should consider his clean disciplinary history and good relations with
FINRA staff before the events at issue. But Jarkas’s appearance and defense of himself in
litigation is not a recognized mitigating factor, and the Guidelines do not consider a clean
disciplinary history to be mitigating. Guidelines, at 6 (“[W]hile the existence of a disciplinary
history is an aggravating factor when determining the appropriate sanction, its absence is not
mitigating.”) (citing Rooms v. SEC, 444 F.3d 1208, 1214-15 (10th Cir. 2006)); E.g., Houston,

stressed the importance of cooperation in [FINRA] investigations . . . . Failures to comply [with
Rule 8210 requests] are serious violations because they subvert [FINRA’s] ability to carry out its
regulatory responsibilities.”).

19
Jarkas’s misconduct was therefore serious, and a bar will protect the public by encouraging
others to respond to Rule 8210 requests completely and in a timely manner.63
Accordingly, we find that the bar imposed on Jarkas is neither excessive nor oppressive
within the meaning of Exchange Act Section 19(e)(2).
C.

The sanctions assessed for the net capital violation
are neither excessive nor oppressive.

For an individual, like Jarkas, who is responsible for his firm’s violation of the net capital
rule, the Guidelines recommend a 30 business-day suspension or, in egregious cases, “a lengthier
suspension (of up to two years) or a bar”; and a fine of $1,000 to $50,000.64 The Guidelines also
identify the following two “principal considerations” for determining the sanction:
(1) “[w]hether the firm continued in business while knowing of deficiencies/inaccuracies or
voluntarily ceased conducting business because of the deficiencies/inaccuracies”; and
(2) “[w]hether respondent attempted to conceal deficiencies or inaccuracies by any means,
including “parking” of inventory and inflating “mark-to-market” calculations.”65
Here, FINRA assessed but did not impose a two-year suspension and $50,000 fine. Even
if FINRA had imposed these sanctions for Jarkas’s violation of NASD Rule 2110 and FINRA
Rule 2010 as a result of Global Crown’s net capital violations, we would not find the sanctions to
be excessive or oppressive. Jarkas knew or should have known that his proprietary trading had
resulted in an increase of the Firm’s net capital requirements, and he knew or should have known
that the Firm was substantially delinquent in paying its payroll taxes. Therefore, Jarkas knew or
should have known that his actions had exposed the Firm and its customers to net capital risk.
Further, Global Crown, under Jarkas’s control, obstructed FINRA’s investigation into its net
capital deficiencies, thereby further exposing its customers to risk. As discussed above, we find
no mitigating factors.
D.

The sanctions assessed for failing to file an NASD Rule 1017 application
are neither excessive nor oppressive.

For an individual, like Jarkas, who is responsible for his firm’s failure to file an
application under NASD Rule 1017, the Guidelines recommend a suspension for up to two years
in “cases involving a serious breach of a restrictive agreement” or a bar in “egregious cases”; and
a fine of $2,500 to $50,000.66 The Guidelines also identify the following three “principal
considerations” for determining the sanction: (1) “[w]hether the respondent breached a material
provision of the agreement”; (2) “[w]hether the respondent breached a provision of the

agreement that contained a restriction that was particular to the firm”; and (3) “[w]hether the
firm had applied for, was in the process of applying for, or had been denied a waiver of a
restriction at the time of the misconduct.”67
Here, FINRA assessed but did not impose a 30 business-day suspension and a $5,000
fine. Even if FINRA had imposed these sanctions, we would not find them to be excessive or
oppressive. Indeed, the sanctions assessed are at the low-end of the recommended range, and
there are no mitigating factors.

Conclusion

We sustain FINRA’s findings that Jarkas violated (1) FINRA Rules 8210 and 2010 by
failing to appear for two OTRs; (2) NASD Rule 2110 and FINRA Rule 2010 by allowing Global
Crown to conduct a securities business with insufficient net capital on August 27 and 29, 2008,
September 29 and 30, 2008, March 31, 2009, and April 27, 2009; and (3) NASD Rules 1017 and
2110 by failing to file an application for approval of a material change in business operations.
We set aside FINRA’s finding that Jarkas violated NASD Rule 2110 and FINRA Rule 2010 by
allowing Global Crown to conduct a securities business with insufficient net capital on April 28,
2009. Also, we sustain the sanctions that FINRA assessed, its decision to impose only one of the
sanctions—a bar from associating with any FINRA member in any capacity—and its order that
Jarkas pay his proportionate share of hearing costs totaling $5,436.14 and $1,542.02 in appeal
costs.
An appropriate order will issue.68
