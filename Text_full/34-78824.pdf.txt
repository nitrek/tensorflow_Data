FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASEAND-DESIST ORDER

Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that ceaseand-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), against Portugal Telecom, SGPS, S.A., now known as
Pharol SGPS, S.A. (“Portugal Telecom” or “Respondent”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Ceaseand-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:

Summary
1.
This financial reporting matter arises out of Portugal Telecom, SGPS, S.A.’s
(“Portugal Telecom”) misleading and inaccurate disclosures regarding its investments in debt
instruments issued by entities of Portuguese conglomerate, Grupo Espirito Santo (“GES”). Banco
Espirito Santo, S.A. (“BES”), one of Portugal Telecom’s largest shareholders, was part of GES.
Portugal Telecom invested in debt instruments issued by Espirito Santo International, S.A. (“ESI”),
a GES entity. After these ESI debt instruments matured in February 2014, Portugal Telecom
invested €897 million in commercial paper issued by Rio Forte Investments, S.A. (“Rio Forte”),
another GES entity.
2.
Portugal Telecom included this Rio Forte commercial paper as part of the operating
assets that it contributed to Oi, S.A. (“Oi”) of Brazil pursuant to the terms of a telecom merger
between Portugal Telecom and Oi. In connection with the merger, the parties had valued Portugal
Telecom’s operating assets to be contributed at 1.75 billion as of December 31, 2013. The
merger was consummated on May 5, 2014. On June 30, 2014, Portugal Telecom disclosed for the
first time that its operating assets included €897 million in short-term commercial paper issued by
Rio Forte. Rio Forte defaulted on the debt in July 2014, resulting in substantial losses and causing
the parties to renegotiate the terms of the merger, with Oi returning the Rio Forte commercial
paper to Portugal Telecom.
3.
Portugal Telecom misrepresented the nature of the short-term investments in its
December 31, 2013 fiscal year end financial statements and also failed to disclose the nature and
extent of the credit risk to which it was exposed at December 31, 2013. In addition, Portugal
Telecom’s internal accounting controls were insufficient at December 31, 2013.

Grupo Espirito Santo (“GES”) is a large Portuguese conglomerate of the Espirito
Santo family. Its numerous entities1 include:
Espirito Santo International, S.A. (“ESI”) is a GES holding company headquartered in
Luxembourg. ESI filed for creditor protection on July 18, 2014.
Rio Forte Investments, S.A. (“Rio Forte”) is a privately held limited liability company
incorporated in Luxembourg. Rio Forte, which is owned 100% by ESI, held and managed
GES’s non-financial investments. Rio Forte filed for creditor protection on July 22, 2014.
Banco Espirito Santo, S.A. (“BES”), one of Portugal Telecom’s three largest
shareholders, previously was Portugal’s second largest bank. It collapsed in the summer of
2014 amid reports of irregularities and received a €4.9 billion bailout from the Portuguese
government. BES had a 10.05% interest in Portugal Telecom at December 31, 2013, while
Portugal Telecom owned a 2.1% interest in BES at December 31, 2013.
Facts
A.

The Oi/Portugal Telecom Merger

7.
In October 2013, Oi and Portugal Telecom announced that they had entered into a
memorandum of understanding in which Oi would acquire Portugal Telecom’s operating assets for
shares in Oi. A final merger agreement was signed on February 19, 2014.
8.
The merger was conditioned upon, among other things, the successful completion
of Oi’s capital raise. Oi issued approximately $6.2 billion of new shares in a global equity offering
in April 2014, including $2.5 billion of shares Oi issued to Portugal Telecom in exchange for
substantially all of Portugal Telecom’s operating assets. Oi’s global offering included $1.2 billion
of shares sold in the U.S. The global offering closed and the merger was consummated on May 5,
2014. Following the merger, Portugal Telecom held a combined direct and indirect interest of
39.7% in Oi.
9.
In connection with the merger, the parties valued Portugal Telecom’s operating
assets to be contributed at 1.75 billion (approximately $2.5 billion) as of December 31, 2013.
However, after the assets were valued but before they were contributed to Oi, Portugal Telecom
invested in €897 million short-term commercial paper issued by Rio Forte, a privately-held GES
holding company that managed GES’s non-financial investments. Portugal Telecom made this
investment in February 2014 when the short-term investments it held at December 31, 2013 in
another GES non-financial holding company, ESI, matured. Portugal Telecom then renewed the
Rio Forte debt when it matured on April 15, 2014 (€847 million) and April 17, 2014 (€50 million).

The various Espirito Santo entities are referred to as GES or the GES entities.

10.
In May and June 2014, several news articles reported concerns regarding the
financial condition of ESI and other GES entities. Then, on June 26, 2014, news outlets reported
that Portugal Telecom had bought Rio Forte commercial paper before Portugal Telecom merged
with Oi. In a June 30, 2014 announcement, Portugal Telecom disclosed for the first time its
investment in the Rio Forte commercial paper. In response to this news, the price at which
Portugal Telecom’s ADSs traded dropped more than 11% between June 27, 2014 and July 1, 2014.
11.
In July 2014, Rio Forte defaulted on the commercial paper and, on July 22, 2014,
filed for creditor protection. Thereafter, Oi and Portugal Telecom renegotiated the terms of the
merger, with Oi returning the Rio Forte commercial paper to Portugal Telecom and Portugal
Telecom surrendering a significant portion of the common and preferred Oi shares it had received
in the merger. As a result of the renegotiation, Portugal Telecom’s direct and indirect interest
declined from 39.7% to 27.5%.2 In January 2015, Oi sold the operating assets it had acquired from
Portugal Telecom.
12.
On August 25, 2014, in a Form 6-K, Portugal Telecom made supplemental and
clarifying disclosures to its December 31, 2013 financial statements. Among other matters,
Portugal Telecom disclosed for the first time that, as of December 31, 2013, its short-term
investments included commercial paper in the total amount of €750 million issued by ESI, an
unrated, non-financial GES holding company. Portugal Telecom also disclosed that the ESI
investment represented 82% of its short-term investments at December 31, 2013. Portugal
Telecom additionally disclosed for the first time the concentration of its cash deposits with BES
and further that it had not implemented an effective investment diversification policy at December
31, 2013.
13.
In August, 2014, Portugal Telecom’s Board engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers
(“PwC”) in Portugal to conduct an independent analysis of Portugal Telecom’s treasury
applications with GES. Portugal Telecom disclosed the results of PwC’s independent analysis in a
Form 6-K filing on January 8, 2015.
B.

Portugal Telecom’s Misleading and Inaccurate Financial Statements

14.
Portugal Telecom’s fiscal year end 2013 consolidated financial statements were
misleading and inaccurate. These financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board, were filed with the SEC on Form 6-K on March 12, 2014 and also included in
Portugal Telecom’s 2013 annual report filed with the SEC on Form 20-F on April 30, 2014.

2

Prior to the merger, Portugal Telecom owned a direct and indirect economic interest of 23.2%
in Oi.

1.

Portugal Telecom’s Mischaracterization of Short-Term Investments

15.
In its 2013 financial statements, Portugal Telecom mischaracterized its short-term
investment in ESI commercial paper. Specifically, in footnote 24 entitled “short-term investments”
to Portugal Telecom’s December 31, 2013 financial statements, Portugal Telecom
mischaracterized its €750 million investment in ESI commercial paper as “debt securities issued by
PT Finance and Portugal Telecom.” This disclosure was misleading and inaccurate because the
debt securities were not issued by Portugal Telecom but rather subscribed to by Portugal Telecom
(or its subsidiary PT Finance). Footnote 24 was also incomplete because it failed to identify the
issuer of the securities – ESI, a GES holding company – and thus did not allow a user of the
financial statements to evaluate the credit risk to which Portugal Telecom was exposed.3
16.
Portugal Telecom corrected this error in its August 25, 2014 supplemental
disclosures by disclosing that the “total amount of Euro 750 million includes debt securities issued
by [ESI].” Portugal Telecom further disclosed that ESI was a “non-financial holding company”
and part of GES.
2.

Portugal Telecom’s Credit Risk Disclosure Failures

17.
Portugal Telecom failed to disclose the nature and extent of the credit risk to which
it was exposed at December 31, 2013, as required by IFRS No. 7, Financial Instruments:
Disclosures. The objective of IFRS No. 7 is to provide information that enables users to evaluate:
(1) the significance of financial instruments for the entity’s financial position and performance; and
(2) the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments to which the entity is exposed
and how the entity manages those risks. As an initial matter, Portugal Telecom did not disclose
that €750 million was invested in commercial paper at December 31, 2013, or that this amount was
concentrated in debt issued by ESI, a non-financial holding company, as discussed above. Portugal
Telecom also failed to disclose information about the credit quality of these financial assets, which
were not rated, as required by IFRS No. 7, ¶ 36(c) (an entity is required to disclose information
about the credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired). As a result,
investors were unable to form an overall picture of the nature and extent of risks arising from these
financial instruments, particularly since the investments in ESI debt represented 82% of Portugal
Telecom’s short term investments and 29% of its short-term investments plus cash and cash
equivalents at December 31, 2013. The ESI debt also represented 40% of Portugal Telecom’s
December 31, 2013 equity.
18.
Portugal Telecom also failed to accurately disclose its objectives, policies, and
processes for managing its exposure to credit risks arising from financial instruments, as required
by IFRS No. 7, ¶ 33 (qualitative disclosures). At December 31, 2013, Portugal Telecom disclosed
in footnote 45.1.3: “Risks related to treasury activities result mainly from the cash deposits on
investments made by [Portugal Telecom and its subsidiaries]. In order to dilute these risks,
3

In contrast, Portugal Telecom disclosed in footnote 24 the identity of the issuers of its other
short term investments at December 31, 2013, which totaled €162 million.
5

Portugal Telecom’s policy is to invest its cash for short time periods, entering in agreements with
reputable financial institutions and diversifying counterparties.” Portugal Telecom’s footnote
45.1.3 disclosure was misleading and inaccurate for several reasons.
19.
First, it had failed to implement effective diversification as of December 31, 2013,
as Portugal Telecom admitted in its August 25, 2014 supplemental disclosures, stating: “With
respect to the information on our policy on investments in cash and short-term investments, as
presented in general terms in the Report and Consolidated Financial Statements…and in particular
the criterion for investments in diversified financial institutions that are reputable in the market, it
should be mentioned that, given the concentration in deposits and treasury applications in
BES/GES, as of December 31, 2013, the Company was not implementing an effective
diversification.” Notably, 82% of Portugal Telecom’s short-term investments and 85% of its cash
and cash equivalents were invested in/deposited with BES/GES entities at December 31, 2013;
nevertheless, Portugal Telecom failed to disclose the magnitude of its aggregate exposure to
BES/GES entities in either its March 12, 2014 Form 6-K or fiscal year end 2013 Form 20-F.4
20.
Second, Portugal Telecom’s short-term investments were not invested for short
time periods. PwC reported that although Portugal Telecom’s investments were always papered as
short-term investment (less than 180 days), the investments were successively rolled over. PwC
concluded that such investments exceeded Portugal Telecom’s own 180-day policy for short-term
investments.
21.
Third, the short-term investments were not invested with a “reputable financial
institution” at December 31, 2013. Rather, the funds were invested in debt issued by ESI, a nonfinancial holding company of GES and, as noted above, the investments were not rated.
C.

Portugal Telecom’s Insufficient Internal Accounting Controls

22.
Portugal Telecom’s internal accounting controls surrounding its investments were
insufficient at December 31, 2013. Contrary to Portugal Telecom’s stated policy to invest its cash
for short time periods and to enter into agreements with reputable financial institutions and
diversified counterparties, Portugal Telecom invested significant amounts of its cash in GES
financial instruments over a period of 14 years beginning in 2001. PwC identified numerous
control issues that allowed these investment policy violations, including the following:


In 2003, Portugal Telecom created a monthly dashboard report entitled “Tableaux de
Bord,” which reflected Portugal Telecom’s financial position at certain points in time.
Although these reports were to be approved by Portugal Telecom’s executive
committee, they were not regularly presented and, when presented, failed to include the
correct description of the issuers of short-term investments (e.g., ESI/Rio Forte) until

Although Portugal Telecom disclosed transactions and balances with its “major shareholders,”
which included BES, in its March 12, 2014 Form 6-K and 2013 Form 20-F, it specifically
excluded from this disclosure outstanding balances related to bank deposits, short-term
investments, such as the ESI debt securities, and financings.
6
4

Portugal Telecom’s then CFO presented a revised report to Portugal Telecom’s
executive committee on July 2, 2014.


In 2004, the executive committee delegated the authority to Portugal Telecom’s CEO
and CFO, among others, to invest surplus treasury amounts by any method that was
legally permitted, with maturities not in excess of 180 days. Although the investments
in GES securities typically were on a short term basis (less than 180 days), the
investments were successively rolled over. As a result, the successive periods during
which money was invested exceeded the established limit of 180 days.



In 2010, Portugal Telecom implemented procedures and internal control mechanisms to
ensure identification, approval, and disclosure of transactions with qualified
shareholders such as BES and their related entities. Such transactions, if over
€100,000, were to be approved only after a prior favorable opinion of its audit
committee had been obtained. Such transactions were further subject to approval by its
board of directors if the aggregate value exceeded €1,000,000. The procedures were
updated in 2011 to exempt transactions undertaken at market terms, although Portugal
Telecom had no procedures to ascertain whether transactions were at market terms. As
a result, transactions with GES entities were never subjected to review by Portugal
Telecom’s audit committee or approval by its board of directors.



Portugal Telecom failed to implement controls and procedures to ensure compliance
with its credit risk management policy, which limited its short-term investments to
reputable financial institutions and diversified counterparties. For example, Portugal
Telecom performed no credit risk analysis before investing in the debt of GES entities.
Portugal Telecom also failed to perform any market consultations.



Many ESI investments were made informally and without evidence concerning who
made the investment decision or who authorized the investment. Moreover, PwC
identified investments in ESI bonds for which term sheets and/or prospectuses were
received only after the investment; for other ESI bonds, supporting documents lacked
relevant information, such as interest rates and maturity dates, or were not signed by the
issuer.



In May 2013, Portugal Telecom issued notes in the aggregate amount of €1,000 million
at a fixed rate of 4.625% and maturing on May 8, 2020, €500 million of which was
used to subscribe to ESI bonds even though Portugal Telecom’s internal policies
authorized the investment of “surplus treasury amounts” only.



Portugal Telecom had no controls in place to assess whether short-term investments
were impaired.

23.
In July and August 2014, Portugal Telecom’s audit committee identified many of
these same weaknesses and further concluded that the company had failed to comply with its own
credit risk management policies regarding diversification and counterparties. Specifically with
7

respect to counterparties, the audit committee found that short-term investments were improperly
made with non-financial holding companies, whose “good market reputation was not adequately
evidenced.” The audit committee also concluded that Portugal Telecom’s internal controls manual
lacked specific procedures relating to investments in short-term securities.
Violations
24.
As a result of the conduct described above, Portugal Telecom violated Section 13(a)
of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-16 thereunder, which require every issuer
of a security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file with the Commission
information, documents, and annual reports as the Commission may require, and mandate that
periodic reports contain such further material information as may be necessary to make the
required statements not misleading.
25.
As a result of the conduct described above, Portugal Telecom violated Section
13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, which requires issuers to make and keep books, records, and
accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and dispositions
of their assets.
26.
As a result of the conduct described above, Portugal Telecom violated Section
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, which requires issuers to devise and maintain a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization; and (ii) transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity generally
accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and to maintain
accountability for assets.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
A.
Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Portugal Telecom cease
and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a),
13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-16 thereunder.
B.
Respondent Portugal Telecom shall, within 10 days of the entry of this Order, pay a
civil money penalty in the amount of $1,250,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for
transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section
21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C.
§3717.
C.

Payment must be made in one of the following ways:
8

(1)

Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which
will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

(2)

Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

(3)

Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United
States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:
Enterprise Services Center

a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Victoria A. Levin, Assistant
Regional Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, Los Angeles
Regional Office, 444 South Flower Street, Suite 900, Los Angeles, California 90071.
D.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor
Action, it shall not argue that it is entitled to, nor shall it benefit by, offset or reduction of any
award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil
penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a
Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that it shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting
the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission’s counsel in this action and pay the amount of the
Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed
an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty
imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action” means a
private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based
on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this
proceeding.
By the Commission.
