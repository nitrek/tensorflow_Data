Open-End Fund Liquidity Risk Management Programs; Swing Pricing; Re-Opening of
Comment Period for Investment Company Reporting Modernization Release
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rule; re-opening of comment period.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission is proposing a new rule and
amendments to its rules and forms designed to promote effective liquidity risk management
throughout the open-end fund industry, thereby reducing the risk that funds will be unable to
meet redemption obligations and mitigating dilution of the interests of fund shareholders in
accordance with section 22(e) and rule 22c-1 under the Investment Company Act. The proposed
amendments also seek to enhance disclosure regarding fund liquidity and redemption practices.
The Commission is proposing new rule 22e-4, which would require each registered open-end
fund, including open-end exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) but not including money market
funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program. The Commission also is proposing
amendments to rule 22c-1 to permit a fund, under certain circumstances, to use “swing pricing,”
the process of adjusting the net asset value of a fund’s shares to effectively pass on the costs
stemming from shareholder purchase or redemption activity to the shareholders associated with
that activity, and amendments to rule 31a-2 to require funds to preserve certain records related to
swing pricing. With respect to reporting and disclosure, the Commission is proposing

1

amendments to Form N-1A regarding the disclosure of fund policies concerning the redemption
of fund shares, and the use of swing pricing. The Commission also is proposing amendments to
proposed Form N-PORT and proposed Form N-CEN that would require disclosure of certain
information regarding the liquidity of a fund’s holdings and the fund’s liquidity risk management
practices. In connection with these proposed amendments, the Commission is re-opening the
comment period for Investment Company Reporting Modernization, Investment Company Act
Release No. 31610 (May 20, 2015).
DATES: The comment period for the proposed rule published June 12, 2015 (80 FR 33589) is
reopened. Comments on this release (Investment Company Act Release No. 31835) and
Investment Company Act Release No. 31610 should be received on or before January 13, 2016.

INTRODUCTION
Daily redeemability is a defining feature of open-end management investment companies

(“open-end funds” or “funds”) such as mutual funds. 2 As millions of Americans have come to
rely on open-end funds as an investment vehicle of choice, the role of fund liquidity management
2

An open-end fund is required by law to redeem its securities on demand from shareholders at a price
approximating their proportionate share of the fund’s net asset value at the time of redemption. Section
22(d) of the Act prohibits a dealer from selling a redeemable security that is being offered to the public by
or through an underwriter other than at a current public offering price described in the fund’s prospectus.
Rule 22c-1 under the Act requires open-end funds, their principal underwriters, and dealers in fund shares
(and certain others) to sell and redeem fund shares at a price determined at least daily based on the current
net asset value next computed after receipt of an order to buy or redeem. Together, these provisions require
that fund shareholders be treated equitably when buying and selling their fund shares. While a money
market fund is an open-end management investment company, money market funds generally are not
subject to the amendments we are proposing (except certain amendments to proposed Form N-CEN) and
thus are not included when we refer to “funds” or “open-end funds” in this release except where specified.
The term “mutual fund” is not defined in the 1940 Act.

6

in reducing the risk that a fund will be unable to meet its obligations to redeeming shareholders
while also minimizing the impact of those redemptions on the fund (i.e., mitigating investor
dilution) is becoming more important than ever. The U.S. fund industry has experienced
significant growth in the last 20 years, 3 markets have grown more complex, and funds pursue
more complex investment strategies, including fixed income and alternative investment
strategies that are focused on less liquid asset classes. Yet, it has been over twenty years since
we have provided guidance regarding the liquidity of open-end funds other than money market
funds. 4
We remain committed, as the primary regulator of open-end funds, to designing
regulatory programs that respond to the risks associated with the increasingly complex portfolio
composition and operations of the asset management industry. Commission staff engaged with
large and small fund complexes to better understand funds’ management of liquidity risk.
Through these outreach efforts our staff has learned that, while some funds and their managers
have developed comprehensive liquidity risk management programs, others have dedicated
significantly fewer resources to managing liquidity risk in a formalized way. We believe
proposing to address these variations in practices is appropriate and that it is in the interest of
funds and fund investors to create a regulatory framework that would reduce the risk that a fund
will be unable to meet its redemption obligations and minimize dilution of shareholder interests
by promoting stronger and more effective liquidity risk management across open-end funds.
We are proposing a set of comprehensive reforms that would provide for: (i) liquidity
3

As of the end of 2014, there were 8,734 open-end funds (excluding money market funds, but including
ETFs), as compared to 2,960 at the end of 1992. See Investment Company Institute, 2015 Investment
Company Fact Book (2015), available at http://www.ici.org/pdf/2015_factbook.pdf (“2015 ICI Fact
Book”), at 177 and 184.

risk management standards that address issues arising from modern portfolio construction; (ii) a
new pricing method that, if funds choose to use it, could better allocate costs to shareholders
entering or exiting the fund; and (iii) fuller disclosure of information regarding the liquidity of
fund portfolios and how funds manage liquidity risk and redemption obligations. To accomplish
this, first, we are proposing new rule 22e-4 under the Act, which would require funds to establish
liquidity risk management programs. Under the proposed rule, the principal components of a
liquidity risk management program would include a fund’s classification and monitoring of each
portfolio asset’s level of liquidity, as well as designation of a minimum amount of portfolio
liquidity, which funds would tailor to their particular circumstances after consideration of a set of
market-related factors established by the Commission.
Second, in order to provide funds with an additional tool to mitigate potential dilution
and to manage fund liquidity, we are proposing amendments to rule 22c-1 under the Act to
permit funds (except money market funds and ETFs) to use “swing pricing,” a process of
adjusting the net asset value of a fund’s shares to pass on to purchasing or redeeming
shareholders more of the costs associated with their trading activity. Lastly, in order to give
investors, market participants, and Commission staff improved information on fund liquidity and
redemption practices, we are proposing amendments to our disclosure requirements and recently
proposed data reporting forms. We discuss these proposals as well as why liquidity management
is so vital to investors in open-end funds and the developments that have led us to this proposal
further below. Taken together, these reforms are designed to provide investors with increased
protections regarding how liquidity in their open-end funds is managed, thereby reducing the risk
that funds will be unable to meet redemption obligations and mitigating dilution of the interests
of fund shareholders. These reforms are also intended to give investors better information with

8

which to make investment decisions, and to give the Commission better information with which
to conduct comprehensive monitoring and oversight of an ever-evolving fund industry.

BACKGROUND
A.

Open-End Funds

Over the past few decades, investors increasingly have come to rely on investments in
open-end funds to meet their financial needs and access the capital markets. Individuals invest in
these funds for a variety of reasons, from investing for retirement and their children’s college
education to providing a source of financial security for emergencies and other lifetime events.
Institutions also invest significantly in open-end funds as part of basic or sophisticated trading
and hedging strategies or to manage cash flows.
There are currently two kinds of open-end funds: mutual funds and ETFs. 5 At the end of
2014, 53.2 million households, or 43.3 percent of all U.S. households owned mutual funds. 6
Mutual funds allow investors to pool their investments with those of other investors so that they
may together benefit from fund features such as professional investment management,
diversification, and liquidity. Fund shareholders share the gains and losses of the fund, and also
share its costs. Investors in mutual funds can redeem their shares on each business day and, by

5

ETFs registered with the Commission are organized either as open-end management investment companies
or unit investment trusts. See section 4(2) of the Act (defining “unit investment trust” as an investment
company which (i) is organized under a trust indenture, contract of custodianship or agency, or similar
instrument, (ii) does not have a board of directors, and (iii) issues only redeemable securities, each of which
represents an undivided interest in a unit of specified securities, but does not include a voting trust). Most
ETFs are organized as open-end management investment companies and, except where specified, when we
refer to ETFs in this release, we are referring to ETFs that are organized as open-end management
investment companies.

law, must receive their pro rata share of the fund’s net assets (or its cash value) within seven
calendar days after delivery of a redemption notice. 7
ETFs also offer investors an undivided interest in a pool of assets. Since 2003, the
number of ETFs traded in U.S. markets has increased by more than 1,200 funds, and the assets
held by ETFs have increased from $151 billion at the end of 2003 to $1.9 trillion at the end of
2014. 8 ETF shares, similar to stocks, are bought and sold throughout the day by investors on an
exchange through a broker-dealer. 9 In addition, like mutual funds, ETFs provide redemption
rights on a daily basis, but, pursuant to exemptive orders, such redemption rights may only be
exercised by certain large market participants – typically broker-dealers – called “authorized
participants.” Authorized participants may purchase and redeem ETF shares at the ETF’s net
asset value per share (“NAV”) from the ETF. 10 When an authorized participant transacts with an
ETF to purchase and sell ETF shares, these share transactions are structured in large blocks
called “creation units.” Most ETFs are structured so that an authorized participant will purchase
a creation unit with a “portfolio deposit,” which is a basket of assets (and sometimes cash) that
generally reflects the composition of the ETF’s portfolio. 11 The ETF makes public the contents

7

See section 2(a)(32) of the Act (defining a “redeemable security” as any security, other than short-term
paper, that entitles its holder to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuer’s current net
assets, or the cash equivalent thereof), and section 22(e) of the Act (providing, in part, that no open-end
fund shall suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the date of payment upon redemption of any
redeemable security in accordance with its terms for more than seven days after tender of the security
absent specified unusual circumstances).

Authorized participants purchase ETF shares at the ETF’s NAV through the ETF’s underwriter or other
service provider.

of the portfolio deposit before the beginning of the trading day. 12 After purchasing a creation
unit, an authorized participant may hold the ETF shares or sell (or lend) some or all of them to
investors in the secondary market.
Similarly, for most ETFs, when an authorized participant wishes to redeem ETF shares, it
presents a creation unit of ETF shares to the ETF for redemption and receives in return a
“redemption basket,” the contents of which are made public by the ETF before the beginning of
the trading day. The redemption basket (which is usually, but not always, the same as the
portfolio deposit) typically consists of securities and a small amount of cash. 13 In addition, while
less common, some ETFs represent to the Commission that they ordinarily intend to conduct all
purchase and redemption transactions with authorized participants in cash instead of an in-kind
basket of assets, and all ETFs reserve the right to transact with authorized participants in cash.
The ability of these authorized participants to purchase and redeem creation units at each day’s
NAV enables authorized participants (or market makers that trade through authorized
participants) to exercise arbitrage opportunities that are generally expected to have the effect of
keeping the market price of ETF shares at or close to the NAV of the ETF. 14

12

See id. at n.20 and accompanying text.

13

See id. at n.21 and accompanying text.

14

For example, if ETF shares begin trading on national securities exchanges at a price below the ETF’s NAV,
authorized participants can purchase ETF shares in secondary market transactions and, after accumulating
enough shares to comprise a creation unit, redeem them from the ETF in exchange for the more valuable
securities in the ETF’s redemption basket. Those purchases create greater market demand for the ETF
shares, and thus tend to drive up the market price of the shares to a level closer to NAV. Conversely, and
again by way of example, if the market price for ETF shares exceeds the NAV of the ETF itself, an
authorized participant can deposit a basket of securities in exchange for the more valuable creation unit of
ETF shares, and then sell the individual shares in the market to realize its profit. These sales would increase
the supply of ETF shares in the secondary market, and thus tend to drive down the price of the ETF shares
to a level closer to the NAV of the ETF share. In each case, the authorized participant (or its market maker
customer) may hedge its exposure to cover the risk from the time the arbitrage opportunity is exercised
through the time it can deliver shares or assets to the ETF, at which time it will unwind its hedge. See ETF
Proposing Release, supra note 9, at nn.25-30 and accompanying text; see also 2015 ETP Request for
Comment, supra note 11, at section I.C.2.

11

Recently, the Commission has also approved exchange-traded managed funds
(“ETMFs”). 15 ETMFs are a hybrid between a traditional mutual fund and an ETF. Like ETFs,
ETMFs would have shares listed and traded on a national securities exchange; directly issue and
redeem shares in creation units only; impose fees on creation units issued and redeemed to
authorized participants to offset the related costs to the ETMFs; and primarily utilize in-kind
transfers of portfolio deposits in issuing and redeeming creation units. Like mutual funds,
ETMFs would be bought and sold at prices linked to NAV and would seek to maintain the
confidentiality of their current portfolio positions. While no ETMF has been launched yet, the
proposed rule and amendments (except the proposed amendments to rule 22c-1) would also
apply to ETMFs to the same extent as to other open-end funds whose shares are redeemable on a
daily basis.
Open-end funds are an attractive investment option for many different types of investors
because they provide diversification, economies of scale, and professional management. They
also facilitate retail investors’ access to certain investment strategies or markets that might be
difficult (if not impossible) or time consuming for investors to replicate on their own. 16

15

See Eaton Vance Management, et al., Investment Company Act Release Nos. 31333 (Nov. 6, 2014) (notice)
(“ETMF Notice”) and 31361 (Dec. 2, 2014) (order). For the purposes of the proposed amendments to rule
22c-1, the definition of “exchange-traded fund” shall include ETMFs.

16

For example, many retail investors would have difficulty investing in certain foreign and emerging market
securities given local requirements for purchasing and holding such securities. In addition, some securities
may only be sold in large blocks that retail investors would be unlikely to be able to purchase. Many retail
investors also may not have the expertise to construct investment strategies followed by, for example,
alternative funds on their own. See also Notice Seeking Comment on Asset Management Products and
Activities, Docket No. FSOC-2014-0001 (“FSOC Notice”); Comment Letter of the Asset Management
Group of SIFMA and the Investment Adviser Association on the FSOC Notice (Mar. 25, 2015) (“SIFMA
IAA FSOC Notice Comment Letter”), at 12 (“Pooled funds provide many individual investors exposure to
asset classes that they could not reach without investing collectively.”); Comment Letter of the Investment
Company Institute on the FSOC Notice (Mar. 25, 2015) (“ICI FSOC Notice Comment Letter”), at 11 (“The
vast majority of [mutual fund] investors would be unable to replicate such investment exposure by directly
holding securities themselves.”).

12

Additionally, open-end funds have become a popular investment vehicle because they may
provide a cost-efficient way for investors to track a benchmark index or strategy. 17
B.

The Role of Liquidity in Open-End Funds
1. Introduction

A hallmark of open-end funds is that they must be able to convert some portion of their
portfolio holdings into cash on a frequent basis because they issue redeemable securities, 18 and
are required by section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act to make payment to shareholders
for securities tendered for redemption within seven days of their tender. 19 As a practical matter,
many investors expect to receive redemption proceeds in less than seven days as some mutual
funds disclose in their prospectuses that they will generally pay redemption proceeds on a
next-business day basis. 20 Furthermore, open-end funds that are redeemed through brokerdealers must meet redemption requests within three business days because broker-dealers are
subject to rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), which
establishes a three-day (T+3) settlement period for security trades effected by a broker or a

17

See e.g., Rick Ferri, Index Funds Gain Momentum (Part 1 of 2), FORBES (July 29, 2013), available at
http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickferri/2013/07/29/index-funds-gain-momentum-part-1-of-2/ (discussing the
growth of passively managed index funds and ETFs that follow indexes).

18

See sections 5(a)(1) and 2(a)(32) of the Act. All other management companies are closed-end (“closed-end
funds”). Closed-end fund shareholders do not have redemption rights and closed-end funds are usually
traded on secondary markets, either on exchanges or over the counter, at prices that may be at a premium or
a discount to the fund’s NAV.

19

Section 22(e) of the Act provides, in part, that no registered investment company shall suspend the right of
redemption or postpone the date of payment upon redemption of any redeemable security in accordance
with its terms for more than seven days after tender of the security absent specified unusual circumstances.

20

See Comment Letter of Fidelity Investments on the FSOC Notice (Mar. 25, 2015) (“Fidelity FSOC Notice
Comment Letter”), at 6 (“mutual funds normally process redemption requests by the next business day”);
see also ICI FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 16, at 17 (“For example, a mutual fund has by law
up to seven days to pay proceeds to redeeming investors, although as a matter of practice funds typically
pay proceeds within one to two days of a redemption request.”).

13

dealer. 21 Given the statutory and regulatory requirements for meeting redemption requests, as
well as any disclosure made to investors regarding payment of redemption proceeds, a mutual
fund must adequately manage the liquidity of its portfolio so that redemption requests can be
satisfied in a timely manner. 22
Sufficient liquidity of ETF portfolio positions also is important. ETFs typically make
in-kind redemptions of creation units, which can mitigate liquidity concerns for ETFs compared
to mutual funds, if the in-kind redemptions are of a representative basket of the ETF’s portfolio
assets that do not alter the ETF’s liquidity profile. 23 However, transferring illiquid instruments to
the redeeming authorized participants could result in a liquidity cost to the authorized participant
or any of its clients, which would then be reflected in the bid-ask spread and ultimately impact
investors. Moreover, declining liquidity in an ETF’s basket assets could affect the ability of an
authorized participant or any of its clients to readily assemble the basket for purchases of
creation units and to sell securities received upon redemption of creation units. 24

17 CFR 240.15c6-1. In a 1995 staff no-action letter, the Division of Investment Management expressed the
view that because rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act applies to broker-dealers and does not apply directly
to funds, the implementation of T+3 pursuant to rule 15c6-1 did not change the standards for determining
liquidity, which were based on the requirements of section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act. The
Division noted, however, that as a practical matter, many funds have to meet redemption requests within
three business days because a broker-dealer is often involved in the redemption process. See Letter from
Jack W. Murphy, Associate Director and Chief Counsel, Division of Investment Management, SEC, to Paul
Schott Stevens, General Counsel, Investment Company Institute (May 26, 1995), available at

In addition, a significant amount of illiquid securities in an ETF’s portfolio can make
arbitrage opportunities more difficult to evaluate because it would be difficult for market makers
to price, trade, and hedge their exposure to, the ETF. 25 The effective functioning of this arbitrage
mechanism has been pivotal to the operation of ETFs and to the Commission’s approval of
exemptions that allow their operation. 26 The liquidity of the ETF’s portfolio positions is a factor
that contributes to the effective functioning of the ETF’s arbitrage mechanism and the ETF
shares trading at a price that is at or close to the NAV of the ETF. 27
If authorized participants are unwilling or unable to trade ETF shares in the primary
market, and the majority of trading takes place among investors in the secondary market, the
ETF’s shares may trade at a significant premium or a discount to the value of the ETF’s

secondary price at or close to NAV would not function effectively. In a period of significant
decline in market liquidity, this could cause the ETF, in effect, to function more like a closed-end
investment company, potentially frustrating the expectations of secondary market investors. 29 In

market sell-off, “leading to outsize losses for investors who entered sell orders at the depth of the panic”).
We recognize that not all changes in market liquidity can lead to such extreme results. In many cases of
day-to-day price volatility and fluctuations in liquidity, market participants will simply demand greater
compensation for purchasing less liquid or more volatile assets. However, declining liquidity can become
so acute that market makers and investors begin to refrain from conducting transactions. See, e.g., Carrie
Driebusch et al., The Problem with ETFs, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (Sept. 14, 2015) (stating that the
“trading turmoil of Aug. 24 disrupted the arbitrage activity in which traders buy and sell ETFs and their
components to take advantage of price discrepancies.”).

29

See, e.g., Matthew Tucker & Stephen Laipply, “Fixed Income ETFs and the Corporate Bond Liquidity
Challenge” (2014), available at http://www.ishares.com/us/literature/brochure/blackrock-ish-fixed-incomeetfs-wp-prd-814.pdf, at 9 (“It should be noted that, although fixed income ETFs have created an
incremental source of bond market liquidity for investors, the ETF structure itself remains dependent on the
liquidity of the underlying bond market. ETFs serve as efficient risk transfer vehicles because the value at
which they trade is reflective of the value of the underlying bonds held within the ETF. If a true and
actionable value discrepancy between the ETF and its underlying bond portfolio develops, market
participants can trade one versus the other to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity. This mechanism
is premised upon a functioning OTC bond market that can be accessed to buy and sell the underlying
securities. Ultimately, if the underlying bond market liquidity becomes impaired then the ETF
creation/redemption process would become impaired as well. In such a scenario the ETF would continue to
provide price discovery, but would mechanically begin to function more like a closed-end fund (which is
unable to grow or shrink in size in order to balance supply and demand). While ETFs provide liquidity
enhancement for the bond market, they remain structurally dependent upon the same market.”).
Market stresses have demonstrated how declines in market liquidity may cause an ETF’s shares to trade at
a significant premium or discount to the shares of the ETF’s underlying portfolio assets. See, e.g., Eleanor

addition, all ETFs permit authorized participants to redeem in cash, rather than in kind, and some
ETFs ordinarily redeem authorized participants in cash. ETFs that elect to redeem authorized
participants in cash, like mutual funds, would need to ensure that they have adequate portfolio
liquidity (in conjunction with any other liquidity sources) to meet shareholder redemptions. 30
As noted above, ETMFs have features of both mutual funds and ETFs. As ETMFs would
redeem their shares on a daily basis from authorized participants, the ETMF would need to hold
sufficiently liquid assets to meet such redemptions to the extent that authorized participants
redeem in cash. Like ETFs, however, the ETMF’s ability to make in-kind redemptions could
mitigate liquidity concerns. 31 Further, as ETMF market makers would not engage in the same
arbitrage as ETF market makers, 32 the liquidity of an ETMF’s portfolio might have a limited
relevance beyond the ETMF’s ability to meet redemptions.
2.

Liquidity Management by Open-End Funds

Portfolio managers consider a variety of factors in addition to liquidity when constructing
a fund’s portfolio, including the fund’s investment strategies, economic and market trends,
portfolio asset credit quality, and tax considerations. Nevertheless, meeting daily redemption
obligations is fundamental for open-end funds, and funds must manage liquidity in order to meet
these obligations. 33 Several factors influence how liquidity management by open-end funds
30

When an ETF does permit an authorized participant to redeem in cash, it typically requires the authorized
participant to pay a fee covering the costs of the liquidity it receives. See BlackRock, Viewpoint, Fund
Structures as Systemic Risk Mitigants (Sept. 2014), available at http://www.blackrock.com/corporate/enus/literature/whitepaper/viewpoint-fund-structures-as-systemic-risk-mitigants-september-2014.pdf
(“BlackRock Fund Structures Paper”), at 7.

31

However, an ETMF’s transferring illiquid instruments to the redeeming authorized participants would
likely affect the premium/discount over NAV at which ETMF shares trade. See ETMF Notice, supra note
15, at n.17.

32

ETMF market makers would assume no intraday market risk in their ETMF share inventory positions
because all trading prices are linked to NAV. See id. at paragraphs 13 and 24.

affects the equitable treatment of investors in a fund, investor incentives, and potentially the
orderly operation of the markets when fulfilling redemption obligations.
First, it is important to consider how a mutual fund (or ETF redeeming shares by using
significant amounts of cash) meets redemptions. When a fund receives redemption requests
from shareholders, and the fund does not have cash on hand to meet those redemptions, 34 the
fund has discretion to determine whether to sell portfolio assets to generate cash to meet the
redemptions and which assets will be sold, or to obtain cash by other available means such as
bank lines of credit. 35 A fund may choose to sell its most liquid assets first. This method of
selling is limited to some degree by the investment strategies of the fund, and a fund pursuing
this method of meeting redemptions to any significant degree may in the near term need to
rebalance its portfolio so that the fund continues to follow its investment strategies. 36 A fund that

34

A fund can have cash on hand to meet redemptions from cash held in the fund’s portfolio, cash received
from investor purchases of fund shares, interest payments and dividends on portfolio securities, or maturing
bonds. See, e.g., Fidelity FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 20, at n.17 (“[S]ecurities do not need
to be sold every time a redemption order is placed. Sale of fund assets is necessary only when gross
redemptions significantly exceed net inflows.”).

35

See, e.g., id., at 21 (“When facing stressed markets and shareholder redemptions, a portfolio manager must
decide whether to: (i) maintain current portfolio composition and sell a cross section of holdings; (ii) meet
redemptions with cash and/or index futures if held, with the result being increased concentrations in
non-cash positions; or (iii) reposition a portfolio’s composition by selling a mixture of holdings and cash
and/or index futures, thereby realigning holdings in response to shifting market prices and expectations.”).
A fund could also use a line of credit to meet redemptions instead of selling assets, but using a line of credit
leverages the fund, and thus many funds only do so infrequently. See infra section III.C.5.a (discussing the
extent to which drawing on a credit line to meet redemptions could result in negative impacts on the fund,
and providing guidance on borrowing arrangements entered into by funds); see also Fidelity FSOC Notice
Comment Letter, supra note 20, at 21 (“Fully substituting cash liquidation for security sales is a very
short-term strategy if redemptions are persistent.”); Comment Letter of Invesco Ltd. on the FSOC Notice
(Mar. 25, 2015) (“Invesco FSOC Notice Comment Letter”), at 10 (stating that Invesco portfolio managers
do not automatically sell the most liquid assets when there is a need to raise cash for redemptions or other
purposes and that they may seek to rebalance portfolios in falling markets in a manner that cushions the
impact of redemptions). But see infra note 371 (noting that other funds rely on lines of credit more
frequently).
A fund also may reserve the right to redeem its shares in kind instead of in cash. However, there are often
logistical issues associated with paying in-kind redemptions, which limit the availability of in-kind
redemptions under many circumstances. See infra section III.C.5.c.

36

Some mutual funds disclose that they may temporarily depart from their investment strategies in order to

18

chooses to sell its most liquid assets to meet fund redemptions may minimize the effect of the
redemptions on short-term fund performance for redeeming and remaining shareholders, but may
leave remaining shareholders in a potentially less liquid and riskier fund until the fund
rebalances. 37 In contrast to meeting redemptions by selling its most liquid assets first, a fund
alternatively could choose to meet redemptions by selling, to the best of its ability, a “strip” of
the fund’s portfolio (i.e., a cross-section or representative selection of the fund’s portfolio
assets). 38 Funds also could choose to meet redemptions by selling a range of assets in between
its most liquid, on one end of the spectrum, and a perfect pro rata strip of assets, on the other end
of the spectrum. Additionally, funds could choose to opportunistically pare back or eliminate
holdings in a particular asset or sector to meet redemptions. As discussed further in section
IV.B.2, analysis conducted by staff in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (the “DERA
Study” 39) suggests that the typical U.S. equity fund appears to sell relatively more liquid assets
(as opposed to a strip of the fund’s portfolio) to meet redemptions, and that as a fund’s liquidity
decreases, a fund will become even more likely to sell its relatively more liquid assets (rather

take a “temporary defensive position” to avoid losses in response to adverse market, economic, political or
other conditions. See Investment Company Names, Investment Company Act Release No. 24828
(Jan. 17, 2001) [66 FR 8509 (Feb. 1, 2001)] (“Investment Company Names Rule Release”).

JOURNAL (June 16, 2015), available at http://www.wsj.com/articles/waddell-funds-sales-leave-investorswith-riskier-securities-1434482621 (noting that from July 2014 through June 2015, a high-yield bond fund
experienced heavy redemptions that caused its net assets to shrink 33% in this period, and during this same
period, the fund’s holdings of bonds rated triple-C or below grew to 47% of assets, from 35% before the
redemptions).

38

There are practical limitations on a fund’s ability to sell a pro rata slice of its portfolio, such as minimum
trade sizes, transfer restrictions, illiquid assets, tax complications from certain sales, and avoidance of odd
lot positions.

than a strip of its portfolio) to meet redemptions (thus resulting in decreased liquidity in the
fund’s portfolio).
Second, the effect of redemptions on shareholders is determined by how and when those
redemptions affect the price of the fund’s shares. Under rule 22c-1, all investors who redeem
from an open-end fund on any particular day must receive the NAV next calculated by the fund
after receipt of such redemption request. 40 As most funds, with the exception of money market
funds, only calculate their NAV once a day, this means that redemption requests received during
the day receive the end of day NAV, typically calculated as of 4 p.m. Eastern time. 41 When
calculating a fund’s NAV, however, rule 2a-4 requires funds to reflect changes in holdings of
portfolio securities and changes in the number of outstanding shares resulting from distributions,
redemptions, and repurchases no later than the first business day following the trade date. 42 We
allow this calculation method to provide funds with additional time and flexibility to incorporate
last-minute portfolio transactions into their NAV calculations on the business day following the
trade date, rather than the trade date. 43 As a practical matter, this calculation method also gives
broker-dealers, retirement plan administrators, and other intermediaries additional time to
process transactions received by 4 p.m. on the trade date, which then may be reflected in the
fund’s NAV on the business day following the trade date. Given that under many circumstances

40

Rule 22c-1(a). See also supra note 2.

41

Commission rules do not require that a fund calculate its NAV at a specific time of day. Rule 22c-1
generally requires that the purchase and redemption of a redeemable security be effected at the current
NAV next computed after receipt of a purchase or redemption request. See rule 22c-1(a). Current NAV
must be computed at least once daily, subject to limited exceptions, Monday through Friday, at the specific
time or times set by the board of directors. See rule 22c-1(b)(1).

reflecting these changes on the trade date would not materially affect the fund’s price, we have
allowed and continue to allow such changes to be reflected no later than the first business day
following the trade date.
Nevertheless, we recognize that trading activity and other changes in portfolio holdings
associated with meeting redemptions may occur over multiple business days following the
redemption request. Such activities associated with meeting redemptions may include, for
example, selling assets and, if the fund’s most liquid assets are sold to meet redemptions,
rebalancing the portfolio to avoid departing from the fund’s investment strategies. If these
activities occur (and their associated costs are incurred) in days following redemption requests,
the costs of providing liquidity to redeeming investors could be borne at least partially by the
remaining investors in the fund, thus potentially diluting the interests of non-redeeming
shareholders. 44 The less liquid the fund’s portfolio holdings, the greater these liquidity costs can
become. 45
Thus, with respect to redemptions, there can be significant adverse consequences to

44

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Mutual Fund Directors Forum on the FSOC Notice (Mar. 25, 2015), at 5
(stating that “there could be severe outlier situations in which sudden and extensive redemptions might
impose costs on non-redeeming shareholders, either because of increases in transaction costs associated
with selling portfolio securities in stressful circumstances or because portfolio managers are forced to sell
securities into falling markets at a price less than what they believe the security’s fundamental value to
be.”). We note that ETFs either conduct redemptions with authorized participants in kind or, if in cash,
typically require the authorized participant to pay a fee covering the costs of the liquidity it receives. See
supra note 30 and accompanying text. Accordingly, ETFs do not necessarily create the same dilution
concerns as mutual funds.

See Comment Letter of Nuveen Investments on the FSOC Notice (Mar. 25, 2015) (“Nuveen FSOC Notice
Comment Letter”), at 10 (stating that “to the extent that the prices of portfolio securities do not reflect the
most current market conditions, which is more likely to occur with less liquid asset classes in stressed
markets, a fund with net redemptions may be paying more to redeeming shareholders than it should (giving
such redeemers a ‘first mover advantage’), thereby harming remaining shareholders and the long-term
performance of the fund” but noting that there is no evidence that shareholders are actually motivated by
this advantage); Comment Letter of Occupy the SEC on the FSOC Notice (Mar. 25, 2015) (“Occupy the

are surely lagging, particularly in turbulent times”).

21

remaining investors in a fund when it fails to adequately manage liquidity. 46 For example,
portfolio assets held by a fund can become increasingly illiquid as its more liquid portfolio assets
are sold to meet redemptions and thus could have a compounding effect of causing the fund’s
entire portfolio to become increasingly illiquid for purposes of meeting future shareholder
redemptions, which could adversely affect the fund’s risk profile. 47 Furthermore, if a fund finds
that it can only sell portfolio assets (or portions of a position in a particular asset) that are less
liquid at prices that incorporate a significant discount from fair value, the discounted sale price
can materially affect the fund’s NAV. 48
These factors in fund redemptions—either individually or in combination—can create
incentives in times of liquidity stress in the markets for early redemptions (or a “first-mover
advantage”). 49 If investor redemptions are motivated by this first-mover advantage, 50 they can

most of the resulting trades after the day of redemption, most of the costs are not reflected in the NAV paid

complementarities—the expectation that other investors will withdraw their money reduces the expected
return for staying in the fund and increases the incentive for each individual investor to withdraw as well—

that a fund would be unable to meet redemption obligations without materially affecting the
fund’s NAV. 53
There also is a potential for adverse effects on the markets when open-end funds fail to
adequately manage liquidity. For example, if liquid asset levels are insufficient to meet
redemptions, funds may sell less-liquid portfolio assets at discounted or even fire sale prices.
These sales can produce significant negative price pressure on those assets and correlated assets.
Accordingly, redemptions and funds’ liquidity risk management can affect not just the remaining
investors in the fund, but any other investors holding these assets. Such liquidity stress on the
assets held in the fund may transmit stress to other funds or portions of the market as well. 54
In December 2014, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) issued a notice
seeking public comment on the potential risks to the U.S. financial system that may be posed by
asset management products and activities in the areas of liquidity and redemptions among
others. 55 Although our rulemaking proposal is independent of FSOC, several commenters
responding to the FSOC notice discussed issues concerning liquidity and redemptions, and we
have considered and cited to the relevant comments throughout the release. 56 As the primary

Recent Developments in the Open-End Fund Industry

Recent industry developments have underlined our focus on the importance of liquidity
risk management practices in open-end funds. These developments include significant growth in
assets of, and shareholder inflows into, open-end funds with fixed income strategies and
alternative strategies since 2008 and the evolution of settlement periods and redemption practices
utilized by open-end funds. While mutual funds holding U.S. equities continue to make up the
largest category of funds in terms of fund assets, their share of the total industry assets has
declined from 65.2% in 2000 to 44.5% in 2014. 58 Assets of foreign bond and foreign equity
funds have grown during the same period from 11% to 17.4%, 59 and there has been significant
growth in fixed income and alternative strategy funds, as discussed below.
1. Fixed Income Funds and Alternative Funds
We have observed significant growth in cash flows into, and assets of, fixed income
mutual funds and fixed income ETFs. Assets in these funds grew from $1.5 trillion at the end of
2008 to $3.5 trillion at the end of 2014, with net inflows exceeding $1.3 trillion during that

have more concave flow-performance relationships when they have more illiquid assets and when the
overall market illiquidity is high” and that these results “point to the possibility of fragility”).

income market structure, holding a roundtable focused on the fixed income markets in 2013 and
publishing a report on the municipal securities markets in 2012. 61 In addition, both
Commissioners and Commission staff have spoken about the need to focus on potential risks
relating to the fixed income markets and their underlying liquidity. 62 Commission staff also has
focused on the nature of liquidity risk management in fixed income funds, including by selecting
fixed income funds as an examination priority in 2014 and 2015. 63

We also have observed recent growth in alternative mutual funds. Since 2005, the assets
of open-end funds with alternative strategies have grown significantly, from approximately $365
million at the end of 2005 to approximately $334 billion at the end of 2014. 64 Although the
assets of open-end funds pursuing alternative strategies accounted for a relatively small
percentage (approximately 3%) of the mutual fund market as of December 2014, the growth of
assets in these funds has been substantial, with asset growth of approximately 58% each year
from the end of 2011 to the end of 2014. 65 While growth in alternative mutual funds and ETFs
has slowed over the past year, a rising interest rate environment could cause inflows to these
funds to increase once again, as investors look to reduce their interest rate risk and/or increase
income by investing in alternative strategies. 66
Unlike alternative mutual funds and ETFs, private funds (such as hedge funds and private
equity funds) pursuing similar alternative strategies can invest in portfolio assets that are
relatively illiquid without generating the same degree of redemption risk for the fund because

DERA Study, supra note 39, at pp. 7-8. While there is no clear definition of “alternative” in the mutual
fund space, an alternative mutual fund is generally understood to be a fund whose primary investment
strategy falls into one or more of the three following buckets: (i) non-traditional asset classes (for example,
currencies or managed futures funds), (ii) non-traditional strategies (such as long/short equity, event
driven), and/or (iii) less liquid assets (such as private debt). Their investment strategies often seek to
produce positive risk-adjusted returns that are not closely correlated to traditional investments or
benchmarks, in contrast to traditional mutual funds that historically have pursued long-only strategies in
traditional asset classes.

2014, investors held the view that interest rates would rise and, thus, they looked to reduce interest rate risk

market neutral strategies which are often used as a substitute for fixed income portfolios.”).

27

investor redemption rights are often limited. 67 In addition, investor expectations of private funds’
redemption rights differ from the redemption expectations of typical retail investors in open-end
funds. For example, investors in private equity funds typically commit their capital for the life of
the fund. 68 Hedge funds often contain “lock-up” provisions (in which an investor only can
redeem after a specified period of time has elapsed since its initial investment), typically impose
limitations on the frequency of redemptions (e.g., allowing redemptions only once a quarter or
once a year), and require advance notice periods for redemptions. 69 They also are often able to
impose gates, suspensions of redemptions, and side pockets to manage liquidity stress. As a
result these funds can, and often do, restrict investor redemption rights as the liquidity of the
funds’ portfolio assets declines. Data reported on Form PF show that at December 31, 2014,
only 16.5% of qualifying hedge funds allowed investors to withdraw any of their investment in
seven days or less and for almost 60% of reporting qualifying hedge funds, the liquidity of the
fund’s portfolio was greater than the withdrawal rights provided to investors for all time frames
reported on the form. 70 As of that date, 88% of qualifying hedge funds may suspend investor
withdrawals and 62% may impose gates on investor withdrawals. 71

In contrast, alternative strategy mutual funds and ETFs have no such ability to tailor
investor redemption rights based on the liquidity profile of the funds’ portfolios. Yet some of
these funds seek to pursue similar investment strategies as hedge funds and other private funds,
while still being bound by the redemption obligations applicable to open-end funds.
Accordingly, our staff has been focused on the liquidity of alternative strategy mutual funds and
ETFs, the nature of liquidity and redemption risks faced by investors in these funds given their
legal right to be paid the proceeds of any redemption request within seven days. 72 The findings
in the DERA Study have lent further support to our focus on liquidity risk management practices
in this industry segment, as the study found that alternative strategy mutual funds had cash flows
that were significantly more volatile than other strategies, indicating that these funds may face
higher levels of redemption risk. Volatility in flows places additional importance on liquidity
risk management to prevent some of the consequences from a failure to adequately manage
liquidity discussed in section II.B.2 above. The proposed rule and rule amendments build off of
many of the observations we and our staff have made through efforts examining the growth in
funds and ETFs with fixed income strategies and alternative strategies that are discussed below.
2. Evolution of Settlement Periods and Redemption Practices
Practices relating to securities trade settlement periods and the timing of the payment of
redemption proceeds to investors also have evolved considerably over the decades since the

Commission last addressed liquidity needs in open-end funds. 73 Prior to the adoption of rule
15c6-1 under the Exchange Act in 1993, which established three business days (T+3) as the
standard settlement timeframe for broker-dealer trades, there was no federal rule that mandated a
specific settlement cycle for securities transactions. 74 Before the adoption of rule 15c6-1, trades
settled on a T+5 basis based on industry practice, and the decline in the securities trading
settlement period from T+5 to T+3 prompted funds that were sold through broker-dealers to
satisfy redemption requests within three business days. 75 In recent years, market participants
have explored the possibility of further reducing this T+3 settlement period. 76 We also have
observed that some open-end funds disclose in their prospectuses that they generally will satisfy

73

See, e.g., Invesco FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 35, at 14 (noting that it “was not long ago that
equity securities settled on a T+7 basis rather than today’s T+3 standard and initiatives are underway to
shorten that time to T+2”).

Act).

See May 1995 Staff No-Action Letter, supra note 21 (noting that funds that are sold through brokers or
dealers and that hold portfolio securities that do not settle within three business days “should assess the mix
of their portfolio holdings to determine whether, under normal circumstances, they will be able to facilitate
compliance with the T+3 standard by brokers and dealers,” taking into account the “percentage of the
portfolio that would settle in three days or less, the level of cash reserves, and the availability of lines of
credit or interfund lending facilities.”).

redemption requests in even shorter periods of time than T+3, including on a next-business-day
basis. 77
While standard settlement periods for securities trades in the markets have tended to fall
significantly over the last several decades—and investor expectations that redemption proceeds
will be paid promptly after redemption requests have risen—settlement periods for other
securities held in large amounts by certain funds have not fallen correspondingly. For example,
some bank loan funds (an asset class that has grown in recent years) 78 invest substantial amounts
of their assets in bank loans and loan participations, which typically have long settlement times
compared to other investments. 79 Based on our review of fund filings, many funds that invest in
these assets do not consider most of their portfolio holdings to be illiquid and generally represent
in their disclosures that they comply with the Commission’s current guidelines, which state that

77

Disclosures by open-end funds are subject to the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.
Therefore there may be liability under these provisions if a fund fails to meet redemptions within seven
days or any shorter time disclosed in the fund’s prospectus or advertising materials. See section 17(a) of
the Securities Act, section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act, and section
34(b) of the Exchange Act; see also Fidelity FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 20, at 6 (“mutual
funds normally process redemption requests by the next business day”); Nuveen FSOC Notice Comment
Letter, supra note 45, at 9 (noting settlement periods for trades of fund portfolio securities as a relevant
factor in assessing liquidity risk, particularly with securities that “do not trade with enforceable settlement
rights and tend to settle over longer settlement periods than the T+1 or T+3 periods over which mutual fund
share redemptions themselves settle”).

78

Based on staff analysis of Morningstar Direct Data, net assets of bank loan mutual funds and ETFs grew
from $14.6 billion in December 2008 to $123.5 billion in December 2014.

See, e.g., BlackRock, Viewpoint, Who Owns the Assets? A Closer Look at Bank Loans, High Yield Bonds
and Emerging Markets Debt (Sept. 2014) (“BlackRock, Viewpoint, Who Owns the Assets?”), available at
https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/en-fi/literature/whitepaper/viewpoint-closer-look-selected-assetclasses-sept2014.pdf (“[T]he settlement periods for bank loans are longer than the settlement periods for
fixed income securities such as high yield bonds, which typically settle in three days. This delayed
settlement period may cause a potential liquidity mismatch for mutual funds offering daily liquidity,
requiring fund managers to ensure that a fund has sufficient liquidity over settlement windows to meet
potential redemptions.”); Comment Letter of OppenheimerFunds on the FSOC Notice (Mar. 25, 2015)
(“OppenheimerFunds FSOC Notice Comment Letter”) at 3-4 (stating that “loans still take longer to settle
than other securities. Median settlement times for buy-side loan sales are 12 days” and noting that an
“important tool in managing settlement times is the establishment of a credit line dedicated to bank loan
funds.”).

31

an open-end fund should invest no more than 15% of its net assets in “illiquid” assets. 80
However, the settlement periods associated with some bank loans and loan participations may
extend beyond the period of time the fund would be required to meet shareholder redemptions,
creating a potential mismatch between the timing of the receipt of cash upon sale of these assets
and the payment of cash for shareholder redemptions. 81
Overall, the evolution of the market towards shorter settlement periods – and
corresponding investor expectations – combined with open-end funds holding certain securities
with longer settlement periods have raised concerns for us about whether fund portfolios are
sufficiently liquid to support a fund’s ability to meet its redemption obligations.
D.

Current Regulatory Framework
1. Statutory and Regulatory Requirements

Section 22(e) of the Act provides that no open-end fund shall suspend the right of
redemption or postpone the date of payment of redemption proceeds for more than seven days
after tender of the security absent specified unusual circumstances. 82 This statutory requirement

80

See infra note 92 and accompanying text. Under current Commission guidelines, a portfolio security or
other asset is considered illiquid if it cannot be sold or disposed of (rather than settled) in the ordinary
course of business within seven days at approximately the value at which the fund has valued the
investment.

81

Mutual funds and ETFs investing in foreign securities can also have such settlement mismatches. See, e.g.,
Investment Company Institute, Understanding Exchange-Traded Funds: How ETFs Work, (Sept. 2014), at
n.34, available at https://www.ici.org/pdf/per20-05.pdf (noting that internationally focused ETFs generally
require authorized participants to post collateral “because the timing of clearing and settlement in another
country may not coincide with the T+3 settlement cycle in the United States”). There has been significant
growth in emerging market funds since the year 2000. See infra note 664 and accompanying text.

82

Section 22(e) permits open-end funds to suspend redemptions and postpone payment for redemptions
already tendered for any period during which the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) is closed (other
than customary weekend and holiday closings) and in three additional situations if the Commission has
made certain determinations. First, a fund may suspend redemptions for any period during which trading
on the NYSE is restricted, as determined by the Commission. Second, a fund may suspend redemptions for
any period during which an emergency exists, as determined by the Commission, as a result of which it is
not reasonably practicable for the fund to: (i) liquidate its portfolio securities, or (ii) fairly determine the
value of its net assets. Third, a fund may suspend redemptions for such other periods as the Commission
may by order permit for the protection of fund shareholders. See also Letter from Douglas Scheidt,

32

was enacted “in response to abusive practices of early open-end companies that claimed that
their securities were redeemable, but then instituted barriers to redemption” to prevent net
redemptions or to prevent shareholders from switching to other funds. 83 As previously discussed,
in addition to the seven-day redemption requirement in section 22(e), rule 15c6-1 under the
Exchange Act also impacts the timing of open-end fund redemptions because the rule requires
broker-dealers to settle securities transactions, including transactions in open-end fund shares,
within three business days after the trade date. Furthermore, rule 22c-1 under the Act, the
“forward pricing” rule, requires funds, their principal underwriters, and dealers to sell and
redeem fund shares at a price based on the current NAV next computed after receipt of an order
to purchase or redeem fund shares, even though fund assets may be sold in subsequent days in
order to meet redemption obligations. 84 Thus, there are a number of statutory and regulatory
provisions that must be considered in assessing a fund’s ability to meet redemptions and mitigate
potential dilution of shareholders’ interests.

General Counsel, Investment Company Institute (Dec. 8, 1999) available at
http://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/guidance/tyle120899.htm, at n.2 and accompanying text. The
Commission has rarely issued orders permitting the suspension of redemptions for periods of restricted
trading or emergency circumstances but has done so on a few occasions. See, e.g., In the Matter of The
Reserve Fund, on behalf of two of its series, the Primary Fund and the U.S. Government Fund, Investment
Company Act Release No. 28386 (Sept. 22, 2008) [73 FR 55572 (Sept. 25, 2008)]; see also, e.g., In the
Matter of Municipal Lease Securities Fund, Inc., Investment Company Act Release No. 17245 (Nov. 29,
1989). Money market funds are able to suspend redemptions in certain limited circumstances. See rule
22e-3 under the Act; see also infra note 155 and accompanying text.

With the exception of money market funds subject to rule 2a-7 under the Act, the
Commission has not promulgated rules requiring open-end funds to invest in a minimum level of
liquid assets. 85 The Commission historically has taken the position that open-end funds should
maintain a high degree of portfolio liquidity to ensure that their portfolio securities and other
assets can be sold and the proceeds used to satisfy redemptions in a timely manner in order to
comply with section 22(e). 86 The Commission also has stated that open-end funds have a
“general responsibility to maintain a level of portfolio liquidity that is appropriate under the
circumstances,” and to engage in ongoing portfolio liquidity monitoring to determine whether an
adequate level of portfolio liquidity is being maintained in light of the fund’s redemption
obligations. 87 As noted in this guidance, a fund experiencing net outflows due to shifts in market

85

Under rule 2a-7, money market funds must maintain sufficient liquidity to meet reasonably foreseeable
redemptions, generally must invest at least 10% of their portfolios in assets that can provide daily liquidity
and at least 30% of their portfolios in assets that can provide weekly liquidity, and may not acquire any
illiquid security if, immediately after the acquisition, the money market fund would have invested more
than 5% of its total assets in illiquid securities. Rule 2a-7. Additionally, the Commission recently adopted
amendments to rule 2a-7 that, among other things: (i) give boards of directors of money market funds
discretion to impose a liquidity fee or temporarily suspend the right of redemption if a fund’s weekly
liquidity level falls below the required regulatory threshold; and (ii) require all non-government money
market funds to impose a liquidity fee if the fund’s weekly liquidity level falls below a designated threshold
of 10%, unless the fund’s board determines that imposing such a fee is not in the best interests of the fund.

In the rule 38a-1 adopting release, the Commission stated that funds should adopt policies and procedures
regarding the pricing of portfolio securities and fund shares. See Compliance Programs of Investment
Companies and Investment Advisers, Investment Company Act Release No. 26299 (Dec. 17, 2003)
[68 FR 74714 (Dec. 24, 2003)] (“Rule 38a-1 Adopting Release”) (“These pricing requirements are critical
to ensuring fund shares are purchased and redeemed at fair prices and that shareholder interests are not
diluted.”). The Commission also identifies “portfolio management processes” as an issue that should be
covered in the compliance policies and procedures of a fund or its adviser and indicates that each fund
should tailor its policies and procedures to address the fund’s particular compliance risks. See id., at n.82
(noting that the chief compliance officer’s annual report should discuss the fund’s particular compliance
risks and any changes that were made to the policies and procedures to address newly identified risks).

assets” to 15% of the fund’s net assets (the “15% guideline”). 92 Under the 15% guideline, a
portfolio security or other asset is considered illiquid if it cannot be sold or disposed of in the
ordinary course of business within seven days at approximately the value at which the fund has
valued the investment. 93 The 15% guideline has generally caused funds to limit their exposures
to particular types of securities that cannot be sold within seven days and that the Commission
and staff have indicated may be illiquid, depending on the facts and circumstances, such as
private equity securities, securities purchased in an initial public offering, and certain other
privately placed or other restricted securities 94 as well as certain instruments or transactions not

92

Guidelines Release, supra note 4, at section III. (“If an open-end company holds a material percentage of
its assets in securities or other assets for which there is no established market, there may be a question
concerning the ability of the fund to make payment within seven days of the date its shares are tendered for
redemption. The usual limit on aggregate holdings by an open-end investment company of illiquid assets is
15% of its net assets. An illiquid asset is any asset which may not be sold or disposed of in the ordinary
course of business within seven days at approximately the value at which the mutual fund has valued the
investment.”). The Guidelines Release modified prior Commission guidance that set a 10% limit on
illiquid assets for open-end funds. See Restricted Securities Release, supra note 86.
While the wording of the Guidelines Release limits holdings of illiquid assets above 15% of a fund’s net
assets, the Guidelines Release cites a prior Commission statement regarding the “prudent limit on mutual
fund holdings of illiquid securities” that limits a fund from acquiring any illiquid asset if, immediately after
such acquisition, the fund’s holdings of illiquid assets would exceed a certain percentage of the fund’s net
assets. See Guidelines Release, supra note 4, at n.8 (citing Restricted Securities Release, supra note 86).
The latter interpretation (that is, the interpretation that the 15% standard is a limit on the acquisition of
illiquid assets, not a limit on the holdings of illiquid assets) is consistent with approaches that Congress and
the Commission have historically taken in other parts of the Investment Company Act and the rules
thereunder. See infra note 348.

an investment company issuing redeemable securities is a question of fact for the board of directors to
determine, based upon the trading markets for the specific security” and noted that the board should
consider the unregistered nature of a rule 144A security as one of the factors it evaluates in determining its
liquidity. Id. The Division of Investment Management has also stated that an open-end fund’s board of

not established a set of required factors that must be considered when assessing the liquidity of
these or other types of securities, but rather has provided “examples of factors that would be
reasonable for a board of directors to take into account with respect to a rule 144A security (but
which would not necessarily be determinative).” 96 These factors include: the frequency of trades
and quotations for the security; the number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the security and
the number of other potential purchasers; dealer undertakings to make a market in the security;
and the nature of the security and the nature of the marketplace in which it trades, including the
time needed to dispose of the security, the method of soliciting offers, and the mechanics of
transfer. 97
3. Overview of Current Practices
Over the last two years, Commission staff has had the occasion to observe through a
variety of different events the current liquidity risk management practices at a cross-section of
different fund complexes with varied investment strategies. The staff has observed that liquidity
risk management techniques may vary across funds, including funds within the same fund
complex, in light of unique fund characteristics, including, for example, the nature of a fund’s
investment objectives or strategies, the composition of the fund’s investor base, and historical
fund flows. These observations collectively have shown the staff that, even with various unique
characteristics, many open-end funds and fund complexes have implemented procedures for
assessing, classifying, and managing the liquidity of their portfolio assets. 98
95

See Interval Fund Proposing Release, supra note 83.

96

See Rule 144A Release, supra note 86.

97

Id.

98

There are varying degrees of formality in the adoption and implementation of these procedures.

37

Specifically, some of the funds observed by the staff assess their ability to sell particular
assets within various time periods (typically focusing on one-, three-, and/or seven-day
periods). 99 In conducting this analysis, these funds may take into account relevant market,
trading, and other factors, and monitor whether their initial liquidity determination should be
changed based on changed market conditions. This process helps open-end funds determine
their ability to meet redemption requests in various market conditions within the disclosed period
for payment of redemption proceeds.
Funds observed by the staff that have implemented procedures for assessing and
classifying the liquidity of their portfolio assets also often have developed controls to manage
fund portfolio liquidity risk and the risk of changing levels of shareholder redemptions, such as
holding certain amounts of the fund’s portfolio in highly liquid assets, setting minimum cash
reserves, and establishing committed back-up lines of credit or interfund lending facilities. 100 A
few of the funds observed by staff conduct stress testing relating to the availability of liquid
assets to cover possible levels of redemptions. 101 Some of these funds’ advisers also have

99

See 2014 Fixed Income Guidance Update, supra note 62 (noting that fund advisers “generally assess
overall fund liquidity and funds’ ability to meet potential redemptions over a number of periods” and
discussing certain steps that fund advisers may consider taking given potential fixed income market
volatility); see also infra note 151 and accompanying text.

100

Press coverage has detailed steps some funds and their advisers have taken to manage liquidity in light of
changing market conditions as well. See, e.g., Jessica Toonkel, Fund Boards, Management Go on High
Alert Around Bond Liquidity, REUTERS (Nov. 24, 2014), available at
http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/24/us-funds-bondholders-alert-idUSKCN0J80AD20141124
(reporting that investment advisers “have been testing their funds against various market scenarios,
building cushions of cash, shorter-duration bonds and other liquid securities, and regularly discussing risks
with their boards”); Katy Burne, Bond Funds Loan Up on Cash, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (Nov. 30,
2014), available at http://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-funds-load-up-on-cash-1417394534 (discussing cash
buffers and use of certain derivatives to manage liquidity concerns); Cordell Eddings, Bond Liquidity Risk
in $3.5 Trillion Funds Defused by Cash, BLOOMBERG (Aug. 18, 2014), available at

101

See, e.g., Nuveen FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 45, at 12 (“We stress test a fund’s ability to
meet redemptions over a one-month period in a badly stressed market by hypothetically assuming a large
increase in net redemptions, cash outflows for derivatives cash collateral and cash outlay requirements

38

periodic discussions with their boards of directors about how the fund approaches liquidity risk
management and what emerging risks they are observing relating to liquidity risk. We have
observed that some of the funds with the more thorough liquidity risk management practices
have appeared to be able to better meet periods of higher than typical redemptions without
significantly altering the risk profile of the fund or materially affecting the fund’s performance,
and thus with less dilutive impacts.
Conversely, the Commission is concerned that some funds employ liquidity risk
management practices that are substantially less rigorous. Some funds observed by the staff do
not take different market conditions into account when evaluating portfolio asset liquidity, and
do not conduct any ongoing liquidity monitoring. Some funds do not incorporate any
independent oversight of fund liquidity risk management outside of the portfolio management
process. 102 Staff has observed that some of these funds, when faced with higher than normal
redemptions, experienced particularly poor performance compared with their benchmark and
some even experienced an adverse change in the fund’s risk profile, each of which can increase
the risk of investor dilution.
Finally, the Commission learned through staff outreach that many funds treat their risk
management process for assessing the liquidity profile of portfolio assets, and the incorporation
of market and trading information, as entirely separate from their assessment of assets under the
imposed by various leverage structures, and comparing the level of cash needed to meet that hypothetical
scenario against the amount of cash the fund could reasonably expect to raise from various sources
(including selling assets in a hypothetically stressed market or drawing on a credit facility) in that same
time frame.”); ICI FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 16, at 24 (stating that some asset managers
conduct forms of stress testing to determine the impact of certain changes on portfolio liquidity).
102

See, e.g., BlackRock FSOC Notice Comment Letter, at 6 (stating that among several overarching principles
that provide the foundation for a prudent market liquidity risk management framework for collective
investment vehicles is having “a risk management function that is independent from portfolio management,
with direct reporting lines to senior leadership and a regular role in communication with the asset
manager’s board of directors”).

39

15% guideline. The former process is typically conducted on an ongoing basis through the
fund’s risk management function, through the fund’s portfolio management function, or through
the fund’s trading function (or a combination of the foregoing), while assessment of assets under
the 15% guideline is more typically conducted upon purchase of an asset through the fund’s
compliance or “back-office” functions, with little indication that information generated from the
risk management or trading functions informs the compliance determinations. This functional
divide may be a by-product of the limitations of the 15% guideline as a stand-alone method for
comprehensive liquidity risk management, a situation that our proposed framework is meant to
address. 103
Overall, our staff outreach has increased our understanding of some of the valuable
liquidity risk management practices employed by some firms as a matter of prudent risk
management. This outreach also has shown us the great diversity in liquidity risk management
practices that raises concerns regarding various funds’ ability to meet their redemption
obligations and minimize the effects of dilution under certain conditions. Collectively, these
observations have informed our understanding of the need for an enhanced minimum baseline
requirement for fund management of liquidity risk.
E.

Rulemaking Proposal Overview

Against this background, today we are proposing a multi-layered set of reforms designed
to promote effective liquidity risk management throughout the open-end fund industry and
thereby reduce the risk that funds will not be able to meet redemption obligations and mitigate
potential dilution of the interests of fund shareholders in accordance with section 22(e) of, and
rule 22c-1 under, the Investment Company Act. The proposed amendments also seek to enhance
103

See infra section III.C.4 for a discussion of the limitations of the 15% guideline.

40

disclosure regarding fund liquidity and redemption practices. In addition, these proposed
reforms are intended to address the liquidity-related developments in the open-end fund industry
discussed above and are a part of a broader set of initiatives to address the impact of open-end
fund investment activities on investors and the financial markets, and the risks associated with
the increasingly complex portfolio composition and operations of the asset management
industry. 104
First, we are proposing new rule 22e-4, which would require each registered open-end
fund, including open-end ETFs but not including money market funds, to establish a liquidity
risk management program. The proposed rule would require a fund’s liquidity risk management
program to incorporate certain specified elements. One primary element of this program is a
new requirement for funds to classify and monitor the liquidity of portfolio assets, reflecting that
liquidity may be viewed as falling on a spectrum rather than a binary conclusion that an asset is
either “liquid” or “illiquid.” Another principal feature is a new requirement that funds establish a
minimum amount of their assets that would be held in cash and assets that the fund believes are
convertible to cash within three business days at a price that does not materially affect the value
of that asset immediately prior to the sale. 105 This proposed requirement is aimed at decreasing
104

Such other initiatives include modernizing investment company reporting and disclosure, addressing the
risks of derivatives use, and requiring large investment companies and investment advisers to engage in
annual stress tests as required by section 165(i) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”). See Chair Mary Jo White, Speech, Remarks to the New York Times
DealBook Opportunities for Tomorrow Conference (Dec. 11, 2014), available at
http://www.sec.gov/News/Speech/Detail/Speech/1370543677722; Investment Company Reporting
Modernization, Investment Company Act Release No. 31610 (May 20, 2015) [80 FR 33590
(June 12, 2015)] (“Investment Company Reporting Modernization Release”).

105

Proposed rule 22e-4(a)(8) defines “Three-Day Liquid Asset” to mean “any cash held by a fund and any
position of a fund in an asset (or portion of the fund’s position in an asset) that the fund believes is
convertible into cash within three business days at a price that does not materially affect the value of that
asset immediately prior to sale. In determining whether a position or portion of a position in an asset is a
three-day liquid asset, a fund must take into account the factors set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this
section, to the extent applicable.” Proposed rule 22e-4(a)(9) defines “Three-Day Liquid Asset Minimum”
to mean “the percentage of the fund’s net assets to be invested in three-day liquid assets,” in accordance

41

the likelihood that funds would be unable to meet their redemption obligations and promote
effective liquidity risk management industry-wide. We also anticipate that the proposed program
requirement would result in investor protection benefits, as improved liquidity risk management
could decrease the chance that a fund could meet its redemption obligations only with material
effects on the fund’s NAV or changes to the fund’s risk profile.
Even with improved liquidity risk management, circumstances could arise in which
shareholder purchase and redemption activity could dilute the value of existing shareholders’
interests in the fund. For this reason, we are also proposing amendments to rule 22c-1 under the
Act to permit a fund (except a money market fund or ETF) to use “swing pricing,” the process of
adjusting a fund’s NAV to effectively pass on to purchasing or redeeming shareholders more of
the costs stemming from their trading activity. Swing pricing could protect existing shareholders
from dilution associated with such purchase and redemption activity and could be another tool to
manage liquidity risks. Pooled investment vehicles in certain foreign jurisdictions currently use
various forms of swing pricing to mitigate shareholder dilution associated with other
shareholders’ capital activity, and we believe swing pricing could be an effective tool to assist
U.S. registered funds in mitigating potential shareholder dilution.
Finally, we are proposing disclosure- and reporting-related amendments to provide
greater transparency with respect to funds’ liquidity risks and risk management. Specifically, we
are proposing amendments to Form N-1A to require disclosure regarding swing pricing, if
applicable, and to improve disclosure regarding how funds meet redemptions of fund shares. We
also are proposing amendments to proposed Form N-PORT and proposed Form N-CEN to
provide detailed information, both to the Commission and the public, regarding a fund’s
with rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(A) and (C).

42

liquidity-related holdings data and liquidity risk management practices. We note that while these
disclosure- and reporting-related amendments are primarily applicable to mutual funds that are
not money market funds, as well as ETFs, certain of the proposed amendments are applicable to
money market funds as well.
We anticipate that these proposed requirements will facilitate the Commission’s risk
monitoring efforts by providing greater transparency regarding the liquidity characteristics of
fund portfolio holdings, as well as to monitor and assess compliance with rule 22e-4 if adopted.
While proposed Form N-PORT and proposed Form N-CEN are primarily designed to assist the
Commission, we believe that the proposed requirements also would increase investor
understanding of particular funds’ liquidity-related risks and redemption policies, which in turn
would assist investors in making investment choices that better match their risk tolerances. 106
We note that many investors, particularly institutional investors, as well as academic researchers,
financial analysts, and economic research firms, could use the information regarding a fund’s
liquidity-related holdings data and liquidity risk management practices reported on Form
N-PORT to evaluate fund portfolios. 107 Finally, we are proposing to require that ETFs report on
proposed Form N-CEN information regarding any requirement to post collateral by authorized
participants that are purchasing or redeeming shares. Such collateral requirements could affect
authorized participants’ capacity and willingness to serve as authorized participants for ETFs,
and, in turn, the effective functioning of the ETF’s arbitrage mechanism and the ETF shares

106

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Markit on the FSOC Notice (Mar. 25, 2015), at 2 (“we believe that liquidity
and redemption risk contained in asset management products can be mitigated by providing risk managers
or investors of pooled investment vehicles better information about the liquidity risk associated with pool
investments so that they can price it more accurately. This could be done through, among other things,
disclosures of the ‘prudent valuation’ (accounting for pricing uncertainty) of the fund’s investments and the
implementation of appropriate liquidity risk management policies and procedures”).

DISCUSSION
A.

Program Requirements and Scope of Proposed Rule 22e-4

Today we are proposing new rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act, which
would require that each registered open-end management investment company, including
open-end ETFs but not including money market funds, 108 establish a written liquidity risk
management program. We expect that the proposed rule 22e-4 program requirements would
reduce the risk that funds will be unable to timely meet their redemption obligations under
section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act and other statutory and regulatory provisions, 109
mitigate potential investor dilution, and provide for more effective liquidity risk management
among funds. We believe that this, in turn, would result in significant investor protection
benefits and enhance the fair and orderly operation of the markets. 110
1.

Proposed Program Elements

Proposed rule 22e-4 would require each fund to adopt and implement a written liquidity
risk management program that is designed to assess and manage the fund’s liquidity risk. 111
Under the proposed rule, liquidity risk would be defined as the risk that a fund could not meet

108

Under proposed rule 22e-4(a)(5), “fund” means “an open-end management investment company that is
registered or required to register under section 8 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-8) and includes a separate series
of such an investment company, but does not include a registered open-end management investment
company that is regulated as a money market fund under § 270.2a-7.”

109

In addition to the seven-day redemption requirement in section 22(e), rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act
also impacts the timing of open-end fund redemptions because the rule requires broker-dealers to settle
securities transactions, including transactions in open-end fund shares, within three business days after the
trade date. See supra note 21 and accompanying text. Furthermore, funds’ redemption obligations are also
governed by any disclosure to shareholders that a fund has made about the time within which it will meet
redemption requests, as disclosures by open-end funds are subject to the antifraud provisions of the federal
securities laws. See supra note 77 and accompanying text.

110

See infra section IV.C.1.

111

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(1).

44

requests to redeem shares issued by the fund that are expected under normal conditions, or are
reasonably foreseeable under stressed conditions, without materially affecting the fund’s net
asset value. 112 Proposed rule 22e-4 specifies that a fund’s liquidity risk management program
shall include the following required program elements: (i) classification, and ongoing review of
the classification, of the liquidity of each of the fund’s positions in a portfolio asset (or portions
of a position in a particular asset); (ii) assessment and periodic review of the fund’s liquidity risk;
and (iii) management of the fund’s liquidity risk, including the investment of a set minimum
portion of net assets in assets that the fund believes are convertible to cash within three business
days at a price that does not materially affect the value of that asset immediately prior to sale. 113
Proposed rule 22e-4 incorporates specific requirements for each of these program elements, and
these requirements are discussed in detail below. A fund may, as it determines appropriate,
expand its liquidity risk management procedures and related disclosure concerning liquidity risk
beyond the required program elements, and should consider doing so whenever it would be
necessary to ensure effective liquidity management. A fund would be required to set and invest
a prescribed minimum portion of net assets in assets that are cash or that the fund believes are
convertible to cash within three business days at a price that does not materially affect the value
of that asset immediately prior to the sale, and also would be required to classify the liquidity of
the fund’s portfolio positions. In other respects, the proposed program requirements are more

112

Proposed rule 22e-4(a)(7). This definition is similar to the definition of “liquidity risk” that the
Commission has used in other contexts, modified as appropriate to apply to the specific liquidity needs of
investment companies. See Financial Responsibility Rules for Broker-Dealers, Exchange Act Release No.
70072 (July 30, 2013) [78 FR 51823 (Aug. 21, 2013)], at n.291 (“Generally, funding liquidity risk is the
risk that a firm will not be able to meet cash demands as they become due and asset liquidity risk is the risk
that an asset will not be able to be sold quickly at its market value.”).
This proposed definition contemplates that a fund consider both expected requests to redeem, as well as
requests to redeem that may not be expected, but are reasonably foreseeable. See infra section III.C.

113

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(1), (2).

45

principles-based and would permit each fund to tailor its liquidity risk management program to
the fund’s particular risks and circumstances.
The requirements of proposed rule 22e-4, including the liquidity risk assessment
requirements, are applicable to all open-end funds, which term is defined to include each
separate series of a registered open-end investment company. 114 Therefore, each series of a fund
would be responsible for developing a liquidity risk management program tailored to its own
liquidity risk in order to comply with the proposed rule. We anticipate that liquidity risk could
differ—sometimes significantly—among the series of an investment company, based on
variations in each of the proposed liquidity risk assessment factors required to be considered.
Under these circumstances, it would be appropriate for each series’ liquidity risk management
program to incorporate risk assessment and risk management elements that are distinct from
other series’ programs. However, to the extent that the series of an investment company are
substantially similar in terms of cash flow patterns, investment strategy, portfolio liquidity, and
the other factors a fund would be required to consider in assessing its liquidity risk, 115 it may be
appropriate for each series to adopt the same or a similar liquidity risk management program.
Proposed rule 22e-4 includes board oversight provisions related to the liquidity risk
management program requirement. Specifically, a fund’s board would be required to approve
the fund’s liquidity risk management program, any material changes to the program, and the
fund’s designation of the fund’s investment adviser or officers as responsible for administering
the fund’s liquidity risk management program (which cannot be solely portfolio managers of the

114

See proposed rule 22e-4(a)(5).

115

See infra section III.C.1.

46

fund). 116 A fund also would be required to disclose certain information about its liquidity risk
and risk management in its registration statement, 117 as well as on proposed Forms N-CEN and
N-PORT. 118
2.

Scope of Proposed Rule 22e-4 and Related Disclosure and Reporting
Requirements

Proposed rule 22e-4, as well as the related disclosure and reporting requirements, would
apply to all registered open-end funds (including open-end ETFs) other than money market
funds. The liquidity risk management program required under proposed rule 22e-4 would reduce
the risk that funds would be unable to meet shareholder redemptions in light of their statutory
and regulatory requirements for meeting redemption requests, as well as any disclosure made to
investors regarding payment of redemption proceeds, without materially affecting the fund’s
NAV. 119
Although we recognize that various fund characteristics, such as a fund’s investment
strategy, ownership concentration, redemption policies, and other similar factors, could make a
fund relatively more prone to liquidity risk, 120 we believe that all registered open-end funds
(other than money market funds), not only those whose investment strategies create greater
liquidity risk, should fall within the scope of proposed rule 22e-4. While we are not proposing

satisfy redemption requests within a period shorter than seven days (because they are sold through broker
dealers, which are subject to rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act (establishing a three-business day (T+3)
settlement period for security trades effected by a broker or a dealer), and/or because they have disclosed to
investors that they will meet redemption requests within a period shorter than seven days).

different liquidity risk management program requirements for different types of funds, the
proposed rule is designed to result in robust liquidity risk management programs whose scope,
and related costs and burdens, are adequately tailored to manage the liquidity risk faced by a
particular fund. The proposed rule requires each fund to assess its liquidity risk periodically,
after consideration of certain enumerated factors, and to adopt policies and procedures for
managing its liquidity risk based on this assessment. 121 For example, a fund whose ownership is
relatively concentrated, and that has an investment strategy requiring it to hold a significant
portion of unlisted securities that do not trade frequently, would likely establish a different
liquidity risk management program than a fund whose portfolio assets consist mostly of
exchange-traded securities with a very high average daily trading volume. 122
We are not proposing to exclude any particular subset of open-end management
investment companies other than money market funds from the scope of proposed rule 22e-4,
because even funds with investment strategies that historically have entailed relatively little
liquidity risk could experience liquidity stresses in certain environments. For example, although
most equity securities are generally understood to be more liquid than fixed income securities,
investments in certain types of equities involve some degree of liquidity risk. 123 Also,
unexpected market events could cause the liquidity of assets that typically are more liquid to
decrease. 124 Furthermore, different types of funds within the same broad investment strategy

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)-(iv).

122

See infra section III.C.1.

123

For example, certain foreign securities (equities as well as fixed income securities) may entail very long
settlement times and trading limitations. See infra note 197. Also, certain equity securities, such as
microcap equity securities, trade relatively infrequently, which in turn could diminish their liquidity. See

For example, during the “Flash Crash” of October 15, 2014, one of the most volatile trading days since
2008, yield decreases on 10-year Treasuries resulted in certain fixed income market participants turning off

may demonstrate different levels of liquidity (and thus, presumably, different levels of liquidity
risk). 125 We are also not proposing to provide different liquidity requirements for relatively small
funds because, as discussed in the Economic Analysis section below, smaller funds tend to
demonstrate relatively high flow volatility (and thus possibly greater liquidity risk). 126
Like traditional open-end funds, the Commission believes that open-end ETFs could
experience liquidity risk, and thus proposes to include open-end ETFs within the scope of rule
22e-4. 127 As discussed above, the liquidity of an ETF’s portfolio securities is a factor that
contributes to the effective functioning of the ETF’s arbitrage mechanism and the ETF shares
trading at a price that is at or close to the NAV of the ETF. 128 In addition, ETFs that permit
authorized participants to redeem in cash, rather than in kind, and ETFs that typically redeem in
cash, like traditional mutual funds, would need to ensure that they have sufficient portfolio
liquidity (in conjunction with any other liquidity sources) to meet shareholder redemptions in
cash. 129 And especially in times of declining market liquidity, the liquidity of an ETF may be

automatic pricing on electronic trading platforms on account of fears that the market was moving too
quickly for automatic prices to keep up with the market. This, in turn, slowed the pace of trading in U.S.
Treasuries, temporarily decreasing their liquidity. See, e.g., Joint Staff Report: The U.S. Treasury Market
on October 15, 2014 (July 13, 2015), available at http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/pressreleases/Documents/Joint_Staff_Report_Treasury_10-15-2015.pdf (“Flash Crash Staff Report”) (report of
staff findings from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission discussing in depth, among other things, the strains in
liquidity conditions during the events of October 15).

limited by the liquidity of the market for the ETF’s underlying securities. 130 As discussed below,
we believe that the liquidity-related concerns relevant to ETFs structured as unit investment
trusts (“UITs”) are different from those relevant to open-end ETFs, and thus we are proposing
not to include ETFs structured as UITs within the scope of proposed rule 22e-4. 131
The scope of proposed rule 22e-4 does not include closed-end investment companies
(“closed-end funds”). Closed-end funds do not issue redeemable securities and are not subject to
section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act. 132 Closed-end funds’ liquidity needs are
consequently different from those of open-end funds. This has been acknowledged previously
by the Commission; for example, the 15% guideline is applicable only to open-end funds and not
closed-end funds. 133 Closed-end funds that elect to repurchase their shares at periodic intervals
under Investment Company Act rule 23c-3 (“closed-end interval funds”) are subject to certain
liquidity standards in order to ensure that they can complete repurchase offers, and must adopt
written procedures reasonably designed to ensure that their portfolio assets are sufficiently liquid
to comply with their fundamental policies on repurchases. 134 However, other closed-end funds

130

See supra note 24 and accompanying text.

131

See infra note 144 and accompanying paragraph. We note that the vast majority of ETFs are organized as
open-end funds. See ETF Proposing Release, supra note 9.

132

See sections 22(e), 2(a)(32) (defining “redeemable security”) and 5(a)(1)-(2) (defining “open-end
company” and “closed-end company”) of the Act.

Companies, Investment Company Act Release No. 19399 (Apr. 7, 1993) [58 FR 19330 (Apr. 14, 1993)]
(“Repurchase Offers Release”), at n.7 and accompanying text.

134

Specifically, rule 23c-3 requires that: (i) a specified percentage of the investment company’s portfolio
consists of assets that can be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business, at approximately the
price at which the investment company has valued the investment, within the period within which the
investment company pays repurchase proceeds; and (ii) the investment company’s board of directors adopts
written procedures reasonably designed, taking into account current market conditions and the company’s
investment objectives, to ensure that the company’s portfolio assets are sufficiently liquid so that the
company can comply with its fundamental policy on repurchases. See rule 23c-3(b)(10)(i), (iii).
Based on staff analysis, there were 26 closed-end interval funds, representing approximately $5.7 billion in
assets, in 2014.

50

are subject to no explicit liquidity requirements under the 1940 Act. 135 Because closed-end
funds, with the exception of closed-end interval funds, are not subject to specific statutory or
regulatory liquidity requirements, we are not proposing to include closed-end funds within the
scope of rule 22e-4. Although closed-end interval funds do have to comply with certain liquidity
standards and therefore must manage their liquidity risk, we believe that the written liquidity
procedures they are required to adopt under rule 23c-3(b)(10)(iii) are adequate given these funds’
more limited liquidity needs. Also, because closed-end interval funds do not permit shareholders
to redeem their shares each day, they may be better able to structure their portfolios to anticipate
their liquidity needs than open-end funds. For these reasons, we are not including these funds
within the proposed scope of rule 22e-4.
UITs, including ETFs structured as UITs, also would not be covered within the scope of
proposed rule 22e-4. A UIT issues redeemable securities, like a traditional open-end fund, which
represent undivided interests in an essentially fixed portfolio of securities. 136 As units of a UIT
series 137 are redeemable, UITs are subject to the requirements of section 22(e). 138
135

See Interval Fund Proposing Release, supra note 83, at text following n.35 (“Closed-end companies are not
subject to a liquidity standard.”).

136

Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, Unit Investment Trusts
(UITs), available at http://www.sec.gov/answers/uit.htm (“UIT Answers”).

137

UITs typically consist of a number of consecutive series, with each series representing units in a specific,
separate portfolio of securities. Unlike traditional open-end investment companies, UITs have no corporate
management structure, and their portfolios are not managed.

138

With respect to UITs that are not ETFs, and that do not serve as separate account vehicles that are used to
fund variable annuity and variable life insurance products, sponsors have historically maintained a
secondary market in UIT units, rather than having the series liquidate portfolio securities to meet
redemptions, because a large number of redemptions could necessitate premature termination of the series.
See Form N-7 for Registration of Unit Investment Trusts under the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Investment Company Act of 1940, Investment Company Act Release No. 15612 (Mar. 9, 1987)
[52 FR 8268 (Mar. 17, 1987)] (“Form N-7 Re-Proposing Release”), at text following n.1; see also UIT
Answers, supra note 136.
At present, however, the majority of UIT assets are attributable to separate account vehicles that are used to
fund variable annuity and variable life insurance products, and the sponsors of these UITs do not typically
maintain a secondary market in UIT units. See infra note 139 and accompanying text.

51

We are not proposing to include UITs within the scope of the proposed rule for a number
of reasons. First, we understand based on staff analysis that approximately 75% of the assets
held in UITs currently serve as separate account vehicles that are used to fund variable annuity
and variable life insurance products. 139 These UITs essentially function as pass-through vehicles,
investing principally in securities of one or more open-end investment companies, which as
discussed above would be subject to the scope of proposed rule 22e-4. 140 Thus, we believe that
the liquidity risk of these UITs would be even more limited if proposed rule 22e-4 were adopted,
because their underlying holdings are funds that would be required to adopt their own liquidity
risk management programs under the proposed rule.
Second, UITs are not actively managed, and their portfolios are not actively traded. A
UIT buys a relatively fixed portfolio of securities, and generally holds them with little change for
the life of the UIT. 141 A UIT does not have a board of directors, corporate officers, or an
investment adviser to render advice during the life of the trust. 142 Accordingly, the provisions of
proposed rule 22e-4, which require a fund’s board to approve and oversee a liquidity risk
management program and the fund’s adviser or officers to administer the program, are thus
inapposite to the management structure of a UIT. 143
Finally, we also are not including UIT ETFs within the scope of proposed rule 22e-4
because UIT ETFs generally track established and widely recognized indices. 144 Moreover, they

See UIT Answers, supra note 136.

142

See id. Because of this lack of management, some UIT trust documents provide that its administrator must
redeem a pro rata share of the trust’s holdings when an investor redeems from a UIT, subject to practical
constraints such as securities with transfer restrictions.

143

See infra section III.D.

144

Based on information from Morningstar as of July 22, 2015, the following ETFs are structured as UITs,

52

fully replicate their underlying indices including with respect to their basket assets. Therefore,
we do not view a liquidity risk management program as necessary or beneficial for UIT ETFs.
We also propose to exclude from the scope of rule 22e-4 all money market funds subject
to the requirements of rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Money market funds are
subject to extensive requirements concerning the liquidity of their portfolio assets. As described
below, these requirements are more stringent than the liquidity-related requirements applicable to
funds that are not money market funds (and that would be applicable to funds that are not money
market funds under proposed rule 22e-4), on account of the historical redemption patterns of
money market fund investors and the assets held by money market funds. 145 Rule 2a-7 includes a
general portfolio liquidity standard, which requires that each money market fund hold securities
that are sufficiently liquid to meet reasonably foreseeable shareholder redemptions in light of its
obligations under section 22(e) of the Act and any commitments the fund has made to
shareholders. 146 Money market funds are also subject to a specific limitation on the acquisition
of illiquid securities. Namely, a money market fund cannot acquire illiquid securities if,
immediately after the acquisition, the fund would have invested more than 5% of its total assets
in illiquid securities. 147 This limit on illiquid asset holdings is more stringent than the corollary
15% guideline for open-end funds that are not money market funds, which as discussed above,

and each ETF tracks the index in its name unless otherwise noted: SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average
ETF Trust, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, SPDR S&P Midcap 400 ETF Trust, Invesco Powershares QQQ
Trust Series 1 (which tracks the NASDAQ 100 Index), and the Invesco BLDRS Index Funds Trust (which
has ETFs tracking the BNY Mellon Asia 50 ADR Index, the BNY Mellon Developed Markets 100 ADR
Index, the BNY Mellon Emerging Markets 50 ADR Index, and the BNY Mellon Europe Select ADR
Index).

147

Rule 2a-7(d)(4)(i).

53

limits a fund’s aggregate holdings of illiquid assets to 15% of the fund’s net assets. 148 In addition
to the 5% limit on money market funds’ illiquid asset holdings, all taxable money market funds
must invest at least 10% of their total assets in “daily liquid assets,” 149 and all money market
funds must invest at least 30% of their total assets in “weekly liquid assets.” 150 There is no
current or proposed corollary requirement for open-end funds that are not money market funds to
invest certain portions of their assets in daily liquid assets or weekly liquid assets.
Money market funds are also subject to liquidity-related disclosure and reporting
requirements. 151 These disclosure and reporting requirements do not currently extend to funds
that are not money market funds, although under the proposed amendments to Form N-PORT,
funds that are not money market funds would be required to report information about each
portfolio asset’s liquidity classification under rule 22e-4 and whether it is a 15% standard
asset. 152
Money market funds also have certain tools at their disposal to manage heavy
redemptions that are not available to other open-end funds. 153 A money market fund is permitted

On the compliance date for the disclosure-related money market fund reforms adopted in 2014
(Apr. 14, 2016), money market funds will be required to disclose each day the percentage of their total
assets invested in daily liquid assets and weekly liquid assets on their websites. See rule 2a-7(h)(10)(ii) (a
money market fund must maintain a schedule, chart, graph, or other depiction on its website showing
historical information about its investments in daily liquid assets and weekly liquid assets for the previous
six months, and must update this historical information each business day, as of the end of the preceding
business day). As of the compliance date, they also will be required to report information about the
liquidity of their portfolio securities on Form N-MFP. See Form N-MFP Items C.21, C.22, and C.23.

152

See infra section III.G.2; proposed Item C.7 of proposed Form N-PORT (requiring a fund to disclose

fund to disclose whether each portfolio security is an illiquid security).

assets fall below 30% of its total assets and the fund’s board determines that imposing a fee or
gate is in the fund’s best interests; if a fund’s weekly liquid asset falls below 10% of total assets,
the fund is required to impose a liquidity fee on redemptions unless the fund’s board determines
that imposing such a fee would not be in the fund’s best interests. 154 Additionally, rule 22e-3
permits a money market fund to suspend redemptions and postpone payment of redemption
proceeds in an orderly liquidation of the fund if, subject to other requirements, the fund’s board
makes certain findings. 155 Because money market funds are required to maintain a liquidity risk
management program, we propose that these funds be excluded from the scope of rule 22e-4.

Request for Comment

While we request detailed comment on each of the specific elements of proposed rule
22e-4 below, here we request comment on the general program requirement of the proposed rule,
as well as the extent to which the proposed program requirement would promote effective
liquidity risk management.

As proposed, rule 22e-4 would require that a fund’s liquidity risk management program
include certain general elements. Do commenters believe that the general elements of the
program would enhance a fund’s ability to assess and manage its liquidity risk? Are

See rule 22e-3(a) (permitting a money market fund to permanently suspend redemptions and liquidate if the
fund’s level of weekly liquid assets falls below 10% of its total assets or, in the case of a fund that is a

deviation between the fund’s amortized cost price per share and its market-based NAV may result in
material dilution or other unfair results to investors or existing shareholders); see also 2014 Money Market

there any elements that should be excluded from the program requirement, or are there
any additional elements that should be included in the program requirement? Should any
of the proposed elements be modified? Do commenters believe that the program would
enhance funds’ management of liquidity risk better than they already do in practice? Do
commenters believe that the program would materially strengthen a fund’s ability to meet
its redemption obligations and would materially reduce potential dilution? Should the
rule focus not just on the liquidity of the fund’s assets but also more specifically and
prominently on its liabilities, such as derivatives obligations, that may affect the liquidity
of the fund?
•

Should the Commission be more prescriptive in requiring a fund to adopt certain specific
policies and procedures for classifying and monitoring the liquidity of portfolio assets,
assessing and periodically reviewing liquidity risk, and/or managing the fund’s liquidity
risk, beyond the proposed requirements of rule 22e-4? If so, what other procedures
should the Commission require? Are there operational challenges associated with any of
the other procedures the Commission could require? To what extent do funds currently
have policies and procedures resembling the proposed program requirements? Have
funds’ current policies and procedures proven effective at managing liquidity risk, and
how have they evolved in recent years? Are these policies and procedures primarily
overseen by a fund’s chief compliance officer, chief risk officer (if any), or someone
else?

We also request comment on the scope of proposed rule 22e-4.
•

Do commenters agree that all open-end funds, including open-end ETFs but excluding
money market funds, should be subject to the program requirement of the proposed rule?

56

If not, why not? Do commenters agree that the proposed program requirement gives
enough flexibility for a fund to adopt a program whose scope, and related costs and
benefits, are adequately tailored for that fund to manage its actual and potential liquidity
risk?
•

Should certain funds or types of funds be excluded from the proposed program
requirement, or subject to a different or less stringent requirement, because their
investment strategies, ownership concentrations, redemption policies, or some other
factor makes them less prone to liquidity risk? If so, which funds or types of funds, and
why? Should smaller funds and smaller fund complexes be excluded from the proposed
program requirement, or subject to a different or less stringent requirement? Why or why
not? How should we distinguish between funds that should be subject to liquidity risk
management program requirements and those that should not? Conversely, are there
particular types of funds (or investment strategies) that are subject to heightened liquidity
risk and should be subject to more prescriptive or stringent requirements under a liquidity
risk management program or otherwise? If so, what types of funds should be considered
to have higher liquidity risk and why? Can these types of funds be easily categorized or
defined? What enhanced liquidity risk management program requirements should be
considered for such funds and why? Are there any types of funds (or investment
strategies) with such limited liquidity that we should consider limiting their ability to be
structured as open-end funds?

•

Do commenters agree that open-end ETFs and ETMFs should be included? If not, why
not? Do commenters believe that ETFs and/or ETMFs incur additional liquidity risk if
they permit redeeming authorized participants to receive cash, rather than an in-kind

57

basket of securities, in exchange for redeemed shares?
•

Should any of the requirements of the proposed rule be modified for ETFs or ETMFs on
account of the relief from section 22(e) some of these funds receive under their
exemptive orders? Should any of the requirements apply differently when an ETF or an
ETMF is organized as a class of an open-end fund or as a feeder fund in a master-feeder
structure where other classes or feeder funds operate as traditional mutual funds?

Exemptive orders for ETF relief include provisions that govern the composition of portfolio
deposits and redemption baskets. In general, portfolio deposits and redemption baskets must
represent pro rata slices of the ETF’s portfolio and must be the same for all purchasers and
redeemers that transact with the ETF on the same day. In recent years, ETF sponsors have
requested increased flexibility in determining the composition of portfolio deposits and
redemption baskets. 156
•

We request comments on whether such flexibility would result in favorable or
unfavorable changes in how ETFs manage the liquidity of their holdings. For example,
would ETFs benefit from reduced cash drag? Would the flexibility enable or encourage
ETFs to reduce the overall liquidity of their portfolios or to hold a greater amount of
relatively illiquid assets? Does the existing 15% guideline adequately address any
concerns regarding liquidity that could result from greater basket flexibility? Would the
requirements we are proposing adequately address any concerns regarding liquidity that
could result from greater basket flexibility? If not, could other requirements adequately
address any concerns?

156

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. on the 2015 ETP Request for Comment
(Aug. 17, 2015) (“At a minimum, we believe it is important that ETF managers have the ability to construct
non-pro rata baskets, subject to compliance and board oversight to help identify and address instances
where the use of such baskets may conflict with the interests of the ETF and its shareholders.”).

58

We request comment on the types of investment products that the Commission proposes not to
include, or to specifically exclude, from the scope of proposed rule 22e-4.
•

Do commenters agree that closed-end funds, including closed-end interval funds, should
not be included within the scope of the proposed rule? Should we make any changes to
the liquidity requirements for closed-end interval funds?

•

Do commenters agree that UITs should not be included within the proposed rule’s scope?
Is there any subset of UITs that should be considered for inclusion, if only for some
aspects of the rule? Is there a significant risk that UITs (or a certain subset of UITs) may
not be able to meet redemption requests? With respect to UITs that are not ETFs, and
that do not serve as separate account vehicles that are used to fund variable annuity and
variable life insurance products, is it reasonable to expect that UIT sponsors would
maintain a secondary market in UIT units to the same extent and in the same manner as
they have historically?

•

Alternatively, should we require UITs to meet certain minimum liquidity requirements at
the time of deposit of the securities, such as requiring a UIT to maintain a prescribed
minimum portion of its net assets in assets that it believes are convertible to cash within
three business days at a price that does not materially affect the value of that asset
immediately prior to the sale? Why or why not? What specific requirements of proposed
rule 22e-4 should be modified for UITs to account for the facts that UITs are not actively
managed, UITs’ portfolios are not actively traded, and UITs do not have a board of
directors, corporate officers, or an investment adviser to render advice during the life of
the trust?

59

•

Is it appropriate that we include ETFs organized as open-end funds but not ETFs
organized as UITs within the rule? Should we exclude from the scope of the rule ETFs
organized as open-end funds that, similar to UIT ETFs, fully track established and widely
recognized indices? Why or why not? Do commenters believe that ETFs organized as
open-end funds would reorganize as UITs in response to the rule? Why or why not?

•

Do commenters agree that we should specifically exclude money market funds from the
scope of proposed rule 22e-4? Is there any subset of money market funds that should be
considered for inclusion, if only for some aspects of the rule?
B.

Classifying the Liquidity of a Fund’s Portfolio Positions Under Proposed
Rule 22e-4

We have not updated the liquidity guidelines applicable to funds and fund portfolio assets
in over two decades, and we believe that developments in the fund industry as well as staff
observations of funds’ current liquidity risk management practices warrant proposing
requirements for classifying the liquidity of funds’ portfolio positions.157 We are aware based on
staff experience that many fund managers engage in analysis of the liquidity of portfolio assets,
beyond considering whether the fund’s portfolio construction is consistent with the 15%
guideline, and we believe that all open-end funds and their shareholders would benefit from a
comprehensive review of the liquidity of funds’ portfolio positions. Staff outreach has shown
that funds today employ notably different procedures for assessing and classifying the liquidity
of their portfolio assets. 158 Some funds have implemented procedures that analyze multiple
157

See supra section II.D.

158

See 2014 Fixed Income Guidance Update, supra note 62; see also BlackRock FSOC Notice Comment
Letter, supra note 50, at 6 (stating that among several overarching principles that provide the foundation for
a prudent market liquidity risk management framework for collective investment vehicles is “[m]easuring

60

aspects relating to an asset’s liquidity, including relevant market, trading, and asset-specific
factors, and monitor whether their initial liquidity determinations should be amended based on
changed conditions. While the 15% guideline requires a binary determination of whether an
asset is liquid or illiquid, funds with relatively comprehensive liquidity classification procedures
tend to view the liquidity of their portfolio assets in terms of a more-liquid to less-liquid
spectrum. 159 This “spectrum”-based approach to liquidity can enhance a fund’s ability to
construct a portfolio whose liquidity profile is calibrated to reflect the fund’s specific liquidity
needs. The staff has observed, however, that other funds, including some with relatively less
liquid strategies, use liquidity classification practices that are substantially less thorough, do not
take relevant factors into account when evaluating portfolio assets’ liquidity and do not
incorporate ongoing liquidity monitoring. To the extent that these practices result in a fund
holding assets that are insufficiently liquid to meet redemptions without materially affecting the
fund’s NAV (assuming that the fund must sell portfolio assets to meet redemptions), we believe
these practices could adversely affect fund investors—either by decreasing the price that
redeeming shareholders will receive for their shares and the price of the shares held by
non-redeeming investors, or if the fund sells its most liquid assets to meet redemptions, by
potentially increasing the liquidity risk of the fund shares held by non-redeeming shareholders.
Due to the foregoing concerns, we are proposing new requirements for classifying and
monitoring the liquidity of funds’ portfolio positions. Under proposed rule 22e-4, a fund would

Invesco FSOC Notice Comment letter, supra note 35, at 11 (stating that their liquidity analysis includes
classifying certain portfolio holdings in liquidity buckets across a liquidity spectrum, utilizing certain
quantitative metrics and qualitative factors).
159

See, e.g., ICI FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 16, at 23 (“While the SEC’s 85 percent liquidity
test requires binary determinations for each portfolio holding…, for broader liquidity management purposes
fund managers think of portfolio holdings as falling along a liquidity continuum.”).

61

be required to classify the liquidity of each of the fund’s positions in a portfolio asset (or portions
of a position in a particular asset) and review the liquidity classification of each of the fund’s
portfolio positions on an ongoing basis. 160 In classifying and reviewing the liquidity of portfolio
positions, proposed rule 22e-4 would require a fund to consider the number of days within which
a fund’s position in a portfolio asset (or portions of a position in a particular asset) would be
convertible to cash at a price that does not materially affect the value of that asset immediately
prior to sale. 161 The proposed rule would require a fund to consider certain specified factors in
classifying the liquidity of its portfolio positions.162
The proposed liquidity categorization process would be in addition to the existing 15%
guideline (which would be retained, as discussed below 163) and would require a fund to assess the
liquidity of its portfolio positions individually, as well as the liquidity profile of the fund as a
whole. A fund would be able to use this assessment, in turn, to establish procedures for
managing its liquidity risk and to determine whether the liquidity of its portfolio reflects its
liquidity needs for meeting shareholder redemptions, thus reducing potential dilution of
non-redeeming shareholders. 164 As described above, we understand that, in practice, funds apply
the 15% guideline to limit the funds’ exposures to particular types of securities that generally
cannot be sold or sold quickly. 165 Although the 15% guideline involves determining whether an

asset can be sold or disposed of within seven days at approximately its stated value, it does not
involve a fund considering whether it can actually receive the proceeds of any sale within seven
days. The 15% guideline also does not involve a fund taking into account any market or other
factors in considering an asset’s liquidity, 166 or assessing whether the fund’s position size in a
particular asset affects the liquidity of that asset. In contrast, the proposed liquidity
categorization approach incorporates each of these aspects, which, as discussed further below,
we believe are critical to comprehensively assessing the liquidity of a fund’s position in a
particular portfolio asset. 167 We thus have come to consider the 15% guideline alone to be
insufficient to limit a fund’s liquidity risk given the fund’s obligations to meet shareholder
redemptions. We believe the principal benefit of the 15% guideline is to limit the ability of
certain highly illiquid strategies, such as private equity, to operate in an open-end fund form.
1.

Proposed Relative Liquidity Classification Categories
a.

Proposed Classification Requirement

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(i) would require a fund to classify each of the fund’s positions
in a portfolio asset (or portions of a position in a particular asset) based on the relative liquidity
of the position. 168 For purposes of proposed rule 22e-4, a fund would assess the relative liquidity
of each portfolio position based on the number of days within which it is determined, using
166

The Commission has, however, discussed factors that would be reasonable for a board of directors to take
into account in assessing the liquidity of a rule 144A security (but which would not necessarily be
determinative). See supra notes 96-97 and accompanying text.

167

In section III.C.4 below, we discuss the interplay between the 15% guideline as proposed to be codified and
the proposed requirement for a fund to invest a set minimum portion of its net assets in three-day liquid
assets.

168

As discussed in detail below, proposed rule 22e-4 would require a fund to assess and manage its liquidity
risk, and these risk assessment and risk management requirements would be based in part on the proposed
liquidity classification requirement set forth in proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(i) and described in this section.
See infra sections III.C.1, III.C.3. We are also proposing to require that a fund disclose information
regarding the liquidity classification of each of the fund’s portfolio positions, as determined pursuant to
proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(i). See infra section III.G.2.

63

information obtained after reasonable inquiry, that the fund’s position in an asset (or a portion of
that asset) would be convertible to cash 169 at a price that does not materially affect the value of
that asset immediately prior to sale. That is, the person who classifies the liquidity of each
portfolio position 170 must determine—using information obtained after reasonable inquiry—the
time period in which the fund would be able to sell the position, at a price that does not
materially affect the value of that asset immediately prior to sale, and settle the sale (i.e., receive
cash for the sale of the asset). With respect to this determination, the term “immediately prior
to sale” is meant to reflect that the fund must determine whether the sales price the fund would
receive for the asset is reasonably expected to move the price of the asset in the market,
independent of other market forces affecting the asset’s value. The term “immediately prior
to sale” is not meant to require a fund to anticipate and determine in advance the precise current
market price or fair value of an asset at the moment before the fund would sell the asset. As
discussed in more detail below, a fund would be required to consider certain specified
market-based, trading, and asset specific factors in determining how long a particular portfolio
position would take to convert to cash. 171
In making this assessment, a fund could determine that different portions of a position in
a particular asset could be converted to cash within different times. If a fund were to conclude,
based on the liquidity classification factors required to be considered, that it would take the fund
longer to convert its entire position in an asset to cash than it would to convert only a portion of
that position to cash, it could determine, for example, that 50% of the position could be
169

See proposed rule 22e-4(a)(3) (defining “convertible to cash” as “the ability to be sold, with the sale
settled”).

management program to the fund’s adviser or officers).

These factors are discussed in detail below. See infra section III.B.2.

converted to cash within 1 day, but the remainder of the position could take up to 3 days to
convert to cash. Staff outreach has shown that some funds currently consider the liquidity
character of their portfolio holdings—particularly relatively large holdings—to be tiered in this
manner, with a certain percentage of the holding deemed to be more liquid than the remainder of
the holding. Proposed rule 22e-4 would thus specify that a fund would be required to adopt
policies and procedures for classifying the liquidity of each of the fund’s positions in a portfolio
asset, or portions of the fund’s position in a particular asset. 172 In this release, any reference to a
fund classifying the liquidity of its position in a particular portfolio asset should be read to also
include circumstances in which the fund would classify the liquidity of portions of a position in a
particular asset.
Based on its determination of the number of days within which the fund could convert its
position in an asset to cash under this standard, the fund would be required to classify each of its
positions in a portfolio asset into one of six liquidity categories:
o Convertible to cash within 1 business day.
o Convertible to cash within 2-3 business days.
o Convertible to cash within 4-7 calendar days. 173
o Convertible to cash within 8-15 calendar days.
o Convertible to cash within 16-30 calendar days.
o Convertible to cash in more than 30 calendar days.
As discussed below, we anticipate that the proposed liquidity categorization approach would
permit a fund to take a more nuanced approach to portfolio construction and liquidity risk

172

calendar day liquidity classification categories).

65

management than an approach under which a fund would simply designate portfolio assets as
liquid or illiquid. The proposed approach also would provide the framework for detailed
reporting and disclosure about the liquidity of funds’ portfolio assets in a structured data format,
as the six liquidity categories described above would be incorporated into the fund’s portfolio
holdings reporting on proposed Form N-PORT. 174 In particular, the structured data format would
increase the ability of Commission staff, investors, and other potential users to aggregate and
analyze the data in a much less labor-intensive manner. This data, in turn, would assist
Commission staff in monitoring risks and trends with respect to funds’ portfolio liquidity (for
example, observing whether portfolio liquidity increases or decreases in response to market
events), and would also permit investors to better evaluate the liquidity profile of funds’
portfolios and better assess the potential for returns and risks of a particular fund. 175 In addition,
the proposed categorization requirement also would provide the foundation for the requirement
for a fund to invest a prescribed minimum percentage of its net assets in “three-day liquid assets”
(that is, any cash held by a fund and any position in an asset, or portion thereof, that the fund
believes is convertible to cash within three business days at a price that does not materially affect
the value of that asset immediately prior to sale). 176
The proposed approach would require a fund to assess the liquidity of its entire position
in a portfolio asset, or each portion of that position, as opposed to the liquidity of the normal
trading lot for that asset. It has been argued that because a fund will not likely need to sell its
entire position in a particular asset under normal market circumstances, liquidity determinations
should be based on the sale of a single trading lot for that asset, except in unusual

circumstances. 177 We agree that the fact that a fund may not be able to convert its entire position
in an asset to cash at a price that does not materially affect the value of that asset immediately
prior to sale should not, by itself, be dispositive of a portfolio asset’s liquidity. Nevertheless,
assessing liquidity only on the basis of the ability to sell and receive cash for a single trading lot
of a portfolio asset ignores the fact that a fund needing to sell certain assets in order to meet
redemptions would almost certainly need to sell greater than one trading lot of a particular asset.
In addition, a fund may need to dispose of an entire position because of deteriorating credit
quality or other portfolio management factors. Similarly, an index fund may need to sell an
entire position in an asset if that asset falls out of the tracked index. The liquidity of the entire
position size thus is relevant to the liquidity of the overall portfolio, a fund’s ability to meet its
stated investment strategy, and a fund’s portfolio management.
The proposed categorization approach also is meant to promote more consistent liquidity
classification practices within the fund industry. Proposed rule 22e-4 would require a fund to
consider certain specified factors, to the extent applicable, with respect to each position in an
asset (or similar asset(s), if data concerning a particular portfolio asset is not available to the
fund). The proposed rule would specify that this consideration must include certain specified
market, trading, and asset-specific factors (each discussed in more detail below), as applicable. 178
We believe that codifying these factors would contribute to more consistency in the quality and
breadth of funds’ analyses of their portfolio positions’ liquidity, while recognizing that funds’
portfolios, and the particular assets included within a portfolio, are diverse and that not every
factor will be relevant to each liquidity determination. We recognize, and anticipate, that

Valuation and Liquidity Issues White Paper”), at 42.

67

different funds could classify the liquidity of identical portfolio positions differently, depending
on their analysis of the factors required to be considered under the proposed rule. There could be
multiple appropriate reasons for this, including different information available to funds at
different times, and fund-specific reasons for classifying the liquidity of a position in a particular
way that are not equally applicable to another fund (for example, in the context of an asset used
for hedging or risk mitigation purposes 179).
Proposed rule 22e-4 does not specify that certain asset classes fall within particular
liquidity categories, because we believe that individual funds would be more effective in
assessing and reviewing their portfolio positions’ liquidity based on an evaluation of market and
asset-specific factors, than the Commission would be in determining asset classes’ liquidity
based on a categorical approach. While we recognize that permitting each fund to determine its
own portfolio positions’ liquidity would likely result in less consistency in funds’ portfolio
position liquidity classifications than specifying by rule which asset classes fall into certain
liquidity categories, we believe that the proposed approach is preferable to an approach that
involves Commission-imposed liquidity classifications of certain asset classes. We are
concerned that an approach involving Commission-imposed liquidity classifications would likely
result in certain assets’ liquidity being overestimated and others’ liquidity being underestimated,
since we believe that a portfolio position’s liquidity character depends on a range of interrelated
factors (as discussed below). 180 Also, we are concerned that Commission-imposed liquidity
classifications would be overly rigid and would be difficult to adjust quickly to reflect changing

179

See infra section III.B.2.i.

180

See infra section III.B.2.

68

market conditions. 181 Thus, we believe that this approach would be more likely to provide an
inaccurate reflection of an asset’s liquidity than the proposed classification approach.
Although we are not proposing an approach that presumes that certain asset classes fall
within particular liquidity categories, we note that if a fund is an outlier with respect to its
liquidity classifications, Commission staff would be able to identify such outlier classifications
based on the fund’s position-level liquidity disclosure on Form N-PORT and determine whether
further inquiry is appropriate. 182 If Commission staff does determine to examine a fund’s
liquidity classifications based on the fund’s Form N-PORT disclosure, it would be able to
examine whether the fund considered the required factors in classifying the liquidity of its
portfolio positions. Thus, while the actual liquidity classifications assigned to funds’ portfolio
positions could vary from fund to fund, the proposed approach provides a regulatory framework
that should promote consistency in funds’ liquidity classification practices.
The proposed approach to liquidity classification reflects our understanding that many
funds evaluate assets’ liquidity across a liquidity spectrum, as opposed to making a binary
determination of whether an asset is liquid or illiquid. As discussed above, Commission staff
outreach to funds has shown us that it is common for funds to treat portfolio assets as relatively
liquid or illiquid compared to other portfolio assets, and some funds “score” the liquidity of their
portfolio holdings based on a variety of factors, including the period of time it takes to convert
the holdings to cash, similar to those that we are proposing. We also understand that some

181

See, e.g., Flash Crash Staff Report, supra note 124 (noting that, while “[t]he U.S. Treasury market is the
deepest and most liquid government securities market in the world,” liquidity conditions in the market for
U.S. Treasury securities became “significantly strained” during the October 2015 “Flash Crash”).

182

See infra section III.G.2.

69

third-party service providers currently provide data and analyses assessing the relative liquidity
of a fund’s portfolio assets. 183
A nuanced liquidity classification approach has practical benefits in terms of managing
liquidity to meet anticipated redemptions. Because we understand based on staff outreach that
many funds today consider very few, if any, of their portfolio assets to be holdings limited by the
15% guideline, we believe that the proposed spectrum-based approach to liquidity classification
acknowledges the liquidity variation in funds’ portfolio positions better than the current
framework, in which a fund could consider its entire portfolio (or a significant portion of the
portfolio) to be simply “liquid.” We believe that this approach would permit a fund to better
plan how it would meet redemptions occurring in a day, a week, or some other period, by
categorizing asset positions in terms of the respective times in which they could be converted to
cash and constructing the fund’s portfolio in order to manage its expected and reasonably
foreseeable redemptions during these periods. The proposed liquidity classification approach
also would enhance a fund's ability to adjust its portfolio composition in anticipation of, or in
reaction to, adverse events, or to comply with its investment strategy or mandate.
The proposed approach would provide the framework for reporting and disclosure about
the liquidity of funds’ portfolio assets that would permit our staff to better monitor liquidity
trends and funds’ liquidity risk profiles, and also would help investors and other market
participants assess funds’ relative liquidity. As discussed below, we are proposing amendments
to proposed Form N-PORT that would require a fund to indicate the liquidity classification of
each of a fund’s portfolio positions.184 Funds are not currently required to disclose information

183

See infra note 205 and accompanying paragraph.

184

See infra section III.G.2.a.

70

about the liquidity of their portfolio assets, although Item C.7 of Form N-PORT, as proposed
earlier this year, would require that each fund report whether each particular portfolio security is
an “illiquid asset” and defines illiquid assets in terms of current Commission guidelines. 185
Requiring a fund to classify the liquidity of each portfolio position also would facilitate fulsome
reporting of a fund’s liquidity profile on Form N-PORT. As discussed below, we believe that the
proposed N-PORT reporting requirements would permit enhanced Commission monitoring and
oversight of the fund industry and would result in investor protection benefits, because we
believe the proposed requirements would permit investors (particularly institutional investors), as
well as academic researchers, financial analysts, and economic research firms, to use the
liquidity-related data reported on Form N-PORT to evaluate fund portfolios and related risks. 186
The time frames associated with the proposed liquidity categories reflect our
understanding of some of the relevant periods that some funds currently consider in assessing the
liquidity of a fund’s portfolio assets. 187 There are many ways in which identifying portfolio
positions that are convertible to cash in one business day or two-to-three business days could
enhance a fund’s ability to calibrate its liquidity profile in order to manage its expected and
reasonably foreseeable redemptions during these periods. 188 For example, if a fund discloses that

See supra note 118 and accompanying text; see also infra notes 563-565 and accompanying text.

186

See infra sections III.G.2.a; IV.C.3.b.

187

We note that Question 32 on Form PF requests information regarding the percentage of the reporting fund’s
portfolio capable of being liquidated within certain time frames. See supra note 70 for additional
information about Form PF. However, the time frames associated with the liquidity categories in proposed
rule 22e-4 are different from those incorporated in Form PF Question 32 on account of the different
redemption obligations of registered funds versus private funds, as well as, relatedly, the different liquidity
profile of registered funds’ portfolio assets (generally) versus private funds’ portfolio assets.

188

With respect to the one-day and two-to-three-day liquidity categories, we are proposing to incorporate a
convertible-to-cash time period that is based on business days instead of calendar days, in order to
minimize unnecessary re-classifications of portfolio positions that could affect data analyses of a fund’s
Form N-PORT data reporting regarding these positions. If these two liquidity categories were based on
calendar days instead of business days, a portfolio position reported on a Friday might be considered to be

71

it will generally pay redemption proceeds within one business day after receiving a shareholder’s
redemption request (although it may delay payment for seven calendar days, as permitted by
section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act), it would be required to identify portfolio assets
that, if needed, could be converted to cash within one day. Many funds that do not pay
redemption proceeds within a day of receiving a redemption request nevertheless may pay
redemption proceeds within a time period shorter than the seven days required by section 22(e).
For example, because rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, which became effective in 1995,
established three business days as the standard settlement period for securities trades effected by
a broker-dealer, this rule effectively requires most funds to pay redemption proceeds within three
business days after receiving a redemption request, because a broker or dealer will be involved in
the redemption process. 189 Market participants also are exploring further reducing this settlement
period from T+3 to T+2, and possibly eventually to T+1. 190 Likewise, even funds that do not
disclose that they will pay redemption proceeds within periods shorter than seven days may find
convertible to cash within three calendar days (because markets would not be open over the weekend), but
the same portfolio position reported on a different weekday would be considered to be convertible to cash
within one or two calendar days. This could cause a fund to have to re-classify portfolio positions based on
the reporting date, and this re-classification could skew analyses that the Commission staff or other parties
conduct using Form N-PORT data. Because the required classification is the most granular in shortest-term
liquidity categories, we believe such reporting consistency is particularly important. However, after the
one-day and two-to-three-day liquidity categories, we are proposing to switch to a calendar day framework
both to tie to the seven calendar day requirement for meeting redemptions under section 22(e) of the Act
and because the longer the timeframe is to convert the asset to cash, the more we recognize the timeframe
is likely to be a less precise estimate and thus the additional precision from the business day categorization
is less likely to be material to the classification.
189

See Securities Transactions Settlement Release, supra note 74. In 2004, the Commission issued a concept
release seeking input on, among other things, the benefits and costs associated with implementing a
settlement cycle for most broker-dealer transactions that is shorter than three days. Concept Release:

[69 FR 12922 (Mar. 18, 2004)] (“Securities Transactions Settlement Concept Release”).
Several comments from asset managers received in response to the FSOC Notice noted that, as a practical
matter, the three-business-day settlement requirements of rule 15c6-1 effectively take most fund
investments to a T+3 settlement timeline. See, e.g., SIFMA IAA FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra

it useful to identify portfolio positions that may be converted to cash quickly (i.e., within three
business days or shorter) in order to meet unexpected or unusually high redemption requests, or
to rebalance or otherwise adjust a portfolio’s composition quickly.
Along with identifying positions that may be converted to cash within either one business
day or two-to-three business days, we believe that identifying each “less liquid asset”—that is,
any position in an asset (or portion of a position in a particular asset) that is not a three-day liquid
asset 191—would enhance a fund’s ability to determine the portion of the fund’s portfolio that the
fund may not be able to rely on selling to meet redemption requests within the three-day period
required by rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, or within some shorter period. 192 Among less
liquid assets, some may be convertible to cash in just over three business days, others may not be
convertible to cash for a year or more, and still others may fall in between these two extremes.
To reflect this, we are proposing four categories of less liquid assets: positions convertible to
cash within four-to-seven calendar days, eight-to-fifteen calendar days, sixteen-to-thirty calendar
days, and over-thirty calendar days. 193
Determining whether a portfolio position is convertible to cash within four-to-seven
calendar days would enhance a fund’s ability to identify those positions that are not immediately
or very quickly convertible to cash (i.e., those positions convertible to cash within one, two, or
three business days), but that nevertheless could be converted to cash in a time frame that would
permit funds to pay redeeming shareholders within the seven-day period established by section
22(e). For example, for a fund that typically sells its most liquid assets to meet redemptions, the

73

four-to-seven day liquidity category could assist the fund in constructing a second layer of
portfolio liquidity to meet redemptions using liquidity within the fund even after it has sold or
disposed of its most liquid assets. 194 We anticipate that funds could determine that a variety of
securities within different asset classes could be converted to cash within four-to-seven calendar
days, depending on facts and circumstances.
We understand that circumstances could arise in which the settlement period for a
particular portfolio position could be viewed either as two-to-three business days or
four-to-seven calendar days. For example, if a sale were to occur on a Thursday and be settled
on a Monday, the settlement period could be viewed either as two business days or four calendar
days. Because this could cause ambiguity for reporting purposes, 195 in situations in which the
settlement period could be viewed either as two-to-three business days or four-to-seven calendar
days, a fund should classify the portfolio position based on the shorter settlement period (i.e.,
two-to-three business days, not four-to-seven calendar days). 196
We believe that the eight-to-fifteen calendar day and sixteen-to-thirty calendar day
categories of less liquid assets would distinguish a position that is convertible to cash in close to
seven calendar days (i.e., close to the required redemption period established by section 22(e))
from one that takes significantly longer (i.e., close to a month) to convert to cash. For example,
if a fund were to enter into a period of extended redemptions that it anticipates would last for
multiple days, it could begin trying to liquidate eight-to-fifteen day assets in order to plan to

See supra text accompanying and following note 37 (discussing the fact that a fund that sells its most liquid
assets to meet redemptions minimizes the effect of the redemptions on short-term fund performance for
redeeming and remaining investors, but may leave remaining investors in a potentially less liquid and
riskier fund until the fund rebalances).

meet redemptions that would occur more than a week in the future. The over-thirty calendar day
category is meant to identify those portfolio positions that are the least liquid, including those
that may have very extended settlement periods.
Assets with settlement periods longer than three business days would be considered less
liquid assets. Assets also should be classified under the rule based on typical expected settlement
periods for transactions in that asset in the particular jurisdiction, and not based on the prospect
of gaining expedited settlement of the purchase or sale upon request. Transactions in certain
types of securities have historically entailed lengthy settlement periods. For example,
transactions in certain foreign securities, 197 agency mortgage-backed securities (other than
secondary market trades), 198 and U.S. bank loan participations 199 typically require settlement
periods of more than three business days. An asset having a shorter settlement period could also
be considered to be a less liquid asset, however, if a fund were to determine, based on the factors
required to be assessed under the proposed rule, that it could not sell its position in the asset and

Request for Comment

We request comment on the proposed requirements for classifying the relative liquidity
of a fund’s portfolio positions.
•

What procedures or practices do funds currently use to assess and classify the liquidity of
portfolio assets? Have these procedures proven effective in the past? If not, under what
circumstances were they ineffective, and why? Have funds modified their procedures for
assessing and classifying liquidity in recent years to account for changes in market
structure and the advent of new types of market participants? If so, how? Who at the
fund and/or the adviser is tasked with assessing the liquidity of the funds’ portfolio
assets? Are any third-party service providers used in assessing portfolio assets’ liquidity,
and if so, how are such service providers used and what are the costs associated with their
services? Would the proposed requirements require funds to make systems modifications
and what costs would be associated with any potential system modifications? What
would the associated costs and other burdens be for funds to assess and classify the
liquidity of portfolio assets?

•

Do commenters agree that it would be useful for a fund to consider portfolio positions’
liquidity in terms of a spectrum instead of a binary determination that an asset is liquid or
illiquid, and do funds currently consider the relative liquidity of portfolio assets by
classifying assets (either explicitly or informally) into multiple liquidity categories? If
so, what categories are used, and why? Alternatively, should we define the term “illiquid
assets?” Why or why not? If so, how should we define it?

76

•

Do funds currently consider the period in which a fund’s position in an asset can be
converted into cash (that is, sold, with the sale settled) in assessing and classifying the
liquidity of portfolio assets? Do commenters agree that it would be useful for a fund to
assess the liquidity of its entire position in a portfolio asset, or portions of a position in a
particular asset, as opposed to the liquidity of a single trading lot of a portfolio asset held
by the fund? Do funds currently consider the ability to sell varying portions of a fund’s
position in a portfolio asset (fractions of the position, as well as the entire position) in
assessing that asset’s liquidity?

•

What assumptions, estimations, and judgments would funds need to make in order to
determine liquidity classifications, and how would these assumptions, estimations, and
judgments affect the comparability of reporting across funds? Are there concerns, such
as proprietary or liability concerns, associated with reporting liquidity classifications
based on such assumptions, estimations, and judgments?

•

The proposed rule would require a fund to determine, using information obtained after
reasonable inquiry, the number of days within which a fund’s position in a portfolio asset
(or portion of a position in a particular asset) would be convertible to cash at a price that
does not materially affect the value of that asset immediately prior to sale. Do
commenters believe that the terms “information obtained using reasonably inquiry,” “at a
price that does not materially affect the value of that asset,” and “immediately prior to
sale” are sufficiently clear? If not, how could they be made clearer?

•

Do the proposed liquidity categories reflect the manner in which funds currently assess
and categorize the liquidity of their portfolio holdings as part of their portfolio and risk
management? Should we increase or decrease the number of liquidity categories to

77

which a fund might assign a portfolio position? For example, should we combine the last
three liquidity categories (convertible to cash within 8-15, 16-30, or in more than 30
calendar days) into one liquidity classification category (e.g., “convertible to cash in
more than 7 calendar days”)? Why or why not? Should we add one or more liquidity
categories outside of the more than 30 calendar day time period (e.g., “convertible to cash
in more than 90 calendar days”)? Why or why not? Should we revise the time periods
associated with any of the proposed liquidity categories? Alternatively, should we permit
a fund to classify the liquidity of its portfolio securities based not on conversion-to-cash
time periods specified by the Commission, but instead based on conversion-to-cash time
periods that the fund determines to be appropriate (taking into account the fund’s
redemption obligations)? Would such an approach diminish comparability in funds’
reporting of their liquidity assessment on proposed Form N-PORT, discussed below?
•

Regarding the proposed liquidity categories that would be associated with less liquid
assets, is there any reason why an asset with a settlement period longer than three
business days should not be deemed to be a less liquid asset? What types of funds would
be largely composed of assets that would be considered less liquid assets under proposed
rule 22e-4?

•

To what extent do commenters anticipate that assets in the eight-to-fifteen calendar days,
sixteen-to-thirty calendar days, and over-thirty calendar days classification categories
under the proposed rule overlap with assets that funds currently consider to be limited by
the 15% guideline?

78

•

Are the proposed liquidity categories appropriate for ETFs and ETMFs? Should ETFs
and ETMFs that transact primarily in kind be permitted to have different liquidity
categories? If so, what categories and why?

•

Should smaller funds or funds pursuing particular types of investment strategies be
permitted to have different liquidity categories? If so, how should we define those
subsets of funds?

•

Should we use business days or calendar days for all the liquidity classification
categories, rather than using business days in the shorter categories, but calendar days for
the longer categories? If we used calendar days for all the categories, how could we
avoid changes in asset classification based on whether the asset was held near a
weekend? In addition, if we used calendar days, how could we obtain information on
which assets could be converted to cash within the three business day requirement in rule
15c6-1? If we used business days for all categories, how could we obtain information on
which assets could be converted to cash within the seven calendar day (as opposed to
business day) requirement for payment of redemption proceeds under section 22(e) of the
Act?

Factors to Consider in Classifying the Liquidity of a Portfolio Position

Staff outreach to the fund industry has highlighted certain common factors that some
funds use in evaluating portfolio assets’ liquidity. Specifically, the most comprehensive liquidity
analyses take into account relevant market-based, trading, and asset-specific factors in assessing
a fund’s ability to convert a position in a portfolio asset (or portions of a position in a particular
asset) to cash at approximately its stated value during current market conditions. The
Commission has previously provided examples of factors that would be reasonable for a board of

79

directors to consider in assessing the liquidity of a rule 144A security, 200 and outreach has shown
that certain funds reference these factors when considering the liquidity of all portfolio assets
(not just rule 144A securities). Other funds, however, classify the liquidity of their portfolio
assets using substantially less thorough practices (e.g., assuming, without individualized
analysis, that certain asset classes are always liquid or always illiquid). As discussed above, we
believe that a nuanced classification approach may have practical benefits in improving how
funds manage liquidity to meet anticipated redemptions. 201
Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii) would require a fund to take the following factors into
account, to the extent applicable, when classifying the liquidity of each portfolio position in a
particular asset:
o Existence of an active market for the asset, including whether the asset is listed on an
exchange, as well as the number, diversity, and quality of market participants;
o Frequency of trades or quotes for the asset and average daily trading volume of the asset
(regardless of whether the asset is a security traded on an exchange);
o Volatility of trading prices for the asset;
o Bid-ask spreads for the asset;
o Whether the asset has a relatively standardized and simple structure;
o For fixed income securities, maturity and date of issue;
o Restrictions on trading of the asset and limitations on transfer of the asset;
o The size of the fund’s position in the asset relative to the asset’s average daily trading
volume and, as applicable, the number of units of the asset outstanding; and
o Relationship of the asset to another portfolio asset.

200

See supra note 96 and accompanying text.

201

See supra paragraphs accompanying note 178 and following note 183.

80

These factors are based on those certain investment advisers consider when
systematically evaluating the liquidity of portfolio assets. 202 We are proposing to require that all
funds take into account these factors, as applicable, to encourage effective liquidity assessment
across the fund industry. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. We recognize that the specific
factors appropriate for consideration could vary depending on the issuer and the particular asset,
and therefore an evaluation of a particular portfolio position’s liquidity could focus more heavily
on certain factors and less on others. In evaluating the liquidity of its portfolio positions, a fund
could also take into account other pertinent factors in addition to those set forth in proposed rule
22e-4(b)(2)(ii). However, a fund would be required to consider, as applicable, the proposed rule
22e-4(b)(2)(ii) factors as a minimum set of considerations to be used in classifying the liquidity
of each portfolio position.
If a fund lacks pertinent information about a portfolio asset, the fund would be required to
consider the proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii) factors as applied to similar assets (for purposes of this
release, “comparable assets”). 203 For example, if a fund has never before invested in a particular
asset—particularly, an asset that does not trade frequently and for which market data is not
generally available or is of low quality—the fund could estimate the time it would take to
convert the asset to cash if better market data were available for comparable assets (for example,
as applicable, assets that are similar in terms of duration, credit quality, bid-ask spread, and/or
maturity). Under these circumstances, a fund would be required to evaluate all applicable
202

See, e.g., ICI FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 16, at 23 (“Specific information that may
contribute further to the manager’s view of an asset’s liquidity may include: (i) assessments of bid-ask
spreads, volumes, depth of secondary market for the asset, information from pricing vendors, and other
data; (ii) deliberations among portfolio managers and traders regarding valuation and liquidity; (iii) analysis
of the capital structure and credit quality of the asset/holding; (iv) the “newness” of a bond issue (newer
issues tend to be more liquid); and (v) liquidity data provided by third parties. Some fund managers assign
“liquidity scores” to particular holdings based on these types of factors.”).

203

See proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii).

81

22e-4(b)(2)(ii) factors with respect to the comparable assets. If data concerning a portfolio asset
(as opposed to the comparable assets) were to become available to a fund, we would expect that
a fund would assess, as part of its ongoing review of the liquidity classifications assigned to each
portfolio position, whether the liquidity classification given to the portfolio asset is appropriate in
light of newly available data. 204
We understand that some third-party service providers currently provide data and
analyses assessing the relative liquidity of a fund’s portfolio assets, 205 and we believe that a fund
could also appropriately use this type of data to inform or supplement its consideration of the
proposed liquidity classification factors. However, before doing so, a fund should consider
having the person(s) at the fund or investment adviser tasked with administering the fund’s
liquidity risk management program review the quality of the data received from third parties, as
well as the particular methodologies used and metrics analyzed by third parties, to determine
whether this data would effectively inform or supplement the fund’s consideration of the
proposed liquidity classification factors. This review could include an assessment of whether
modifications to an “off-the-shelf” product are necessary to accurately reflect the liquidity
characteristics of the fund’s portfolio holdings.
In the following sections, we discuss each of the proposed liquidity classification factors
and provide guidance on specific issues associated with each of these factors that a fund may
wish to consider in evaluating the liquidity of its portfolio positions.

204

See infra section III.B.3.a.

205

These third-party vendors may, for example, create liquidity scores for a fund’s portfolio assets based on
factors such as duration, rating, bid-ask spreads, and instrument maturity, and provide models that reflect
how an asset’s liquidity may be affected by different market conditions.

82

a.

Existence of Active Market, Including Whether the Asset Is Listed on an
Exchange, and the Number, Diversity, and Quality of Market Participants

Under proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii)(A), a fund would be required to consider, to the
extent applicable, the existence of an active market for the asset, including whether the asset is
listed on an exchange, as well as the number, diversity, and quality of market participants.
The manner in which a fund may sell a particular portfolio asset, including whether an
asset is listed on an exchange, can affect that asset’s liquidity. While in general, being listed on a
developed and recognized exchange increases an asset’s liquidity, 206 the fact that an asset is
exchange-traded does not necessarily mean that a fund would be able to convert that asset to cash
within a relatively short period. For example, a small-cap equity stock might be listed on an
exchange but trade quite infrequently, which would tend to decrease its relative liquidity.
Conversely, certain securities that are traditionally traded in over-the-counter (“OTC”) markets,
such as corporate bonds, could be considered more liquid if, for instance, they are frequently
traded and there are generally a substantial number of bids to purchase the security. As an
extreme example, short-term securities issued (or guaranteed as to principal and interest) by the
U.S. government do not trade on exchanges, but are typically considered to be quite liquid. 207

206

See, e.g., Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Basel III: The Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Liquidity
Risk Monitoring Tools (Jan. 2013), at part 1, section II.A.1, available at
http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs238.pdf; see also Nuveen FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 45, at 9
(“While securities that trade on exchanges… or in deep principal/over-the-counter (“OTC”) markets (e.g.,
U.S. Treasuries) are generally liquid even in stressed markets, other securities that trade on an OTC basis…
have faced increasing liquidity challenges in normal markets and can be subject to insufficient quality bids
in times of stress as market makers pull back their capital. This can make it not only more difficult to sell
these securities, but also to accurately value those assets that are retained.”).

207

See rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(A)(1) under the Exchange Act (describing securities haircuts for securities issued
or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States or any agency thereof); see also Liquidity
Coverage Ratio: Liquidity Risk Measurement Standards (Sept. 9, 2014) [79 FR 61440 (Oct. 10, 2014)]
(“Liquidity Coverage Ratio Release”) (in liquidity coverage ratio rule adopted by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, “Level 1 Liquid Assets” are described as securities issued or unconditionally
guaranteed as to timely payment of principal and interest by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and
liquid and readily-marketable securities issued or unconditionally guaranteed as to the timely payment of

83

The means of trading a portfolio asset can affect its liquidity regardless of whether the
asset is a security traded on an exchange. For example, whether an asset is traded in a bilateral
transaction with a single dealer, or through an electronic auction mechanism whereby a trader
can simultaneously contact multiple counterparties, can have different effects on that asset’s
liquidity. 208 The choice of trading mechanism may have different liquidity effects depending on
the asset being traded and other market conditions, and therefore it is difficult to make general
statements regarding the correlation between a particular trading mechanism and the liquidity of
the asset being traded. However, a fund should consider past experience in using different
trading mechanisms to sell a particular asset (or similar assets), when assessing the liquidity of a
portfolio position in that asset.
In addition, there are multiple considerations that a fund could assess in evaluating the
diversity and quality of market participants for a particular asset. A fund may wish to consider
the number of market makers on both the buying and selling sides of transactions. A fund also
may consider the quality of market participants who purchase and sell units of a particular
portfolio asset, and may wish to assess, in particular: the market participant’s capitalization; the
reliability of the market participant’s trading platform(s); and the market participant’s experience
and reputation transacting in various types of assets. We believe that the diversity and quality of
market participants are meaningful in assessing a portfolio position’s liquidity because the most
liquid assets tend to have active sale or repurchase markets at all times with diverse market
principal and interest by any other U.S. government agency (provided that its obligations are fully and
explicitly guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government)). But see Flash Crash Staff
Report, supra note 124 (noting that, while “[t]he U.S. Treasury market is the deepest and most liquid
government securities market in the world,” liquidity conditions in the market for U.S. Treasury securities
became “significantly strained” during the October 2015 “Flash Crash”).

participants. 209 The presence of multiple market makers may be a sign that a market is liquid. 210
Diversity of market participants, on both the buying and selling sides of transactions, is also an
important factor for a fund to consider because it tends to reduce market concentration and may
facilitate a market remaining liquid during periods of stress. 211
b.

Frequency of Trades or Quotes and Average Daily Trading Volume

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii)(B) would require a fund to consider the frequency of trades
and quotes for a particular asset in evaluating the liquidity of a portfolio position in that asset, as
well as the asset’s average daily trading volume, regardless of whether the asset is a security
traded on an exchange.
In general, the greater the frequency of trades for an asset (and, relatedly, the greater the
frequency of bid and ask quotes for that asset), the more liquid that asset is. However, this is not
a perfect or complete measure, and trade size also should be considered in assessing the
relationship between trade frequency and liquidity. For example, 100 trades at $100 might or
might not signify greater liquidity than 50 trades at $200, although they are likely to suggest

209

See, e.g., Abdourahmane Sarr & Tonny Lybek, Measuring Liquidity in Financial Markets, IMF Working
Paper (Dec. 2002), available at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2002/wp02232.pdf (“Liquid
markets tend to exhibit five characteristics: (i) tightness (ii) immediacy, (iii) depth, (iv) breadth, and
(v) resiliency.”).

See, e.g., Sunil Wahal, Entry, Exit, Market Makers, and the Bid-Ask Spread, 10 REV. OF FIN. STUD. 871
(1997), available at http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~keechung/MGF743/Readings/H1.pdf (“Large-scale
entry (exit) is associated with substantial declines (increases) in quoted end-of-day inside spreads, even
after controlling for the effects of changes in volume and volatility. The spread changes are larger in
magnitude for issues with few market makers; however, even for issues with a large number of market
makers, substantial changes in quoted spreads take place.”).

See, e.g., Amir Rubin, Ownership Level, Ownership Concentration, and Liquidity, 10 J. FIN. MARKETS 219
(Aug. 2007), available at http://www.sfu.ca/~arubin/JFM_2006074.pdf (“We examine the link between the
liquidity of a firm’s stock and its ownership structure, specifically, how much of the firm’s stock is owned
by insiders and institutions, and how concentrated is their ownership. We find that the liquidity-ownership
relation is mostly driven by institutional ownership rather than insider ownership. Importantly, liquidity is
positively related to total institutional holdings but negatively related to institutional block holdings.”).

85

better liquidity than one trade at $10,000. 212 In evaluating the frequency of trades (and bid and
ask quotes) for an asset, a fund should generally consider, among other relevant factors, the
number of dealers quoting prices for that asset, the number of other potential purchasers and
sellers, and dealer undertakings to make a market in the asset.
High average trading volume also tends to be correlated with greater liquidity. In
general, the greater the average daily trading volume for a particular portfolio asset, the deeper
the market, and the more likely it is that a fund would be able to convert its position to cash at a
price that does not materially affect the value of that asset immediately prior to sale. 213 A fund
may wish to particularly consider the number of days a particular asset has shown zero trading
volume during the prior month, year, or other relevant period, as this could indicate particularly
limited liquidity. High trading volume is not always indicative of available liquidity for a
particular asset, however. For example, high trading volumes might be associated with high
selling pressure on the asset and trades at that time may have a high price impact. 214

managers’ attention to market risks indicated by . . . shrinking transaction volumes which exacerbate the
impact cost for additional trading”).
We note that double-counting of trades is a potential issue to consider when assessing average trading
volume. Double-counting occurs because of differences between dealer and auction markets. In a dealer
market, trades are “double-counted” because the dealer buys from person A and then sells to person B. In
an auction market, person A and B trade directly. See, e.g., Anne M. Anderson & Edward A. Dyl, Trading

86

Assets that are components of widely followed market indices tend to have relatively
high trading volume, and therefore relatively high liquidity compared to other assets. If a
security is included in such an index, market participants are likely to invest in the security in
order to replicate the index. This, in turn, will increase demand and trading volume for the
security, therefore increasing the security’s liquidity compared to securities not in such an
index.215 Additionally, index components are selected, with a goal of promoting replicability of
the index, based on multiple factors including liquidity screens, which in turn may be based on
an asset’s trading volume. 216 A security’s inclusion in a widely followed market index therefore
suggests relatively high trading volume, and thus a greater level of liquidity relative to similar
securities that were not chosen to be part of such an index (e.g., a high-yield corporate bond
included in a widely followed market index would likely be more liquid than an otherwise
similar high-yield corporate bond that is not a component of such an index).
c.

Volatility of Trading Prices

Under proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii)(C), a fund would be required to consider the
volatility of trading prices for a particular portfolio asset when evaluating the liquidity of a
position in that asset. In general, there is an inverse relationship between liquidity and
volatility, 217 as lack of liquidity in a particular asset tends to amplify price volatility for that

historically experienced liquidity disruptions during periods of extreme market volatility, such as
the June 2013 “taper tantrum.” 219 For these reasons, we believe that trading price volatility is
potentially a valuable metric to consider in determining an asset’s liquidity.
d.

Bid-Ask Spreads

Bid-ask spreads—the difference between bid and offer prices for a particular asset—have
historically been viewed as a useful measure for assessing the liquidity of assets that trade in the
OTC markets. 220 A fund would thus be required, under proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii)(D), to
consider a portfolio asset’s bid-ask spreads in evaluating the liquidity of a position in that asset.
The bid-ask spread of a particular fixed income asset is related to the riskiness of that asset, as
well as the length of time that a broker-dealer believes it will have to hold the asset before selling
it. 221 In general, high bid-ask spreads for a particular asset correlate with a lack of liquidity in

volatility shocks are positively and significantly correlated across stock and bond markets).
218

See, e.g., Prachi Deuskar, Extrapolative Expectation: Implications for Volatility and Liquidity (Aug. 2007),

(“Illiquidity amplifies supply shocks, increasing realized volatility of prices, which feeds into subsequent
volatility forecasts.”); see also Fidelity FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 20, at 21 (“Liquidity
management is linked to portfolio managers’ attention to market risks indicated by…increasing marketand security-specific volatility.”).

In May 2013, Ben Bernanke, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, announced that the Federal
Reserve may start scaling back its asset purchase program—in which the Federal Reserve purchased
approximately $85 billion worth of bonds and mortgage-backed securities each month—sooner than
investors expected. This caused interests rates on fixed income products to spike, and bond prices to fall
dramatically. This market dislocation came to be known as the “taper tantrum.” See Condon & Kearns,

financial crisis, bid-ask spreads on U.S. investment grade bonds were notably elevated. 222
However, bid-ask spreads alone do not necessarily provide a comprehensive understanding of an
asset’s liquidity. For instance, bid-ask spreads are often constrained by the increments in which
prices are quoted. 223
e.

Standardization and Simplicity of Structure

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii)(E) would require a fund to consider whether a portfolio
asset has a relatively standardized and simple structure in evaluating the liquidity of a position in
that asset. Assets that trade OTC with terms set at issuance such as sizes, maturities, coupons,
and payment dates tend to be relatively more liquid compared to similarly situated assets without
standardized terms. The issue of standardization is particularly significant with respect to the
corporate bond market, since corporate issuers commonly have large numbers of bonds
outstanding, and trading can be fragmented among that universe of bonds. For example, while

While both spreads and depths (quoted and on the limit order book) declined after the NYSE’s change from
eighths to sixteenths, depth declined throughout the entire limit order book as well. The combined effect of
smaller spreads and reduced cumulative limit order book depth has made liquidity demanders trading small
orders better off; however, traders who submitted larger orders in lower volume stocks did not benefit,
especially if those stocks were low priced.”); Hendrik Bessembinder, Tick Size, Spreads, and Liquidity: An

each of the top ten largest issuers in the United States had one common equity security
outstanding as of April 2014, these issuers collectively had more than 9,000 bonds
outstanding. 224 Conversely, some types of OTC-traded securities exhibit a relatively high level
of standardization, such as government and agency bonds, futures contracts, and certain swap
contracts. Central clearing of certain OTC-traded securities, which generally requires the terms
of these securities to be highly standardized, has been associated with an increase in these assets’
liquidity, as measured by factors such as the bid-ask spreads for these assets and the number of
dealers providing quotes for these assets. 225 While standardization of a particular security
contract alone is not indicative of that security’s liquidity, standardization can increase liquidity
by simplifying the ability to quote and trade securities, enhancing operational efficiency to
execute and settle trades, and improving secondary market transparency.

assessing the liquidity of the fund’s position in that asset. In general, a fixed income asset trades
most frequently in the time directly following issuance, and its trading volume decreases in the
asset’s remaining time to maturity. 226 Thus “on-the-run” securities (that is, bonds or notes of a
particular maturity that were most recently issued) tend to trade significantly more frequently
than their “off-the-run” counterparts (that is, bonds or notes issued before the most recently
issued bond or note of a particular maturity). 227 Because high trading volume generally suggests
relatively higher liquidity, 228 a fixed income asset’s date of issuance and maturity (which in turn
are generally correlated with the trading volume of a fixed income asset) together are important
liquidity indicators. We understand, based on staff outreach and industry knowledge, that
remaining time to maturity is a key factor that fixed income funds commonly consider in
assessing the liquidity of their portfolio positions.

Restrictions on Trading and Limitations on Transfer

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii)(G) would require a fund to consider any restrictions on
trading a particular asset, and limitations on transfers of that asset, in evaluating the liquidity of a

the Bid-Ask Spread in Corporate, Government and Municipal Bond Markets, Federal Reserve Board of

http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=163139.

227

The on-the-run phenomenon refers to the fact that, in fixed income markets, securities with nearly identical
cash flows trade at different yields and with different liquidity. In particular, most recently issued (i.e.,
on-the-run) government bonds of a certain maturity are generally more liquid than previously issued (i.e.,
off-the-run or old) bonds maturing on similar dates. See, e.g., Paolo Pasquariello & Clara Vega, The
on-the-run liquidity phenomenon, 92 J. OF FIN. ECON. 1 (Apr. 2009), available at

portfolio position in that asset. We previously stated that the liquidity of rule 144A securities is
“a question of fact for the board of directors [of the fund] to determine based upon the trading
markets for the specific security.” 229 We also stated that a fund’s board may find it reasonable to
consider certain factors when evaluating the liquidity of a rule 144A security, including: (i) the
frequency of trades and quotes for the security; (ii) the number of dealers willing to purchase or
sell the security and the number of other potential purchasers; (iii) dealer undertakings to make a
market in the security; and (iv) the nature of the security and the nature of the marketplace trades
(e.g., the time needed to dispose of the security, the method of soliciting offers, and the
mechanics of transfer). 230 These guidance factors are consistent with certain of the proposed rule
22e-4(b)(2)(ii) factors, 231 and a fund is required to consider the proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii)
factors in evaluating the liquidity of a 144A security.
Regardless of whether a portfolio asset is a restricted security, it may nevertheless be
subject to other limitations on transfer. For example, for securities that are traded in certain
foreign markets, government approval may be required for the repatriation of investment income,
capital, or the proceeds of sales of securities by foreign investors. 232 Portfolio assets furthermore

company’s board of directors may delegate day-to-day responsibility for such determinations to the

22e-4(b)(2)(ii)(A). “The nature of the security and the nature of the marketplace trades” is a very general
factor, and we believe that many of the proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii) factors (in particular, those reflected
in proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii)(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G), and (H)) indicate the nature of the security
and the nature of marketplace trades.

Size of Position in an Asset Relative to the Asset’s Average Daily Trading
Volume and, as Applicable, Number of Units of the Asset Outstanding

Under proposed rule 22e-4, a fund’s liquidity analysis regarding a particular portfolio
asset would be required to take into consideration the ability to sell and receive cash for the
entire position (or, as applicable, portions of a position in a particular asset), not only its ability
to convert a single trading lot of that asset to cash. 234 Because the size of a fund’s portfolio
position in a particular asset is a key element in determining a fund’s ability to convert the entire
position (or portions of a position in a particular asset) to cash, the proposed rule would require a
fund assessing the liquidity of a portfolio asset to consider the size of the fund’s position in that
asset. 235 Staff outreach has shown that many funds currently consider this factor in evaluating
the liquidity of their portfolio positions. A fund would be required to consider the size of its
position in a particular portfolio asset relative to the asset’s average daily trading volume and, as

disproportionate amount of their eligible highly qualified liquid assets in locations outside the United States
where unforeseen impediments may prevent timely repatriation of such assets during a liquidity crisis).
233

See, e.g., Stephen H. Bier, Julien Bourgeois & Joseph McClain, Mutual Funds and Loan Investments, The

transactions that require consents from borrowers or key syndicate members, and loan documents are still
negotiated written documents that require human review. As a result…the mechanics of loan trades and
certain trade settlement times cause funds to carefully monitor liquidity considerations surrounding loan
investments…. [In making such determinations, funds] typically consider factors common to general
liquidity determinations, as well as factors specific to the loan markets, which can include: (i) the legal
limitations on the transferability or sale of a loan including the requirement to obtain consents from
borrowers or syndicate agents and members prior to assignment; (ii) the existence of a trading market for
the loans and the estimated depth of the market; (iii) the frequency of trades or quotes for the loan; (iv) the
estimated length of the settlement period; and (v) the borrower’s health.”).

applicable, the number of units of the asset outstanding. 236 Small-capitalization securities are
generally less liquid than large-capitalization securities 237 and, as discussed above, securities with
lower trading volume are generally less liquid than securities whose trading volume is higher. 238
The size of a fund’s position in a particular portfolio asset could augment the effects of these two
liquidity factors. For example, if a fund holds a significant position in a small-capitalization
security, this could indicate that its position is relatively illiquid. 239 Likewise, holding a large
position in a thinly traded security diminishes the possibility that a fund would be able to convert
a significant portion of that position to cash in order to meet redemptions. In considering the
number of units of an asset that are currently outstanding, a fund may wish to take into account
the extent to which units of an asset may be technically outstanding, but cannot be purchased by
a member of the public (e.g., shares of a company that the company has repurchased from the
public, but not cancelled because the company plans to later reissue the shares, for example to
cover employee stock grants). Because units of an asset that cannot be purchased by a member
of the public are not able to be actively traded, this consideration could be relevant to a fund’s
assessment of how the size of a portfolio position relative to the number of outstanding units may
affect that position’s liquidity.

variability of illiquidity (“an increase in the number of institutional holders of a stock decreases the average
number of shares of the stock held by individual institutions and, thereby, reduces the potential size of a
trade and its accompanying liquidity-induced impact”)).

94

When a fund is evaluating the size of its position in a particular asset as a factor in
assessing that position’s liquidity, it would be required to consider the extent to which the timing
of disposing of the position could create any market value impact. 240 Selling a large position in a
particular asset into the market over a short time period could entail a negative price impact on
the asset, which in turn could cause losses to the fund and its shareholders. Therefore, this
consideration is relevant to determining the period in which a fund would be able to convert a
particular portfolio position (or portion thereof) to cash, without affecting the value of that asset
by virtue of the transaction.
i.

Relationship of Asset to Another Portfolio Asset

Under proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii)(I), a fund would be required to consider, in assessing
the liquidity of a position in a particular portfolio asset, whether the fund invests in the asset
because it is connected with an investment in another portfolio asset. This may arise in
connection with a derivatives transaction, or if the fund uses an asset for hedging or risk
mitigation purposes.
When funds enter into certain transactions that implicate section 18 of the Investment
Company Act, they generally will maintain in a segregated account certain liquid assets in order
to “cover” the fund’s obligation under the transactions. We applied this framework to certain
financing transactions in Investment Company Act Release No. 10666 (“Release 10666”), issued
in 1979, 241 and also understand that funds today apply this framework to certain derivatives,
based on the guidance we provided in Release 10666 and on no-action letters issued by our

240

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii)(H).

staff. 242 We explained in Release 10666 that “[a] segregated account freezes certain assets of the
investment company and renders such assets unavailable for sale or other disposition.” 243 We
also stated in Release 10666 that only liquid assets should be placed in a segregated account.
Thus, although we expect that assets used by a fund to cover derivatives and other transactions
would be liquid when considered in isolation, when evaluating their liquidity for purposes of the
proposed rule, the fund would have to consider that they are being used to cover other
transactions and, consistent with our position in Release 10666, are “frozen” and “unavailable
for sale or other disposition.” Because these assets are only available for sale to meet
redemptions once the related derivatives position is disposed of or unwound, a fund should
classify the liquidity of these segregated assets using the liquidity of the derivative instruments
they are covering. Release 10666 notes that segregated assets may be “replaced by other
appropriate non-segregated assets of equal value,” and when they are so replaced, formerly
segregated assets would no longer be considered unavailable for sale or other disposition. 244
When a formerly segregated asset is no longer segregated, a fund generally should assess, as part
of its ongoing review of the liquidity classifications assigned to each portfolio position, whether
the liquidity classification given to the portfolio asset when it was segregated continues to be
appropriate. 245

section 18 to derivatives and certain other transactions).

A fund may purchase an asset in connection with its holding of another asset for other
reasons, such as hedging. For example, a fund might purchase a debt security denominated in a
foreign currency and attempt to hedge the currency risks associated with the debt security by
entering into a currency future. When evaluating the liquidity of the currency future, the fund
should consider the way the currency future is being used in the fund’s portfolio. In situations
where a fund purchases a more liquid asset in connection with a less liquid asset, and it plans to
transact in the more liquid asset only in connection with the less liquid asset, then the liquidity of
the two assets is linked by the fund and, in this case, the fund should consider the liquidity
classification of the foreign debt security when determining the liquidity of the currency future.

Request for Comment

We request comment on the proposed factors that a fund would be required to consider,
as applicable, in classifying the liquidity of each portfolio position in a particular asset.
•

What factors do funds currently use to assess and classify the liquidity of portfolio assets,
and do the proposed factors reflect factors that funds already consider when evaluating
portfolio assets’ liquidity? Do commenters agree that requiring a fund to consider certain
factors would encourage effective liquidity assessment across the fund industry? Would
considering certain factors improve funds’ ability to meet their redemption obligations
and to reduce potential dilution of non-redeeming shareholders? Would classification
generally enhance funds’ liquidity risk management, including funds’ ability to meet their
redemption obligations and to reduce potential dilution of non-redeeming shareholders?

•

Should any of the proposed factors not be required to be considered by a fund in making
liquidity determinations? Should any of the proposed factors be modified? Are there any
additional factors, besides the proposed factors, that a fund should be required to consider

97

in evaluating the liquidity of a portfolio position in a particular asset? Should the
proposed rule text be modified to explicitly exempt certain types of funds from
considering certain factors? Or are there additional factors, besides the proposed factors,
that should be required to be considered by certain types of funds? Should funds be
required to consider correlations between asset classes more generally, outside the
derivatives and hedging contexts? Should certain factors be given more weight than
others? Should proposed rule 22e-4 explicitly require a fund to classify the liquidity of a
position (or portions of a position in a particular asset) used to cover a derivative position
using the same liquidity classification category as it assigned to the derivative? Should
the Commission provide additional guidance regarding the circumstances in which a fund
should consider the liquidity of a particular portfolio asset in relation to the liquidity of
another asset? What types of operational challenges would arise in connection with
considering the liquidity of a particular portfolio asset in relation to the liquidity of
another asset?
•

Instead of codifying the factors as part of proposed rule 22e-4, should the Commission
solely provide guidance as to what would be appropriate for a fund to consider in
assessing its portfolio assets’ liquidity? Why or why not? Would the failure to codify the
factors diminish how consistently they are applied across the industry?

•

Would a more principles-based approach, in lieu of codified factors or guidance, be more
appropriate? For example, would it be less costly to implement and allow more flexible
use of factors that might be more pertinent in analyzing the liquidity of a particular asset?
Or would a more principles-based approach not materially advance portfolio asset
liquidity assessments beyond those conducted today under the 15% guidelines, and thus

98

be subject to similar limitations as discussed above as a stand-alone method for liquidity
assessment?
•

To the extent that a fund lacks pertinent information about a particular portfolio asset,
should the fund be required to consider the proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii) factors with
respect to appropriate comparable assets? What characteristics of the portfolio asset and
the comparable asset would a fund generally compare in determining the weight to
ascribe to the comparable asset’s liquidity in evaluating the portfolio asset’s liquidity?

•

Should ETFs and ETMFs be governed by the same, a subset of, or different factors? If
so, which factors and why?
We seek comment on the Commission’s guidance regarding each of the proposed factors.

•

Besides the guidance, are there any other specific issues associated with any of the
proposed factors that a fund may wish to consider in evaluating the liquidity of a
portfolio position in a particular asset?

•

Do commenters generally agree with the guidance that we have proposed regarding the
ways that each of the proposed factors could indicate relative liquidity or illiquidity of a
portfolio asset? Should we add a note to rule 22e-4 indicating that the release includes
additional guidance regarding the proposed factors?
3.

Ongoing Review of the Liquidity of a Fund’s Portfolio Positions
a.

Proposed Ongoing Review Requirement

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(i) would require a fund to review the liquidity classification of
each of the fund’s portfolio positions on an ongoing basis. As appropriate, a fund could
determine to revise its liquidity classification of a portfolio position based on this ongoing review
requirement. The Commission has previously stated that it “expects funds to monitor portfolio

99

liquidity on an ongoing basis to determine whether, in light of current circumstances, an
adequate level of liquidity is being maintained.” 246 Some have interpreted this statement to mean
that the Commission does not intend for a fund to reassess the liquidity status of individual
securities on an ongoing basis, but instead to monitor whether a fund portfolio’s overall liquidity
profile is appropriate in light of its redemption obligations under section 22(e). 247 We agree that
a fund should monitor the liquidity of its portfolio holistically, in light of shareholder flows, to
determine the fund’s capacity to meet its redemption obligations. 248 However, decreased
liquidity of individual portfolio components can directly affect the ability of a fund to meet its
redemption obligations, or to meet obligations in a manner that does not dilute the interests of
non-redeeming shareholders. 249 We thus believe that requiring a fund to review position-level
liquidity classifications made under proposed rule 22e-4 on an ongoing basis would reduce the
risk that the fund will be unable to meet its redemption obligations and reduce potential dilution
of shareholders’ interests.
As discussed above, Commission staff understands, based on outreach to the fund
industry and information provided by industry participants, that different funds employ varying
approaches to monitoring the liquidity of individual assets and positions. We understand that
some funds may not normally review the liquidity of individual portfolio assets on a continuing
basis after they are acquired. On the other hand, our staff learned through outreach efforts across
the fund industry that certain funds periodically reassess the liquidity of each portfolio security

See Guidelines Release, supra note 4, at section II. (stating, with respect to the Commission’s expectation
that a fund would monitor its portfolio liquidity, “For example, an equity fund that begins to experience a

consider reducing its holdings of illiquid securities in an orderly fashion in order to maintain liquidity.”).

See, e.g., Heartland Release, supra note 47.

based on market-wide developments, as well as events affecting particular securities or asset
classes. 250
Pursuant to the proposed ongoing review requirement, each fund would be required to
consider the rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii) factors, as applicable, in reviewing its portfolio positions’
liquidity on an ongoing basis. 251 However, beyond this, rule 22e-4 does not include prescribed
review procedures, nor does it incorporate specific developments that a fund must monitor. A
fund may wish to determine the frequency of its ongoing review of portfolio positions’ liquidity
classifications based in part on the liquidity of its portfolio holdings, as well as the timing of its
portfolio acquisitions and turnover, in order to evaluate whether its portfolio acquisitions are in
compliance with the three-day liquid asset minimum requirement. 252 For example, a fund whose
portfolio assets’ liquidity could depend significantly on current market conditions should
generally review the liquidity classifications of its portfolio assets relatively often (up to daily, or
even hourly, depending on facts and circumstances). On the other end of the spectrum, it may be
appropriate for a fund whose portfolio holdings’ liquidity tends to be more stable (for example, a
large-cap equity fund) to consider reviewing the liquidity classifications of its portfolio assets
less frequently. 253
In adopting ongoing review policies and procedures, a fund generally should include
policies and procedures for identifying market-wide developments, as well as security- and
asset-class-specific developments, that could demonstrate a need to change the liquidity

classification of a portfolio position. For instance, relevant market-wide developments could
include changes in interest rates or other macroeconomic events, market-wide volatility, marketwide flow changes, dealer inventory or capacity changes, and extraordinary events such as
natural disasters or political upheaval. 254 Security- and asset-class specific developments that a
fund may wish to consider include corporate events (such as bankruptcy, default, or delisting, as
well as reputational events) and regulatory changes affecting certain asset classes. Any of these
developments could cause changes, for example, in the frequency of trades or quotes for a
particular asset, as well as changes to that asset’s trading volume, price volatility, and bid-ask
spreads.
b.

Request for Comment

We request comment on the proposed ongoing review requirement.
•

How do funds currently monitor the liquidity of portfolio assets, and how frequently do
they do so? To what extent do funds anticipate that the ongoing review procedures that
would be required under proposed rule 22e-4 would replicate the procedures funds
currently use to monitor whether portfolio assets are limited by the 15% guideline? Are
current processes largely automated? Do funds believe that systems could be used to
automate the monitoring that would be required under proposed rule 22e-4? What tradeoffs or risks does automated monitoring pose vis-à-vis manual monitoring, and how do
firms currently manage those risks? Are there circumstances in which automated
monitoring is inappropriate, and, if so, why?

•

Is the ongoing review requirement, as proposed, sufficiently clear? Are there certain
approaches to ongoing review that we should require and/or on which we should provide

254

See, e.g., 2014 Fixed Income Guidance Update, supra note 62.

102

guidance? Should we specify a minimum time period for funds to review their liquidity
classifications under proposed rule 22e-4? Should we require that a fund monitor for
certain specified developments or events, and/or expand our guidance on the market-wide
and security- and asset-class-specific developments that a fund could consider?
C.

Assessing and Managing a Fund’s Liquidity Risk

We believe that assessing and managing liquidity risk in a comprehensive manner is
critical to a fund’s ability to honor redemption requests within the seven-day period required
under section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act, as well as within any shorter time period
disclosed in the fund’s prospectus or advertising materials or required for purposes of rule
15c6-1. Proposed rule 22e-4(a)(7) would define liquidity risk as the risk that the fund could not
meet requests to redeem shares issued by the fund that are expected under normal conditions, or
are reasonably foreseeable under stressed conditions, without materially affecting the fund’s net
asset value. This proposed definition contemplates that a fund consider both expected requests
to redeem (e.g., shareholder flows relating to seasonality or shareholder tax considerations), as
well as requests to redeem that may not be expected, but are reasonably foreseeable under
stressed conditions (e.g., shareholder outflows related to stressed market conditions or increased
volatility, or outflows that are reasonable to expect in light of a reputational event affecting the
fund or the departure of a fund’s portfolio manager). 255

255

See, e.g., infra section IV.C.1.e (discussing why we do not believe that a general stress testing requirement
would be an adequate substitute for the proposed three-day liquid asset requirement).

103

A fund’s liquidity risk depends on a variety of factors, including, among others, its cash
flows, investment strategy, portfolio liquidity, use of borrowings and derivatives, cash (and cash
equivalents) on hand, and borrowing arrangements. 256 Staff outreach has shown that funds
consider these types of factors in assessing their liquidity risk, and some funds conduct stress
tests (incorporating these factors) to analyze various redemption scenarios to determine whether
the fund has sufficient liquid assets to cover different levels of redemptions. 257 Likewise, we
understand that a fund may employ many different policies and procedures for managing its
liquidity risk, including adjusting portfolio composition to withstand potential liquidity stresses,
maintaining bank lines of credit or other borrowing arrangements, requesting notification from
large shareholders about possible upcoming redemptions, and other similar risk management
techniques. In addition, some fund complexes have established a dedicated risk management
function, with independent risk oversight. Other funds, however, employ substantially less
comprehensive liquidity risk assessment and management practices and procedures. These
256

See infra section III.C.1; see also Nuveen FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 45, at 10-11 (stating
that mutual funds that could have liquidity challenges in difficult markets include those that invest not only
in less liquid asset classes, but also those with larger investor concentrations, with fund flows particularly
sensitive to changes in the returns of the markets in which they invest, that hold a large amount of a single
issuance or a high percentage of its average daily trading volume, with meaningful use of effective
leverage, and that invest in assets that do not have contractual settlement periods and tend to settle over
longer periods than ordinary securities).

257

See supra text following note 100; see also supra note 104 (discussing Commission initiative to require
large investment companies and investment advisers to engage in annual stress tests as required by section
165(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act); BlackRock FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 50, at 6 (stating that
among several overarching principles that provide the foundation for a prudent market liquidity risk
management framework for collective investment vehicles is estimating “potential fund redemptions based
on (a) historical behavior under normal as well as under adverse market conditions, and (b) monitoring
investor profiles and related redemption behaviors to help identify potential liquidity needs, recognizing the
differences between institutional and retail investors, large and small investors, categories of assets (e.g.,
retirement versus non-retirement assets), and the platforms on which funds are sold (e.g., self-directed
versus through an intermediary”); AII FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 50, at 15 (“investment
advisers to mutual funds continually review a broad series of metrics to evaluate the current adequacy of
the fund’s liquidity position. These include historic data regarding redemption request levels, stressing the
historic redemption levels, assessing levels of liquidity of categories of assets held by the fund based on
industry standards, assessing current and expected market conditions of the types of asset held by the fund
and then assessing liquidity in those various market conditions.”).

104

funds, for example, may have little coordination between the compliance personnel who monitor
the fund’s adherence to the 15% guideline, and the portfolio and risk management personnel who
assess the liquidity profile of portfolio assets. Staff outreach has shown that it is fairly common
for a fund not to have adopted a specific liquidity risk management program, but instead to rely
primarily on the portfolio management process to consider liquidity risk when making portfolio
management decisions. While a fund’s portfolio management function has access to a great deal
of information relevant to the liquidity of the fund’s portfolio assets, and thus pertinent to the
fund’s liquidity risk, portfolio managers may have competing interests that could potentially
impede effective liquidity risk management. For example, depending on the circumstances, a
fund’s portfolio manager could be reluctant to invest a portion of the fund’s assets in highly
liquid assets, which may be appropriate for liquidity risk management purposes, but that the
manager believes could cause a fund’s performance to lag compared to similar funds or the
fund’s benchmark. 258 In sum, our staff has found that the comprehensiveness as well as the
independence of funds’ liquidity risk management vary significantly.
Because we are concerned with funds’ ability to meet their redemption obligations and to
mitigate shareholder dilution associated with redemptions, we are proposing new requirements
for assessing and managing funds’ liquidity risk. Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii) would require a
fund to assess and periodically review its liquidity risk, taking into account certain factors.
Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv) would require a fund to manage its liquidity risk based on this
assessment, including: (i) requiring the fund to determine (and periodically review) a minimum

But see Mikhail Simutin, Cash Holdings and Mutual Fund Performance, 18 REV. OF FIN. 1425 (2013)
(“Simutin”) (“Cash holdings of equity mutual funds impose a drag on fund performance but also allow
managers to make quick investments in attractive stocks and satisfy outflows without costly fire sales. This
article shows that actively managed equity funds with high abnormal cash—that is, with cash holdings in
excess of the level predicted by fund attributes—outperform their low abnormal cash peers by over 2% per
year.”).

percentage of the fund’s net assets that must be invested in three-day liquid assets (the fund’s
“three-day liquid asset minimum”); 259 (ii) prohibiting a fund from acquiring any less liquid asset
if the fund would have invested less than its three-day liquid asset minimum in three-day liquid
assets; 260 and (iii) prohibiting a fund from acquiring any 15% standard asset if the fund would
have invested more than 15% of its net assets in 15% standard assets. 261
We are proposing these new requirements with the goal of providing funds with the
flexibility to adopt policies and procedures that would be most appropriate to assess and manage
their liquidity risk, while at the same time reducing the risk that funds will be unable to meet
redemption obligations, minimizing dilution, and elevating the overall quality of liquidity risk
assessment and management across the fund industry. Given that a fund’s liquidity risk arises
from the interaction of multiple discrete and overlapping factors, we believe that the most
effective liquidity risk management programs would be multi-faceted and customized to reflect
the sources of the fund’s liquidity risk. The requirements that we are proposing are therefore
intended to be largely principles-based and would permit a fund to tailor its risk assessment and
management procedures to respond to the fund’s particular risks and circumstances. On the
other hand, we also believe that requiring each fund to consider, as a baseline, a standard set of
factors for assessing liquidity risk, requiring each fund to keep a minimum portion of net assets
in cash and assets that the fund believes are convertible to cash within three business days
without materially affecting the value of the asset (which minimum each fund would determine
based on standard factors), and limiting a fund’s holdings of 15% standard assets would create an

Assessing a Fund’s Liquidity Risk

Proposed rule 22e-4 envisions a two-pronged liquidity risk assessment and risk
management process, whereby a fund would be required to assess its liquidity risk, based on
certain specified factors, and then develop a liquidity risk management program tailored to the
fund’s liquidity risk. 262 Here we discuss the liquidity risk assessment portion of this process.
The requirements we are proposing for the fund’s management of the risks identified by this
assessment are discussed in a later section of the release. 263 Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii) would
require each fund to assess the fund’s liquidity risk, considering certain specified factors that are
discussed in more detail below. We compiled these factors based, in part, on staff outreach to
funds and third-party service providers who assess liquidity risk on behalf of funds. To the
extent that funds currently conduct liquidity stress tests, we understand that these stress tests
commonly incorporate many of the proposed factors (or functionally similar factors). 264 The
proposed liquidity risk factors also incorporate considerations that we believe have historically
contributed to liquidity risk in open-end funds. 265

262

To the extent that liquidity risk differs among each series of an investment company, each series would be
required to adopt a liquidity risk management program whose liquidity risk assessment and management
elements are distinct from other series’ programs. See supra paragraph accompanying notes 114-115.

263

See infra sections III.C.3 – III.C.5.

264

See supra notes 101, 257 and accompanying text.

265

See Guidelines Release, supra note 4 (noting that funds should consider cash flows into specific investment
strategies in determining whether the fund is maintaining an adequate level of liquidity).

107

The proposed rule would require each fund to take the following factors into account, as
applicable, in assessing the fund’s liquidity risk:
o Short-term and long-term cash flow projections, taking into account the following
considerations:


Size, frequency, and volatility of historical purchases and redemptions of fund shares
during normal and stressed periods;



The fund’s redemption policies;



The fund’s shareholder ownership concentration;



The fund’s distribution channels; and



The degree of certainty associated with the fund’s short-term and long-term cash flow
projections

o The fund’s investment strategy and liquidity of portfolio assets;
o Use of borrowings and derivatives for investment purposes; and
o Holdings of cash and cash equivalents, as well as borrowing arrangements and other
funding sources.
This list is not meant to be exhaustive. In assessing its liquidity risk, a fund may take into
account considerations in addition to the factors set forth in proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii). For
example, if a fund elects to conduct stress testing 266 to determine whether it has sufficient liquid
assets to cover different levels of redemptions, a fund should consider incorporating the results
of this stress testing into its liquidity risk assessment. However, a fund would be required to
consider, as applicable, the proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii) factors as a minimum set of
considerations to be used in assessing its liquidity risk. For this reason, a fund that elects to
conduct stress tests may wish to review the factors and parameters it uses to construct scenario
analyses concerning the adequacy of the fund’s portfolio liquidity, and update these factors and

266

See supra notes 101, 257 and accompanying text.

108

parameters to reflect the proposed liquidity risk assessment factors. We believe that stress tests
that incorporate the proposed factors, though not required, could be particularly useful to a fund
in assessing its liquidity risk.
We recognize that some of the proposed factors may not be applicable in assessing the
liquidity risk of certain funds or types of funds. For example, we recognize that certain
considerations that the proposed rule would require a fund to consider in assessing its cash flow
projections (e.g., shareholder ownership concentration, and the fund’s distribution channels)
would generally be more applicable to mutual funds than to ETFs. To the extent that a proposed
factor is not applicable to a particular fund, the fund would not be required to consider that factor
in assessing its liquidity risk.
Below we provide guidance on specific issues associated with each of the proposed
liquidity risk assessment factors. We also request comment below with respect to each of the
proposed factors, as well as guidance regarding each factor.
a.

Cash Flow Projections

A fund’s cash flow (the amount of cash flowing either into or out of the fund) is
important in determining whether the fund will have sufficient cash to satisfy redemption
requests. 267 Cash flow projections thus directly affect a fund’s liquidity risk. 268 As discussed
below, we believe that several factors influence the extent to which a fund’s cash flow profile
267

See, e.g., Invesco FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 35, at 11(“Cash inflows from sources such as
gross subscriptions (including reinvested dividends on fund shares), dividend and interest payments on
portfolio securities and maturities of debt securities held in portfolios do help manage fund level liquidity
and are taken into account by portfolio managers as part of their liquidity management.”); ICI FSOC Notice
Comment Letter, supra note 16, at 18 (“Managing liquidity as part of overall portfolio management is a
dynamic process requiring fund managers to make daily adjustments to accommodate cash inflows and
outflows. . . Portfolio managers and traders typically receive data on cash flows at least daily and thus have
a strong sense of whether additional actions (including the sale of portfolio holdings) would be needed to
meet redemption requests or otherwise adjust a fund’s liquidity profile.”).

268

Proposed rule 22e-4(a)(7).

109

could indicate or contribute to the fund’s liquidity risk. Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)(A) thus
would require a fund to consider these factors when evaluating its liquidity risk. In general, we
believe that the better a fund’s portfolio and risk managers are able to predict the fund’s net
flows, the better they will be able to measure and manage the fund’s liquidity risk. 269
Predictability about whether periods of market stress or declines in fund performance generally
lead to increased redemptions of fund shares is particularly significant, as careful liquidity risk
management during these periods could prevent the need to sell less-liquid portfolio assets under
unfavorable circumstances, which in turn could create significant negative price pressure on the
assets and, to the extent the fund continues to hold a portion of those assets, decrease the value of
the assets still held by the fund at least temporarily. 270
A fund would be required to consider the size, frequency, and volatility of historical
purchases and redemptions of fund shares, during both normal and stressed periods, when
considering its cash flow projections. 271 A fund whose inflows generally correspond to its
outflows in terms of timing, size, frequency, and response to market events will likely be able to
use cash received from purchases to pay redeeming shareholders, which decreases the fund’s

Performance? An Analysis of Mutual Funds, 20 REV. OF FIN. STUD. 125 (Jan. 2007) (noting that
unexpected investor flows may force managers to rebalance their portfolios to control liquidity, and that
these liquidity-related trades should underperform trades motivated by valuation beliefs).

such selling had “a significant impact on the downward direction of the market”).

liquidity risk. Funds whose net flows are relatively less volatile in terms of size and frequency
will likely entail less liquidity risk than similar funds with more volatile net flows, because funds
with less flow volatility can better plan how to meet fund redemptions and thus will be less likely
to need to sell portfolio assets in a manner that creates a market impact in order to pay redeeming
shareholders. 272 A fund should generally review historical purchases and redemptions of fund
shares across a variety of market conditions in order to determine how the fund’s flows may
differ during stressed and normal periods (keeping in mind that historical experience may not
necessarily be indicative of future outcomes, depending on changes in market conditions and the
fund’s particular circumstances). In particular, if outflows are greater, more frequent, or more
volatile during stressed periods, this could exacerbate the fund’s liquidity risk. 273 A fund may
find it instructive to understand when its highest, lowest, most frequent, and most volatile
purchases and redemptions occurred within various time horizons, such as the past one, five, ten,
and twenty years (as applicable, considering the fund’s operating history). In addition to
considering its own historical flow data, a fund, particularly a fund without a substantial
operating history, may wish to consider purchase and redemption activity in funds with similar
investment strategies. Consideration of similar funds’ purchases and redemptions could show
whether the fund’s historical flows are typical or aberrant compared to those seen in similar
funds and assist new funds in predicting flow patterns.
A fund may wish to evaluate whether the size, frequency, and volatility of its shareholder
flows follow any discernable pattern. For example, patterns in shareholder flows have been

changes in fund performance ratings provided by third-party rating agencies. 277 A fund’s
investment strategy also could contribute to its shareholder flows: for instance, we understand
that certain investors tend to trade in and out of ETFs with index-based strategies frequently
because they invest in these ETFs for hedging and/or short-term trading purposes. 278

Furthermore, a fund may wish to take into account its assets in assessing historical flow data,
since smaller funds may experience greater flow volatility. 279
While historical redemption patterns are an important factor in assessing cash flows, a
fund should be cognizant of the limitations of using past flow history to assess future cash flow
needs. Therefore, a fund would be required to take into account other factors when considering
cash flow projections, including its redemption policies. 280 Specifically, we believe a fund
should generally consider the disclosures in its prospectus or advertising materials regarding the
time period in which it will pay redemption proceeds (or endeavor to pay redemption
proceeds), 281 and whether its redemption policies vary based on the distribution channels the fund
employs. A fund whose policies require it to pay redeeming shareholders on a next-day basis
could find itself with fewer options for managing high levels of redemptions than a fund that is
bound only by the redemption timing requirements of rule 15c6-1. To illustrate, when a fund
that pays redemption proceeds within one day receives a large redemption request and a fund
that pays redemption proceeds within three business days pursuant to the timing requirements of
rule 15c6-1 receives a redemption request of the same size, the first fund must satisfy the full
request within one day, whereas the second fund has more time to space out the sale of portfolio
assets in order to satisfy the redemption request. Even though the shareholder flows of the first

select into assets with lower trading costs. Atkins and Dyl (1997) find support for this conjecture by
showing that securities with lower bid-ask spread have higher trading volume. These theories and
empirical evidence suggest that, due to the low trading costs of ETFs, a new clientele of high-frequency
investors can materialize around the newly created securities. This clientele would not trade the less-liquid
underlying assets if ETFs were not present.”).

and second fund are identical, the redemption policies of the first fund magnify its liquidity risks
by requiring that the fund pay redemptions quickly. 282 An ETF that typically pays redemption
proceeds in kind should generally also consider that it has reserved the right to transact with
authorized participants in cash, the circumstances in which it anticipates that it would pay
redemption proceeds in cash, and how these policies impact its cash flow projections.
A mutual fund also would be required to consider its shareholder ownership
concentration as a factor affecting its cash flow projections. 283 If a mutual fund’s shares are
concentrated in a relatively small group of shareholders, one shareholder’s redemptions of fund
shares could result in considerable cash outflows from the fund. 284 This in turn could increase
the mutual fund’s liquidity risk if the fund does not have procedures in place to manage large
redemptions, particularly if the fund were to encounter unexpected redemptions from a large
shareholder. For these reasons, we believe a mutual fund should consider the extent to which its
shareholder concentration affects its liquidity risk, particularly taking into account other factors
that could magnify shareholder concentration-related liquidity risk (e.g., if a fund has an
investment strategy that attracts shareholders who trade based on short-term price movements,
shareholders could be more likely to redeem precipitously, and resulting unexpected redemptions
by a shareholder with a large ownership stake could cause significant liquidity stresses to the
fund).

282

See supra note 270.

283

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)(A)(3).

284

We note that a relatively concentrated fund shareholder base may make it easier for funds to communicate
with those shareholders about their anticipated future redemptions, and thus plan liquidity demands.
However, those shareholders are under no legal obligation to forewarn the fund of their redemptions and
so, particularly in times of stress, may not do so.

114

There are multiple ways that a mutual fund’s distribution channels could affect its cash
flows (including the predictability of the fund’s cash flows), and the proposed rule would require
a mutual fund to consider this factor in evaluating its cash flows and related liquidity risk. 285
First, a mutual fund’s redemption practices could depend on its distribution channels. For
example, mutual funds that are sold through broker-dealers will have to meet redemption
requests within three business days, because rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act establishes a
T+3 settlement period for securities trades effected by a broker or dealer. Second, to the extent
that mutual fund shares are held through omnibus accounts, it could be difficult for a mutual
fund to be fully aware of the composition of the underlying investor base, 286 including investor
characteristics that could affect the mutual fund’s short-term and long-term flows (e.g., whether
ownership in the mutual fund is relatively concentrated, 287 and whether the mutual fund’s
underlying investors share any common investment goals affecting redemption frequency and
timing). Finally, a mutual fund’s distribution channels could affect its cash flow predictions
insofar as certain distribution channels are generally correlated with particular purchase and
redemption patterns. For instance, investors in mutual funds distributed through a retirement
plan channel or other planned savings channel (e.g., funds underlying a 529 plan) 288 may be more
likely to be long-term investors who do not trade based on short-term price movements, and their
purchase and redemption patterns thus may be relatively predictable compared to those of other

investors. Investors in mutual funds distributed through certain channels also may have similar
purchase and redemption characteristics relating to their financial and tax-related needs. For
example, taxable investors who are considering purchasing mutual fund shares around capital
gains distribution dates have an incentive to delay their purchases until after the distribution, but
non-taxable shareholders (such as those who invest through IRAs and other tax-deferred
accounts) face no such incentive for delaying purchases. 289
Finally, a fund would be required to consider the degree of certainty surrounding its
short-term and long-term cash flow projections. 290 A fund could consider the length of its
operating history (including the fund’s experience during points of market instability, illiquidity,
or volatility), any observed purchase and redemption patterns, and the applicable other factors set
forth in proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)(A) in determining the level of certainty the fund has
regarding its cash flows. A fund may find it instructive to employ ranges in considering cash
flow projections and their relationship to liquidity risk. For instance, a fund that could
reasonably project that its cash flows will fall within a relatively narrow range could more
precisely assess its liquidity risk than a fund that could reasonably project a broader range of
projected cash flows. If a fund has implemented policies to encourage certain shareholders (e.g.,
large shareholders, or certain types of shareholders such as institutional shareholders) to provide
advance notification of their intent to redeem a significant number of shares of the fund, this
could increase the degree of certainty surrounding its cash flow projections. 291

anticipated redemptions above certain levels in place with certain distribution partners).

b.

Investment Strategy and Liquidity of Portfolio Assets

Under proposed rule 22e-4, a fund’s procedures for assessing its liquidity risk must take
into account the effects that the fund’s investment strategy and the liquidity of its portfolio assets
could have on the fund’s liquidity risk. 292 A fund’s investment strategy could increase or
decrease the fund’s liquidity risk in various ways. For example, whether a fund is actively or
passively managed could have ramifications on the fund’s liquidity. On one hand, a fund with a
passive investment strategy could have less liquidity risk relative to an actively managed fund
that invests in a similar portfolio, to the extent that the portfolio of the passively managed fund is
built around a widely followed market index (securities that are components of such an index are
generally more liquid than securities that are not). 293 An index-tracking fund also may be more
likely to sell a “strip” of the portfolio (i.e., a cross-section or representative selection of the
fund’s portfolio assets) to meet net redemptions, which minimizes the outcome that the fund
would sell its most liquid assets first, in order to continue to closely track the applicable
benchmark. On the other hand, index-based strategies could exhibit increased liquidity risk
during periods when an index is being reconstituted, if the index reconstitution results in multiple
funds simultaneously attempting to get into or out of the same portfolio position. 294 Index-based
strategies also could experience increased liquidity risk when the assets in the index become less
liquid due to market events, because the fund’s manager will have less discretion to move the

fund’s strategy away from the index’s assets. In addition, index-based strategies that track lessliquid market indices may exhibit more liquidity risk than passively managed funds built around
widely-followed market indices. 295
The extent to which a fund’s portfolio is diversified (or, relatedly, a fund’s concentration
in certain types of portfolio assets) could have ramifications on the fund’s potential liquidity risk
as well. A fund’s status as a diversified investment company under the Investment Company
Act, 296 its status as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue
Code, 297 and its principal investment strategies as disclosed in its prospectus all could affect the
fund’s liquidity risk. 298 For example, a fund constrained by various diversification requirements
that needs to sell portfolio securities in order to meet redemption requests could be limited by its
diversification obligations in determining which portfolio securities it will sell. Such a fund
might need to unwind certain portfolio positions under unfavorable circumstances. A fund
whose investment strategy requires it to invest a certain percentage of its assets in a particular
asset class, industry segment, or securities associated with a particular geographic region could
encounter similar limitations, if selling certain portfolio securities would cause the fund to not be
in compliance with its investment strategies. On the other hand, a fund with a relatively
more-diversified portfolio needing to sell portfolio assets to build liquidity would possibly be
able to select assets for sale based on whether the markets for those assets are favorable. A
relatively less-diversified fund may have fewer options (i.e., because the markets for its portfolio

assets are uniform or correlated) and could thus be compelled to transact in unfavorable markets.
Such fund also may need to trade larger dollar amounts of each asset, which may increase the
price impact of the trades.
In addition to diversification or concentration issues, a fund’s portfolio management
decisions that are meant, in part, to decrease an undesirable tax impact on the fund could affect
the fund’s liquidity risk. For example, a fund whose portfolio includes foreign securities might
manage its portfolio to avoid securities transaction taxes imposed by other jurisdictions. 299
Similarly, a fund could be managed using an active tax loss harvesting strategy to
opportunistically realize losses that may be used to offset future gains. 300 The sale of certain
portfolio assets to meet liquidity needs might adversely affect these, and comparable,
management practices. Consequently, a fund whose tax management strategy makes its portfolio
managers unwilling to sell certain portfolio assets in order to meet redemptions could face
increased liquidity risk compared to a similarly situated fund, because it could have fewer
desirable options to generate cash to pay redemptions (and thus could have increased risk that it
would need to sell portfolio assets under unfavorable circumstances in order to meet
redemptions) than another, similar fund.
While we believe consideration of a fund’s investment strategy is an important factor in
assessing a fund’s liquidity risk, we caution that different types of funds within the same broad
investment strategy may demonstrate different levels of liquidity (and thus, presumably, different

levels of liquidity risk). 301 The liquidity of a fund’s portfolio assets directly affects the amount of
liquidity risk associated with the fund. A fund should consider the portions of the fund’s net
assets that are invested in each of the six liquidity categories set forth in proposed rule
22e-4(b)(2)(i). All else being equal, funds with relatively greater portions of their assets invested
in less liquid assets would tend to have greater liquidity risk than funds holding relatively fewer
less liquid assets.
c.

Use of Borrowings and Derivatives for Investment Purposes

Proposed rule 22e-4 would require a fund to take into account the potential effects of the
use of borrowings and derivatives for investment purposes (for example, to enhance returns) on
its liquidity risk. 302 Funds may borrow from a bank under section 18 of the Investment Company
Act. In addition to the asset coverage limitations imposed by section 18, 303 any such borrowing
would be subject to the terms agreed between a fund and the bank, including terms relating to the
maturity date of the borrowing and any circumstances under which the borrowing may be
required to be repaid. In addition, as noted above, funds that borrow for investment purposes, for
example through financing transactions such as reverse repurchase agreements and short sales,
generally do so in reliance on the guidance we provided in Release 10666, under which funds
cover their obligations under such transactions by segregating certain liquid assets. 304 Segregated
assets are considered to be unavailable for sale or disposition, including for redemptions, unless

301

See infra note 627 and accompanying text.

302

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)(C). Although the use of borrowings and derivatives is a distinct factor under
proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii), a fund should also consider the potential impact of borrowings and
derivatives in its assessment of other factors set forth in proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii), such as the fund’s
cash flow projections and its investment strategy and liquidity of portfolio assets.

replaced by other appropriate non-segregated assets of equal value. 305 This means that a fund
that receives significant redemption requests may need to unwind a portion of its financing
transactions in order make more liquid assets available for sale to fulfill such requests.
Furthermore, if a fund seeks to unwind its financing transactions in a declining market, it may
need to dispose of a greater amount of its more liquid holdings in order to repay its borrowings,
thereby reducing the amount of liquid assets it has available to meet redemptions. Consequently,
a fund’s assessment of its liquidity risk should include an evaluation of the nature and extent of
its borrowings and the potential impact of borrowings on the fund’s overall liquidity profile.
The use of derivatives, such as futures, forwards, swaps and written options, may also
affect a fund’s liquidity risk. Funds use derivatives for a wide range of purposes, including
hedging or risk mitigation, but also to obtain leverage or investment exposures. 306 As noted
above, funds that use derivatives under which they have an obligation to pay typically do so in
reliance on the guidance we provided in Release 10666 and in related no-action letters issued by
our staff, and therefore segregate liquid assets in respect of their obligations under derivatives
transactions. 307 Derivatives may therefore raise concerns that are similar to those discussed
above in the context of borrowings. Funds also may be required to dispose of assets in order to
post required margins with respect to their short sale transactions. In addition, some derivatives
transactions – particularly those that are complex or entered into OTC – may be less liquid, have
longer settlement periods, or be more difficult to price than other types of investments, which
potentially increases the amount of time required to unwind such transactions.

307

See supra section III.B.2.i.

121

Even highly liquid derivatives may present liquidity risk for some funds. For example,
some funds use derivatives for cash and liquidity management purposes. A large-cap equity
fund with a temporary cash position may purchase equity index futures that have lower
transaction costs, shorter settlement periods and greater liquidity than a direct investment in
equity securities, in order to obtain a degree of exposure to large-cap equities. While
“equitizing” its temporary cash position in this manner may mitigate the potential performance
lag associated with a cash holding, it also exposes the fund to market risk. 308 Accordingly, a
fund’s assessment of liquidity risk should take into account the manner and extent of its
derivatives use and the structure and terms of its derivatives transactions.
In addition to the liquidity of the derivatives positions themselves, assessing liquidity risk
generally may include an evaluation of the potential liquidity demands that may be imposed on
the fund in connection with its use of derivatives, including any variation margin or collateral
calls the fund may be required to meet. 309 To the extent the fund is required to make payments to
a derivatives counterparty, those assets would not be available to meet shareholder redemptions.
d.

Holdings of Cash and Cash Equivalents, As Well As Borrowing
Arrangements and Other Funding Sources

Proposed rule 22e-4 would require a fund to consider its cash and cash equivalent
holdings, as well as its borrowing arrangements and other funding sources, in assessing its
liquidity risk. 310 Current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles define cash equivalents
308

two fixed income mutual funds that suffered significant losses during the 2008 financial crisis primarily
due to their use of total return swaps to obtain exposure to commercial mortgage-backed securities and
noting that the funds “had to raise cash for anticipated [total return swap] contract payments by selling
depressed bonds into an increasingly illiquid market.”).

as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash
and that are so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because
of changes in interest rates. 311 Examples of items commonly considered to be cash equivalents
include certain Treasury bills, agency securities, bank deposits, commercial paper, and shares of
money market funds. 312 Cash and cash equivalents are extremely liquid (in that they either are
cash, or could be easily and nearly immediately converted to known amounts of cash without a
loss in value), and significant holdings of these instruments generally decrease a fund’s liquidity
risk because the fund could use them to meet redemption requests without materially affecting
the fund’s NAV. 313
Entering into borrowing arrangements and agreements with other potential funding
sources also could affect a fund’s liquidity risk, as they could assist the fund in paying redeeming
shareholders without the need to sell portfolio securities under circumstances that could impair
the fund’s NAV. 314 For example, in the past several decades, it has become increasingly
common for fixed income funds to establish lines of credit with commercial banks. 315 When

should not preclude an investment in a money market fund from being classified as a cash equivalent under
U.S. GAAP under normal circumstances); Form PF: Glossary of Terms (defining “cash and cash
equivalents”).

313

However, a substantial investment in cash and cash equivalents could decrease a fund’s total return and/or
cause a fund to diverge from its investment strategy, and thus a fund may wish to calibrate its holdings of
these instruments to manage the fund’s liquidity risk while taking these concerns into consideration. But

the level predicted by fund attributes outperform their low abnormal cash peers by over 2% per year).

also Fortune, supra note 270, at 64 (noting that lines of credit with banks were rarely available to funds
prior to the mid-1980s); infra section III.C.5.a (Commission guidance on use of borrowing arrangements
and other funding sources as a liquidity risk management control).

123

considering the extent to which a bank credit facility could affect a fund’s liquidity risk, we
believe a fund may find it instructive to evaluate the terms of the credit facility (e.g., associated
fees, the borrowing rate, and the time frame for repaying borrowed funds), the amount of the
credit facility, whether the credit facility is committed or uncommitted, 316 and the financial
health of the institution(s) providing the facility (especially to the extent that the fund also holds
bonds or other securities issued by such institution(s), as a decrease in these securities’
liquidity—caused, for example, by increased volatility of their trading prices—could contribute
to an increased need to borrow from the institution). If a credit facility is shared among multiple
funds within a fund family, a fund may wish to consider that the ability of that facility to mitigate
the liquidity risk of one fund within the family hinges in part on the degree of liquidity risk
associated with the other funds sharing the facility. A fund also may wish to consider any
negative impact on the fund resulting from borrowing funds for liquidity risk management
purposes, as opposed to managing liquidity through the fund’s portfolio construction. For
example, borrowing funds to pay redeeming shareholders (for example, to avoid making sales of
assets into distressed markets) could be beneficial to redeeming shareholders but could
ultimately disadvantage non-redeeming shareholders who would effectively bear the costs of
borrowing. 317 In assessing the effects of the fund’s borrowing arrangements on the fund’s
liquidity risk, a fund may find it useful to assess the purposes for which the fund has historically
borrowed funds to pay redemption proceeds. Finally, if a fund holds bonds or other securities

316

A committed line of credit represents a bank’s obligation, in exchange for a fee, to make a loan to a fund
subject to specified conditions. A bank can also provide an uncommitted or standby line of credit, in which
the bank indicates a willingness, but no obligation, to lend to a fund. See Fortune, supra note 270, at 47.

317

See Heartland Release, supra note 47.

124

issued by a bank, the fund may wish to consider whether entering into a borrowing arrangement
with the same bank that issued such securities increases correlated exposure to the bank.
A fund also could engage in interfund lending within a family of funds if the fund has
obtained exemptive relief from the Commission permitting the arrangement. 318 When
considering the extent to which an interfund lending arrangement could affect a fund’s liquidity
risk, we believe a fund may find it instructive to evaluate the terms of the arrangement (e.g., the
lending rate and the time frame for repaying borrowed funds), as well as any conditions required
under exemptive relief, including limitations on the circumstances in which interfund lending
may be used. For example, it is common for exemptive orders to permit interfund lending in
circumstances in which there is a timing mismatch between when a fund is required to pay
redeeming shareholders and when any asset sales that the fund has executed in order to pay
redemptions will settle (e.g., a fund may be required to pay redeeming shareholders within three
business days, but the portfolio transactions the fund has executed in order to pay these
shareholders may not settle for seven days). A fund can reasonably predict that it will repay
borrowed money relatively quickly and reliably under these circumstances. Therefore this type
of borrowing would tend to be very low risk, and thus entail less liquidity risk, 319 than borrowing
money to pay redemptions without already having secured a price at which the assets used to
cover the borrowing will be sold.
Finally, a fund could generate liquidity through repurchase transactions, whereby the
fund could agree to sell securities to another party at a specified price with a commitment to buy
the securities back at a later date for another specified price. A repurchase agreement is
318

See infra note 320 and accompanying and following text.

319

See supra section III.C.1.c (discussing circumstances in which a fund’s use of leverage and derivatives
could increase the fund’s liquidity risk).

125

structurally similar to a short-term loan, and thus a fund could use repurchase agreements to
temporarily borrow cash to repay redeeming shareholders. A fund may find it instructive to
consider how factors such as market conditions, supply and demand factors, whether the
repurchase agreement is on a bilateral or tri-party basis, and counterparty credit risk could affect
the ability of repurchase transactions to mitigate liquidity risk.
A fund’s borrowing and other funding arrangements are subject to restrictions on
affiliated transactions and leverage under the Investment Company Act and rules under the Act.
For example, funds must obtain exemptive relief from the Commission before executing
transactions that implicate section 17 of the Investment Company Act, which restricts
transactions between an “affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated
person of such affiliated person” and that investment company. 320 Thus, as noted above, a fund
must obtain exemptive relief before executing interfund lending arrangements. Additionally,
funds’ borrowing arrangements must be conducted in compliance with section 18 of the
Investment Company Act, which limits a fund’s ability to issue or sell “senior securities.” For
instance, section 18(f) of the Investment Company Act limits funds to bank borrowing with
300% asset coverage. 321 The Commission and its staff have also taken the position that reverse

See Investment Company Act sections 17(a) (prohibiting first- and second-tier affiliates of a fund from
borrowing money or other property from, or selling or buying securities or other property to or from the
fund, or any company that the fund controls; 17(b) (permitting the Commission to grant an exemptive order
permitting transactions that would otherwise be prohibited under section 17(a) if certain conditions of
fairness are met); see also Investment Company Act section 17(d) (making it unlawful for first- and
second-tier affiliates of a fund, the fund’s principal underwriters, and affiliated persons of the fund’s
principal underwriters, acting as principal, to effect any transaction in which the fund or a company
controlled by the fund is a joint or a joint and several participant in contravention of Commission rules);
rule 17d-1(a) under the Investment Company Act (prohibiting first- and second-tier affiliates of a fund, the
fund’s principal underwriters, and affiliated persons of the fund’s principal underwriters, acting as
principal, from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or other
joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan in which any such fund or company controlled by a fund is a
participant unless an application regarding such enterprise, arrangement or plan has been filed with the
Commission and has been granted).

repurchase agreements may involve the issuance of a senior security subject to the requirements
of section 18 and, under certain circumstances, a fund could need to “cover” the senior security
by maintaining “segregated accounts.” 322 These statutory and regulatory restrictions could
constrain a fund’s ability to use borrowing and other funding sources to meet redemption
requests, and these limitations should be considered in assessing a fund’s liquidity risk.

Request for Comment

We request comment on the proposed liquidity risk assessment requirement.
•

Do commenters believe that the definition of “liquidity risk” in proposed rule 22e-4 is
appropriate? Within the proposed definition, are the terms “reasonably foreseeable” and
“without materially affecting the fund’s NAV” clear? If not, how could the definition of
“liquidity risk,” and terms within the proposed definition, be made more appropriate
and/or clear?

•

How do funds currently assess their liquidity risk? Who at the fund and/or the adviser is
tasked with assessing the fund’s liquidity risk? Who should be tasked with assessing the
fund’s liquidity risk? Should the proposed rule specify the officers or functional areas
that should be tasked with assessing a fund’s liquidity risk?

except that a fund may borrow from any bank so long as immediately after the borrowing there is asset
coverage of at least 300% for all borrowings of the fund).
322

See, e.g., Release 10666 supra note 241. In Release 10666, the Commission considered the application of
section 18’s restrictions on the issuance of senior securities to reverse repurchase agreements (among other
types of agreements). The Commission concluded that such agreements may involve the issuance of senior
securities subject to the prohibitions and asset coverage requirements of section 18. The Commission
further stated that, although reverse repurchase agreements (among other types of agreements) are
functionally equivalent to senior securities, these and similar arrangements nonetheless could be used by
funds in a manner that would not warrant application of the section 18 restrictions. The Commission noted
that in circumstances involving similar economic effects, such as short sales of securities by funds,
Commission staff had determined that the issue of section 18 compliance would not be raised if funds
“cover” senior securities by maintaining “segregated accounts.” The Commission also discussed the
specific attributes of segregated accounts, board obligations, and other related matters in Release 10666.

127

We also request comment on each of the proposed factors that each fund would be
required to consider in assessing its liquidity risk.
•

What factors do funds currently use to assess their liquidity risk, and do the proposed
factors reflect factors that funds (and/or the adviser, as applicable) already consider when
evaluating liquidity risk? Should any of the proposed factors not be required to be
considered by a fund in assessing its liquidity risk? Should any of the proposed factors
be modified? Are there any additional factors, besides the proposed factors, that a fund
should be required to consider in assessing liquidity risk? Should any of the proposed
factors be given additional weight and, if so, under what circumstances?

•

Instead of codifying the proposed factors as part of proposed rule 22e-4, should we
provide guidance on factors that might be appropriate for a fund to consider in assessing
its liquidity risk?
We seek comment on the Commission’s guidance discussed above regarding each of the

proposed factors.
•

Besides the guidance, are there any other specific issues associated with any of the
proposed factors that a fund may wish to consider in assessing the fund’s liquidity risk?
Do commenters generally agree with the guidance that the Commission has proposed
regarding the ways in which each of the proposed factors could contribute to a fund’s
liquidity risk? Should the staff provide additional guidance about the factors? Should we
add a note to rule 22e-4 indicating that the release includes additional guidance regarding
the proposed factors?

128

•

Are there any factors or procedures that would be of particular use to a fund without a
substantial operating history in assessing liquidity risk? Would a new fund look to
purchase and redemption activity in similar funds to predict its flow patterns?
2.

Periodic Review of a Fund’s Liquidity Risk
a.

Proposed Liquidity Risk Review Requirement

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii) would require a fund to periodically review the fund’s
liquidity risk, taking into account each of the factors of proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)(A)-(D)
(discussed above in sections III.C.1.a – III.C.1.d). We believe that the periodic review of a
fund’s liquidity risk is necessary to determine whether, in light of current circumstances, an
adequate level of liquidity is being maintained. Like the proposed requirement to monitor the
liquidity of portfolio assets, 323 the proposed liquidity risk review requirement would permit each
fund to develop and adopt effective and individualized procedures to review the fund’s liquidity
risk, tailored as appropriate to reflect the fund’s particular facts and circumstances. A fund
would be required to consider each of the proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)(A)-(D) factors in
reviewing its liquidity risk. However, beyond this, rule 22e-4 does not include prescribed review
procedures, nor does it specify the required risk review period or incorporate specific
developments that a fund should consider as part of its review. A fund might generally consider
whether its periodic review procedures should include procedures for evaluating regulatory,
market-wide, and fund-specific developments affecting each of the proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)
risk factors. Because a fund’s liquidity risk is directly related to the liquidity of the fund’s
portfolio assets (as reflected by proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)(B), which requires consideration
of the liquidity of a fund’s portfolio assets as an element of the fund’s liquidity risk assessment),
323

See proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(i).

129

a fund may wish to adopt liquidity risk review procedures that reference the fund’s procedures
for monitoring portfolio assets’ liquidity. For example, a fund’s liquidity risk review procedures
could specify that certain circumstances giving rise to a revision of a portfolio asset’s liquidity
classification 324 could necessitate a review of the fund’s liquidity risk.
b.

Request for Comment

We request comment on the proposed liquidity risk review requirement.
•

How do funds currently review liquidity risk? How often do funds currently review this
risk? To what extent do funds anticipate that the periodic review procedures that would
be required under proposed rule 22e-4 would replicate procedures funds currently use to
periodically evaluate liquidity risks facing the fund?

•

Are there certain review procedures that the Commission should require and/or on which
the Commission should provide guidance? Should the Commission specify how
frequently a fund must review its liquidity risk? Should funds review liquidity risk at
least as frequently as they conduct ongoing liquidity reviews? Should the Commission
expand its guidance on regulatory, market-wide, and fund-specific developments that a
fund’s review procedures should cover?
3.

Portfolio Liquidity: Minimum Investments in Three-Day Liquid Assets
a.

Proposed Three-Day Liquid Asset Minimum Requirement

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(A) would require each fund to determine the fund’s
“three-day liquid asset minimum” as part of its liquidity risk management program. 325 As

324

See, e.g., supra paragraph accompanying notes 251-254.

325

Under proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(C), a fund would be prohibited from acquiring any less liquid asset if,
immediately after the acquisition, the fund would have invested less than its three-day liquid asset
minimum in three-day liquid assets.

130

proposed, the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum would be defined as the percentage of the
fund’s net assets to be invested in three-day liquid assets. 326 In determining its three-day liquid
asset minimum, a fund would be required to consider the factors a fund would be required to
consider in assessing its liquidity risk under proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii). 327 These factors
include an assessment of short-term and long-term cash flow projections, taking into account
certain specified considerations discussed further below; the investment strategy and liquidity of
the fund’s portfolio assets; the use of borrowings and derivatives for investment purposes (for
example, to enhance returns), 328 and holdings of cash and cash equivalents, as well as borrowing
arrangements and other funding sources. These factors are based, in part, on staff outreach to
funds and third-party service providers that assess liquidity risk on behalf of funds, and they also
incorporate considerations that we believe have historically contributed to liquidity risk in
open-end funds. 329
A fund’s board would be required to approve the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum
(including any changes to the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum), 330 and a fund would be
required to maintain a written record of how the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum was
determined (including an assessment of each of the factors proposed rule 22e-4 would require a
fund to assess in making this determination). 331

326

We propose to define three-day liquid asset as any cash held by a fund and any position of a fund in an
asset (or portion of the fund’s position in an asset) that the fund believes is convertible into cash within
three business days at a price that does not materially affect the value of that asset immediately prior to
sale. See proposed rule 22e-4(a)(8).

327

See proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(A).

331

See proposed rule 22e-4(c)(3) (each fund must maintain a written record of how the three-day liquid asset

131

We are proposing the requirement for each fund to determine a three-day liquid asset
minimum to increase the likelihood that the fund will hold adequate liquid assets to meet
redemption requests without materially affecting the fund’s NAV. Although the Commission
has stated that open-end funds have a general responsibility to maintain an appropriate level of
portfolio liquidity, no requirements under the federal securities laws or Commission rules
specifically oblige open-end funds (with the exception of money market funds) to maintain a
minimum level of portfolio liquidity. 332 We believe that codifying a three-day liquid asset
minimum requirement would result in a portfolio liquidity standard that fosters consistency in
funds’ consideration of the factors relevant to their liquidity risk management, while
simultaneously permitting flexibility in implementation, which we believe is appropriate in light
of the significant diversity of holdings and strategies within the fund industry.
We believe setting the minimum amount of liquid assets in the fund based on three-day
liquid assets is appropriate for a number of reasons. Most funds sell at least some of their shares
through broker-dealers, and thus, as a practical matter, are required as a result of rule 15c6-1
under the Exchange Act to meet redemptions within three business days. 333 While some mutual
funds disclose in their prospectuses that they will generally pay redemption proceeds on a nextbusiness day basis and many others do so as a matter of practice, 334 we are not proposing that

minimum, and any adjustments thereto, were determined, including assessment of the factors specified in
proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)(A)-(D), for a period of not less than five years (the first two years in an easily
accessible place) following the determination of and each change to the three-day liquid asset minimum).
332

See supra section II.D.1.

333

See, e.g., Fidelity FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 20, at 6 (“As a practical matter, three-day
settlement requirements under Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1…effectively take most fund investments to a
T+3 settlement timeline.”).

334

See id. at 6 (“mutual funds normally process redemption requests by the next business day”); see also ICI
FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 16, at 17 (“For example, a mutual fund has by law up to seven
days to pay proceeds to redeeming investors, although as a matter of practice funds typically pay proceeds
within one to two days of a redemption request.”).

132

funds maintain a minimum amount of assets that may be converted to cash within one day, given
the impact such a minimum could have on investment strategies. Staff outreach has shown that,
for the funds that typically do target a minimum amount of liquidity in the fund, they typically
target either cash and cash equivalents or assets similar to our definition of three-day liquid
assets. Accordingly, targeting such a minimum appears to be a common practice for those funds
that do establish a target.
Consistent with the time period referenced in section 22(e) of the Act, we considered
requiring that a fund determine a minimum amount of liquid assets based on assets convertible to
cash within seven calendar days at a price that does not materially affect the value of that asset
immediately prior to sale (“seven-day liquid assets”). Determining a minimum amount of sevenday liquid assets would require that a fund have a certain amount of liquidity to meet
redemptions within the seven-day period required under the Act. However, we were concerned
that requiring a minimum amount of seven-day liquid assets would not as well match regulatory
requirements and disclosures that require most funds to meet redemption requests in shorter time
periods and market practices and investor expectations that effectively require all funds to meet
redemption requests in shorter time periods. We thus believe that a three-day liquid asset
minimum more effectively advances our goals of reducing the risk that funds will be unable to
meet redemptions and mitigating dilution.
We anticipate that the proposed requirement for a fund to consider certain factors,
including the factors required in assessing the fund’s liquidity risk, in determining its three-day
liquid asset minimum would promote investor protection by reducing the risk funds will be
unable to meet their redemption obligations, mitigating dilution, and elevating the overall quality
of liquidity risk management across the fund industry. The consideration of certain factors also

133

would require every fund to consider multiple aspects of its history, policies, strategy, and
operations that could give rise to liquidity risk.
When determining its three-day liquid asset minimum, a fund must consider short-term
and long-term cash flow projections, taking into account the following factors, which we
discussed previously in connection with the assessment of a fund’s liquidity risk: 335
•

the size, frequency, and volatility of historical purchases and redemptions of fund
shares during normal and stressed periods;

•

the fund’s redemption policies;

•

the fund’s shareholder ownership concentration;

•

the fund’s distribution channels; and

•

the degree of certainty associated with the fund’s short-term and long-term cash
flow projections. 336

We believe consideration of cash flow projections is pivotal to setting an appropriate
three-day liquid asset minimum. The primary goal of a minimum level of liquidity is to ensure
that each fund is able to meet redemptions and to do so with minimal dilution of shareholders’
interests. Doing so requires that the fund’s adviser, to the best of its ability, understands
potential levels of net redemptions and the causes and timing of those redemptions. To
adequately make such projections, we believe a fund must consider the sub-factors described
above. For example, it would be important to understand not just the magnitude of redemptions
the fund tends to receive, but also how frequent redemptions of various sizes are and how
volatile the fund’s flows are. It also may be important to understand how the fund’s redemption

336

See proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)(A).

134

activity compares to funds with similar investment strategies, for example, to understand whether
the fund may have unique liquidity risks (or lack liquidity risks) that may make past redemption
experiences less predictive of future redemption risk. It would be essential that the fund
formulate its cash flow projections after considering the factors in both normal and stressed
periods—minimum liquidity would not likely advance the Commission’s goal of reducing the
risk that funds will be unable to meet redemptions and mitigating dilution if funds can only meet
redemptions in stressed conditions through sales of portfolio assets that create dilution and
significantly increase the fund’s liquidity risk. In addition, a fund, though not required to do so,
may wish to consider employing some form of stress testing 337 or consider specific historical
redemption scenarios in determining its three-day liquid asset minimum.
In formulating the fund’s cash flow projections, a fund also must consider the fund’s
redemption policies, shareholder ownership concentration, and distribution channels. These are
important structural features of a fund that can materially affect the risk of significant
redemptions—and thus may cause a fund to set a higher three-day liquid asset minimum than
one based on its redemption history alone. For example, a fund with a concentrated shareholder
base has a high risk that only one or two shareholders deciding to redeem can cause the fund to
sell a significant amount of assets, which depending on the liquidity of the fund’s portfolio and
how it meets those redemptions, can dilute remaining shareholders. Similarly, a fund whose
redemption policy is to satisfy all redemptions on a next business day basis (T+1) or that is sold
through distribution channels that historically attract investors with more volatile and/or
unpredictable flows also should consider setting a higher three-day liquid asset minimum than a
337

large investment companies and investment advisers to engage in annual stress tests as required by section
165(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act).

135

fund that—all else equal—does not face these risks. Finally, in setting a three-day liquid asset
minimum it is critical that a fund consider the degree of certainty associated with the fund’s
short-term and long-term cash flow projections. Projections may only be as good as the extent
and quality of information that informs them. For example, if a fund does not have great
visibility into its shareholder base (e.g., because the fund’s shares are principally sold through
intermediaries that do not provide shareholder transparency) or if a fund is uncertain about
changing market conditions which are likely to materially affect the fund’s level of net
redemptions, it may make projections but be quite uncertain about those projections. In these
circumstances, we would expect a fund to set its three-day liquid asset minimum to reflect this
uncertainty, for example, by providing a cushion or multiple of its cash flow projections in the
event realized net redemptions are significantly higher. A fund should have a three-day liquid
asset minimum that will allow it to meet its net redemption projections.
In setting its three-day liquid asset minimum, a fund also must consider its investment
strategy and the liquidity of portfolio assets. A finding of the DERA Study is that certain
investment strategies typically have greater volatility of flows than other investment strategies.
For example, the DERA Study indicates that the mean standard deviation of monthly net flows
for alternative funds is 13.6% and for emerging market debt funds is 9.4%, but is only 2.7% for
municipal bond funds and 4.9% for U.S. corporate bond funds. 338 Accordingly, all else equal, we
generally would expect that an emerging market debt fund would have a higher three-day liquid
asset minimum than a municipal bond fund. Similarly, the less liquid a fund’s overall portfolio
assets are, the more a fund may want to establish a higher three-day liquid asset minimum to
avoid dilution when meeting investor redemptions.
338

DERA Study, supra note 39, at Table 6.

136

A fund also must consider its use of borrowings and derivatives in setting its three-day
liquid asset minimum. A leveraged fund has an increased risk that it will be unable to meet
redemptions and an increased risk of investor dilution compared to an equivalent fund with no
leverage. For example, a fund with leverage through bank borrowings may have to meet margin
calls if a security the fund provided to the bank to secure the loan declines in value. Such margin
calls can render highly liquid portfolio assets unavailable to meet investor redemptions, which
can increase dilution and the risk the fund will be unable to meet redemptions. Similarly, a fund
that has significant fixed obligations to derivatives counterparties (for example, from a total
return swap or writing credit default swaps) must pay out on these obligations when due, even if
it means selling the fund’s more liquid, high quality assets to raise cash. 339 A fund with a
leveraged strategy thus, all else equal, should have a higher three-day liquid asset minimum than
a fund that does not.
Finally, a fund must consider its holdings of cash and cash equivalents, as well as
borrowing arrangements and other funding sources when determining its three-day liquid asset
minimum. Unencumbered cash and cash equivalents are assets that the fund can typically
readily deploy, in normal and stressed conditions, to meet redemptions. A fund can have cash on
hand to meet redemptions from cash held in the fund’s portfolio, cash received from investor
purchases of fund shares, interest payments and dividends on portfolio securities, or maturing
bonds. Our staff observed that several fund complexes targeted a minimum amount of cash or
cash equivalent holdings in the fund because they assumed such holdings would allow the fund
to meet redemptions in a stressed period without realizing significant discounts to fair value
when the asset was sold. Accordingly, higher cash and cash equivalent holdings may make a
339

See, e.g., OppenheimerFunds Release, supra note 309.

137

fund more comfortable that it can meet redemptions under stressed conditions with a lower threeday asset minimum than an equivalent fund whose three-day asset minimum was comprised
primarily of non-cash equivalent assets. A fund also should consider whether it has a line of
credit or other funding sources available to it to meet redemptions. As discussed further below,
while we believe that liquidity risk management is best conducted primarily through portfolio
construction, we recognize a line of credit can facilitate a fund’s ability to meet unexpected
redemptions.
Because each fund would be required to maintain a written record of how its three-day
liquid asset minimum was determined, including an assessment of each of the factors discussed
above, 340 our examination staff would be able to ascertain that funds are indeed considering the
required factors. We expect that a board approving a fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum
would consider how the specified factors inform that minimum, and thus we believe that the
proposed rule would cause fund boards to consider a comprehensive set of issues surrounding the
fund’s liquidity risk and risk management. Moreover, we believe that the board approval
requirement associated with the three-day liquid asset minimum determination would add
independent oversight over funds’ liquidity risk management.
Although a fund would be permitted to determine its three-day liquid asset minimum
under the analysis required by the proposed rule, we generally believe that it would be extremely
difficult to conclude, based on the factors it would be required to consider, that a zero three-day
liquid asset minimum would be appropriate. Under the proposed rule, a fund’s three-day liquid
asset minimum would be a control to manage the fund’s liquidity risk, and as discussed above
the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum would be required to be determined based on the
340

See supra note 331.

138

consideration of certain specified factors. 341 We believe that it would be extremely difficult to
conclude, based on factors such as the fund’s cash flow projections and redemption policies, that
zero holdings of three-day liquid assets would allow the fund to manage its liquidity risk (in
conjunction with any other liquidity risk management policies and procedures the fund adopts as
part of its liquidity risk management program).
By way of example, consider a bank loan fund with a ten-year track record. The fund has
a history of volatile cash flows that it projects will continue, with periods of market stress and
reduced performance leading to increased net redemptions, and its largest net redemption during
a one-week period was five percent of the fund’s net assets. The fund does not have a
concentrated shareholder base and is sold through several broker-dealers. The fund has 98
percent of its net assets invested in bank loans and loan participations that do not settle within
three business days, one percent of its net assets invested in corporate bonds (which under this
example we are assuming qualify as three-day liquid assets) and one percent of its net assets in
cash and cash equivalents. The fund does not borrow or use derivatives for investment purposes,
but does have a committed credit line in place with a bank. It would appear that such a fund,
after assessing the factors required to be considered, would have a difficult time concluding that
its existing three-day liquid asset holdings would be an adequate minimum given the liquidity
risks inherent in the fund’s portfolio and its redemption history.
We considered establishing a floor for the three-day liquid asset minimum. For example,
we considered requiring that a fund set its three-day liquid asset minimum after consideration of
the factors described above, but in no event could the minimum be below a certain specified
percentage of the fund’s net assets or a certain multiple of its average or worst net redemptions.
341

See proposed rule 22e-4(b)(iv)(A).

139

A uniform percentage three-day liquid asset minimum floor could be difficult, however, given
the diverse range of funds to which it would apply and the range of net redemptions within
different types of funds indicated by the DERA Study. If set relatively high, a uniform
percentage floor risks requiring excessive liquidity in some funds given their portfolio
characteristics, investor base, and flow projections, which may unnecessarily constrain the fund’s
returns and investment in certain assets frustrating investors’ goals in choosing to invest in the
fund. If set relatively low, it may encourage some funds to set low levels of three-day liquid
asset minimums that would not effectively manage liquidity risk or mitigate dilution. A floor
also could be set based on a fund’s historical redemptions. However, such a floor would not be
forward-looking—a fund should be setting its minimum liquidity based in large part on
projections of expected future redemptions. Such an approach risks a fund setting its minimum
liquidity too low, for example during a period of rapid inflows that are likely to soon reverse.
Conversely, continuing with the same example, it risks setting minimum liquidity too high after
those flows have in fact reversed.
Accordingly, we preliminarily believe our proposed approach appropriately balances
these considerations by requiring that a rigorous set of factors be considered and documented,
and the three-day liquid asset minimum approved by the fund’s board, but otherwise allow the
minimum to be tailored to the nature of the fund and its cash flow projections. It should allow
funds with different investment strategies, and whose cash flow and liquidity needs vary notably
from one fund to the next, to manage their individual levels of liquidity risk in a way that best
serves their investors. 342 We recognize that funds’ three-day liquid asset minimums would likely

342

See, e.g., BlackRock FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 50, at 6 (statement that among several
overarching principles that provide the foundation for a prudent market liquidity risk management
framework for collective investment vehicles is “[r]equiring that individual funds have sufficient sources of

140

vary from one fund to the next (even within the same strategy), depending on the factors that
each fund would be required to consider. But we believe that consideration and documentation
of the required factors, board oversight, and public disclosure of the fund’s three-day liquid asset
minimum should constrain funds from setting an inappropriately low minimum in light of the
fund’s liquidity needs and risks. 343
We also note that assets eligible for inclusion in each fund’s three-day liquid asset
minimum holdings could include a broad variety of securities, as well as cash and cash
equivalents. While one fund may conclude that it is appropriate to hold a significant portion of
its three-day liquid assets in cash and cash equivalents, another could decide it is appropriate to
hold equity, debt, derivatives or asset-backed securities as the majority of its three-day liquid
asset minimum holdings. We believe that the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum
requirement would allow funds to continue to meet a wide variety of investors’ investment needs
by obliging funds to maintain appropriate liquidity in their portfolios, while permitting funds to
remain substantially invested in portfolio assets that conform to their investment strategies.
The proposed three-day liquid asset minimum requirement reflects liquidity management
strategies that we understand from staff outreach that some—but not all—funds use. Based on
staff outreach, we understand that funds of different sizes, with varying investment strategies,
manage their liquidity by maintaining specified portions of their portfolios in more liquid assets.

market liquidity to meet anticipated redemptions under a range of scenarios, including changes in market
risk factors (e.g., interest rates) that may impact the value of portfolio securities and/or collateral and
various levels of potential fund redemptions. This could be achieved by setting out principles for managing
liquidity and redemption risk that should include maintaining sufficient levels of liquid assets, such as cash
and liquid bonds as well as dedicated and shared loan facilities. The principles-based approach should
provide appropriate flexibility to tailor practices to particular asset structures and fund redemption terms.”).
343

See infra section III.D.1-2 (discussing board approval of the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum and any
changes thereto), section III.G.2.c (discussing disclosure of a fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum on
proposed Form N-PORT).

141

Some funds invest a certain percentage of their assets in cash and cash equivalents; others invest
in other types of more liquid portfolio securities corresponding with their investment strategies.
To the extent that a fund already maintains a specified portion of its portfolio in more liquid
assets, we anticipate that the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum requirement would
formalize this risk management strategy, and augment it by requiring the fund to consider certain
factors in determining the portion of assets that the fund will maintain in three-day liquid assets.
More importantly, it would require the many funds that do not consider maintaining a minimum
amount of liquidity, despite their obligations to meet redemptions within a certain time period, to
do so.
b.

Limiting Acquisition of Less Liquid Assets in Contravention of a Fund’s
Three-Day Liquid Asset Minimum

Under proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(C), a fund would not be permitted to acquire any
less liquid asset if, immediately after the acquisition, the fund would have invested less than its
three-day liquid asset minimum in three-day liquid assets. 344 This provision of proposed rule
22e-4 would thus limit the acquisition of less liquid assets if such acquisition would result in the
fund holding a smaller percentage of its net assets in three-day liquid assets than the percentage
representing its three-day liquid asset minimum. The provision would not, however, require a
fund to constantly have invested a certain portion of its net assets in three-day liquid assets. For
example, if a fund’s investments in three-day liquid assets were to temporarily drop below the
fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum, proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(C) would require the fund
to acquire only three-day liquid assets until its investments in three-day liquid assets reach the

344

A fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum would apply at the series level, not at the class level.

142

fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum, but the proposed rule would not require the fund to
divest less liquid assets and reinvest the proceeds in three-day liquid assets. 345
While we believe that fund shareholders’ interests are generally best served when the
percentage of a fund’s assets invested in three-day liquid assets is at (or above) the fund’s
three-day liquid asset minimum, 346 we believe that requiring a fund to maintain this percentage
at all times could adversely affect shareholders and could potentially negate the liquidity risk
management benefits of the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum requirement. For instance,
if a fund were forced to sell less liquid assets at an inopportune time in order to reinvest the
proceeds in three-day liquid assets, the fund might need to sell the less liquid assets at prices that
incorporate a significant discount to the assets’ stated value, or even at fire sale prices. These
forced sales could produce significant negative price pressure on those assets and decrease the
value of the assets still held by the fund, thereby decreasing the value of fund shares held by
remaining investors, and possibly creating a first-mover advantage that harms investors who
choose not to redeem their shares as quickly as others. 347 Also, if a fund needed to rebalance its
portfolio frequently to maintain a specified percentage of the fund’s net assets invested in
three-day liquid assets, this could produce unnecessary transaction costs adversely affecting the
fund’s NAV, and could cause a fund to sell portfolio assets when it is not advantageous to do so
(e.g., when an asset’s price is low, or when sales of an asset would have an undesirable tax

345

A fund’s investments in three-day liquid assets could drop below the fund’s three-day liquid asset
minimum for a variety of reasons. For instance, the fund could sell its most liquid assets in order to obtain
cash to meet redemption requests, thereby reducing its holdings of three-day liquid assets. Or, if the market
value of a fund’s three-day liquid assets falls relative to the market value of the fund’s less liquid assets, the
percentage of a fund’s assets invested in three-day liquid assets could decrease. A fund’s three-day liquid
assets also could become less liquid if market conditions deteriorate.

346

See infra notes 690-698 and accompanying text.

143

impact). For these reasons, we are proposing a requirement that limits the acquisition of less
liquid assets when such acquisition would result in a fund investing less than its three-day liquid
asset minimum in three-day liquid assets, but we are not proposing to require that funds always
maintain a certain portion of their portfolio assets in three-day liquid assets. 348
c.

Periodic Review of a Fund’s Three-Day Liquid Asset Minimum

Under proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(B), each fund would be required to periodically
review the adequacy of the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum, and in conducting such
review would be required to take into account the factors a fund would be required to consider in
determining its three-day liquid asset minimum. We believe the factors used to determine a
fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum also provide an appropriate framework for reviewing the
adequacy of a fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum because, as discussed below, changes in
the assessment of the factors could provide a basis for adjusting the three-day liquid asset
minimum. A fund would be required to complete this review no less frequently than semiannually, 349 but could establish a more frequent periodic review period, and in addition could
review the three-day liquid asset minimum even more frequently on an ad-hoc basis as

348

This proposed acquisition test (in contrast to a maintenance test) reflects approaches that Congress and the
Commission have historically taken in other parts of the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder.
See, e.g., Investment Company Act section 5(c) (a registered diversified company that at the time of its
qualification meets the diversification requirements specified in Investment Company Act section 5(b)(1)
shall not lose its status as a diversified company because of any subsequent discrepancy between the value
of its various investments and the requirements of section 5(b)(1), so long as any such discrepancy existing
immediately after its acquisition of any security or other property is neither wholly nor partly the result of
such acquisition); rule 2a-7(d)(3) (portfolio diversification requirements of rule 2a-7 are determined at the
time of portfolio securities’ acquisition); rule 2a-7(d)(4)(i) (limit on a money market fund’s acquisition of
illiquid securities if, immediately after the acquisition, the money market fund would have invested more
than 5% of its total assets in illiquid securities); rule 2a-7(d)(4)(ii)-(iii) (minimum daily liquidity
requirement and minimum weekly liquidity requirement of rule 2a-7 are determined at the time of portfolio
securities’ acquisition).

349

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(B).

144

conditions demand. 350 As discussed below, the fund’s investment adviser or officers
administering the fund’s liquidity risk management program would be required to submit written
reports to the fund’s board concerning the adequacy of the fund’s liquidity risk management
program, including the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum, and the effectiveness of its
implementation. Board approval would be required for any changes to the fund’s three-day
liquid asset minimum.351 Each fund would be required to maintain a copy of the written reports
provided to the board, as well as a written record of the fund’s assessment of the factors set forth
in rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)(A) through (D) and the determination of the three-day liquid asset
minimum, and any reviews and adjustments to the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum. 352
Because we anticipate that a fund would rely significantly on its three-day liquid assets in
meeting fund redemptions, we view the three-day liquid asset minimum determination as a
cornerstone of a fund’s liquidity risk management, and we believe it is important for a fund to
periodically reassess whether its three-day liquid asset minimum effectively assists the fund in
managing its liquidity risk. We envision the determination of a fund’s three-day liquid asset
minimum as a dynamic process, incorporating new or updated information into the fund’s
assessment of factors, reflecting shareholder-related, fund-management-oriented, or market
changes that could affect the fund’s ability to meet redemptions. A fund’s three-day liquid asset
minimum could become outdated for multiple reasons. For example, a fund’s shareholder
ownership concentration could change or market events could reveal that shareholder redemption

See infra paragraph following note 352.

351

See infra section III.D (discussing the board’s role in approving and overseeing a fund’s liquidity risk
management program); see also proposed rule 22e-4(b)(3)(i) and (ii). We note that a fund may hold more
three-day liquid assets than required by the three-day liquid asset minimum. Thus, a fund may determine it
is appropriate to increase its minimum holdings in three-day liquid assets without waiting for the next
board meeting (or calling a special meeting) to formally approve an increase in the minimum.

352

See supra note 331.

145

patterns are different than anticipated under certain circumstances. Additionally, market events
or national regulatory, monetary, and fiscal policies could affect the liquidity of a fund’s
portfolio assets. Any of these events, or similar events influencing a fund’s cash flows, portfolio
liquidity, or the other liquidity risk factors included in proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii), could alter
the level of three-day liquid assets that a fund would determine appropriate to manage its
liquidity risk.
Like the proposed requirements to perform an ongoing review of the liquidity of portfolio
assets and to review periodically the fund’s liquidity risk, 353 the proposed three-day liquid asset
minimum review requirement would permit each fund to develop and adopt its own procedures
for conducting this review, taking into account the fund’s particular facts and circumstances.
While each fund would be required to consider each of the proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)(A)-(D)
factors in periodically reviewing its three-day liquid asset minimum, rule 22e-4 would not
otherwise include prescribed review procedures or incorporate specific developments that a fund
should consider as part of its review. We believe that in developing comprehensive periodic
review procedures, a fund should generally consider including procedures for evaluating
regulatory, market-wide, and fund-specific developments affecting the fund’s liquidity risk. A
fund also may wish to adopt procedures specifying any circumstances that would prompt ad-hoc
review of the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum in addition to the periodic review required
by the proposed rule (as well as the process for conducting any ad-hoc reviews).
d.

Request for Comment

We request comment on all aspects of the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum
requirement.
353

See supra note 323 and accompanying text.

146

•

Do commenters agree that the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum requirement
would improve a fund’s ability to meet redemption requests without materially affecting
the fund’s NAV? Are we correct that not all funds today target holding a minimum
amount of more liquid assets?

•

Do commenters agree that the proposed requirement would promote investor protection
by enhancing funds’ ability to meet their redemption obligations, mitigating dilution, and
elevating the overall quality (comprehensiveness as well as independence) of liquidity
risk management across the industry? Would the proposed requirement assist fund
boards in overseeing funds’ ability to meet redemption obligations?

•

Should we define the three-day liquid asset minimum as proposed? Should we define
three-day liquid assets as proposed? If not, why not? Are there other definitions that
would be better? If so, what are they? Should we preclude certain assets or types of
assets from being considered three-day liquid assets? If so, which assets or asset types
and why? For example, should we prohibit funds from classifying as three-day liquid
assets any assets that are subject, directly or indirectly, to a guarantee, put, wrap, swap, or
other liquidity enhancement from a third party? Alternatively, should we require specific
disclosure regarding such assets? If so, what should be included in the disclosure?
Should we require that the fund more stringently or frequently monitor the liquidity of
three-day liquid assets?

•

Would an alternate liquid asset holdings requirement (e.g., a seven-day liquid asset
minimum requirement, a one-day liquid asset minimum requirement, or a buffer of cash
and cash equivalents or a combination of the above) better accomplish these goals, and if
so, what should that alternate requirement be and why? Should funds that disclose that

147

they will meet redemptions (or are otherwise required to meet redemptions) within less
than three business days be required to have liquid asset minimum requirements that
correspond to those shorter redemption windows (given that there may be liability under
the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws if a fund fails to meet redemptions
within any shorter time disclosed in the fund’s prospectus or advertising materials)?
Conversely, should funds that disclose that under normal circumstances they expect to
meet redemptions within a period that is longer than three business days (e.g., within the
seven days permitted under section 22(e)) be permitted to have liquid asset minimum
requirements that correspond to those longer redemption windows? Which funds (and
holding how much assets) are not subject to rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act? Would
different minimum liquidity requirements for different open-end funds be confusing to
investors?
•

Instead of permitting each fund to determine the portion of liquid asset holdings that
would most effectively enable it to manage its own liquidity risk, should the Commission
instead mandate a standard level of required minimum liquid asset holdings across-theboard, or different levels depending on different investment strategies (or some other
fund characteristic)? If so, at what level (e.g., 1%, 5%, 10%), and what considerations
would form the basis for the recommended level?

•

Should the Commission set a floor below which a fund could not set its three-day liquid
asset minimum? Should it do so only for funds that hold above a certain percentage of
net assets in less liquid assets? If so, what percentage of less liquid assets should trigger
the mandated floor on the three-day liquid asset minimum? What should the floor on the
three-day liquid asset minimum be for such funds?

148

•

In addition to specifying that a fund must determine its three-day liquid asset minimum,
should the Commission also require a fund to limit its investment in a subset of less
liquid assets held by a fund (e.g., assets that can only be converted to cash in over 7 days,
over 15 days, over 30 days, or over 90 days at a price that does not materially affect the
value of that asset immediately prior to sale)? If so, what should this limit be? Should it
be a set percentage of fund assets established by the Commission (e.g., 5%, 10%, 20%,
30%), or should a fund be required to set its own limit, using the factors it would be
required to consider in determining its three-day liquid asset minimum (or some other set
of factors)? Should this limit apply to all funds, or only a subset of funds (e.g., only
funds with certain investment strategies, or whose three-day liquid asset minimums are
below a certain threshold)? Would such a requirement be an effective substitute for the
limit on 15% standard assets discussed below?

•

Should we exclude certain funds from the proposed requirement to determine a three-day
liquid asset minimum? For example, should a fund that only invests in three-day liquid
assets be required to determine a three-day liquid asset minimum?

•

Instead of a requirement that limits the acquisition of less liquid assets when such
acquisition would result in a fund investing less than its required minimum in three-day
liquid assets, would a requirement mandating that a fund always maintain a specified
portion of its assets in three-day liquid assets better facilitate funds’ liquidity risk
management and promote investor protection? Should a fund be required to hold some
minimum portion of assets in holdings that are likely to be liquid in stressed market
environments? If so, what type of assets, at what level, and what considerations would
form the basis for the recommended level?

149

•

As noted above, the three-day liquid asset minimum would be tested each time the fund
acquires new assets, and a fund would be permitted to fall below its three-day liquid asset
minimum if it does so due to redemptions or market events. Once a fund falls below its
three-day liquid asset minimum, any acquisition of new assets must be of three-day liquid
assets until the fund is at or above its three-day liquid asset minimum. Should we limit
the time period (e.g., to 30 days, 60 days, or 90 days) in which a fund can be below its
three-day liquid asset minimum so that a fund cannot persistently be below this level of
liquidity? Would such an approach better promote investor protection? Would there be
operational challenges with this requirement? Should we limit the extent to which a fund
can fall below its three-day liquid asset minimum? If so, what extent should be the limit?

•

Should the board be required to approve the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum and
any changes to the three-day liquid asset minimum? Why or why not?
We request comment on how the three-day liquid asset minimum requirement (or a

similar requirement) could affect the management of a fund’s liquidity risk, decrease the
probability that the fund will be able to meet redemption obligations only through activities that
could materially affect the fund’s NAV or risk profile, and mitigate dilution.
•

What range of levels of three-day liquid assets do commenters anticipate different funds
would determine to be appropriate, based on the factors the proposed rule would require a
fund to consider? What types of securities do commenters anticipate that different funds
would determine are or are not appropriate as three-day liquid asset minimum holdings?

•

How many funds today target a minimum level of more liquid assets? If some funds
indeed aim to invest a certain portion of their assets in more liquid assets for purposes of
liquidity risk management, what types of assets do funds hold for these purposes, and

150

how do funds determine what portion of their net assets they intend to invest in these
assets? What burdens and other difficulties, if any, would funds have in initially
complying with the three-day liquid asset minimum requirement?
•

What are the processes that commenters anticipate a fund would use for determining and
reviewing its three-day liquid asset minimum under the proposed rule? Do commenters
generally agree with the guidance that the Commission has provided regarding the
processes a fund could use to determine and review its three-day liquid asset minimum?
Should the minimum frequency of the fund’s review of the adequacy of its three-day
liquid asset minimum be shorter than semi-annually (such as quarterly) or longer (such as
annually)?

•

Should the Commission specify certain procedures that a fund must use in determining its
three-day liquid asset minimum, such as requiring a fund to consider specific historical
redemption scenarios? Should we require that the minimum not be less than, for
example, a fund’s highest historical level of net redemptions, its average level of net
redemptions over some time period, or a multiple (e.g., two times) of those levels?
We request comment on the proposed factors that each fund would be required to

consider in determining and reviewing its three-day liquid asset minimum.
•

To what extent do funds already consider the proposed factors when determining the
portion of fund assets that should be invested in more liquid assets for purposes of
liquidity risk management? Do commenters believe it is appropriate for a fund to
consider the same set of factors in determining and reviewing its three-day liquid asset
minimum as it considers in assessing and reviewing its liquidity risk? Are there other
factors that would be preferable?

151

•

Should any of the proposed factors not be required to be considered by a fund in
determining and reviewing its three-day liquid asset minimum? Should any of the
proposed factors be modified? Are there any additional factors, besides the proposed
factors, that a fund should be required to consider?

•

Instead of codifying the proposed factors as part of proposed rule 22e-4, should the
Commission provide guidance on factors that may be appropriate for a fund to consider
in determining and reviewing its three-day liquid asset minimum? Should the
Commission provide additional guidance on the proposed factors?

Portfolio Liquidity: Limitation on Funds’ Investments in 15% Standard Assets
a.

15% Standard Assets

Included in proposed rule 22e-4 is a limit on a fund’s ability to acquire “15% standard
assets.” Specifically, proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(D) would prohibit a fund from acquiring any
15% standard asset if, immediately after the acquisition, the fund would have invested more than
15% of its net assets in 15% standard assets. The provision would not require a fund to divest
any holdings if 15% standard assets rise above 15% of its net assets. 354
Under proposed rule 22e-4(a)(4), a 15% standard asset would be defined as any asset that
may not be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business within seven calendar days at
approximately the value ascribed to it by the fund. 355 For purposes of the proposed definition, a
354

A fund’s investments in 15% standard assets could rise above 15% of the fund’s net assets for a variety of
reasons. For instance, the fund could sell its most liquid assets in order to obtain cash to meet redemption
requests, thereby increasing its holdings of 15% standard assets relative to its total holdings. Or, if the
market value of a fund’s 15% standard assets rises relative to the market value of the fund’s other assets,
the percentage of a fund’s assets invested in 15% standard assets could increase. Assets that are not 15%
standard assets also could become 15% standard assets if market conditions deteriorate. See supra note
345 (discussing similar considerations with respect to a fund’s holdings of three-day liquid assets).

355

As discussed above, under the 15% guideline, a portfolio security or other asset is considered illiquid if it
cannot “be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business within seven days at approximately the
value at which the mutual fund has valued the investment.” See supra note 93. Rule 2a-7(a)(20) defines

152

fund would not be required to take into account the size of the fund’s position in the asset or the
time period associated with receipt of proceeds of sale or disposition of the asset. We believe
that assets included in the definition of 15% standard asset would be consistent with those
currently classified as illiquid by funds under the 15% guideline, and that such a limit would be
an important limitation on certain relatively illiquid holdings in funds’ portfolios, such as private
equity investments, securities acquired in an initial public offering, and real estate assets. As
noted above, we believe that the 15% guideline has generally caused funds to limit their
exposure to particular types of securities that cannot be sold within seven days and the proposed
limit on 15% standard assets would continue to limit these exposures.
As discussed above, the Commission and staff have in the past provided guidance in
connection with the 15% guideline. 356 We propose to withdraw this guidance because we believe
this proposal provides a more comprehensive framework for funds to evaluate the liquidity of
their assets. We request comment below on whether additional guidance is needed in connection
with the definition of 15% standard asset.
We believe that the proposed limit on 15% standard assets and the proposed three-day
liquid asset minimum each serve distinctly important, but interrelated, roles in managing
liquidity risk. We therefore propose to require each fund to comply with the limit on 15%
standard assets as well as the three-day liquid asset minimum requirement. While the three-day
liquid asset minimum requirement would increase the likelihood that each fund holds adequate

the term “illiquid security” to mean “a security that cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of
business within seven calendar days at approximately the value ascribed to it by the fund.” We understand
the terms “approximately the value at which the . . . fund has valued the investment” and “approximately
the value ascribed to it by the fund” to have identical meanings. For the sake of consistency with the
language of current rule 2a-7, the definition of 15% standard asset incorporates the “approximately the
value ascribed to it by the fund” formulation.
356

See supra section II.D.2.

153

liquid assets to meet redemption requests without materially affecting the fund’s NAV, the limit
on 15% standard assets would increase the likelihood that a fund’s portfolio is not concentrated
in assets whose liquidity is limited and thus may serve as a limit on certain cases of fund
illiquidity. While we considered requiring a different percentage-based ceiling on relatively
illiquid holdings, we ultimately decided that proposing the 15% standard would effectively
accomplish our intended goals while disrupting funds’ existing practices to the least extent
possible.
While this definition is similar to the definition of an asset that cannot be converted to
cash within seven days under the proposed liquidity classification framework, we note several
key differences between the definitions. When determining whether an asset may be sold or
disposed of within seven calendar days for purposes of assessing whether the asset is a 15%
standard asset, a fund need not consider whether it can receive the proceeds of such sale or
disposition within the same seven-day time period. In contrast, the classification framework
takes into consideration whether a fund could convert an asset to cash—that is, sell the asset and
receive cash for the sale within this period. Also, the definition of 15% standard asset does not
require a fund to consider any specific factors in determining the circumstances under which an
asset may be sold or disposed of. The definition of less liquid asset, on the other hand, requires a
fund to consider, as applicable, certain market, trading, and asset-specific factors set forth in
proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii). 357 These factors include the size of a fund’s position in a
particular portfolio asset relative to the asset’s average daily trading volume and (as applicable)

357

Proposed rule 22e-4(a)(6).

154

the number of units of the asset outstanding, which a fund is not required to assess in
determining whether an asset is a 15% standard asset. 358
To provide an example of the distinctions between the proposed 15% standard and the
proposed three-day liquid asset minimum, consider a fund that holds a very large block of a
particular security “X”. Because the fund holds a large block of the issue, it may determine,
based on the liquidity classification factors required to be considered under the proposed rule,
that it could convert a certain percentage (e.g., 70%) of its position to cash in fewer than three
business days, but that it would take more than three business days to convert the remainder of
its position to cash. Under the proposed rule, 70% of the fund’s position in security “X” would
be considered three-day liquid assets, and the other 30% would be considered to be less liquid
assets. The fund would take these classifications into account when considering whether the
further acquisition of less liquid assets would cause the fund to not be in compliance with its
three-day liquid asset minimum. However, even though 30% of the fund’s position in security
“X” would be considered to be less liquid assets, the fund’s position in security “X” would not
also be considered to be 15% standard assets. This is because, as discussed above, a fund is not
required to assess position size in determining whether a particular portfolio asset is a 15%
standard asset. Thus, if a fund can sell a standard size lot of its holdings in that position within
seven days at approximately the value ascribed to it by the fund, the entire position would be
deemed not to be a 15% standard asset.
Consider as well a scenario in which a fund holds shares of security “Y,” and the fund
determines, based on the liquidity classification factors required to be considered under the
proposed rule, that it can sell security “Y” within seven days at approximately the value ascribed
358

See supra section II.D.2.

155

to it by the fund, but whose sale(s) will not also settle until the tenth day. Security “Y” would
fall into the 8-15 day liquidity classification category and would be considered a less liquid asset
because it would not be able to be converted to cash within three business days. However,
because the fund would be able to sell its shares of security “Y” within seven days at
approximately the value ascribed to it by the fund, security “Y” would not be considered to be a
15% standard asset. This is because a fund is required to consider whether it would be able to
sell an asset within seven days, but not also whether those asset sales would settle within this
period, in determining whether a particular portfolio asset is a 15% standard asset. 359
Conversely, consider a fund that holds shares of security “Z,” a privately placed security
that the fund determines cannot be sold within seven days at approximately the value ascribed to
it by the fund. Under the proposed rule, security “Z” would be considered a less liquid asset,
because it would not be able to be converted to cash (that is, sold, with the sale settled) within
three business days. Security “Z” also would be considered to be a 15% standard asset, because
it would not be able to be sold within seven days at approximately the value ascribed to it by the
fund. The fund would take these classifications into account when it is considering whether the
further acquisition of less liquid assets or 15% standard assets would cause the fund to not be in
compliance with its three-day liquid asset minimum or the 15% standard.
The scenarios depicted in the preceding paragraphs demonstrate that the same asset could
be deemed to be a less liquid asset but not also deemed to be a 15% standard asset, and also
illustrate the different roles that the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum and the 15%
standard play in liquidity risk management. The proposed 15% standard would provide an
across-the-board limitation on the acquisition of certain relatively illiquid holdings. The
359

See proposed rule 22e-4(a)(4).

156

proposed definition of less liquid asset, on the other hand, is meant to identify those assets that
would generally not be able to be converted to cash to meet redemption requests, and the
proposed three-day liquid asset minimum is meant to tailor a fund’s acquisition of these holdings
to correspond with its particular liquidity needs. Thus, the proposed 15% standard acts as a cap
on the amount of relatively illiquid assets that a fund may hold, while the proposed three-day
liquid asset minimum acts as a floor on the amount of three-day liquid assets that a fund must
hold.
b.

Request for Comment

We request comment on the proposed 15% standard.
•

Do commenters agree that the Commission should include the 15% standard in proposed
rule 22e-4? Would the 15% standard enhance funds’ ability to manage liquidity risk?

•

Do commenters agree that the three-day liquid asset minimum requirement and the 15%
standard serve distinct roles in managing liquidity risk? Is there a single alternative
standard that would be an effective substitute for the three-day liquid asset minimum
requirement and the 15% standard?

•

Should the Commission instead adopt a different restriction on funds’ investments in
assets whose liquidity is extremely limited, and if so, what should this restriction be? For
example, should we adopt a different percentage limit on funds’ investments in 15%
standard assets? Should we instead limit funds’ investments in some other subset of
assets with extremely limited liquidity, such as assets that can only be converted to cash
in over 7 days, over 15 days, over 30 days, or over 90 days at a price that does not
materially affect the value of that asset immediately prior to sale? If we did the latter,
what should the limit be? Should it be a set percentage of fund assets established by the

157

Commission (e.g., 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%), or should a fund be required to set its own limit,
using the factors it would be required to consider in determining its three-day liquid asset
minimum (or some other set of factors)? Should this limit apply to all funds, or only a
subset of funds (e.g., only funds with certain investment strategies, or whose three-day
liquid asset minimums are below a certain threshold)?
•

As noted above, the 15% standard would be tested each time the fund acquires new
assets, and a fund would be permitted to hold more than 15% of its net assets in 15%
standard assets if it does so due to redemptions or market events. Once a fund rises
above the 15% limit, any acquisition of new assets must be of non-15% standard assets
until the fund is at or below the 15% standard. Would a requirement mandating that a
fund divest excess 15% standard assets if its holdings of these assets rise above 15% of
its net assets better facilitate funds’ liquidity risk management and promote investor
protection? Or should we limit the time period (e.g., to 30 days, 60 days, or 90 days) in
which a fund holds more than 15% of its net assets in 15% standard assets so that a fund
cannot persistently be above the 15% standard? Alternatively, we note that certain
Canadian mutual funds are subject to illiquid asset restrictions that provide that a fund: (i)
must not acquire illiquid assets if more than 10% of the fund’s net assets would be made
up of illiquid assets; (ii) must not have invested more than 15% of the fund’s net assets in
illiquid assets for a period of 90 days or more; and (iii) must, as quickly as is
commercially reasonable, take all necessary steps to reduce the percentage of its net
assets made up of illiquid assets to 15% or less if more than 15% of the fund’s net assets

158

is made up of illiquid assets. 360 Should we adopt similar requirements? Would such
requirements better promote investor protection?
•

Should the Commission modify the proposed definition of 15% standard assets to require
that funds take into account the time period associated with receipt of proceeds of sale or
disposition of an asset?

•

Do commenters agree with the proposal to withdraw current guidance associated with the
15% guideline? Do commenters believe additional guidance is needed in connection
with the proposed definition of 15% standard asset? If so, what guidance should the
Commission provide?

•

What assets do funds currently consider to be limited by the 15% guideline? Do
commenters believe that assets that would meet the proposed definition of 15% standard
asset are consistent with assets that funds currently classify as illiquid under the 15%
guideline? If not, what types of assets would be classified differently?

•

What are funds’ current practices for determining whether a portfolio asset is limited by
the 15% guideline, and what factors do funds currently use to make this determination?
Who at the fund and/or the adviser is tasked with determining whether a portfolio asset is
limited by the 15% guideline, and how often is each asset reviewed? Do funds expect to
engage in the same practices for determining whether an asset is a 15% standard asset?

•

Would it be beneficial to funds for the Commission to include as part of the rule certain
types of securities whose acquisition would be limited by the 15% standard, or other
factors for funds to consider in determining whether an asset is a 15% standard asset? Do
commenters believe that confusion could arise between the definition of a 15% standard

360

See Canadian Securities Administrators, National Instrument 81-102 – Investment Funds at section 2.4.

159

asset and the definition of a less liquid asset under the proposed rule, and if so, how could
this confusion be reduced?
•

Rule 2a-7 currently defines the term “illiquid security” to mean “a security that cannot be
sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business within seven calendar days at
approximately the value ascribed to it by the fund.” 361 Should we amend rule 2a-7 to
clarify that “illiquid security” has the same definition as “15% standard asset?”

Policies and Procedures Regarding Redemptions in Kind
a.

Use of Redemptions in Kind

Along with ETFs, which commonly redeem shares in kind, many mutual funds reserve
the right to redeem their shares in kind instead of in cash. 362 Mutual funds that reserve the right
to redeem in kind may use in-kind redemptions to manage liquidity risk under exceptional
circumstances. 363 A fund, for example, could choose to redeem in kind when faced with
significant redemptions, because this would result in the redeeming shareholder (and not the fund
and its remaining shareholders) bearing any liquidity costs associated with dispositions of
361

Rule 2a-7(a)(20).

362

See, e.g., Adoption of (1) Rule 18f-1 Under the Investment Company Act of 1940 to Permit Registered
Open-End Investment Companies Which Have the Right to Redeem In Kind to Elect to Make Only Cash
Redemptions and (2) Form N-18F-1, Investment Company Act Release No. 6561 (June 14, 1971)
[36 FR 11919 (June 23, 1971)] (“Rule 18f-1 and Form N-18F-1 Adopting Release”) (stating that the
definition of “redeemable security” in section 2(a)(32) of the Investment Company Act “has traditionally
been interpreted as giving the issuer the option of redeeming its securities in cash or in kind.”).

363

See Karen Damato, ‘Redemptions in Kind’ Become Effective for Tax Management, WALL STREET JOURNAL
(Mar. 10, 1999), available at http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB921028092685519084 (“‘Redemptions in
kind’ are typically viewed by fund managers as an emergency measure, a step they could take to meet
massive redemptions in the midst of a market meltdown.”).
Besides using in-kind redemptions as an emergency measure to manage liquidity risk, funds may also use
in-kind redemptions for other reasons. For example, funds may wish to redeem certain investors
(particularly, large, institutional investors) in kind, because in-kind redemptions could have a lower tax
impact on the fund than selling portfolio securities in order to pay redemptions in cash. This, in turn, could
benefit the remaining shareholders in the fund. See, e.g., id. (“If a fund has to sell appreciated stocks to pay
a redeeming shareholder, it realizes capital gains. Unless the fund has offsetting capital losses, those gains
are distributed as taxable income to all remaining fund holders. By contrast, when funds distribute stocks
from their portfolios, there is no tax event for the continuing holders.”).

160

portfolio assets. We understand that many funds also use in-kind redemptions if a large
shareholder is redeeming to transition to a separately managed account with a similar investment
strategy.
There are often logistical issues associated with paying in-kind redemptions, and this
limits the availability of in-kind redemptions under many circumstances. 364 For instance, in-kind
redemptions could entail complex operational issues that would be imposed on both the fund and
on investors receiving portfolio securities. 365 Moreover, some shareholders are generally unable
or unwilling to receive in-kind redemptions. 366 Some funds also have waived the right to redeem
in kind with respect to certain relatively small redemption requests under rule 18f-1 under the
Investment Company Act, which allows a fund to abide by different in-kind redemption policies
for different shareholders without being deemed to create a class of senior securities prohibited
by section 18(f)(1) of the Act. 367

364

See, e.g., Invesco FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 35, at 11 (noting that while “Invesco has on
occasion exercised rights to redeem in kind, in practice such rights are exercised infrequently”).

(June 5, 2013) [78 FR 36834 (June 19, 2013)] (“2013 Money Market Fund Reform Proposing Release”), at
n.473.

366

See, e.g., Fortune, supra note 270, at 47 (“A fund redeeming in kind does so at the risk of its reputation and
future business . . .”). In the context of money market funds, we requested comment on whether we should
require redemptions in kind for redemptions in excess of a certain size threshold, to ease liquidity strains on
the fund and reduce the risks and unfairness posed by significant sudden redemptions. See Money Market
Fund Reform; Proposed Rule, Investment Company Act Release No. 28807 (June 30, 2009) [74 FR 32688
(July 8, 2009)] (“2009 Money Market Fund Reform Proposing Release”), at section III.B. Commenters
generally opposed this type of reform for a variety of reasons, all of which likely would apply equally to
funds other than money market funds. For example, most commenters stated that in-kind redemptions
would be technically unworkable due to complex valuation and operational issues that would be imposed
on both the fund and on investors receiving the in-kind distribution. See 2013 Money Market Fund Reform
Proposing Release, supra note 365, at section III.B.9.c.

367

Under rule 18f-1, any registered open-end fund that has the right to redeem in kind could file with the
Commission, on Form N-18F-1, a notification of election committing itself to pay in cash all requests for
redemptions by any shareholder of record, limited in amount during any ninety-day period to the lesser of
$250,000 or 1 percent of the net asset value of the fund at the beginning of the period. See Rule 18f-1 and
Form N-18F-1 Adopting Release, supra note 362.

161

We believe that, as part of a fund's management of its liquidity risk, a fund that engages
in or reserves the right to engage in in-kind redemptions should adopt and implement written
policies and procedures regarding in-kind redemptions, and we have included this requirement in
proposed rule 22e-4. 368 We expect these policies and procedures would address the process for
redeeming in kind, as well as the circumstances under which the fund would consider redeeming
in kind. Through staff outreach to funds, we understand that while many funds disclose that they
have reserved the right to redeem in kind, most of these funds consider redemptions in kind to be
a last resort or emergency measure, and many do not have policies or procedures in place that
would govern in-kind redemptions. Because the management and personnel capacity of funds
facing heavy redemptions and other liquidity stresses would likely be strained as funds attempt to
manage these pressures, policies and procedures that dictate the fund’s in-kind redemption
procedures (which, as discussed above, could be quite complicated and could apply differently to
different types of shareholders) would increase the likelihood that in-kind redemptions would be
a feasible risk management tool. 369
b.
•

Requests for Comment

Our understanding is that redemptions in kind are not used extensively outside ETFs. Is
this assumption correct? Do funds that engage in redemptions in kind have policies and
procedures regarding those redemptions? Are there steps that funds can take to make
redemptions in kind easier to implement?

•

Under rule 18f-1, any registered open-end fund that has the right to redeem in kind could

requests for redemptions by any shareholder of record, limited in amount during any
ninety-day period to the lesser of $250,000 or 1 percent of the net asset value of the fund
at the beginning of the period. 370 Would re-visiting and eliminating funds’ ability to limit
in-kind redemptions clarify that the Investment Company Act permits funds to redeem
shares in kind as well as in cash?
6.

Discussion of Additional Liquidity Risk Management Tools

While proposed rule 22e-4 specifies that each fund would be required to adopt a liquidity
risk management program incorporating certain specified elements, a fund’s program could
incorporate liquidity risk management tools beyond the requirements of the proposed rule. We
understand that many funds currently engage in certain practices that would not be required by
proposed rule 22e-4, but which could enhance funds’ ability—in conjunction with the policies
and procedures required to be adopted under the proposed rule—to manage liquidity risk.
Specifically, we understand based on staff outreach that it is relatively common for funds to
establish lines of credit to manage liquidity risk, and that funds may use borrowed money or
draw on other funding sources to meet shareholder redemptions, typically during periods of
significantly limited market liquidity. We also understand that it is relatively common for
certain funds (particularly, funds with strategies involving investment in relatively less liquid
portfolio securities) to invest in ETFs to enhance the liquidity of the fund’s portfolio. Below we
provide guidance funds may wish to consider in using these tools and their role in a fund’s
liquidity risk management program. We note that the liquidity risk management tools discussed
below do not comprise an exhaustive list of liquidity risk management controls or procedures

370

See supra note 362 and accompanying text.

163

that a fund could consider implementing, nor are we currently proposing to mandate that a fund
use these tools as part of its liquidity risk management program.
In addition, there are currently several tools that a fund could use, generally under
emergency circumstances, to pay redeeming shareholders during periods in which the fund
encounters limited liquidity. As discussed above, many funds reserve the right to redeem their
shares in kind instead of in cash, although we understand that many funds that do so consider
in-kind redemptions to be a last resort or emergency measure. As a separate emergency
measure, money market funds (but not other funds) are currently permitted, under certain
circumstances, to permanently suspend shareholder redemptions and liquidate the fund. Below
we request comment on whether this tool would be useful and appropriate for the Commission to
make available to funds besides money market funds.
a.

Borrowing Arrangements and Other Funding Sources

As discussed above, entering into borrowing arrangements and agreements with other
potential funding sources could strengthen a fund’s management of liquidity risk, as they could
be used to pay redeeming shareholders without the need to sell portfolio securities at
significantly discounted prices. For example, a fund could establish a committed or
uncommitted line of credit with a commercial bank, engage in interfund lending within a family
of funds, or use repurchase transactions to generate liquidity. 371 Proposed rule

371

See, e.g., SIFMA IAA FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 16, at nn.73-75 (stating that 79% of
SIFMA AMG survey respondents report having access to a line of credit to manage outflows from their
mutual funds, that 64% have drawn on that line of credit at some point within the last five years, and that
8% of SIMFA AMG members surveyed state that they engage in interfund lending to address liquidity
issues); BlackRock FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 50, at 6 (statement that among several
overarching principles that provide the foundation for a prudent market liquidity risk management
framework for collective investment vehicles is identifying backup sources of liquidity such as temporary
borrowings). But see Fidelity FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 20, at 20 (“During the time period
since its inception in 2001, the committed bank line of credit has never been used.”); Comment Letter of
PIMCO on the FSOC Notice (Mar. 25, 2015), at Appendix-2 (“In practice, it is rare for funds to…draw on

164

22e-4(b)(2)(iii)(D) would require a fund to consider its borrowing arrangements and other
funding sources in assessing its liquidity risk, and above we provide guidance on particular
aspects of these activities that could affect a fund’s liquidity risk. 372 We anticipate that a fund
could consider this guidance in assessing whether entering into borrowing or other funding
arrangements would assist the fund in managing its liquidity risk, as well as determining the
terms under which such arrangements would best help the fund to manage its liquidity risk. We
also anticipate that this guidance could be used in reviewing existing borrowing arrangements
and the use of other funding sources to assess whether these activities would continue to help the
fund effectively manage its liquidity risk. In evaluating borrowing arrangements or other
funding sources for purposes of managing liquidity risk, a fund should take into account
restrictions on affiliated transactions and leverage under the Investment Company Act and rules
under the Act. 373 A fund also may wish to consider any negative impact on the fund resulting
from borrowing funds for liquidity risk management purposes, as opposed to managing liquidity
through the fund’s portfolio construction. 374
b.

Use of ETF Portfolio Holdings as a Liquidity Risk Management Tool

We understand that certain funds, particularly funds with investment strategies involving
relatively less liquid portfolio securities (such as micro-cap equity funds, high-yield bond funds

these lines of credit.”); Invesco FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 35, at 12 (stating that it has a
line of credit for its floating rate fund and senior loan portfolio ETF, but that it has been used on a very
infrequent basis).
372

See supra notes 315-318 and accompanying and following text.

373

See supra notes 320-322 and accompany and following text.

374

See, e.g., Nuveen FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 45, at 9-10 (“Funds without credit lines face
the possibility of not being able to sell sufficient assets to raise cash to fund redemption requests, or having
to sell assets at significantly discounted values. To the extent that a fund draws on a credit line to meet net
redemptions (and thus temporarily leverages itself), it increases its market risk at a time when markets are
stressed. While this can be potentially beneficial to long-term performance if the asset class recovers, it
increases the risk of loss to remaining shareholders if markets continue to weaken.”).

165

and bank loan funds), may invest a portion of their assets in ETFs with strategies similar to the
fund’s investment strategy because they view ETF shares as having characteristics that enhance
the liquidity of the fund’s portfolio. 375 Specifically, funds that invest in ETF shares have stated
to Commission staff that they find that these shares are more readily tradable, are less expensive
to trade, and have shorter settlement periods than other types of portfolio investments. 376 And
unlike investments in cash, cash equivalents, and other highly liquid instruments, funds have
suggested that investing in ETFs with the same (or a similar) strategy as the fund’s investment
strategy permits the fund to remain fully invested in assets that reflect the fund’s investment
concentrations, risks, and performance potential.
While we appreciate that ETFs’ exchange-traded nature could make these instruments
useful to funds in managing purchases and redemptions (for example, ETFs’ settlement times
could more closely reflect the time in which a fund has disclosed that it will typically redeem
fund shares), funds should consider the extent to which relying substantially on ETFs to manage
liquidity risk is appropriate. As discussed above, the liquidity of an ETF, particularly in times of
declining market liquidity, may be limited by the liquidity of the market for the ETF’s

See, e.g., Katy Burne, Institutions Pour Cash Into Bond ETFs, WALL STREET JOURNAL (Mar. 1, 2015),
available at http://www.wsj.com/articles/institutions-pour-cash-into-bond-etfs-1425250969. Funds’
investments in ETFs are subject to the Investment Company Act’s limitations on investments in shares
issued by other registered investment companies. See section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act.

376

The Commission’s 2015 Request for Comment on Exchange-Traded Products requested comment on
whether investors’ expectations of the nature of the liquidity of an exchange-traded product (including an
ETF) holding relatively less liquid portfolio securities differ from their expectations of the liquidity of the
underlying portfolio securities. See 2015 ETP Request for Comment, supra note 11, at Question #49. See
e.g., Comment Letter of Vanguard on the 2015 ETP Request for Comment (Aug. 17, 2015) (stating that the
disclosures made by ETFs in prospectuses, shareholder reports, and websites “ensures that investors and
market participants have the necessary information to make informed investment decisions”); Comment
Letter of ETF Radar on the 2015 ETP Request for Comment (Aug. 8, 2015) (stating that investor
expectations of liquidity depend on the skill of the investor); Comment Letter of Danny Reich on the 2015
ETP Request for Comment (July 2, 2015) (stating that there is a “false assumption” that underlying assets
have the same liquidity as the ETP, particularly with respect to bond ETPs).

166

underlying securities. 377 Thus, shares of an ETF whose underlying securities are relatively less
liquid (taking into account the factors discussed in proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii)) may not be able
to be counted on as an effective liquidity risk management tool during times of liquidity stress.
In the case of a significant decline in market liquidity, if authorized participants were unwilling
or unable to trade ETF shares in the primary market, and the majority of trading took place
among investors in the secondary market, the ETF’s shares could trade continuously at a
premium or a discount to the value of the ETF’s underlying portfolio securities. This could
frustrate the expectations of secondary market investors who count on the creation and
redemption process to align the prices of ETF shares and their underlying portfolio securities. 378
We therefore encourage funds to assess the liquidity characteristics of an ETF’s underlying
securities, as well as the characteristics of the ETF shares themselves, in classifying an ETF’s
liquidity under proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(i). We also encourage funds to consider the portion of
a fund’s three-day liquid assets that is invested in ETF shares, taking into account the foregoing
concerns.
c.

Suspension of Redemptions

Section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act permits a fund to suspend redemptions in
specified unusual circumstances, including for any period during which an emergency exists
(only as determined by Commission rules and regulations) as a result of which it is not
reasonably practicable for the fund to liquidate its portfolio securities, or fairly determine the

value of its net assets. 379 Rule 22e-3 exempts money market funds from section 22(e), permitting
a money market fund to suspend redemptions and postpone payment of redemption proceeds in
an orderly liquidation of the fund if, subject to other requirements, the fund’s board makes
certain findings. 380 The Commission has previously requested comment on whether the relief
provided by rule 22e-3 should be available to types of open-end funds besides money market
funds. 381 The Commission received only limited comments addressing the topic, with a few
commenters generally supportive of extending the rule to all open-end funds, 382 and one
commenter arguing that open-end funds should be required to seek individual exemptive orders
from the Commission to obtain the relief provided by rule 22e-3. 383 We request specific
comment below on whether proposing a rule similar to rule 22e-3, which would permit open-end
funds other than money market funds to suspend redemptions and postpone payment of
redemption proceeds in an orderly liquidation of the fund under certain circumstances, would
protect the interests of its investors if the fund were to liquidate.
We also request comment below on whether the Commission should consider proposing
rules that would permit funds to suspend redemptions under other circumstances not involving
the liquidation of the fund. 384 As discussed above, private funds are often able to impose gates

market funds to temporarily suspend redemptions under certain circumstances. 386 Registered
funds that are not money market funds, however, are significantly more limited in their current
ability to suspend redemptions under the Investment Company Act. 387 Specifically, open-end
funds may suspend redemptions for any period during which the NYSE is closed (other than
customary weekend and holiday closings) and in three additional situations only if the
Commission has made certain determinations. 388 These limited suspension rights are aimed at
preventing funds and their advisers from interfering with shareholders’ redemption rights for
improper purposes, 389 and recognize the importance that shareholders place on daily
redeemability of fund shares.

Request for Comment

We request comment on the above discussion and guidance regarding certain tools that a
fund could use to manage liquidity risk beyond the requirements specified in proposed rule
22e-4.
•

Are there any specific liquidity risk management policies or procedures, beyond those
that would be required by proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(A)-(E), that funds should be
required to implement? What procedures, separate from any that resemble those required
by proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(A)-(E), do funds currently use to manage liquidity risk?

•

Do commenters generally agree with our guidance discussed above on the use of
borrowing arrangements and other funding sources, the use of ETFs to manage portfolio
liquidity, and the use of redemptions in kind? Is any additional guidance needed on the
liquidity risk management tools described in this section? Are there any other issues
associated with specific liquidity risk management tools or techniques about which we
should provide guidance? To the extent that funds use liquidity risk management tools
outside those mentioned in this section, what guidance, if any, is needed regarding those
tools?

•

Regarding borrowing arrangements and other funding sources, would additional guidance
be useful regarding specific types of borrowing arrangements?

•

When using ETFs to manage liquidity, do funds consider the liquidity of the ETFs’
portfolio securities? Why or why not?
We also request specific comment on several current rules that touch on liquidity risk

management issues and the suspension of shareholder redemptions.
•

Would proposing a rule similar to rule 22e-3 for funds other than money market funds
protect the interests of fund investors if the fund were to liquidate? If so, under what
circumstances should funds be permitted to suspend redemptions and postpone payment
of redemption proceeds, and should a fund’s board be required to make any finding in
connection with a fund’s suspension of redemptions?

•

Should we consider proposing rules that would permit funds to suspend redemptions
under other circumstances, such as rules that would specify certain emergency
circumstances that would permit funds to suspend redemptions under section 22(e)?
How could we define such emergency circumstances? For example, should we define

170

emergency circumstances to include situations where redemptions exceeded a high level
over a certain period of time or where asset price volatility in the markets exceeded a
certain level making it difficult for the fund to accurately price?
7.

Cross-Trades

Funds, subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, are permitted to
engage in “cross-trading,” that is, securities transactions with certain of their affiliated persons,
including other funds within the fund family. Some funds may seek to use cross-trading as an
additional liquidity risk management tool. Rule 17a-7, however, includes conditions that limit
the portfolio assets that may be cross-traded, and as discussed below, cross-trades that involve
certain less liquid assets may not be eligible to rely on the rule. We propose below guidance
relating to the use of cross-trading in response to investor redemptions.
Section 17 of the Investment Company Act restricts transactions between an “affiliated
person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such affiliated person” and
that investment company—for example, transactions between a fund and another fund managed
by the same adviser. 390 A fund must therefore obtain exemptive relief from the Commission
before entering into purchase or sale transactions with an affiliated fund, or execute such
transactions subject to the provisions of rule 17a-7 under the Investment Company Act
(permitting purchase and sale transactions among affiliated funds and other accounts, under
certain circumstances). 391

390

See supra note 320 and accompanying text.

391

Rule 17a-7 under the Investment Company Act provides an exemption from section 17(a)’s prohibitions so
long as certain conditions are met. In summary, rule 17a-7 requires, among other things, that: (i) the
transaction at issue is a purchase or sale, for no consideration other than cash, for a security for which
market quotations are readily available; (ii) the transaction be effected at the independent current market
price for the security at issue; (iii) the transaction must be consistent with the policy of each fund
participating in the transaction as set forth in its registration statement and reports filed under the

171

Cross-trading can benefit funds and their shareholders, for example by allowing funds
that are mutually interested in a securities transaction that is consistent with the investment
strategies of each fund to conduct such a transaction without incurring transaction costs and
without generating a market impact. 392 However, cross-trades also have the potential for abuse.
As the Commission has said, “[f]or example, an unscrupulous investment adviser might “dump”
undesirable securities on a registered investment company or transfer desirable securities from a
registered investment company to another more favored advisory client in the complex.
Moreover the transaction could be effected at a price which is disadvantageous to the registered
investment company.” 393 Accordingly, rule 17a-7 requires that any cross-trades satisfy certain
conditions designed to prevent such abuses, including the requirement that market quotations be
readily available for each traded security and that if the security is only traded over the counter,
the cross-trade be conducted at the average of the highest current independent bid and lowest
current independent offer determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry. 394 In requiring market
quotations for cross-traded securities, the Commission has stated that “[r]eliance upon such
market quotations provides an independent basis for determining that the terms of the transaction

Investment Company Act; (iv) no brokerage commission, fee (except for customary transfer fees) or other
remuneration be paid in connection with the transaction; and (v) the fund’s board, including a majority of
the independent directors, adopts procedures that are reasonably designed to provide that the rule 17a-7
transactions comply with the conditions of the rule, approve changes to the procedures as the board deems
necessary, and determines no less frequently than quarterly that all rule 17a-7 transactions made during the
preceding quarter were effected in compliance with the approved procedures.
392

As noted above, rule 17a-7 requires that each cross-trade be consistent with the policy of each fund
participating in the transaction and that no brokerage commissions, fees or other remuneration be paid in
connection with the transaction. Because cross-trades are conducted privately between funds, they are not
transparent to market trading reporting systems and thus are unlikely to generate a market impact.

are fair and reasonable to each participating investment company and do not involve
overreaching.” 395
Certain less liquid assets may be ineligible to trade under rule 17a-7 due to this
requirement. Indeed, the less liquid an asset is, the more likely it may not satisfy rule 17a-7. 396
Accordingly, for assets that do not trade in active secondary markets, a fund should consider
whether “market quotations are readily available” and a “current market price” is available and
thus whether the asset may be cross-traded in accordance with rule 17a-7.
In addition, when considering whether cross-trading would be an effective and
appropriate liquidity risk management tool, a fund’s adviser should consider its duty to seek best
execution for each fund potentially involved in the cross-trading transaction, as well as its duty
of loyalty to each fund. 397 An adviser should not cause funds to enter into a cross-trade unless
doing so would be in the best interests of each fund participating in the transaction. In assessing
these factors, a fund should consider any negative impact on the fund resulting from the purchase
of assets by one fund from an affiliated fund (that is, whether any risk-shifting between funds
that results from trading assets is appropriate, considering the funds’ strategies, risk profile, and
liquidity needs before the transaction takes place) given the policy of each fund as recited in its
registration statement and reports under the Act. We request comment on our guidance relating
to cross-trading.

Certain Affiliated Persons Thereof, Investment Company Act Release No. 11676 (Mar. 10, 1981)
[45 FR 17011 (Mar. 17, 1981)]. The Commission historically declined to expand rule 17a-7 to cross-trades
for which market quotations were not readily available and where independent current market prices were
not available because these conditions increase the potential for abuse through cross-trades. See id.

See supra section III.B.2 (discussing proposed factors for classifying the liquidity of a portfolio position).

See, e.g., In the Matter of Western Asset Management Co., Investment Company Act Release No. 30893
(Jan. 27, 2014) (settled action) (the adviser to funds engaging in cross-trading “has a fiduciary duty of
loyalty to its clients and also must seek to obtain best execution for both its buying and selling clients”).

173

•

Does our guidance (combined with existing guidance) relating to rule 17a-7 provide
sufficient protections for cross-trades involving assets that are only traded over the
counter and, depending on the facts and circumstances, may be less liquid? If not, what
additional guidance or protections might be warranted to protect funds and investors from
unfairness or abuse in cross-trades?
D.

Board Approval and Designation of Program Administrative Responsibilities
1.

Initial Approval of Liquidity Risk Management Program

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(3)(i) would require each fund to obtain initial approval of its
written liquidity risk management program from the fund’s board of directors, including a
majority of independent directors. 398 The proposed rule specifies that this approval is required to
include the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum. Directors, and particularly independent
directors, play a critical role in overseeing fund operations, although they may delegate day-today management to a fund’s adviser. 399 Given the board’s historical oversight role, we believe it
is appropriate to require a fund’s board to approve the fund’s liquidity risk management
program. This requirement is designed to facilitate independent scrutiny by the board of
directors of the liquidity risk management program – an area where there may be a conflict of
interest between the investment adviser and the fund. For example, an adviser might have an
incentive to set a low three-day liquid asset minimum in order to permit the fund to invest in

398

In this release, we refer to directors who are not “interested persons” of the fund as “independent directors.”
Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act identifies persons who are “interested persons” of a fund.

399

See Investment Trusts and Investment Companies: Hearings on H.R. 10065 Before a Subcomm. of the
House Comm. on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 112 (1940) at 109 (describing the
board as an “independent check” on management); Burks v. Lasker, 441 U.S. 471 (1979) (citing
Tannenbaum v. Zeller, 552 F.2d 402, 406 (2d. Cir. 1979)) (describing independent directors as
“independent watchdogs”). See also Comment Letter of the Independent Directors Council on the FSOC
Notice (Mar. 25, 2015), at 5 (“A fund board oversees the adviser’s management of the portfolio’s liquidity
as part of its oversight of the fund’s compliance program and portfolio management more generally.”).

174

additional less liquid assets (because such assets may result in higher total returns for a fund),
even though a low minimum may not reflect an appropriate alignment between the fund’s
portfolio liquidity profile and the fund’s liquidity needs.
Directors may satisfy their obligations with respect to this initial approval by reviewing
summaries of the liquidity risk management program prepared by the fund’s investment adviser
or officers administering the program, legal counsel, or other persons familiar with the liquidity
risk management program. The summaries should familiarize directors with the salient features
of the program and provide them with an understanding of how the liquidity risk management
program addresses the required assessment of the fund’s liquidity risk, including how the fund’s
investment adviser or officers administering the program determined the fund’s three-day liquid
asset minimum. In considering whether to approve a fund’s liquidity risk management program,
the board may wish to consider the nature of the fund’s liquidity risk exposure. A board also
may wish to consider the adequacy of the fund’s liquidity risk management program in light of
recent experiences regarding the fund’s liquidity, including any redemption pressures
experienced by the fund.
2.

Approval of Material Changes to Liquidity Risk Management Program and
Oversight of the Three-Day Liquid Asset Minimum

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(3)(i) also would require each fund to obtain approval of any
material changes to the fund’s liquidity risk management program, including changes to the
fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum, from the fund’s board of directors, including a majority
of independent directors. As with the initial approval of a fund’s liquidity risk management
program, the requirement to obtain approval of any material changes to the fund’s liquidity risk
management program from the board is designed to facilitate independent scrutiny of material
changes to the liquidity risk management program by the board of directors. We note that our
175

proposal to require directors to approve material changes to the fund’s liquidity risk management
program differs from the requirements under rule 38a-1 under the Act, which does not require a
fund board to approve changes to a fund’s compliance policies and procedures. 400 Given that the
fund’s liquidity risk management program will be administered by a fund’s investment adviser or
officers (rather than a chief compliance officer), 401 we believe that board approval of material
changes in this context will provide an important independent check on such administration.
The fund’s board would be responsible under the proposed rule for reviewing a written
report from the fund’s investment adviser or officers administering the fund’s liquidity risk
management program, provided no less frequently than annually, that reviews the adequacy of
the fund’s liquidity risk management program, including the fund’s three-day liquid asset
minimum, and the effectiveness of its implementation. 402 This aspect of the proposed rule is
designed to facilitate board oversight over the adequacy and effectiveness of the fund’s liquidity
risk management program, including the three-day liquid asset minimum and whether the threeday liquid asset minimum is providing an appropriate level of minimum liquidity to the fund in

400

Rule 38a-1 requires that the fund’s chief compliance officer provide a written annual report to the fund’s
board addressing, among other things, any material changes made to the fund’s compliance policies and
procedures since the date of the last report and any material changes to the fund’s compliance policies and
procedures recommended as a result of the fund’s annual review of the adequacy of such policies and
procedures and the effectiveness of their implementation.

401

Rule 38a-1 contains several provisions “designed to promote the independence of the chief compliance
officer from the management of the fund.” See Rule 38a-1 Adopting Release, supra note 90. These
include: rule 38a-1(a)(4)(i) (designation and compensation of the chief compliance officer must be
approved by the fund’s board, including a majority of the fund’s independent directors); rule 38a-1(a)(4)(ii)
(the chief compliance officer can only be discharged from his or her responsibilities with the approval of
the fund’s board, including a majority of the fund’s independent directors); rule 38a-1(a)(4)(iii) (the chief
compliance officer must provide an annual report to the board addressing: (i) the operation of the policies
and procedures of the fund and certain service providers since the last report; (ii) any material changes to
the policies and procedures since the last report; (iii) any recommendations for material changes to the
policies and procedures as a result of the annual review; and (iv) any material compliance matters since the
date of the last report); and rule 38a-1(a)(4)(iv) (requiring the chief compliance officer to meet separately
with the fund’s independent directors at least once a year).

402

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(3)(ii).

176

light of changes in the markets, the fund, and its shareholder base over time. To the extent that
the board is being asked to approve a change in a fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum, the
written report should also provide directors with an understanding of how a change to the fund’s
three-day liquid asset minimum was determined to be appropriate. We believe that this review
and its related report will provide the board with sufficient information to provide oversight over
the adequacy and effective implementation of the fund’s liquidity risk management program. As
with the initial approval of each fund’s liquidity risk management program, directors may also
wish to consider the nature of the fund’s liquidity risk exposure in approving any material
changes, particularly with respect to the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum.
3.

Designation of Administrative Responsibilities to Fund Investment Adviser or
Officers

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(3)(iii) would expressly require a fund to designate the fund’s
investment adviser or officers (which may not be solely portfolio managers of the fund)
responsible for administering the fund’s liquidity risk management program, which designation
must be approved by the fund’s board of directors. Designating the fund’s investment adviser or
officers responsible for the administration of the fund’s liquidity risk management program,
subject to board oversight, is consistent with the way we understand most funds currently
manage liquidity. 403 The proposed designation also tasks the persons who are in a position to
manage the fund’s liquidity risks on a real-time basis with responsibility for administration of the
liquidity risk management program. In administering a fund’s liquidity risk management
program, the fund’s investment adviser or officers may wish to consult with the fund’s portfolio

403

See FEDERAL REGULATION OF SECURITIES COMMITTEE, AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION, FUND DIRECTOR’S
GUIDEBOOK (4th ed. 2015), at p. 82 (“Determining the liquidity of a security is primarily an investment
decision that is delegated to the investment adviser, but directors may establish guidelines and standards for
determining liquidity.”).

177

manager, traders, risk managers, and others as necessary or appropriate (e.g., to obtain
information used in classifying the liquidity of a new portfolio position), but we note that the
fund’s portfolio managers may not be solely responsible for administering the program.
We understand, based on staff outreach, that some funds employ a dedicated risk
management officer and task liquidity risk management to this officer, in consultation with the
fund’s portfolio management function. The board of a fund that employs a dedicated risk
management officer (or an officer whose role includes risk management among other duties)
may find it appropriate to designate administration of the fund’s liquidity risk management
program to this officer. We request comment below on whether a fund should be required to
specifically task administration of the fund’s liquidity risk management program to a dedicated
risk officer, or whether we should otherwise specify the officer who must administer the fund’s
liquidity risk management program.
Because the administration of a fund’s liquidity risk management program would be
designated to a fund’s investment adviser or officers, the investment adviser or officers should
provide the board with enough information to oversee such administration. As discussed above,
the fund’s investment adviser or officers would therefore be required to provide the board with a
written report on the adequacy of the fund’s liquidity risk management program, including the
three-day liquid asset minimum, and the effectiveness of its implementation, at least annually.
To the extent that a serious compliance issue arises under the program, it may be appropriate to
consider whether the event should be brought to the board’s attention promptly. 404

404

See Rule 38a-1 Adopting Release, supra note 90 (noting, in the case of a rule 38a-1 compliance program,
that “[s]erious compliance issues must, of course, always be brought to the board’s attention promptly”).

178

We understand that, in certain circumstances, a fund’s service providers may assist a fund
and its investment adviser in monitoring factors relevant to a fund’s liquidity risk and managing
the fund’s liquidity risk. For example, third parties could provide data relevant to assessing fund
flows. Also, a sub-adviser’s portfolio management responsibilities would involve investing a
fund’s assets in accordance with the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum and any other
liquidity-related portfolio requirements adopted by the fund. 405 While we understand that such
actions could provide useful assistance to a fund in assessing, monitoring, and managing
liquidity risk, we note that the primary parties responsible for a fund’s liquidity risk management
are the fund itself and any parties to whom the fund has designated responsibility for
administering the fund’s liquidity risk management program. A fund (or its investment adviser,
to the extent the investment adviser has been given liquidity risk management responsibility)
should thus oversee any liquidity risk monitoring or risk management activities undertaken by
the fund’s service providers, and we encourage a fund (or its investment adviser, as appropriate)
to communicate regularly with its service providers as a part of its oversight and to coordinate
the liquidity risk management efforts undertaken by various parties.

Request for Comment

We request comment on the proposed board approval and oversight requirements.
•

Do fund boards currently approve procedures for classifying the liquidity of portfolio
assets? Do fund boards take any additional steps to oversee the liquidity of portfolio
assets? Should the Commission require boards, including a majority of independent

405

A fund could also formally designate a fund’s sub-adviser as responsible for the fund’s liquidity risk
management program.

179

directors, to approve the initial liquidity risk management program, including the threeday liquid asset minimum?
•

Should the Commission require boards to approve material changes to a fund’s liquidity
risk management program, including any changes to a fund’s three-day liquid asset
minimum? Should the Commission define what would constitute a “material change” to
a fund’s liquidity risk management program or provide additional guidance regarding
what changes would constitute material changes? Alternatively, should the Commission
require boards to approve all changes to a fund’s liquidity risk management program?
Or, similar to rule 38a-1 regarding a fund’s compliance program, should there be no
requirement for board approval of changes to the liquidity risk management program?

•

Does the release provide adequate guidance to fund boards regarding their approval of
the liquidity risk management program? Should we provide any additional guidance in
this regard?

•

Do commenters agree that it would be appropriate to require a fund to designate the
fund’s adviser or officers responsible for administering a fund’s liquidity risk
management program, subject to board approval? Is it appropriate to specify that those
administering the program may not be solely the fund’s portfolio managers? Would any
small fund complexes have difficulty meeting the proposed requirement that the program
may not be solely administered by the fund's portfolio manager? Is it appropriate to
allow a fund to designate a fund sub-adviser responsible for administering a fund’s
liquidity risk management program? Should the Commission require a fund to task
administration of the fund’s liquidity risk management program to a specific officer of

180

the fund? Should the Commission require that a fund have a chief risk officer or risk
committee administer the fund’s liquidity risk management program?
•

Should the Commission specify a shorter or longer frequency for review of a report on
the fund’s liquidity risk management program? Should the report to the board cover both
the adequacy and effectiveness of the fund’s liquidity risk management program as well
as the adequacy of the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum? Alternatively, would a
report reviewing the adequacy of the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum likely
provide a review of the fund’s liquidity risk management program overall given the
factors that must be assessed in setting the three-day liquid asset minimum?

•

Are there other aspects of the fund’s liquidity risk management program about which the
fund’s investment adviser or officers responsible for administering the program should
report to the board? Should we provide any additional guidance to fund boards in
connection with the approval and oversight of a fund’s liquidity risk management
program?
E.

Liquidity Risk Management Program Recordkeeping Requirements

We are proposing to require that each fund maintain a written copy of the policies and
procedures adopted as part of its liquidity risk management program for five years, in an easily
accessible place. 406 Each fund also would be required to maintain copies of any materials
provided to its board in connection with the board’s initial approval of the fund’s liquidity risk
management program and approvals of any subsequent material changes to the program,
including any changes to the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum, and copies of written
reports provided to the board that review the adequacy of the fund’s liquidity risk management
406

Proposed rule 22e-4(c)(1).

181

program, including the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum, and the effectiveness of its
implementation. 407 Funds would have to maintain such records for at least five years after the
end of the fiscal year in which the documents were provided to the board, the first two years in
an easily accessible place.
Finally, we are proposing to require that each fund keep a written record of how its
three-day liquid asset minimum, and any adjustments thereto, were determined, including the
fund’s assessment and periodic review of its liquidity risk in light of the factors incorporated in
paragraphs (b)(2)(iii)(A) through (D) of proposed rule 22e-4. 408 Funds would have to maintain
such records for a period of not less than five years, the first two years in an easily accessible
place, following the determination of, and each change to, the fund’s three-day liquid asset
minimum.
The records discussed above are designed to provide our examination staff with a basis to
determine whether a fund has adopted a liquidity risk management program in compliance with
the requirements of proposed rule 22e-4. Specifically, such records would help our staff to
determine whether a fund’s program incorporates the elements required to be included under
paragraph (b)(2) of proposed rule 22e-4. We also anticipate that these records would assist our
staff in identifying weaknesses in a fund’s liquidity risk management if violations do occur or are
uncorrected.
The five-year retention period in proposed rule 22e-4(c) is consistent with that in rule
38a-1(d) under the Act. We believe consistency in these retention periods is appropriate because
funds currently have program-related recordkeeping procedures in place incorporating a five-

year retention period, which we believe would lessen the compliance burden to funds slightly,
compared to choosing a different retention period, such as the six-year recordkeeping retention
period under rule 31a-2 of the Act. Taking this into account, we believe a five-year retention
period is a sufficient period of time for our examination staff to evaluate whether a fund is in
compliance (and has been in compliance) with the liquidity risk management program
requirements of the rule and anticipate that such information would become less relevant if
extended beyond a five-year retention period. Furthermore, we believe that the proposed fiveyear retention period appropriately balances recordkeeping-related burdens on funds.
We request comment on the proposed liquidity risk management program recordkeeping
requirements.


Do commenters agree that the proposed recordkeeping requirements are appropriate?
Specifically, are there any additional records associated with a fund’s liquidity risk
management program that a fund should be required to keep? Should a fund be required
to keep a written record of how the liquidity classifications of each of the fund’s positions
in a portfolio asset were determined, including assessment of the factors set forth in
proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii)? Should a fund be required to keep a written record of what
liquidity classifications were determined for each of the fund’s positions in a portfolio
asset? Do commenters anticipate that, to the extent that data regarding certain factors
that a fund would be required to consider in classifying its portfolio positions’ liquidity
could be obtained largely through automated systems, it would be possible to easily recreate a record of how past liquidity classifications assigned to a fund’s portfolio
positions were determined? Are there feasible alternatives to the proposed rule that

183

would minimize recordkeeping burdens, including the costs of maintaining the required
records?


Do commenters agree that the five-year retention period for records that would be
required to be kept pursuant to proposed rule 22e-4(c) is appropriate? If not, what
retention period would commenters recommend? Would commenters recommend a sixyear retention period? Why or why not?



We specifically request comment on any alternatives to the proposed recordkeeping
requirements that would minimize recordkeeping burdens on funds, the utility and
necessity of the proposed recordkeeping requirements in relation to the associated costs
and in view of the public benefits derived, and the effects that additional recordkeeping
requirements would have on funds’ internal compliance policies and procedures. 409

Swing Pricing

Rule 22c-1 under the Investment Company Act, the “forward pricing” rule, requires
funds, their principal underwriters, dealers in fund shares, and other persons designated in a
fund’s prospectus, to sell and redeem fund shares at a price based on the current NAV next
computed after receipt of an order to purchase or redeem. 410 When a fund trades portfolio assets
as a result of purchase or redemption requests, costs associated with this trading activity can
dilute the value of the existing shareholders’ interests in the fund. This dilution occurs because
the price at which shareholders transact in fund shares reflects the shares’ current NAV that is
409

See sections 30(c)(2)(A), 30(c)(2)(B), and 31(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act.

410

See rule 22c-1(a). Prior to adoption of rule 22c-1, investor orders to purchase and redeem could be
executed at a price computed before receipt of the order, allowing investors to lock-in a low price in a
rising market and a higher price in a falling market. The forward pricing provision of rule 22c-1 was
designed to eliminate these trading practices and the dilution to fund shareholders which occurred as a
result of backward pricing. Pricing of Redeemable Securities for Distribution, Redemption, and
Repurchase, Investment Company Act Release No. 14244 (Nov. 21, 1984) [49 FR 46558 (Nov. 27, 1984)],

next computed after the fund’s receipt of the shareholders’ purchase and redemption requests
(generally, the fund’s NAV calculated as of the close of the fund’s primary underlying market,
which is typically 4 p.m. Eastern Time), 411 but the fund’s NAV will not generally reflect changes
in holdings of the fund’s portfolio assets and changes in the number of the fund’s outstanding
shares until the first business day following the fund’s receipt of the shareholders’ purchase and
redemption requests. 412 Thus, the price that a purchasing shareholder pays for fund shares
customarily does not take into account the market impact costs and trading costs that arise when
the fund buys portfolio assets in order to invest proceeds of shareholder purchases. Likewise, the
price that a redeeming shareholder receives for fund shares customarily does not take into
account the market impact costs and trading costs that arise when the fund sells portfolio assets
in order to meet shareholder redemptions. Going forward, however, the NAV of the fund shares
held by existing shareholders does reflect these costs, and thus these costs are borne not by the
purchasing or redeeming shareholders but by all existing fund shareholders. 413

See rule 2a-4(a)(2) (providing that changes in holdings of portfolio securities shall be reflected in the fund’s

While forward pricing captures the changes in portfolio assets’ value that arise as a result
of market-wide trading, it does not necessarily reflect any disparity between the market price of a
portfolio asset at the end of the day (as determined for purposes of striking a fund’s NAV) and
the price that a fund receives for trading that asset. This scenario could arise, for example, in
situations in which an asset’s value changes throughout the day, and the price that a fund
receives when trading that asset differs from the market value of the asset at the end of the day.
It also could arise if a fund were forced to sell a relatively less liquid asset at an inopportune
time, and thus had to accept a price for that asset that incorporates a significant discount to the
asset’s stated value.
To provide an illustration of a situation in which forward pricing may not result in a
fund’s NAV reflecting the price that a fund actually received when it sold portfolio assets,
consider the following example. If a fund has valued portfolio asset X at $10 at the beginning of
day 1, and market activity on day 1 (including the fund’s sale of portfolio asset X) decreases the
market value of portfolio asset X to $9 at the end of day 1, the fund’s remaining holdings of
portfolio asset X at the end of day 1 would be valued at $9 to reflect the asset’s market value on
that day. However, staff outreach has shown that it is common industry practice, as permitted by
rule 2a-4, for the fund’s current NAV to not reflect the actual price at which the fund has sold the
portfolio assets until the next business day following the sale. 414 In the example above, if the
fund selling portfolio asset X sold the asset during the day at $8 on day 1, the price that the fund
received for these asset sales would not be reflected in the fund’s NAV until day 2. Thus,

414

See 2a-4(a)(2) (providing that changes in holdings of portfolio securities shall be reflected in the fund’s
current NAV no later than in the first calculation on the first business day following the trade date). The
next day’s NAV would generally reflect the cash receivable from the sale instead of the value of the shares
that were sold (although if the shares were sold and settled within a T+0 or T+1 timeframe, the next day’s
NAV would reflect the value of the shares that were sold).

186

redeeming shareholders would have received an exit price that would reflect portfolio asset X
being valued at the close of the market at $9 on day 1, whereas remaining shareholders would
hold shares on day 2 whose value reflects portfolio asset X being sold at $8 (the actual price that
the fund received when it sold the asset on day one).
Similarly, as noted above, the price that a purchasing shareholder pays for fund shares
normally does not take into account trading and market impact costs that arise when the fund
buys portfolio assets to invest the proceeds received from shareholder purchases. For example,
when a fund experiences net inflows, it may invest the proceeds of shareholder purchases over
several days following the purchase of fund shares. Thus, the purchase price that shareholders
receive on day 1 would not reflect any transaction fees associated with investing the proceeds of
shareholder purchases on subsequent days, or any market activity (including the fund’s purchase
of portfolio assets) that increases the value of the fund’s portfolio assets. To illustrate, if the
fund’s NAV on day 1 (and the purchase price an incoming shareholder were to receive on day 1)
reflects portfolio asset X being valued at $10, but the fund were to purchase additional shares of
portfolio asset X on day 2 at $11, the price that a purchasing shareholder pays on day 1 would
not reflect the costs of investing the proceeds of the shareholder’s purchases of fund shares.
These costs instead would be reflected in the fund’s NAV on days following the shareholder’s
purchase, and thus would be borne by all of the investors in the fund, not only the shareholders
who purchased on day 1.
Certain foreign funds currently use “swing pricing,” the process of adjusting the fund’s
NAV to effectively pass on the market impact costs, 415 spread costs, 416 and transaction fees and

415

Market impact costs are incurred when the price of a security changes as a result of the effort to purchase or
sell the security. Stated formally, market impacts are the price concessions (amounts added to the purchase
price or subtracted from the selling price) that are required to find the opposite side of the trade and

187

charges stemming from net capital activity (i.e., flows into or out of the fund) to the shareholders
associated with that activity, in order to protect other shareholders from dilution arising from
these costs. Investment management industry representative associations operating in certain
European jurisdictions have adopted guidelines on swing pricing procedures in recent years, 417
and a survey conducted by the Association of the Luxembourg Fund Industry (“ALFI”) several
years ago confirmed a strong directional trend towards the adoption of swing pricing among
major market participants in that jurisdiction, which is a significant jurisdiction for the
organization of UCITS funds in Europe. 418 Likewise, several comments from asset managers

complete the transaction. Market impact cost cannot be calculated directly. It can be roughly estimated by
comparing the actual price at which a trade was executed to prices that were present in the market at or near
the time of the trade. See Concept Release: Request for Comments on Measures to Improve Disclosure of
Mutual Fund Transaction Costs, Investment Company Act Release No. 26313 (Dec. 18, 2003)
[68 FR 74819 (Dec. 24, 2003)] (“Transaction Cost Concept Release”).
416

Spread costs are incurred indirectly when a fund buys a security from a dealer at the “asked” price (slightly
above current value) or sells a security to a dealer at the “bid” price (slightly below current value). The
difference between the bid price and the asked price is known as the “spread.” See Transaction Cost
Concept Release, supra note 415. For equity securities listed on an exchange, the costs associated with
trading the security typically take the form of brokerage commissions, as opposed to spread costs.

redemption price of the units of a UCITS shall be laid down in the applicable national law, in the fund rules

received in response to the FSOC Notice 419 noted favorably that funds regulated under the
UCITS Directive use swing pricing to allocate transaction costs to purchasing and redeeming
shareholders. 420
Commission rules and guidance do not currently address the ability of a fund to use
swing pricing to mitigate potential dilution of fund shareholders. The Commission has
previously recognized that excessive trading of mutual fund shares could dilute the value of
long-term investors’ shares, 421 however, and in response to this, the Commission adopted rule
22c-2 under the Investment Company Act. Rule 22c-2, among other things, permits a fund to
impose a fee of up to two percent on shareholders’ redemptions and requires fund boards to
consider imposing redemption fees under certain circumstances. 422 While redemption fees (or
purchase fees) could mitigate dilution arising from shareholder transaction activity,
419

See supra note 16.

420

See Comment Letter of AllianceBernstein L.P. on the FSOC Notice (Mar. 25, 2015) (noting that UCITS
funds may utilize swing pricing to “accurately reflect the costs borne by other shareholders stemming from
transaction costs”); BlackRock FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 50, at 5 and 39 (recommending
that policy makers consider a “mechanism to allocate transaction costs to redeeming shareholders as a way
to provide a price signal for the price of market liquidity and to reimburse or buffer a fund’s remaining
shareholders”); see also Nuveen FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 45, at n.26 (“The SEC could
also study proposals to change the pricing mechanisms for mutual fund subscriptions and redemptions in
such a way that, under certain pre-specified circumstances, subscribing and redeeming shareholders would
bear the cost of portfolio transactions necessary to invest cash for new subscriptions and to fund
redemptions.”); Occupy the SEC FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 45, at 13 (stating that investors
buying or selling large amounts of fund shares impose costs on the fund that results in inequitable outcomes
as long-term investors subsidize those who trade more actively and that for funds that hold illiquid assets
these externalities can become quite material).

See, e.g., Mutual Fund Redemption Fees, Investment Company Act Release No. 26782 (Mar. 11, 2005)
[70 FR 13328 (Mar. 18, 2005)] (“Rule 22c-2 Adopting Release”) at n.7 and accompanying text.

422

Rule 22c-2 prohibits a fund from redeeming shares within seven days after the share purchase unless the
fund meets three conditions. See rule 22c-2(a). First, the board of directors must either: (i) approve a
redemption fee (in an amount not to exceed two percent of the value of shares redeemed), or (ii) determine
that imposition of a redemption fee is either not necessary or not appropriate. Second, the fund (or its
principal underwriter or transfer agent) must enter into a written agreement with each financial
intermediary under which the intermediary agrees to, among other things: (i) provide, at the fund’s request,
identity and transaction information about shareholders who hold their shares through an account with the
intermediary; and (ii) execute instructions from the fund to restrict or prohibit future purchases or
exchanges. Third, the fund must maintain a copy of each written agreement with a financial intermediary
for six years.

189

implementing a fee requires coordination with the fund’s service providers, which could entail
operational complexity. On the other hand, adjusting a fund’s NAV, like imposing a fee, could
pass on transaction-related costs to purchasing and redeeming shareholders, but could be simpler
to implement because this adjustment would occur pursuant to the fund’s own procedures (as
opposed to involving the intermediaries’ systems) and would be factored into the process by
which a fund strikes its NAV. However, the Commission has not addressed whether a fund
might adjust its current NAV to lessen dilution of the value of a fund’s outstanding securities,
and the Commission’s current valuation guidance could raise questions about making such a
NAV adjustment. 423
Because we believe that swing pricing could be a useful tool in mitigating potential
dilution of fund shareholders, we are proposing rule 22c-1(a)(3), which would permit certain
mutual funds (but not ETFs or money market funds) to use swing pricing under certain
circumstances. Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) specifies the conditions under which we believe swing
pricing would be appropriately used. Below we describe in detail the proposed requirements that
a fund using swing pricing would be obliged to follow, the objectives of the proposed rule, and
certain considerations that a fund should generally assess in determining whether swing pricing
would be an effective tool to prevent fund dilution and promote fairness among all its
shareholders. The proposed rule is designed to promote all shareholders’ interests and promote
practices that seek to ensure that a fund’s shares are purchased and redeemed at a fair price. 424

423

For example, adjusting a fund’s NAV in order to effectively require shareholders who are purchasing or
redeeming shares of the fund to bear the costs associated with their purchases or redemptions could be
viewed as a temporary change in a fund’s valuation policies that might conflict with long-standing
Commission guidance that a fund’s valuation policies be “consistently applied.” See Accounting for
Investment Securities by Registered Investment Companies, Investment Company Act Release No. 6295
(Dec. 23, 1970) [35 FR 19986 (Dec. 31, 1970)] (“ASR 118”).

We also believe that the proposed rule would provide a set of operational standards that would
allow U.S. funds to gain comfort using swing pricing as a new means of mitigating potential
dilution. We recognize that implementing swing pricing could give rise to a number of
operational issues and questions, and we provide guidance and request comment on relevant
operational considerations below.

Proposed Rule 22c-1(a)(3)
a.

Overview and Objectives of Proposed Rule

Under proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3), a registered open-end investment company (but not a
registered investment company that is regulated as a money market fund, 425 and not including an
exchange-traded fund 426) would be permitted to establish and implement policies and procedures
providing for the fund to adjust its current NAV to mitigate dilution of the value of its
outstanding redeemable securities as a result of shareholder purchase and redemption activity. 427
Specifically, a fund 428 would be permitted to establish and implement swing pricing policies and
procedures that would require a fund to adjust its NAV under certain circumstances, provided
that the fund’s board (including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the
requirements of the Investment Company Act are “critical to ensuring fund shares are purchased and
redeemed at fair prices and that shareholder interests are not diluted.”).
425

See rule 2a-7.

426

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(v)(A) would define “exchange-traded fund” as “an open-end management
investment company or a class thereof, the shares of which are traded on a national securities exchange,
and that operates pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the Commission or in reliance on an exemptive
rule adopted by the Commission.”

427

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3). Under the proposed rule, “swing pricing” would be defined as “the process of
adjusting a fund’s current net asset value per share to mitigate dilution of the value of its outstanding
redeemable securities as a result of shareholder purchase and redemption activity, pursuant to the
requirements set forth in [proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)].” See proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(v)(C).

428

For purposes of this section III.F and the discussions of proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) in this document, the
term “fund” denotes a fund as defined in proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3), that is, “a registered open-end
management investment company (but not a registered open-end management investment company that is
regulated as a money market fund under § 270.2a-7 or an exchange traded fund as defined in [proposed rule
22c-1(a)(3)(v)(A)]).”

191

fund) 429 must approve these policies and procedures, and the policies and procedures must
include certain specified elements. 430 A fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures must
provide that the fund will adjust its NAV by an amount designated as the “swing factor” once the
level of net purchases into or net redemptions from the fund has exceeded a specified percentage
of the fund’s net asset value known as the “swing threshold.” 431 A fund would be required to
adopt policies and procedures for determining and periodically reviewing its swing threshold. A
fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures also would be required to include policies and
procedures for determining a swing factor that would be used to adjust the fund’s NAV when the
fund’s swing threshold is breached. While the swing factor could vary depending on the facts
and circumstances, a fund’s policies and procedures for determining its swing factor must take
certain specified factors into account. 432 A fund’s board must approve the swing pricing policies
and procedures (including the fund’s swing threshold), as well as any material change thereto, 433
and the board would be required to designate the fund’s adviser or officers responsible for
administering the policies and procedures. 434 A fund would be required to abide by certain

429

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(ii)(A).

430

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i).

431

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(A). Under the proposed rule, “swing factor” would be defined as “the amount,
expressed as a percentage of the fund’s net asset value and determined pursuant to the fund’s swing pricing
procedures, by which a fund adjusts its net asset value per share when the level of net purchases or net
redemptions from the fund has exceeded the fund’s swing threshold.” Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(v)(B).
We request comment on this definition in section III.F.1.e below.
“Swing threshold” would be defined as “the amount of net purchases into or net redemptions from a fund,
expressed as a percentage of the fund’s net asset value, that triggers the initiation of swing pricing.”

recordkeeping requirements relating to its swing pricing policies and procedures and any NAV
adjustments made pursuant to these policies and procedures. 435
In determining whether the fund’s level of net purchases or net redemptions has exceeded
the fund’s swing threshold, the person(s) responsible for administering the fund’s swing pricing
policies and procedures 436 would be permitted to make such determination on the basis of
information obtained after reasonable inquiry. 437 As discussed below, swing pricing requires the
net cash flows for a fund to be known, or reasonably estimated, before determining whether to
adjust the fund’s NAV on a particular day. 438 Because the deadline by which a fund must strike
its NAV may precede the time that a fund receives final information concerning daily net flows
from the fund’s transfer agent or principal underwriter, we believe it is appropriate to permit the
person responsible for administering swing pricing policies and procedures to determine whether
net purchases or net redemptions have exceeded the fund’s swing threshold on the basis of
information obtained after reasonable inquiry. The operational processes associated with swing
pricing are discussed in more detail below at section III.F.2.a.
Under the proposed rule, in-kind purchases and in-kind redemptions would be excluded
from the calculation of net purchases and net redemptions for purposes of determining whether a
fund’s net purchases or net redemptions exceed its swing threshold. 439 When a fund investor
purchases or redeems shares of a fund in kind as opposed to in cash, this does not necessarily
cause the fund to trade any of its portfolio assets. We therefore believe that the risk of dilution as

a result of shareholder purchase and redemption activity is lower with respect to in-kind
purchases and in-kind redemptions, and thus swing pricing would not be permitted unless a
fund’s net purchases or net redemptions that are made in cash (and not in kind) exceed the fund’s
swing threshold.
We are proposing rule 22c-1(a)(3) to provide funds with a tool to mitigate the potentially
dilutive effects of shareholder purchase and redemption activity. Funds would be able to adopt
swing pricing policies and procedures in their discretion (although, once these policies and
procedures are adopted, a fund would be required to adjust its NAV when net purchases or net
redemptions cross the swing threshold, unless the fund’s board approves a change to the fund’s
swing threshold). When a fund that has adopted swing pricing experiences net purchases
exceeding the swing threshold, it would adjust its NAV upward, which would effectively require
purchasing shareholders to cover near-term costs associated with the fund investing in additional
portfolio assets. Conversely, when a fund that has adopted swing pricing experiences net
redemptions exceeding the swing threshold, it would adjust its NAV downward, which would
effectively require redeeming shareholders to cover near-term costs associated with the fund
selling portfolio assets. In both cases, swing pricing would result in the costs of trading portfolio
assets (along with transaction fees and charges relating to these trades) being passed on to
purchasing and redeeming shareholders.
As discussed above, some foreign funds currently use swing pricing, which suggests that
these funds consider swing pricing to be a valuable and effective means of decreasing dilution.
Indeed, one investment manager conducted a study of its funds whose prices swung over a
one-year period (over fifty funds) and found that the performance of each of these funds would
have been impaired, in some cases quite considerably, had the manager not implemented a swing

194

pricing policy. 440 Likewise, ALFI has noted that studies have shown that “[f]unds that apply
swing pricing show superior performance over time compared to funds (with identical
investment strategies and trading patterns) that do not employ anti-dilution measures,” and that
“[s]wing pricing helps preserve investment returns as the value to long-term investors normally
exceeds the value of the swing factor applied on entry to or exit from the fund.” 441 We believe
that the swing pricing policies contemplated by the proposed rule, which are similar to those
used by some foreign funds, could mitigate dilution arising from shareholders’ purchase and
redemption activity. 442 As opposed to purchase and redemption fees or liquidity fees, which
could also prevent fund dilution arising from purchase or redemption activity, 443 swing pricing
would occur pursuant to the fund’s own procedures and would not require coordination with the
fund’s service providers because the swing pricing adjustment would be factored into the process
by which a fund strikes its NAV. 444 In addition to mitigating potential dilution arising from
purchase and redemption activity, swing pricing also could help deter redemptions motivated by

See Luxembourg Swing Pricing Survey, Reports & Guidelines, supra note 413, at 12. But see infra
paragraph following note 447 (noting that swing pricing could increase the volatility of a fund’s NAV in
the short term, which could increase tracking error and could make a fund’s performance deviate from the
fund’s benchmark during the period of volatility to a greater degree than if swing pricing had not been
used).

has previously recognized that costs arising from certain types of redemption activity (namely, short-term
trading strategies, such as market timing) could dilute the value of long-term investors’ shares. See Rule
22c-2 Adopting Release, supra note 421.

443

As discussed above, the Commission has previously recognized that excessive trading of fund shares could
dilute the value of long-term investors’ shares, and in response to this, adopted rule 22c-2, which permits a
fund to impose redemption fees, and requires fund boards to consider imposing redemption fees, under
certain circumstances. See supra notes 421-422.
In addition, money market funds are permitted to use liquidity fees under rule 2a-7. See 2014 Money
Market Fund Reform Adopting Release, supra note 85, at section III.A.5; see also discussion of money
market fund liquidity fees in section III.F.1.b infra. Liquidity fees (including “dilution levies” used by
certain UCITS) are also used in some foreign jurisdictions, as a distinct liquidity risk management tool
separate from swing pricing. See infra notes 467-468 and accompanying text.

any first-mover advantage. That is, if remaining shareholders understood that redeeming
shareholders would bear the estimated costs of their redemption activity, it would reduce their
incentive to redeem quickly because there would be less risk that they would bear the costs of
other shareholders’ redemption activity.
In considering the swing pricing proposal, we considered proposing a rule that would
permit “dual pricing” as opposed to swing pricing. We understand that certain foreign funds use
dual pricing as an alternative means of mitigating potential dilution arising from shareholder
transaction activity. A fund using dual pricing would not adjust the fund’s NAV by a swing
factor when it faces high levels of net purchases or net redemptions, but instead would quote two
prices—one for incoming shareholders (reflecting the cost of buying portfolio securities at the
ask price in the market), and one for outgoing shareholders (reflecting the proceeds the fund
would receive from selling portfolio securities at the bid price in the market). 445 While we
believe that dual pricing also could mitigate potential dilution, we believe that swing pricing is a
preferable alternative because we believe it would be simpler to implement and for investors to
understand. Swing pricing would permit a fund to continue to transact using one price, as they
do today (instead of transacting using separate prices for purchasing and redeeming
shareholders), and also would permit a fund to price its shares without adjustment unless the
level of net purchases or net redemptions were to cross the fund’s swing threshold.
We recognize that swing pricing may involve potential disadvantages to funds as well as
potential advantages, and the provisions of proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) are designed to maximize
the relative advantages and respond to potential concerns associated with swing pricing. While

445

See, e.g., supra note 423 for a discussion of different methods of valuing portfolio assets, as considered in
ASR 118.

196

swing pricing protects against dilution at the fund level and could act as a deterrent against
redemptions motivated by any first-mover advantage, the potential disadvantages of swing
pricing (described in more detail below) include increased performance volatility and the fact
that the precise impact of swing pricing on particular purchase and redemption requests would
not be known in advance and thus may not be fully transparent to investors. Under proposed rule
22c-1(a)(3), swing pricing would be a voluntary tool for funds, and thus a fund would be able to
weigh the potential advantages and disadvantages of swing pricing in relation to the fund’s
particular circumstances and risks, as well as the other tools the fund uses to manage risks
relating to dilution and liquidity.
The swing pricing requirements in proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) aim to minimize NAV
volatility (and related tracking error) associated with swing pricing to the extent possible. Swing
pricing could increase the volatility of a fund’s NAV in the short term, because NAV
adjustments would occur when the fund’s net purchases or net redemptions pass the fund’s swing
threshold. Thus, the fund’s NAV would show greater fluctuation than would be the case in the
absence of swing pricing. This volatility might increase tracking error (i.e., the difference in
return based on the swung NAV compared to the fund’s benchmark) during the period of NAV
adjustment, and could make a fund’s short-term performance deviate from the fund’s benchmark
to a greater degree than if swing pricing had not been used. 446 Volatility and tracking error
related to swing pricing could, therefore, result in investors incorrectly perceiving the short-term
relative performance of a fund. This could potentially cause market distortions if investors were
to incorrectly rate the performance of funds that use swing pricing compared to funds that do not,

446

But see supra notes 440-441 and accompanying text (noting that swing pricing has been found to benefit
fund performance over the long term).

197

and shifted their invested assets from funds that use swing pricing to funds that do not as a result
of this perception. Volatility and tracking error related to swing pricing also may activate alerts
in monitoring systems that follow fund performance, which could in turn trigger purchases or
redemptions in automated fund advisory services whose algorithms are driven by fund
performance. However, we believe that the use of partial swing pricing, described below, would
significantly reduce the performance volatility potentially associated with swing pricing. In
addition, swing pricing should have a minimal effect on longer-term performance volatility and
longer-term tracking error. Taking these considerations into account, we do not believe that
volatility would generally be a significant deterrent to funds using swing pricing. We do request
comment below on the potential effects of swing pricing on funds’ performance volatility and
any potential market distortions that could result if some funds adopt swing pricing but other,
similarly situated funds do not.
Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) envisions partial swing pricing (that is, a NAV adjustment
would not be permitted unless net purchases or net redemptions exceed a threshold set by the
fund and approved by the fund’s board) and not full swing pricing (that is, a NAV adjustment
any time the fund experiences net purchases or net redemptions). Some foreign funds employ
full swing pricing, 447 and there are certain advantages to full swing pricing (e.g., a fund using full
swing pricing would not be required to determine an appropriate swing threshold). 448 However,
we believe partial swing pricing would generally cause lower NAV volatility than full swing
pricing. The use of partial swing pricing also recognizes that net purchases and net redemptions

But see Luxembourg Swing Pricing Survey, Reports & Guidelines, supra note 413, at 6 (of the respondents
surveyed by ALFI, the majority employed a partial swing approach, with only a select few choosing the full
swing method).

below a certain threshold might not require a fund to trade portfolio assets, 449 and therefore a
NAV adjustment, and any associated NAV volatility, might not be appropriate if purchases and
redemptions would not result in costs associated with asset purchases and sales.
We recognize that there are other trade-offs that a fund would have to consider in
determining to implement swing pricing. For example, application of a swing factor would
affect all purchasing and redeeming shareholders equally, regardless of whether the size of an
individual shareholder’s purchases or redemptions alone would create material trading costs for
the fund. This could cause certain shareholders to experience benefits or costs, relative to the
other shareholders in the fund, that otherwise would not exist. For example, an investor who
purchases fund shares on a day when a fund adjusts its NAV downward would pay less to enter
the fund than if the fund had not adjusted is NAV on that day. And, while a small investor’s
redemption requests would not likely create significant liquidity costs for the fund on its own, if
this investor were to redeem on the same day that the fund’s net redemptions cross the swing
threshold, his or her redemption proceeds would be reduced by the NAV adjustment. These
concerns, however, are partially mitigated by the fact that shareholders could be assured that the
same threshold level of net purchase and net redemption activity (as approved by the fund’s
board) would consistently trigger the use of swing pricing, unless the fund’s board and a majority
of the fund’s independent directors were to approve a change in the fund’s swing threshold. 450
Furthermore, we believe that investors who purchase shares on a day that a fund adjusts its NAV
downward would not create dilution for non-redeeming shareholders (even though the
purchasing shareholders may be receiving a lower price than would be the case if the NAV was

For example, a fund may not need to sell portfolio assets to pay redemptions below a certain threshold if it
maintains a certain percentage of its net assets in cash or cash equivalents.

199

not adjusted downward). Under these circumstances, shareholders’ purchase activity would
provide liquidity to the fund, which could reduce the fund’s liquidity costs and thereby could
decrease the swing factor. This could potentially help redeeming shareholders to receive a more
favorable redemption price than they otherwise would have if there had been less purchase
activity on that day, but would not affect the interests of non-redeeming investors.
We believe that an adequate level of transparency about swing pricing is critical for
investors to understand the risks associated with investing in a particular fund. As discussed in
section III.G below, proposed disclosure and reporting requirements regarding swing pricing
would assist shareholders in understanding whether a particular fund has implemented swing
pricing policies and procedures and has used swing pricing. We are not, however, proposing to
require a fund to publicly disclose its swing threshold, because of concerns that certain
shareholders may attempt to time their transactions based on this information, 451 as well as
concerns that disclosure could be confusing or potentially misleading insofar as it could give an
inaccurate view of funds’ relative risks and benefits. For example, a shareholder might assume
that Fund X with a swing threshold of 5% is inherently more risky and thus a “worse”
investment than Fund Y with a swing threshold of 7% because a lower level of net flows would
cause Fund X to adjust its NAV than Fund Y. But the relative performance and risks of both
funds could depend on additional considerations, even excluding differences in the various
market, credit, liquidity, and other risks associated with the funds’ portfolio assets. These
considerations could include the swing factors the funds would use to adjust their NAV and the
451

See Luxembourg Swing Pricing Survey, Reports & Guidelines, supra note 413, at 8 (of the respondents
surveyed by ALFI, the majority of those that used swing pricing “were reluctant to disclose the level of
[swing] threshold they apply . . . [and some] commented that the act of disclosing these details was
contradictory to the principle of investor protection and therefore avoided disclosing the threshold.” ALFI
noted that “[o]n balance it appears that the majority of promoters prefer not to disclose thresholds to ensure
clients do not actively manage trades below the trigger level of the partial swing.”).

frequency with which each fund would encounter net purchases or net redemptions that cross the
fund’s swing threshold. Although funds would not be required to disclose their swing threshold,
the use of partial swing pricing as opposed to full swing pricing could give shareholders comfort
that, under circumstances in which the fund is experiencing relatively low purchases or
redemptions, the fund’s NAV will likely not be adjusted.
Request for Comment
We seek comment on the general swing pricing process as contemplated by proposed rule
22c-1(a)(3). We seek specific comment on the process a fund would use to determine and
review its swing threshold and to calculate the swing factor it would use to adjust its NAV, and
on the proposed approval and oversight requirements associated with swing pricing policies and
procedures, below.
•

Do commenters agree that swing pricing could be a useful tool for U.S. registered funds
in mitigating potential dilution of fund shareholders? Do commenters believe that
dilution arising from costs associated with certain purchases or redemptions of fund
shares is a significant problem that funds currently face, have historically faced under
certain market conditions, or might be expected to face in the future?

•

Do commenters agree that the proposed rule should require a fund that adopts swing
pricing policies and procedures to adjust the fund’s NAV when the fund’s level of net
purchases or redemptions exceeds the fund’s swing threshold? Or should the proposed
rule instead only require a fund that adopts swing pricing policies and procedures to
adjust the fund’s NAV when the fund’s level of net redemptions exceeds the swing
threshold? Alternatively, should the proposed rule permit a fund to choose whether to
adopt swing pricing policies and procedures that would: (i) require the fund to adjust its

201

NAV when the fund’s level of net purchases or redemptions exceeds the fund’s swing
threshold; or (ii) require the fund to adjust its NAV only when the fund’s level of net
redemptions exceeds the fund’s swing threshold? Are there greater concerns about the
potential for dilution associated with net redemptions than those associated with net
purchases?
•

Should a fund be permitted to use full swing pricing, as opposed to the partial swing
pricing contemplated by the proposed rule? Why or why not?

•

Under the proposed rule, when net purchases or net redemptions of a fund that has
adopted swing pricing policies and procedures exceed the fund’s swing threshold, the
price that all purchasing or redeeming shareholders would receive for fund shares would
be adjusted pursuant to the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures. Should a fund
instead be permitted to exempt certain shareholders (for example, purchasing
shareholders on days when the fund’s share price is adjusted downward, or small
shareholders whose purchase or redemption activity would not likely create significant
liquidity costs for the fund) from receiving an adjusted share price on a day when the
fund’s net purchases or redemptions exceed the swing threshold? Why or why not?

•

Would the use of purchase fees, redemption fees and/or liquidity fees (either separately or
in combination) be a more or less effective means of mitigating potential dilution than
swing pricing? Why or why not? Would the use of purchase fees, redemption fees
and/or liquidity fees (either separately or in combination) entail burdens and costs that are
higher or lower than the burdens and costs associated with swing pricing? What types of
operational challenges would arise with swing pricing as opposed to purchase fees,
redemption fees, and liquidity fees? Are purchase fees, redemption fees, and liquidity

202

fees feasible for those funds whose shares are primarily held through third-party
intermediaries?
•

Would the use of dual pricing be a more or less effective means of mitigating potential
dilution than swing pricing? What types of operational challenges would arise with
swing pricing vs. dual pricing?

•

Would allowing funds to require certain investors to accept in-kind redemptions in
certain circumstances be a more or less effective means of mitigation potential dilution
than swing pricing in those circumstances?

•

Do commenters agree that the swing pricing framework contemplated by proposed rule
22c-1(a)(3) responds as effectively as possible to the potential concerns associated with
swing pricing? Specifically, we request comment on the extent to which the swing
pricing requirements incorporated into the proposed rule would reduce volatility and
respond to transparency-related concerns. Would any performance volatility that could
result from swing pricing result in market distortions if some funds adopt swing pricing
but other, similarly situated funds do not? Do commenters believe that the use of partial
swing pricing, as opposed to full swing pricing, would mitigate concerns that the swing
pricing would increase a fund’s volatility? Do these proposed requirements also
effectively respond to transparency-related concerns associated with swing pricing, and
would the proposed disclosure requirements regarding swing pricing also respond to
transparency concerns? Would any alternative or additional swing pricing requirements
more effectively respond to potential concerns about volatility or transparency (or any
other concerns) associated with swing pricing?

203

•

As proposed, rule 22c-1(a)(3) would permit, but not require, a fund to adopt swing
pricing policies and procedures. What process do commenters anticipate that a fund may
use to weigh the potential advantages and disadvantages of swing pricing in relation to
the fund’s particular circumstances and risks? Should each fund’s board be required to
determine whether swing pricing is appropriate for each fund? Should all funds, or a
particular subset of funds (e.g., funds whose three-day liquid asset minimums are below a
certain level, or whose less liquid assets are above a certain level) be required to use
swing pricing? Do commenters expect funds would decide that swing pricing would be
an effective anti-dilution tool, in spite of potential concerns about volatility or
transparency (or any other potential concerns)?

•

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) would permit the person(s) responsible for administering a
fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures to make the determination of whether the
fund’s level of net purchases or redemptions has exceeded the fund’s swing threshold “on
the basis of information obtained after reasonable inquiry.” Do commenters agree that
this would be appropriate? Why or why not? Is the phrase “information obtained after
reasonable inquiry” clear? If not, how could this term be clarified within the context of
the proposed rule?

•

As proposed, rule 22c-1(a)(3) would require a fund to exclude any purchases or
redemptions that are made in kind and not in cash when determining whether the fund’s
level of net purchases or net redemptions has exceeded the fund’s swing threshold. Is
this exclusion appropriate? Why or why not?

b.

Scope of Proposed Rule

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) would apply to all registered open-end management investment
companies, with the exception of money market funds and ETFs. 452 While rule 22c-1(a)
generally applies to all registered investment companies issuing redeemable securities, 453 we
believe that only open-end mutual funds (and, as discussed below, not UITs or ETFs) are
generally susceptible to the risk that shareholder redemption activity could dilute the value of
outstanding shares held by existing shareholders. And as discussed below, we believe money
market funds, while potentially susceptible to this risk, already have extensive tools at their
disposal to mitigate potential shareholder dilution.
All investment companies that fall within the scope of proposed rule 22e-4, with the
exception of ETFs, would be permitted to use swing pricing under proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3), and
a fund may decide to adopt swing pricing policies and procedures as part of the liquidity risk
management program it would be required to implement under proposed rule 22e-4. Under
proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3), swing pricing would be voluntary for funds, and some fund
complexes may decide to use swing pricing for certain funds within the complex but not others,
or establish different swing thresholds for different funds within the complex.454 As discussed

452

As discussed above, for purposes of the proposed amendments to rule 22c-1, “exchange-traded fund”
includes an ETMF.

453

Rule 2a-7 provides exemptions from rule 22c-1 for money market funds, to permit certain money market
funds to use the amortized cost method and/or the penny-rounding method to calculate its NAV, and to
permit a money market fund to impose liquidity fees and temporarily suspend redemptions. See rule
2a-7(c)(1)(i); rule 2a-7(c)(2).

454

Outside the U.S., it is a common industry practice for funds within a fund complex each to have an
individual swing threshold, or for some funds within a complex to use swing pricing while others do not.
See, e.g., BlackRock Swing Pricing Paper, supra note 412; J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Swing pricing:
The J.P. Morgan Asset Management Approach in the Luxembourg Domiciled SICAVs, JPMorgan Funds
and JPMorgan Investment Funds Insight (June 2014), available at

above, funds would be required to exclude any purchases and redemptions that are made in kind,
and not in cash, in determining whether the fund’s level of net purchases or net redemptions has
exceeded the fund’s swing threshold. 455 This could functionally limit the ability of a fund that
often permits in-kind purchases and in-kind redemptions to use swing pricing, or discourage such
a fund from adopting swing pricing policies and procedures, because the fund’s level of net
purchases or net redemptions as calculated pursuant to proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) may never (or
rarely) reach the fund’s swing threshold as determined pursuant to the proposed rule.
We are not proposing to include closed-end investment companies, UITs, ETFs or money
market funds within the scope of proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3). Closed-end investment companies
do not issue redeemable securities and therefore would not incur costs associated with
shareholder purchase and redemption activity that would necessitate swing pricing. Similarly,
where a UIT sponsor maintains a secondary market in units of a UIT series, we believe that the
series is unlikely to ever need to use swing pricing. In addition, since UITs do not frequently
trade their underlying securities, but instead maintain a relatively fixed portfolio, investor flows
do not generally affect the portfolio, and thus purchases and sales of UIT shares would not likely
produce dilutive effects to existing shareholders. 456
Although we believe that ETFs could experience liquidity risk and thus have included
them within the scope of proposed rule 22e-4, 457 we are proposing not to include ETFs within the
scope of proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) because we believe—as described more fully below—that
ETFs’ purchase and redemption practices do not generally entail the risk of dilution as a result of
authorized participants’ purchase and redemption activity, and that swing pricing could impede

206

the effective functioning of an ETF’s arbitrage mechanism. Unlike mutual funds, which
typically internalize the costs associated with purchases and redemptions of shares, ETFs
typically externalize these costs by charging a fixed and/or variable fee to authorized participants
who purchase creation units from, and sell creation units to, an ETF. The fixed and/or variable
fees are imposed to offset both transfer and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the
ETF (or its service providers), as well as brokerage, tax-related, foreign exchange, execution,
market impact and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such
transaction. The amount of these fixed and variable fees typically depends on whether the
authorized participant effects transactions in kind versus in cash and is related to the costs and
expenses associated with transaction effected in kind versus in cash. When an authorized
participant redeems ETF shares by selling a creation unit to the ETF, for example, the fees
imposed by the ETF defray the costs of the liquidity that the redeeming authorized participant
receives, which in turn mitigates the risk that dilution of non-redeeming authorized participants
would result when an ETF redeems its shares.
In addition to our belief that ETFs’ purchase and redemption practices would generally
not entail the risk of dilution for existing shareholders, we are also not including ETFs within the
scope of the proposed rule because we believe that swing pricing could impede the effective
functioning of an ETF’s arbitrage mechanism. 458 As discussed above, the effective functioning
of the arbitrage mechanism is necessary in order for an ETF’s shares to trade at a price that is at
or close to the NAV of the ETF. 459 If an ETF were to adopt swing pricing policies and
458

As discussed previously, ETMF market makers would not engage in the same arbitrage as ETF market
makers because all trading prices of ETMF shares are linked to NAV. See supra note 32 and
accompanying text. ETMFs would charge transaction fees that mitigate the risk of dilution, and therefore
we do not propose to include ETMFs within the scope of proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3).

459

See, e.g., supra note 14 and accompanying text.

207

procedures, as conceptualized under the proposed rule, an authorized participant would not know
whether the ETF’s NAV would be adjusted by a swing factor on any given day and therefore
may not be able to assess whether an arbitrage opportunity exists. 460 The Commission has
historically considered the effective functioning of the arbitrage mechanism to be central to the
principle that all shareholders be treated equitably when buying and selling their fund shares. 461
Therefore, we believe that the implementation of swing pricing by an ETF could raise concerns
about the equitable treatment of shareholders, to the extent that swing pricing could impede the
effective functioning of the arbitrage mechanism.
We are also not proposing to include money market funds within the scope of proposed
rule 22c-1(a)(3). Money market funds are subject to extensive requirements concerning the
liquidity of their portfolio assets. Also, a money market fund (other than a government fund) is
permitted to impose a liquidity fee on redemptions if its weekly liquid assets fall below a certain
threshold, and these fees serve a similar purpose as the NAV adjustments contemplated by swing
pricing. 462 That is, money market fund liquidity fees allocate at least some of the costs of

460

See supra note 451 and accompanying paragraph (noting that a fund would not be required to disclose its
swing threshold under the proposed rule).

See, e.g., Spruce ETF Trust, et al., Investment Company Act Release No. 31301 (Oct. 21, 2014)
[79 FR 63964 (Oct. 27, 2014)] (notice of application for exemptive relief) (to the extent that investors
would have to exit at a price substantially below the NAV of the ETF, this would be “contrary to the
foundational principle underlying section 22(d) and rule 22c-1 under the Act that all shareholders be treated
equitably when buying and selling their fund shares”); Precidian ETFs Trust, et al., Investment Company
Act Release No. 31300 (Oct. 21, 2014) [79 FR 63971 (Oct. 27, 2014)] (notice of application for exemptive
relief) (“A close tie between market price and NAV per share of the ETF is the foundation for why the
prices at which retail investors buy and sell ETF shares are similar to the prices at which Authorized
Participants are able to buy and redeem shares directly from the ETF at NAV. This close tie between
prices paid by retail investors and Authorized Participants is important because section 22(d) and rule 22c-1
under the Act are designed to require that all fund shareholders be treated equitably when buying and
selling their fund shares.”).

providing liquidity to redeeming rather than existing shareholders, 463 and also generate
additional liquidity to meet redemption requests. 464 We therefore believe that money market
funds already have liquidity risk management tools at their disposal that could accomplish
comparable goals to the swing pricing that would be permitted under proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3).
We also believe that the liquidity fee regime permitted under rule 2a-7 is a more
appropriate tool for money market funds to manage the allocation of liquidity costs than swing
pricing. First, while funds would be able to adopt swing pricing policies and procedures at their
discretion, rule 2a-7 requires a money market fund under certain circumstances to impose a 1%
liquidity fee on each shareholder’s redemption, unless the fund’s board of directors (including a
majority of its independent directors) determines that such fee is not in the best interests of the
fund, or determines that a lower or higher fee (not to exceed 2%) is in the best interests of the
fund. 465 Money market funds also have unique minimum liquid asset requirements, and we
believe the use of liquidity fees is appropriately tied to those requirements. Finally, we
anticipate that open-end funds that adopt swing pricing policies and procedures would be
required under such procedures to adjust their NAV on a relatively regular basis (whenever the
fund’s net purchases or net redemptions exceed the fund’s swing threshold). In contrast, money
market fund investors (particularly, investors in stable-NAV money market funds) are
particularly sensitive to price volatility, 466 and we anticipate liquidity fees will be used only in

466

For example, retail and government money market funds are permitted to maintain a stable NAV, reflecting
in part our understanding that investors in these products have a low tolerance for NAV volatility. See
2014 Money Market Fund Reform Adopting Release, supra note 85, at section III.B.3.c. Investors in
floating NAV money market funds also could be sensitive to principal volatility, as we recognized in
adopting requirements that all money market funds disclose their daily net asset value (rounded to the

We

note that some foreign jurisdictions have a similar conception of liquidity fees as a distinct tool
separate from swing pricing. For example, in Europe, UCITS may use swing pricing and apply
“dilution levies.” 467 While many UCITS use swing pricing as a matter of normal course, dilution
levies may be considered a liquidity risk management tool that is used in connection with
stressed conditions. 468

If the scope of the proposed rule were expanded to include ETFs, are there any swing
pricing operational considerations specific to ETFs that we should address? For example,
if an ETF were to adopt swing pricing, how should we address any shareholder fairness
implications that could result if certain authorized participants were to transact in cash
and others were to transact in kind on a day when the fund swings its NAV? Should
ETFs be permitted to use swing pricing in addition to imposing transaction fees on
authorized participants, or as an alternative to such fees? Should we address implications
of the proposed rule on exemptive relief that has been granted to existing ETFs? Should
we also consider the implications of the proposed rule on an ETF that operates as a share
class of a fund that also offers mutual fund share classes, or on an ETF that operates as a
feeder fund investing in a master fund alongside mutual fund feeder funds?

•

We seek comment on how the utilization of swing pricing by an ETF could affect the
capital markets, in particular, market-making in the ETF. If the scope of the rule were
expanded to include ETFs, would market makers and other market participants that
contribute to ETF market-making be less willing to do so if it were unclear when an ETF
that has adopted swing pricing policies and procedures would adjust its NAV, and to
what extent swing pricing would affect the ETF’s end-of-day NAV?

The proposed definition of “exchange-traded fund” in rule 22c-1 would include ETMFs.

applicable exemptive relief, it would arrange for an independent third party to
disseminate the intraday indicative value of the ETMF’s shares, which an investor would
use to estimate the number of shares to buy or sell based on the dollar amount in which

211

the investor wants to transact. 469 To what extent would a NAV adjustment effected by
swing pricing make an investor’s estimate less accurate, given that such adjustment
would not be reflected in the intraday indicative value of the ETMF’s shares
disseminated during the trading day?
•

Do commenters agree that money market funds already have liquidity risk management
tools at their disposal that could accomplish comparable goals to swing pricing, and that
the liquidity fee regime permitted under rule 2a-7 is a more appropriate tool for money
market funds to manage the allocation of liquidity costs than swing pricing? Would there
be any reason to extend the scope of proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) to floating NAV money
market funds?
c.

Determining the Fund’s Swing Threshold

Under proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3), a fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures must
provide that the fund is required to adjust its NAV once the level of net purchases or net
redemptions from the fund has exceeded a set, specified percentage of the fund’s net asset value
known as the “swing threshold.” 470 A fund would be required to adopt policies and procedures
for determining its swing threshold, 471 and as discussed below, the swing threshold and any
changes thereto must be approved by the fund’s board of directors. 472 In specifying its swing
threshold, a fund would be required to consider:

469

See ETMF Notice, supra note 15.

470

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(A). Under the proposed rule, “swing threshold” would be defined as “the
amount of net purchases into or net redemptions from a fund, expressed as a percentage of the fund’s net
asset value, that triggers the initiation of swing pricing.” Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(v)(D). We request
comment on this definition at the end of this section III.F.1.c.

471

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(B).

472

See infra section III.F.1.f.

212

o The size, frequency, and volatility of historical net purchases or net redemptions of fund
shares during normal and stressed periods;
o The fund’s investment strategy and the liquidity of the fund’s portfolio assets;
o The fund’s holdings of cash and cash equivalents, as well as borrowing arrangements and
other funding sources; and
o The costs associated with transactions in the markets in which the fund invests. 473
In order to effectively mitigate possible dilution arising in connection with shareholder
purchase and redemption activity, a fund’s swing threshold should generally reflect the estimated
point at which net purchases or net redemptions would trigger the fund’s investment adviser to
trade portfolio assets in the near term, to a degree or of a type that may generate material
liquidity or transaction costs for the fund. As discussed below, we believe that a consideration of
the factors set forth above would permit a fund to estimate this point. The liquidity or
transaction costs associated with purchase or redemption activity can dilute the value of existing
shareholders’ interests in the fund, and the purpose of swing pricing is to lessen this potential
dilution. Trading assets to meet purchase or redemption requests is not in and of itself an
indication that a fund will incur material liquidity or transaction costs. For example, trading
smaller levels of very liquid assets would likely not produce significant costs to the fund.
However, trading portfolio assets to a significant degree, or trading relatively less liquid assets
within a short time frame in order to invest proceeds from purchases or satisfy redemption

473

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(B).
These factors overlap significantly with factors that we understand are commonly considered by funds that
use swing pricing in other jurisdictions, in order to determine a fund’s swing threshold. For example, the
Luxembourg Swing Pricing Survey, Reports & Guidelines provides that factors influencing the
determination of the swing threshold ordinarily include: (i) fund size; (ii) type and liquidity of securities in
which the fund invests; (iii) costs (and hence, the dilution impact) associated with the markets in which the
fund invests; and (iv) investment manager’s investment policy and the extent to which the fund can retain
cash (or near cash) as opposed to always being fully invested). See Luxembourg Swing Pricing Survey,
Reports & Guidelines, supra note 413, at 14.

213

requests, could generate material costs to the fund that could dilute the value of fund shares held
by existing investors.
We believe that evaluating the factors that proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) would require a
fund to consider in specifying its swing threshold would assist a fund in determining what level
of net purchases or net redemptions would generally lead to a trade of portfolio assets that would
result in material costs to the fund. Assessing the size, frequency, and volatility of historical net
purchases and net redemptions of fund shares would permit a fund to determine its typical levels
of net purchases and net redemptions and the levels the fund could expect to encounter during
periods of unusual market stress, as well as the frequency with which the fund could expect to
see periods of unusually high purchases or redemptions. We believe that comparing the fund’s
historical flow patterns with the fund’s investment strategy, the liquidity of the fund’s portfolio
holdings, the fund’s holdings of cash and cash equivalents and borrowing arrangements and
other funding sources, and the costs associated with transactions in the markets in which the fund
invests would allow a fund to predict what levels of purchases and redemptions would result in
material costs under a variety of scenarios.
The first three factors that proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(B) would require a fund to
consider in specifying the fund’s swing threshold correspond with certain of the factors a fund
would be required to consider in assessing its liquidity risk. 474 This is because evaluating a
fund’s liquidity risk, or the risk that the fund could not meet expected and reasonably foreseeable

474

See proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)(A)(1), proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)(B), proposed rule
22e-4(b)(2)(iii)(D) (requiring a fund to consider, in assessing its liquidity risk, the “size, frequency, and
volatility of historical purchases and redemptions of fund shares during normal and stressed periods,” the
fund’s “investment strategy and liquidity of portfolio assets,” and the fund’s “holdings of cash and cash
equivalents, as well as borrowing arrangements and other funding sources,” respectively).

214

requests to redeem its shares without materially affecting the fund’s NAV, 475 is a similar exercise
to determining the fund’s swing threshold (which, as discussed above, should generally reflect
the estimated point at which net purchases or net redemptions would trigger the fund’s
investment manager to trade portfolio assets in the near term, to a degree or of a type that may
generate material liquidity or transaction costs for the fund). For this reason, we believe that the
issues a fund would consider in assessing the extent to which the (i) size, frequency, and
volatility of historical purchases and redemptions of fund shares during normal and stressed
periods, (ii) the fund’s investment strategy and portfolio liquidity, and (iii) the fund’s holdings of
cash and cash equivalents, borrowing arrangements and other funding sources would affect the
fund’s liquidity risk also are relevant when a fund determines its swing threshold. These issues
are discussed in detail above. 476
In assessing the fourth factor, the costs associated with transactions in the markets in
which the fund invests, a fund may wish to consider, as applicable, market impact costs 477 and
spread costs 478 that the fund typically incurs when it trades its portfolio assets (or assets with
comparable characteristics if data concerning a particular portfolio asset is not available to the
fund). A fund also may wish to consider, as applicable, the transaction fees and charges that the
fund typically is required to pay when it trades portfolio assets. 479 These could include brokerage
commissions and custody fees, as well as other charges, fees, and taxes associated with portfolio
475

See proposed rule 22e-4(a)(7).

476

See supra sections III.C.1.a, III.C.1.b, and III.C.1.d.

477

See supra note 415.

478

See supra note 416.

479

A fund would be required to take transaction fees and charges into account when determining the swing
factor that would be used to adjust the fund’s NAV when the level of net purchases or net redemptions
from the fund has exceeded the fund’s swing threshold. Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(D)(1). See infra note
493 for a discussion of the proposed definition of “transaction fees and charges.”

215

asset purchases or sales (for example, transfer taxes and repatriation costs for certain foreign
securities, or transaction fees associated with portfolio investments in other investment
companies).
We understand that because proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) does not specify a minimum
“floor” for a fund’s swing threshold, a fund could set a swing threshold representing a very low
level of net purchases or net redemptions. This could result in the fund effectively practicing full
swing pricing (that is, adjusting the fund’s NAV whenever there is any level of net purchases or
net redemptions) instead of partial swing pricing. However, we do not anticipate that a fund
would generally wish to set a very low swing threshold, because we believe that a fund would
not want to incur the increased NAV volatility associated with full (or nearly full) swing pricing.
We also are not currently proposing a swing threshold floor because we believe that different
levels of net purchases and net redemptions would create a risk of dilution for funds with
different strategies, shareholder bases, and other liquidity-related characteristics, and thus it
would be difficult to determine a swing threshold floor that would be appropriate across the
scope of funds that would be permitted to use swing pricing. 480
We recognize that requiring a fund to adopt a swing threshold could create the potential
for shareholder gaming behavior because a fund’s shareholders could attempt to time their
purchases and redemptions based on the likelihood that a fund would or would not adjust its
NAV. However, we do not think that potential gaming is a significant concern, because it would
be difficult for shareholders to determine when the fund’s net purchases or net redemptions cross
the swing threshold. As discussed above, a fund would not be required to publicly disclose its

480

We note that, in Europe, there are no across-the-board swing threshold floors applicable to UCITS that use
swing pricing.

216

swing threshold. 481 Also, funds are not required to disclose their daily net flows and do not
usually do so. 482 For a shareholder to effectively “game” the swing pricing, it would have to
know the daily flows on the day that shareholder was purchasing or redeeming and those flows
would have to not materially change after the shareholder placed its order, all of which may be
unlikely. Accordingly, even if a fund were to reveal its swing threshold, it may be difficult for
shareholders to determine when the fund’s net purchases or net redemptions exceed the swing
threshold. We note that, to the extent a fund does decide to disclose its swing threshold, we
believe it would not be appropriate for a fund to disclose it selectively to certain investors (e.g.,
to only disclose the fund’s swing threshold to institutional investors), as we believe this could
assist certain groups of shareholders in strategically timing purchases and redemptions of fund
shares, potentially disadvantaging shareholders who do not know the fund’s swing threshold. 483
Request for Comment
We request comment on the definition of “swing threshold” set forth in proposed rule
22c-1(a)(3) and the process a fund would use to determine its swing threshold.

481

See supra paragraph accompanying note 451.

482

However, as proposed earlier this year, a fund would be required to disclose flow information on proposed
Form N-PORT monthly, and information contained on reports for the last month of each fiscal quarter
would be made public. See infra note 561.

483

Like selective disclosure of fund portfolio holdings, we believe that selective disclosure of a fund’s swing
threshold could facilitate fraud and have adverse ramifications for a fund’s investors if certain investors are
given the opportunity to use this information to their advantage to the detriment of other investors.
See, e.g., Disclosure Regarding Market Timing and Selective Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings, Investment
Company Act Release No. 26418 (Apr. 16, 2004) [69 FR 22300 (Apr. 23, 2004)] (discussing harm that
could result from selective disclosure of fund portfolio holdings and adopting amendments to Form N-1A
that would—among other things—require funds to disclose their policies and procedures with respect to the
disclosure of their portfolio securities and any ongoing arrangements to make available information about
their portfolio securities).

217

•

Is the definition of “swing threshold,” as set forth in proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)
appropriate and clear? If not, how could this definition be clarified or made more
effective within the context of the proposed rule?

•

Should a fund be permitted to adopt two swing thresholds—one for net redemptions and
one for net purchases? Would this be more operationally difficult than adopting one
swing threshold that would be used for net redemptions as well as net purchases, and if
so, why?

•

Should any of the proposed factors not be required to be considered by a fund in
determining and reviewing its swing threshold? Should any be modified? Are there any
additional factors, besides the proposed factors, that a fund should be required to
consider? Should we set a minimum floor for a fund’s swing threshold (e.g., one percent,
or some other percentage, of the fund’s net asset value) to prevent a fund from setting a
very low swing threshold? If so, what should it be and why?

•

Do commenters agree that the swing threshold requirements under proposed rule
22c-1(a)(3) would not raise significant concerns regarding the potential for shareholder
gaming behavior, because it would be difficult for shareholders to determine when the
fund’s net purchases or net redemptions cross the swing threshold? If commenters
believe that the swing pricing framework contemplated by proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)
would raise significant concerns regarding the potential for shareholder gaming behavior,
how could these concerns best be alleviated?
d.

Periodic Review of a Fund’s Swing Threshold

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) would require a fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures
to include policies and procedures providing for the periodic review, no less frequently than

218

annually, of the fund’s swing threshold. 484 In conducting such review, a fund would be required
to consider the factors included in proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(B). 485 Any change to the fund’s
swing threshold, including those deemed appropriate as a result of this review would be deemed
to be a material change to the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures that must be
approved by the fund’s board. 486 Beyond specifying certain factors that a fund would be required
to consider in reviewing its swing threshold, proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) does not include
prescribed review procedures, nor does it specify the required risk review period or incorporate
specific developments that a fund should consider as part of its review. A fund may wish to
adopt procedures specifying that the swing threshold will be reviewed more frequently than
annually (i.e., semi-annually or monthly), and/or specifying any circumstances that would
prompt ad-hoc review of the fund’s swing threshold in addition to the periodic review required
by the proposed rule (as well as the process for conducting any ad-hoc reviews). Like a fund’s
liquidity risk review procedures, we believe that funds should generally consider procedures for
evaluating market-wide, and fund-specific developments affecting each of the proposed rule
22c-1(a)(3)(i)(B) factors in developing comprehensive procedures for reviewing a fund’s swing
threshold. 487

Request for Comment
We request comment on the process a fund would use to review its swing threshold.
•

Are there certain procedures that we should require, and/or on which we should provide
guidance, regarding a fund’s periodic review of its swing threshold? Should we expand
our guidance on the market-wide, and fund-specific developments that a fund’s swing
threshold review procedures should cover?

•

Do commenters agree that a fund that adopts swing pricing policies and procedures
should be required to review its swing threshold at least annually? Do commenters
anticipate that a fund that adopts swing pricing procedures would voluntarily choose to
review its swing threshold any more frequently than annually? Alternatively, should a
fund be required to review its swing threshold any more or less frequently than annually?
e.

Calculating the Swing Factor the Fund Will Use to Adjust its NAV

Under proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3), a fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures would
be required to provide that the fund must adjust its NAV by an amount designated as the “swing
factor” each time the fund’s net purchases or net redemptions have exceeded the fund’s swing
threshold. 488 A fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures would be required to specify how
the swing factor to be used to adjust the fund’s NAV will be determined. 489 As discussed in
more detail below, the swing factor would be the amount, expressed as a percentage of the fund’s
net asset value, that takes into account any near-term costs expected to be incurred by the fund as

488

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(A). Under the proposed rule, “swing factor” would be defined as “the amount,
expressed as a percentage of the fund’s net asset value and determined pursuant to the fund’s swing pricing
procedures, by which a fund adjusts its net asset value when the level of net purchases into or net
redemptions from the fund has exceeded the fund’s swing threshold.” Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(v)(B). We
request comment on this definition at the end of this section III.F.1.e.

489

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(D).

220

a result of net purchases or net redemptions that occur on the day the swing factor is used to
adjust the fund’s NAV. 490 It also must take into account information about the value of assets
purchased or sold by the fund to satisfy net purchases or net redemptions that occur on the day
the swing factor is used to adjust the fund’s NAV (if that information would not be reflected in
the current NAV of the fund computed on that day). 491
We anticipate that, because these considerations could vary depending on the facts and
circumstances, the swing factor that a fund would determine appropriate to use in adjusting its
NAV also could vary. We therefore believe that procedures for determining the swing factor
generally should detail how each of the factors a fund would be required to consider under the
proposed rule would assist the fund in calculating the swing factor. Below we provide examples
of methods that a fund may wish to consider employing in calculating the swing factor.
We are proposing rule 22c-1(a)(3) to provide funds with a tool to mitigate the potentially
dilutive effects of shareholder purchase and redemption activity, and the factors a fund would be
required to consider in determining its swing factor are meant to enhance a fund's ability to
estimate the costs associated with purchase and redemption activity that could dilute the value of
the existing shareholders’ interests in the fund. These costs include both market-related costs
(that is, market impact costs and spread costs 492) and transaction fees and charges associated with
the fund trading portfolio assets. 493 The proposed swing factor determination requirement

490

493

“Transaction fees and charges” would be defined in proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) to mean “brokerage
commissions, custody fees, and any other charges, fees, and taxes associated with portfolio asset purchases
and sales.” Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(v)(E). We request comment on the proposed definition of this term
at the end of this section III.F.1.e.

221

incorporates an assessment of multiple sources of potential dilution, in order to cause a fund to
take all relevant considerations into account when making this determination.
Specifically, proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(D)(1) would require a fund’s policies and
procedures for determining the swing factor to take into account any near-term costs that are
expected to be incurred as a result of net purchases or net redemptions that occur on the day the
swing factor is used to adjust the fund’s NAV, including any market impact costs, spread costs,
and transaction fees and charges arising from asset purchases or asset sales in connection with
those purchases or redemptions, as well as any borrowing-related costs associated with satisfying
those redemptions. 494 While a fund may be able to determine some of these costs with precision
(e.g., transaction fees and charges, and borrowing-related costs), we understand that other costs
may only be able to be estimated by the fund, and the swing factor therefore would represent an
estimate of the combined near-term costs associated with purchase or redemption activity. A
fund may wish to consider certain of the factors it would evaluate for purposes of classifying the
liquidity of its portfolio positions 495 in order to assess the costs associated with purchasing or
selling portfolio assets. For example, a fund could use a portfolio asset’s average daily trading
volume 496 in determining the portion of a particular portfolio holding that it could sell each day

494

The proposed costs that a fund would be required consider in determining its swing factor overlap
significantly with costs that we understand funds that use swing pricing in other jurisdictions commonly
consider when determining their swing factor. For example, the Luxembourg Swing Pricing Survey,
Reports & Guidelines provides that the following should be considered when determining the swing factor:
(i) the bid-offer spread of a fund’s underlying portfolio assets, (ii) net broker commissions paid by the fund,
(iii) custody transaction charges, (iv) fiscal charges (e.g., stamp duty and sales tax), (v) any initial charges
or exit fees applied to trades in underlying investment funds, and (vi) any swing factors or dilution amounts
or spreads applied to underlying investment funds or derivative instruments. See Luxembourg Swing
Pricing Survey, Reports & Guidelines, supra note 413, at 7, 15-16.

495

See supra section III.B.2.

496

See proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii)(B).

222

without market impact. Likewise, a fund could refer to bid-ask spreads for a particular asset 497
to estimate the purchase price that the fund would pay for that asset. Indications of decreasing
liquidity (for example, widening bid-ask spreads) would likely indicate increased market-related
costs associated with certain portfolio assets. We anticipate that the particular transaction fees
and charges that a fund would likely consider would include brokerage commissions and custody
fees, as well as other charges, fees, and taxes associated with portfolio asset purchases or sales
(for example, transfer taxes and repatriation costs for certain foreign securities, or transaction
fees associated with portfolio investments in other investment companies). If a fund were to
draw on a line of credit, or otherwise borrow money, in order to pay redemptions, this borrowing
activity could result in costs to the fund that, like the costs associated with purchasing and selling
portfolio assets, could dilute the value of the shares held by existing shareholders. 498 We are
therefore proposing to require that a fund consider these costs, along with the costs associated
with investing the proceeds from net purchases or assets sales to satisfy net redemptions, in
determining the swing factor.
The proposed rule specifies that the determination of a fund’s swing factor must take into
account the near-term costs expected to be incurred by the fund as a result of net purchases or
net redemptions that occur on the day the swing factor is used to adjust the fund’s NAV
(emphasis added). The phrase “near-term” is meant to reflect that investing proceeds from net
purchases or satisfying net redemptions could involve costs that may not be incurred by the fund
for several days. For example, a fund could use cash to satisfy redemptions, which may result in
minimal costs to the fund, but rebalancing the fund’s portfolio to rebuild cash balances in the

497

See proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii)(D).

498

See supra section III.C.5.a.

223

next several days could cause the fund to incur costs that would be borne by the existing
shareholders. The rule text specifies that the costs to be considered are those that are expected to
be incurred by the fund as a result of the net purchase or net redemption activity that occurred on
the day the swing factor is used to adjust the fund’s NAV; this specification is designed to help
ensure that the costs to be taken into account are those that are directly related to the purchases or
redemptions at issue. Thus, while the term “near-term costs” does not envision a precise number
of days, we believe that, in context, this term would not likely encompass costs that are
significantly removed in time from the purchases or redemptions at issue.
Under proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(D)(2), a fund’s policies and procedures for
determining the swing factor would be required to consider information about the value of assets
purchased or sold by the fund as a result of the net purchases or net redemptions that occur on
the day the swing factor is used to adjust the fund’s NAV, if that information would not be
reflected in the current NAV of the fund computed that day. This factor is meant to reflect the
fact that a fund’s NAV will generally not reflect changes in holdings of the fund’s portfolio
assets and changes in the number of the fund’s outstanding shares until the first business day
following the fund’s receipt of the shareholder’s purchase or redemption requests. 499 Thus, the
price that a shareholder receives for his or her purchase or sale of fund shares customarily does
not take into account market-related costs that arise when the fund trades portfolio assets in order
to meet shareholder purchases or redemptions. But these costs could dilute the value of fund
shares held by existing shareholders and thus should be considered in determining the fund’s
swing factor.

499

See supra note 412 and accompanying text.

224

A fund could take a variety of approaches to determining its swing factor, in light of the
fact that the relevant factors to be used in determining the swing factor could vary, as well as the
likelihood that the persons administering the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures may
(to the extent that net purchases or net redemptions cannot be ascertained or reasonably
estimated until close to the time that the fund must strike its NAV) have limited time to
determine the swing factor each day the fund’s net purchases or net redemptions exceed the
swing threshold. For example, a fund may wish to set a “base” swing factor, and adjust it as
appropriate if certain aspects required to be considered in determining the swing factor deviate
from a range of pre-determined norms (for example, if spread costs generally exceed a certain
pre-determined level). Alternatively or additionally, we request comment below on the extent to
which a fund that uses swing pricing may wish to incorporate into its policies and procedures a
formula or algorithm that includes the factors required to be considered for determining the
swing factor. We also understand that it may be difficult to determine certain costs (particularly,
certain market impact costs and spread costs) with precision, while other factors that a fund
would be required to consider in determining its swing factor may be able to be ascertained more
exactly (for example, transaction fees and charges, borrowing-related costs, and the value of
assets purchased or sold by the fund as a result of net purchases or net redemptions that occur on
the day the swing factor is used to adjust the fund’s NAV). For this reason, in establishing
policies and procedures for determining the swing factor, a fund may wish to incorporate the use
of reasonable estimates in these policies and procedures, to the extent the fund determines
necessary or appropriate. 500
500

We understand that funds that use swing pricing in other jurisdictions may use reasonable estimates, such
as those discussed in this paragraph, when determining their swing factor. See, e.g., Luxembourg Swing
Pricing Survey, Reports & Guidelines, supra note 413, at 15.

225

We are not proposing to require an upper limit on the swing factor that a fund would be
permitted to use, on account of the difficulty of establishing an appropriate across-the-board limit
that would permit funds with different investment strategies, under all market conditions, to
determine a swing factor that reflects the costs associated with the potential shareholder purchase
or redemption activity. These costs could vary widely across funds and under different market
conditions, and we do not wish to limit the extent to which swing pricing could mitigate the
dilution of existing shareholders. We believe that the lack of an upper limit on a fund’s swing
factor would not result in inappropriately high NAV adjustments, because the swing factor
would be required to be determined with reference to the factors discussed above, and the
policies and procedures for determining the swing factor would be required to be approved by
the fund’s board, which has an obligation to act in the interests of the fund. 501
We do recognize that if we were to require an upper limit on the amount that a fund
would be permitted to adjust its NAV, this could mitigate volatility, tracking error, and
transparency concerns that could arise from the use of swing pricing. 502 A required swing factor
limit would act as an upper bound on the extent to which a fund would be able to adjust its NAV
and the NAV volatility resulting from this adjustment. Also, capping the swing factor that a fund
would be permitted to use would provide transparency regarding the maximum amount that a
shareholder could expect the share price that he or she receives upon purchase or redemption to
be adjusted on account of swing pricing. However, as discussed above, we believe that the use
of partial swing pricing could significantly reduce the performance volatility potentially

502

See supra section III.F.1.a.

226

associated with swing pricing, 503 and that proposed disclosure and reporting requirements
regarding swing pricing will enhance transparency surrounding the use of swing pricing. 504
Although we are not proposing to require an upper limit on the swing factor that a fund
would be permitted to use, a fund would be permitted to adopt an upper limit on the swing factor
it would apply, as part of the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures. 505 We understand
that certain foreign domiciled funds that use swing pricing voluntarily limit the level of the
swing factor to be applied, with such limits generally ranging from 1% - 3%. 506 These funds
usually disclose the swing factor upper limit in the fund’s offering documents. 507 To the extent
that a fund chooses to adopt a swing factor upper limit as part of its swing pricing policies and
procedures, this limit would be required to be approved by the fund’s board (as part of the fund’s
swing pricing policies and procedures, which are subject to board approval). 508 Likewise, a
change to a fund’s swing factor upper limit would be deemed to be a material change to the
fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures that would require board approval. 509 As fund
directors have an obligation to act in the interests of the fund, 510 we expect that a fund board
approving a swing factor upper limit would generally determine that capping the swing factor
would not unduly limit the extent to which swing pricing could mitigate the potentially dilutive
effects of shareholder purchase and redemption activity. Also, because the upper limit would

affect the swing factor a fund would use to adjust its NAV when net purchases or net
redemptions exceed the fund’s swing threshold, the determination of the upper limit must take
into account the same factors the fund would be required to consider in determining the swing
factor. 511
We request comment below on whether to require an upper limit on the swing factor that
a fund would be permitted to use, and if so, the appropriate level of such limit. We also request
comment on whether a fund should be permitted to adopt an upper limit on the swing factor it
would apply, as part of the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures.
Request for Comment
We request comment on the definition of “swing factor” set forth in proposed rule
22c-1(a)(3) and the process a fund would use to calculate the swing factor that the fund would
use to adjust its NAV.
•

Is the definition of “swing factor,” as set forth in proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) appropriate
and clear? If not, how could this definition be clarified or made more effective within the
context of the proposed rule?

•

We request comment on each of the considerations that a fund would be required to take
into account in determining the swing factor, pursuant to proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(D).
Would these considerations reflect the estimated or actual costs associated with
purchasing or selling portfolio assets in order to meet purchases or redemptions of fund
shares? Should any aspect of proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(D) not be required to be
considered by a fund in calculating the swing factor? Should any of the considerations be
modified, and is the definition of “transaction fees and charges,” as set forth in the

511

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(D).

228

proposed rule, appropriate and clear? Instead of codifying certain considerations that a
fund must take into account in determining the swing factor, should we instead provide
guidance on factors a fund may wish to consider in calculating the swing factor? Instead
of using a swing factor to adjust a fund’s NAV, is there an alternate means by which a
fund should be permitted to adjust its NAV to mitigate potential dilution stemming from
purchase or redemption activity (e.g., pricing its assets on the basis of bid prices, as
opposed to pricing using the mean of bid and asked prices)?
•

We request comment on the approaches commenters believe a fund may take to
determine its swing factor. For example, do commenters anticipate that a fund would set
a “base” swing factor, and adjust it as appropriate if certain elements required to be
considered in the swing factor deviate from a range of pre-determined norms? Do
commenters believe that it would be feasible and likely that a fund may wish to use a
formula or algorithm approach for determining the swing factor? What other approaches
to determining the swing factor do commenters anticipate that a fund would be likely to
take?

•

Do commenters agree that the Commission should not require an upper limit on the
swing factor that a fund would be permitted to use? Why or why not? If not, what upper
limit would be appropriate (e.g., 2%, or some other limit), and why? Should we specify
different limits for different types of funds or investment strategies?

•

Do commenters agree that a fund should be permitted to adopt an upper limit on the
swing factor it would apply, as part of the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures?
Why or why not? To the extent that a fund does adopt an upper limit on the swing factor
it would apply, should the fund be required to disclose this upper limit to shareholders?

229

Should each fund that adopts swing pricing policies and procedures be required, not only
permitted, to adopt an upper limit on the swing factor it would apply?
f.

Approval and Oversight of Swing Pricing Policies and Procedures

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(ii)(A) would require a fund that has determined to engage in
the use of swing pricing to obtain initial approval of its swing pricing policies and procedures
(including the fund’s swing threshold and any swing factor upper limit specified under the fund’s
swing pricing policies and procedures) from the fund’s board, including a majority of
independent directors. The proposed rule also would require a fund’s board, including a majority
of independent directors, to approve any material change to the fund’s swing pricing policies and
procedures (including any change to the fund’s swing threshold, a change to any swing factor
upper limit, or any decision to suspend or terminate the fund’s swing pricing policies and
procedures). 512 However, a fund’s board would not be required to manage the administration of
the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures. The proposed rule instead provides that a
fund’s board is required to designate the fund’s investment adviser or officers responsible for
administering the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures and determining the swing factor
that would be used to adjust the fund’s NAV when the fund’s swing threshold is breached. 513
This proposed designation requirement tasks administration for the fund’s swing pricing policies
and procedures to persons who we believe would be in a better position to evaluate fund flows
on a real-time basis than the fund’s board.
The proposed oversight requirements for a fund’s board and its independent directors
reflect the historical role that a fund’s board and independent directors have held with respect to

512

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(ii)(A).

513

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(ii)(B).

issues involving valuation. A fund’s board historically has held significant responsibility
regarding valuation- and pricing-related matters, 514 as well as in approving valuation and
compliance-related policies and procedures. 515 Additionally, in the past we have stated that a
fund’s compliance policies and procedures, which must be approved by the fund’s board
(including a majority of independent directors), should include procedures for the pricing of
portfolio securities and fund shares. 516
We believe that the proposed board and independent director approval requirements
would help ensure that a fund establishes and implements swing pricing policies and procedures
that are in the best interests of all the fund’s shareholders. Because fund directors have an
obligation to act in the interests of the fund, 517 a board approving swing pricing policies and
procedures might do so under the premise that such policies and procedures would not unduly
disadvantage any particular group of shareholders, and that any disadvantages that could affect
certain shareholders would generally be outweighed by the benefits to the fund as a whole.
Furthermore, the proposed approval requirements would serve to assure shareholders that the
514

See, e.g., section 2(a)(41)(B) of the Investment Company Act and rule 2a-4 thereunder (when market
quotations are not readily available for a fund’s portfolio securities, the Investment Company Act requires
the fund’s board of directors to determine, in good faith, the fair value of the securities); rule 2a-7(c)(1)(i)
and rule 2a-7(g)(1)(i)(A)-(C) (a stable NAV money market fund that qualifies as a retail or government
money market fund may use the amortized cost method of valuation to compute the current share price
provided, among other things, the board of directors believes that the amortized cost method of valuation
fairly reflects the market-based NAV and does not believe that such valuation may result in material
dilution or other unfair results to investors or existing shareholders).

515

See, e.g., ASR 118, supra note 423 (a board, consistent with its responsibility to determine the fair value of
each issue of restricted securities in good faith, determines the method of valuing each issue of restricted
securities in the company’s portfolio and the actual valuation calculations may be made by persons acting
pursuant to the board’s direction; the board must continuously review the appropriateness of the method
used in valuing each issue of security in the company’s portfolio); Rule 38a-1 Adopting Release, supra
note 90, at text accompanying n.46 (stating that rule 38a-1 requires fund directors to approve written
compliance policies and procedures that require each fund to “provide a methodology or methodologies by
which the fund determines the fair value of the portfolio security”).

516

See Rule 38a-1 Adopting Release, supra note 90, at nn.39-47 and accompanying text.

517

See, e.g., Role of Independent Directors of Investment Companies, Investment Company Act Release No.

231

same level of net purchase or net redemption activity would consistently trigger the use of swing
pricing, unless the fund’s board and a majority of the fund’s independent directors were to
approve a change in the fund’s swing threshold.
We believe that shareholders’ interests would be best served by requiring the majority of
a fund’s independent directors, along with the fund’s board, to approve the fund’s swing pricing
policies and procedures. As we have stated before, a fund’s independent directors serve to guard
investors’ interests. 518 The decision to implement swing pricing, and determining the terms of
swing pricing policies and procedures to be adopted by a fund, could occasionally produce
conflicts for the fund and its adviser, and we believe that the proposed independent director
approval requirement would help ensure that a fund’s use of swing pricing would operate to the
benefit of the fund’s shareholders (even if this may not be in the best interest of the fund’s
adviser). For example, a fund’s adviser could be reluctant to implement swing pricing to the
extent it may make the fund’s performance stray too far from, or appear more volatile than, the
fund’s benchmark, which could impact the ability of the fund to attract new investments.
Approval of swing pricing policies and procedures by a majority of a fund’s independent
directors could make certain that the fund would use swing pricing in circumstances in which the
board has determined swing pricing would serve shareholders’ best interests, even if these
interests may conflict with the adviser’s.
While a fund’s board would be required to approve the fund’s swing pricing policies and
procedures, the board would be required to designate the fund’s adviser or officers responsible
for the administration of these policies and procedures, including responsibility for determining a
swing factor that would be used to adjust the fund’s NAV when the fund’s swing threshold is
518

232

breached. 519 It is currently common industry practice for foreign domiciled funds that use swing
pricing to appoint a committee to administer the fund’s swing pricing operations. 520 A fund’s
board may wish to consider requiring the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures to be
administered by a committee, and to specify the officers or functional areas that comprise the
committee (taking into account any possible conflicts for the fund and the adviser related to
swing pricing). The persons or committee tasked with swing pricing oversight may wish to meet
periodically to determine the swing factor(s) the fund would use in a variety of circumstances,
taking into account the factors and considerations discussed above in section III.F.1.e. A fund
may wish to consider delineating the frequency with which these persons would meet in its
policies and procedures; for example, a fund’s policies and procedures might specify that these
persons shall meet periodically, such as monthly or quarterly, or more frequently if market
conditions require. 521 Because a fund may decide to adopt swing pricing policies and procedures
as part of its liquidity risk management program, the fund’s board may wish to provide that the
persons (or functional areas) in charge of implementing these policies and procedures overlap
with the persons (or functional areas) in charge of administering the liquidity risk management
program.
Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) would require the determination of the swing factor to be
reasonably segregated from the portfolio management function of the fund. For example, if a

committee were tasked with determining the swing factor(s) the fund would use in a variety of
circumstances, we believe it would be appropriate for the fund’s portfolio manager to provide
inputs to be used by that committee in determining the swing factor, but not to decide how those
inputs would be employed in the swing factor determination. We believe that, in determining the
swing factor, independence from portfolio management is important because the incentives of
portfolio managers may not always be consistent with determining a swing factor that most
effectively prevents dilution of existing shareholders’ interests in the fund. For example, a
fund’s portfolio manager could have an incentive to determine a swing factor that is as low as
possible, because the portfolio manager could be reluctant for the fund’s short-term performance
to appear relatively poor compared to other funds and the fund’s benchmark. 522
A fund’s board would not be required to approve each swing factor that would be used to
adjust the fund’s NAV when the fund’s swing threshold is breached, although the board would
be required to approve the policies and procedures for determining the swing threshold. This
approval framework—along with the proposed segregation of the swing factor determination
from the portfolio management function—is meant to strike a balance between ensuring
appropriate board oversight over the policies and procedures for determining the swing factor,
and independence with respect to the swing factor determination process, while recognizing that
it may not be practicable for a fund’s directors to be directly involved in the process of
determining each swing factor. Because the persons administering the fund’s swing pricing
policies and procedures may have limited time to determine each swing factor to the extent that
net purchases or net redemptions cannot be ascertained or reasonably estimated until close to the
time that the fund must strike its NAV, we do not believe that it would generally be operationally
522

See supra note 446 and accompanying text; infra section III.F.2.b.

234

feasible for a fund’s board to approve each swing factor. Also, we do not believe that requiring a
fund’s board to approve each swing factor would be consistent with boards’ historical oversight
role.
Request for Comment
We seek comment on the proposed approval and oversight requirements associated with a
fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures.
•

Do commenters agree that a fund’s board, including a majority of the fund’s independent
directors, should be required to approve the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures
(including the fund’s swing threshold, and any swing factor upper limit specified under
the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures), and any material changes thereto?
Would these approval requirements ensure that a fund establishes and implements swing
pricing policies and procedures that are in the interests of all of the fund’s shareholders?
Do commenters agree that the proposed independent director approval requirement would
ensure that a fund’s use of swing pricing benefits the fund’s shareholders? Should the
board be provided the option to not use swing pricing in a particular situation when swing
pricing would have been warranted pursuant to a fund’s swing pricing policies and
procedures?

•

Do commenters agree that it would be appropriate to require a fund’s board to designate
the fund’s adviser or officers responsible for the administration of swing pricing policies
and procedures, including responsibility for determining a swing factor that would be
used to adjust the fund’s NAV when the fund’s swing threshold is breached? Do
commenters agree that the determination of the swing factor should be reasonably
segregated from the portfolio management of the fund? Would this pose any difficulty

235

for particular types of entities, for example funds managed by small advisers? Is there a
better way to prevent conflicts between the portfolio manager’s incentives and the
process of determining a swing factor that most effectively prevents dilution of existing
shareholders’ interests in the fund? What officers (or functional areas) of a fund do
commenters anticipate a fund’s board would select to administer the fund’s swing pricing
policies and procedures, and do commenters anticipate that these persons (or functional
areas) would overlap with the administrators of a fund’s liquidity risk management
program?
•

Do commenters agree that a fund’s board should not be required to approve each swing
factor that would be used to adjust the fund’s NAV when the fund’s swing threshold is
breached, although the board would be required to approve the policies and procedures
for determining the swing threshold? Why or why not?

•

Should the Commission provide guidance as to the circumstances in which a possible
misapplication of a firm’s swing pricing policy could result in a material NAV error? For
example, should the Commission explain whether an error would occur when the fund
makes estimates under its swing pricing policy that is applied correctly, but the
information, such as final shareholder flows, subsequently changes to a material degree?
Should funds be required to have specific policies and procedures to address possible
NAV errors?
g.

Recordkeeping Requirements

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) would require a fund to maintain a written copy of swing
pricing policies and procedures adopted by the fund that are in effect, or at any time within the

236

past six years were in effect, in an easily accessible place. 523 Additionally, we are proposing to
expand current rule 31a-2(a)(2), which requires a fund to keep records evidencing and supporting
each computation of the fund’s NAV, 524 to reflect the NAV adjustments based on a fund’s swing
pricing policies and procedures. Specifically, a fund that adopts swing pricing policies and
procedures would be required to preserve records evidencing and supporting each computation
of an adjustment to the fund’s NAV based on the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures. 525
For each NAV adjustment, such records should generally include, at a minimum, the fund’s
unswung NAV, the level of net purchases or net redemptions that the fund encountered (or
estimated) that triggered the application of swing pricing, the swing factor that was used to adjust
the fund’s NAV, and relevant data supporting the calculation of the swing factor. The records
required under the proposed amendments to rule 31a-2(a)(2) would be required to be preserved
for at least six years from the date that the NAV adjustment occurred, the first two years in an
easily accessible place. 526 The proposed six-year period for a fund to maintain a copy of its
swing pricing policies and procedures in proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) corresponds with the six-year
recordkeeping period currently incorporated in rule 31a-2(a)(2). We believe that consistency in
these retention periods is appropriate in order to permit a fund or Commission staff to review
historical instances of NAV adjustments effected pursuant to the fund’s swing pricing policies
and procedures in light of the policies and procedures that were actually in place at the time the
NAV adjustments occurred.
523

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(iii).

524

See rule 31a-2(a)(2) (every registered investment company shall . . . “[p]reserve for a period not less than
six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any transactions occurred, the first two years in an easily
accessible place . . . all schedules evidencing and supporting each computation of net asset value of the
investment company shares”).

237

These proposed recordkeeping requirements would help our examination staff to
ascertain whether a fund that has adopted swing pricing policies and procedures has done so in
compliance with the requirements of proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3). They also would help our staff
to determine whether a fund is taking into account the factors required to be considered under
proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(D) in calculating the swing factor.

We seek comment on the proposed recordkeeping requirements associated with a fund’s
swing pricing policies and procedures.

Do commenters agree that the proposed recordkeeping requirements are appropriate?
Are there any additional records associated with a fund’s swing pricing policies and

to specifically require a fund to keep records evidencing the fund’s consideration of each
of the factors required to be considered in determining each swing factor used to adjust
the fund’s NAV? Do commenters agree that the six-year record retention period in
proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) and the proposed amendments to rule 31a-2(a)(2) is
appropriate?

Guidance on Operational Considerations Relating to Swing Pricing
a.

Operational Processes Associated with Swing Pricing

Swing pricing requires the net cash flows for a fund to be known, or estimated using
information obtained after reasonable inquiry, 527 before determining whether to adjust the fund’s
NAV on any particular day (and, if the fund’s swing factor varies depending on its net flows, to
527

See proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(A) (permitting the person(s) responsible for administering the fund’s
swing pricing policies and procedures to use “information obtained after reasonable inquiry” in determining
whether the fund’s level of net purchases or net redemptions has exceeded the fund’s swing threshold).

238

determine the swing factor that the fund will use to adjust its NAV). A fund using swing pricing
would need to monitor shareholder trades or flows of money in and out of the fund for purposes
of determining whether the fund’s net purchases or net redemptions would give rise to an NAV
adjustment under its swing pricing policies and procedures. 528 Because the deadline by which a
fund must strike its NAV may precede the time that a fund receives final information concerning
daily net flows from the fund’s transfer agent, a fund may wish to arrange for interim feeds of
flows from its transfer agent or distributor in order to reasonably estimate its daily net flows for
swing pricing purposes. A fund also may wish to implement formal or informal policies to
encourage effective communication channels between the persons charged with implementing
the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures, the fund’s investment professionals, and
personnel charged with day-to-day pricing responsibility (to the extent different persons
comprise each of these groups).
In addition, there are unique operational considerations applicable to funds with multiple
share classes. A fund with multiple share classes that uses swing pricing should consider the net
purchase or net redemption activity of all share classes in determining whether its swing
threshold has been breached. 529 Like a fund with only one share class, the purchase or
redemption activity of certain shareholders (or a class of shareholders) within a multi-share-class
fund could dilute the value of the existing shareholders’ (or class of shareholders’) interests in
the fund.

528

We have previously stated that a fund should adopt compliance policies and procedures that provide for
monitoring shareholder trades or flows of money in and out of the fund for purposes of detecting market
timing activity. See Rule 38a-1 Adopting Release, supra note 90, at nn.66-69 and accompanying text.

529

See Luxembourg Swing Pricing Survey, Reports & Guidelines, supra note 413, at 21 (discussing swing
pricing considerations relevant to funds with multiple share classes).

239

b.

Performance Reporting and Calculation of NAV-Based Performance Fees

For purposes of calculating the financial highlights and performance data to be included
in a fund’s prospectus and shareholder reports, 530 a fund using swing pricing should consider its
NAV at the beginning and end of a reporting period, as well as its “ending redeemable value” on
a particular day, to be its NAV as adjusted pursuant to its swing pricing policies and procedures
(as applicable). Because a fund using swing pricing to adjust its NAV would, under certain
circumstances, use the adjusted NAV as the price that shareholders receive for the purchase or
redemption of shares, the adjusted NAV is the “net asset value calculated on the last business
day before the first day of each [performance] period” and the “price calculated on the last
business day of each [performance] period,” as referenced in the instructions to Item 13
(“Financial Highlights Information”) of Form N-1A. For the same reason, the adjusted NAV is
the “ending redeemable value” of the fund’s shares, as referenced in Item 26 (“Calculation of
Performance Data”) of Form N-1A. Likewise, because rule 482 under the Securities Act
references Form N-1A with respect to performance data, 531 a fund using swing pricing also
should use its adjusted NAV when calculating the standardized performance data to be included
in the fund’s advertising materials.

530

See Items 13, 26 of Form N-1A.

531

Rule 482(d), 17 CFR 230.482.

240

If a fund using swing pricing pays NAV-based performance fees to its adviser, 532 the
fund’s NAV for purposes of calculating performance fees should be the NAV as adjusted
pursuant to its swing pricing policies and procedures (as applicable). As discussed above, a
fund’s NAV used for performance reporting purposes would be the NAV as adjusted pursuant to
swing pricing policies and procedures. We believe that the reported NAV and the NAV used for
calculating performance fees (to the extent used) should be consistent in order to promote
transparency regarding any performance fees paid to the fund’s adviser, and to reflect the fact
that the fund’s performance likely has been affected by the transaction costs associated with
shareholders’ purchases and redemptions.
c.

Fund Merger Considerations

When funds merge, and at least one of the merging funds uses swing pricing, there are a
number of considerations relating to swing pricing that the funds generally should consider when
determining the terms of the merger. 533 The boards of merging funds should consider whether a
swing factor should be used to adjust the value of the absorbed fund’s assets, if the absorbing
532

Section 205(a)(1) of the Investment Advisers Act generally restricts an investment adviser from entering
into, extending, renewing, or performing an investment advisory contract that provides for compensation to
the adviser based on a share of capital gains on, or capital appreciation of, the funds of a client.
However, there are certain exemptions to this general restriction. See section 205(b)(2) of the Investment
Advisers Act (providing that the section 205(a)(1) restriction does not apply to an investment adviser
charging performance fees to a registered investment company if the fee is structured to comply with four
requirements: (i) the fee is based on the investment company’s NAV; (ii) the NAV is averaged over a
“specified period”; (iii) the fee increases or decreases proportionately with the investment company’s
“investment performance” over the specified period; and (iv) the investment company’s investment
performance relates to the “investment record” of an “appropriate index” of securities prices or another
measure of investment performance as specified by the Commission by rule, regulation, or order); see also
rule 205-3 under the Investment Advisers Act 17 CFR 275.205-3 (providing an exemption to the section
205(a)(1) restriction and permitting an investment adviser to charge performance fees if the adviser’s client
is a “qualified client” as defined in rule 205-3(d)(1) (generally, a client having at least $1 million under
management with the adviser immediately after entering into an advisory contract with the adviser, or a
client the adviser reasonably believed had a net worth of more than $2 million at the time the contract was
entered into)).

533

See Luxembourg Swing Pricing Survey, Reports & Guidelines, supra note 413, at 18-19 (discussing swing
pricing considerations relevant to fund mergers).

241

fund uses swing pricing and it is applied on the day of the merger. 534 Although the manager of
the absorbing fund may need to sell certain of the assets of the absorbed fund following the
merger (e.g., for consistency with the absorbing fund’s investment strategy, or to comply with
certain regulatory requirements 535), we do not believe that the NAV of either the absorbing fund
or the absorbed fund should be adjusted to counter any dilution resulting from these sales,
because costs associated with these sales would result from the merger and would not be caused
by shareholders’ purchase or redemption activity. In light of potential complications arising
when funds using swing pricing merge, the boards of merging funds should consider whether to
temporarily suspend a fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures ahead of the merger. 536
Under proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3), such suspension would be considered a material change to the
fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures and thus could be accomplished only by vote of the
fund’s board, including a majority of the fund’s independent directors. 537 In any event, the swing
threshold of the absorbing fund should be reviewed following a merger. Likewise, the persons in
charge of administering the absorbing fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures should
consider the effects of the merger when considering what swing factor would be appropriate to
use if the fund’s swing threshold is breached following the merger.

534

Directors overseeing fund mergers must take into account rule 17a-8 under the Investment Company Act
(which sets forth requirements for mergers of affiliated investment companies), if applicable, as well as any
relevant state law requirements. Rule 17a-8 requires a board, including a majority of the independent
directors, to consider the relevant facts and circumstances with respect to a merger of affiliated funds and
determine that the merger is in the best interests of each of the merging funds and that the interests of the
shareholders of both the fund being acquired and the acquiring fund are not being diluted. We expect
swing pricing considerations could be relevant to this determination.
See Luxembourg Swing Pricing Survey, Reports & Guidelines, supra note 413, at 18-19 (discussing issues
associated with the use of swing pricing to adjust the value of the absorbed fund’s assets).

Request for Comment

We seek comment on the Commission’s guidance discussed above regarding certain
operational and accounting considerations relating to swing pricing. Do commenters generally
agree with the Commission’s guidance in this section III.F.2?
Along with this general request for comment on the Commission’s guidance, we request
specific comment on a number of individual guidance items.
•

To what extent is it currently typical for a fund to receive interim feeds of flows from its
transfer agent or distributor, and do these interim feeds generally permit a fund to
reasonably estimate its net flows at the end of a business day? To what extent do
financial intermediaries or other third parties provide interim feeds of flows?

•

Should the Commission amend the proposed rule or provide guidance regarding pricing
errors in the context of swing pricing? How do commenters anticipate that a fund using
swing pricing may wish to update its pricing policies to provide clarity as to the
application of swing pricing to the fund’s policies concerning pricing errors? What
policies do commenters anticipate that a fund’s pricing policies could incorporate with
respect to circumstances in which the fund’s NAV was swung (or not swung) based on an
estimate of net purchases or net redemptions that was later determined to be incorrect, but
was based on information obtained after reasonable inquiry pursuant to proposed rule
22c-1(a)(3)(i)(A)?

•

Do commenters agree that it is appropriate to require that a fund calculate performance
fees based on the fund’s NAV as adjusted pursuant to the fund’s swing pricing policies
and procedures (as applicable)? Why or why not? We specifically request comment on
whether calculating a performance fee based on a fund’s adjusted NAV could be viewed

243

as inappropriately increasing or decreasing the fee (e.g., depending on whether the NAV
was adjusted at the beginning or end of a measurement period).
•

Besides the issues discussed in this section, what specific operational challenges do funds
anticipate associated with swing pricing? Do commenters anticipate there would be
circumstances in which a fund’s structure (e.g., a fund with multiple share classes, as
discussed in section III.F.2.a) would cause swing pricing to be particularly complex to
implement?

•

With respect to a fund with multiple share classes that uses swing pricing, do commenters
agree that the fund should consider the net purchase or net redemption activity of all
share classes in determining whether its swing threshold has been breached? Or should a
fund instead be permitted to consider the net purchase or redemption activity of each
share class separately (which potentially could lead to NAV adjustments for certain share
classes and not others, or different NAV adjustments for each share class, on the same
day)? If so, should we amend rule 18f-3 to expressly allow this? What operational or
other difficulties could result from permitting a fund with multiple share classes that uses
swing pricing to consider the net purchase or redemption activity of each share class
separately, and to potentially make different NAV adjustments for each share class on the
same day?

•

Besides the issues discussed in this section, are there any other operational issues
associated with swing pricing about which we should provide guidance?
3.

Master-Feeder Funds

With respect to master-feeder funds, we believe the use of swing pricing would generally
be appropriate only with respect to the level (or levels) of the fund structure that actually transact

244

in underlying portfolio assets as a result of net purchase or redemption activity. 538 For example,
if shareholders of a feeder fund were to redeem feeder fund shares, the feeder fund would
redeem from the master fund (and not sell portfolio assets) in order to pay redeeming
shareholders. Likewise, if investors were to purchase shares of a feeder fund, the feeder fund
would invest in the master fund with cash received from the feeder fund purchasing
shareholders, and the master fund would invest this cash in portfolio assets. Thus, a feeder fund
would not be permitted to use swing pricing under the proposed rule. 539 The master fund, on the
other hand, would potentially need to purchase portfolio assets in order to invest purchasing
shareholders’ cash (as transferred through the feeder fund), or sell portfolio assets in order to pay
redemption proceeds in exchange for feeder fund shares. Thus, to the extent that net purchases
into or redemptions from the master fund (by one or more feeder funds, or any other investors in
the master fund) exceed the fund’s swing threshold, the swing factor should thus be applied to
the master fund’s NAV. 540 In this example, because the feeder fund invests in the master fund,
the master fund’s adjusted NAV would indirectly affect the NAV of the feeder fund.
Request for Comment
We seek comment on the application of swing pricing to master-feeder funds. Do
commenters generally agree that feeder funds should not be permitted to use swing pricing?
Why or why not?

Financial Statement Disclosure Regarding Swing Pricing

The application of swing pricing would impact a fund’s financial statements and
disclosures in a number of areas, including a fund’s statement of assets and liabilities, statement
of changes in net assets, financial highlights and the notes to the financial statements. Currently,
funds are required by Regulation S-X rule 6-04.19 541 to state the NAV on the statement of assets
and liabilities. Similar to “ending redeemable value” discussed in performance reporting in
section III.F.2.b above, for purposes of reporting the NAV in a fund’s statement of assets and
liabilities, a fund using swing pricing should consider its “purchase price” or “redemption price”
on a particular day to be its NAV as adjusted pursuant to its swing pricing policies and
procedures. We believe that disclosure of this price is important, as it allows investors to
understand the value they would receive had they purchased or redeemed shares on the financial
reporting period end date. Different from redemption fees, which may be charged to specific
shareholders based on the length of time that the shareholder has owned shares of the fund, all
shareholders in a fund would receive the NAV as adjusted pursuant to its swing pricing policies
and procedures. As all shareholders would receive the NAV as adjusted pursuant to the fund’s
swing pricing policies and procedures, we are proposing to amend Regulation S-X rule 6-04.19
to require funds to disclose the NAV as adjusted pursuant to its swing pricing policies and
procedures (if applicable). 542
Swing pricing also would impact disclosures of capital share transactions included in a
fund’s statement of changes in net assets. A fund using swing pricing to adjust its NAV would

541

See 17 CFR 210.6-04.19.

542

See proposed amendments to 210.6-04.19. We also propose amending Regulation S-X rule 6-02 to add a
definition of swing pricing. Swing pricing would be defined as having the meaning given in proposed rule
22c-1(a)(3)(v)(C). See proposed 210.6-02(g).

246

make payments for shares redeemed and receive payments for shares purchased net of the swing
pricing adjustment. For example, if a fund had an unadjusted NAV of $10.00 on a given day and
the adjusted NAV pursuant to the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures was $9.90,
shareholders would transact at $9.90 multiplied by the number of shares purchased or redeemed.
The $0.10 difference between the adjusted and unadjusted NAV would be retained by the fund to
offset transaction and liquidity costs. This $0.10 difference per share should be accounted for as
a capital transaction and not included as income to the fund, because it is designed to reflect the
near-term transactional and liquidity costs incurred as a result of satisfying shareholder
transactions. Funds are required by Regulation S-X rule 6-09.4(b) to disclose the number of
shares and dollar amounts received for shares sold and paid for shares redeemed. 543 In this
example, Regulation S-X would require the dollar amount disclosed to be based on the $9.90 per
share that was actually used for shareholder transactions.
Consistent with presentation of the impact of swing pricing on the statement of changes
in net assets and performance reporting described in section III.F.2.b, a fund should include the
impact of swing pricing in its financial highlights. 544 The per share impact of amounts retained
by the fund due to swing pricing should be included in the fund’s disclosures of per share
operating performance. 545 Accordingly, we are proposing to amend Item 13 of Form N-1A to
specifically require the per share impact of amounts related to swing pricing to be disclosed
below the total distributions line in a fund’s financial highlights. In order to properly reconcile
with the adjusted NAV reported on the statement of assets and liabilities, we also are proposing
543

See 17 CFR 210.6-09.4(b).

544

See Item 13 of Form N-1A.

545

ASC 946-205-50-7 requires specific per share information to be presented in the financial highlights for
registered investment companies, including disclosure of the per share amount of purchase premiums,
redemption fees, or other capital items.

247

to clarify that “Net Asset Value, Beginning of Period” and “Net Asset Value, End of Period” are
each the NAV as adjusted pursuant to the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures, if
applicable.
Similarly, a fund’s calculation of total return should use the NAV as adjusted pursuant to
a fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures as the redemption price calculated on the last
business day of the period. We are proposing to amend Instructions 3(a) and 3(d) to Item 13 of
Form N-1A to explicitly require funds to assume the NAV calculated on the last business day
before the first day of each period and the price calculated on the last business day of each period
shown should each be adjusted for the impact of swing pricing, if applicable. We believe that it
is important for investors to understand the impact of swing pricing on the return that they would
have received for the period presented in the fund’s financial statements. We also are proposing
to amend instructions to Item 26 regarding calculation of performance data to clarify that
“ending redeemable value” should assume a value adjusted pursuant to swing pricing policies
and procedures.
Finally, we are proposing to require funds that adopted swing pricing policies and
procedures to state in a note to their financial statements the general methods used in
determining whether the fund’s net asset value per share will swing, whether the fund’s net asset
value per share has swung during the year, and a general description of the effects of swing
pricing on the fund’s financial statements. 546 We believe this information would be useful in
further understanding the impact of swing pricing on a fund.

Request for Comment
We seek comment on the financial statement disclosure considerations relating to swing
pricing. Do commenters generally agree with the Commission’s guidance discussed above
regarding financial statement disclosure, as well as the proposed amendments to Regulation
S-X?
Along with this general request for comment, we request specific comment on a number
of individual issues discussed above.
•

Should the Commission allow a fund to disclose the total return calculation on an
unadjusted NAV basis as a supplement to the total return calculation in the financial
highlights table, and/or in a fund’s advertising materials?

•

Should the dollar amount of purchases and redemptions disclosed in a fund’s financial
statements be presented based on unadjusted NAV, with the dollar amount retained by
the fund because of swing pricing separately disclosed? Alternatively, should the dollar
amount of purchases and redemptions be presented as the actual value received by the
fund or paid to shareholders, which would include the impact of swing pricing? Why or
why not?

•

Should funds be required to disclose only the NAV as adjusted pursuant to a fund’s
swing pricing policies and procedures on the statement of assets and liabilities?
Alternatively, should funds be required to disclose both unadjusted NAV and the NAV as
adjusted pursuant to a fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures on the statement of
assets and liabilities?

•

Should we require additional disclosures in notes to fund financial statements regarding
swing pricing? If so, what additional information should be disclosed? Do commenters

249

believe that any of the proposed disclosures should be modified? Are any of the
proposed disclosures unnecessary? Why or why not?
•

Do commenters have any accounting or auditing concerns in connection with swing
pricing? If so, please describe specific concerns.
G.

Disclosure and Reporting Requirements Regarding Liquidity Risk and
Liquidity Risk Management

Investors receiving relevant information about the operations of a fund and the principal
risks associated with an investment in a particular fund are important in facilitating investor
choice regarding the appropriate investments for their risk tolerances. Investors in open-end
funds generally expect funds to pay redemption proceeds promptly following their redemption
requests based, in part, on representations made by funds in their disclosure documents.
Accordingly, information about how redemptions will be made and when investors will receive
payment is significant to investors. Currently, funds are not expressly required to disclose how
they manage the liquidity of their assets, and therefore limited information is available regarding
whether the liquidity of a fund’s portfolio securities corresponds with its liquidity needs related
to redemption obligations. In addition to the proposed amendments to Form N-1A and
Regulation S-X discussed above regarding financial reporting related to swing pricing, we are
proposing amendments to Form N-1A, Regulation S-X, proposed Form N-PORT and proposed
Form N-CEN to improve the ability of investors, the Commission staff, and other potential users
to analyze and better understand a fund’s redemption practices, its management of liquidity risks,
and how liquidity risk management can affect shareholder redemptions. We are also proposing
amendments to Form N-1A regarding disclosure of swing pricing.

250

1.

Proposed Amendments to Form N-1A
a.

Redemption of Fund Shares

Form N-1A is used by funds to register under the Investment Company Act and to
register offerings of their securities under the Securities Act. In particular, Form N-1A requires
funds to describe their procedures for redeeming fund shares, including restrictions on
redemptions and any redemption charges. 547 Disclosure regarding other important redemption
information, such as the timing of payment of redemption proceeds to fund shareholders, varies
across funds as today there are no specific requirements for this disclosure under the form. Some
funds disclose that they will redeem shares within a specific number of days after receiving a
redemption request, other funds disclose that they will honor such requests within seven days (as
required by section 22(e) of the Act), and others provide no specific time periods. Some funds
disclose differences in the timing of payment of redemption proceeds based on the distribution
channel through which the fund shares are redeemed, while others do not.
We believe that requiring consistency in disclosures and increasing the level of
information provided among funds regarding the timing of payment after shareholder redemption
of fund shares would give investors fuller information about their investments. Improvements
are needed to enhance the ability of investors to evaluate and compare redemption policies across
funds and to understand when a fund will actually pay redemption proceeds. Accordingly, we
are proposing amendments to Item 11 of Form N-1A that would require a fund to disclose the
number of days in which the fund will pay redemption proceeds to redeeming shareholders. 548
If the number of days in which the fund will pay redemption proceeds differs by distribution

547

See Item 11(c) of Form N-1A.

548

See proposed Item 11(c)(7) of Form N-1A.

251

channel, the fund also would be required to disclose the number of days for each distribution
channel. 549
We also are proposing amendments to Item 11 of Form N-1A that would require a fund
to disclose the methods that the fund uses to meet redemption requests. 550 Under this
requirement funds would have to disclose whether they use the methods regularly to meet
redemptions or only in stressed market conditions. Methods to meet redemption requests may
include, for example, sales of portfolio assets, holdings of cash or cash equivalents, lines of
credit, interfund lending, and ability to make in-kind redemptions. To address transaction costs
associated with shareholder activity, funds also may use redemption fees. 551
Currently, Item 11(c)(3) of Form N-1A requires funds to disclose whether they reserve
the right to redeem their shares in kind instead of in cash. 552 We propose to incorporate this
disclosure requirement into proposed Item 11(c)(8) discussed above. We understand that the use
of in-kind redemptions (outside of the ETF context) historically has been rare and that many
funds reserve the right to redeem in kind only as a tool to manage liquidity risk under emergency
circumstances or to manage the redemption activity of a fund’s large institutional investors. 553
We also are aware that there are often logistical issues associated with redemptions in kind and
that these issues can limit the availability of in-kind redemptions as a practical matter. 554 A fund
should consider whether adding relevant detail to its disclosure regarding in-kind redemptions, or
549

Id.

550

See proposed Item 11(c)(8) of Form N-1A.

551

Funds also may use swing pricing to address transaction costs associated with shareholder purchases or
redemptions. We have proposed amendments to Form N-1A regarding disclosure of swing pricing. See
proposed Item 6(d) of Form N-1A.

552

See Item 11(c)(3) of Form N-1A

553

See supra section III. C.5.c.

554

Id.

252

revising its disclosure if the fund would be practically limited in its ability to redeem its shares in
kind, would provide more accurate information to investors.
We are also proposing to amend Item 28 of Form N-1A to require a fund to file as an
exhibit to its registration statement any agreements related to lines of credit for the benefit of the
fund. 555 As previously mentioned, we understand based on staff outreach that it is relatively
common for funds to establish lines of credit to manage liquidity risk and meet shareholder
redemptions, typically during periods of significantly limited market liquidity. 556 We believe that
requiring funds to include such agreements as exhibits to registration statements will increase
Commission, investor, and market participant knowledge concerning the arrangements funds
have made in order to strengthen their ability to meet shareholder redemption requests and
manage liquidity risk and the terms of those arrangements. We also propose to include an
instruction related to credit agreements noting that the specific fees paid in connection with the
credit agreements need not be disclosed in the exhibit filed with the Commission to preserve the
confidentiality of this information.
Overall, we believe that requiring funds to provide additional disclosure concerning the
methods they use and the funding sources they have to fulfill their redemption obligations and
whether those methods are used on a regular basis or only in stressed market conditions would
improve shareholder and market participant knowledge regarding fund redemption procedures
and liquidity risk management. In particular, increased knowledge of how and when a fund’s
redemption procedures may affect whether, for example, a shareholder would receive cash or

555

See proposed Item 28(h) of Form N-1A.

556

See supra section III.C.5.a.

253

securities in kind or pay a redemption fee would be helpful for investors to better understand the
impact of a fund’s redemption procedures on shareholders.
b.

Swing Pricing

Form N-1A currently requires a fund to describe its procedures for pricing fund shares,
including an explanation that the price of fund shares is based on the fund’s NAV and the
method used to value fund shares. 557 If the fund is an ETF, an explanation that the price of fund
shares is based on market price is required. 558 As discussed above, under proposed rule
22c-1(a)(3), a fund (with the exception of a money market fund or ETF) would be permitted,
under certain circumstances, to use swing pricing to adjust its current NAV as an additional tool
to lessen dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable securities through shareholder purchase
and redemption activity. 559
We are proposing to amend Item 6 of Form N-1A to account for this pricing procedure.
Specifically, the proposed amendment would require a fund that uses swing pricing to explain
the circumstances under which swing pricing would be required to be used as well as the effects
of using swing pricing. 560 For a fund that invests in other funds (e.g., fund-of-funds, masterfeeder funds), the fund would be required to include a statement that its NAV is calculated based
on the NAVs of the funds in which the fund invests, and that the prospectuses for those funds
explain the circumstances under which those funds will use swing pricing and the effects of
using swing pricing. We believe that these proposed disclosures would improve public
understanding regarding a fund’s use of swing pricing as well as the potential advantages and
557

redemption activity.
c.

Request for Comment

We request comment on all aspects of the proposed amendments to Form N-1A.
•

Would the proposed amendments regarding payment of redemption proceeds be helpful
to fund shareholders? Should we modify the proposed disclosures, and if so, how?

•

In addition to the proposed disclosure requirements, should Form N-1A be amended to
require certain funds to incorporate enhanced disclosure regarding liquidity risk into their
summary prospectuses? If so, what funds should be subject to such enhanced disclosure
requirements (e.g., funds with certain investment strategies, whose three-day liquid asset
minimums are below a certain threshold, or that hold above a certain percentage of their
portfolio (for instance, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%) in assets with extremely limited liquidity,
such as assets that can only be converted to cash in over 7 days, over 15 days, over 30
days, or over 90 days at a price that does not materially affect the value of that asset
immediately prior to sale)? What specific liquidity risk disclosure requirements should
apply to these funds?

•

Are there any challenges associated with funds disclosing when they expect to pay
redemption proceeds? Should funds be required to disclose the expected period in
normal and stressed market conditions?

•

Are there any challenges associated with funds disclosing the methods that they use to
meet redemption requests and whether those methods are used regularly or only in
stressed market conditions? Would disclosure of this information overly complicate
prospectus disclosures?

255

•

In cases where the number of days in which a fund will pay redemption proceeds differs
by distribution channel, are there any challenges associated with funds disclosing the
number of days for each distribution channel? Do funds pay all redemption proceeds at
the same time irrespective of distribution channel (although when the shareholder
actually receives redemption proceeds may differ by distribution channel)?

•

Would the proposed amendments provide useful information to shareholders about how
funds plan to satisfy redemption requests? Is there any additional information about fund
redemption policies that shareholders should be aware of that is not discussed above? If
so, would such additional information already be covered under existing Form N-1A
requirements, or would we need to make any amendments to the form or its instructions?

•

Would the proposed amendment to Item 28 of Form N-1A that would require a fund to
file as exhibits to its registration statement any agreements related to lines of credit for
the benefit of the fund be useful to fund shareholders and market participants? Why or
why not? Are there any issues associated with funds filing such credit agreements? For
example, even if specific fees paid in connection with the credit agreements are redacted,
do funds have confidentiality concerns regarding filing such credit agreements? Should
funds be required to file credit agreements if we adopt the proposed amendments to
proposed Form N-CEN that require a fund to disclose information regarding lines of
credit available to the fund?

•

Would the proposed amendments to Form N-1A regarding swing pricing be useful to
fund shareholders? Should funds be required to disclose additional information regarding
swing pricing, and if so, what information should be disclosed?

256

2.

Proposed Amendments to Proposed Form N-PORT

The Commission, investors, and other market participants currently have limited
information about the liquidity of portfolio investments of funds, and we believe that all would
benefit from more detailed reporting and disclosure of the liquidity of a fund’s portfolio
investments. On May 20, 2015, we proposed requiring registered management investment
companies and ETFs organized as unit investment trusts, other than registered money market
funds or small business investment companies, to electronically file with the Commission
monthly portfolio investment information on proposed Form N-PORT. 561 As we discussed in
the Investment Company Reporting Modernization Release, the information that would be filed
on proposed Form N-PORT would enhance the Commission’s ability to effectively oversee and
monitor the activities of investment companies in order to better carry out its regulatory
functions. We also stated that we believe that many investors, particularly institutional investors,
as well as academic researchers, financial analysts, and economic research firms, could use the
information reported on proposed Form N-PORT to evaluate fund portfolios and assess the
potential for returns and risks of a particular fund. 562
We believe that requiring funds to report information about the liquidity of portfolio
investments would assist the Commission in better assessing liquidity risk in the open-end fund
industry, which can inform its policy and guidance, as well as in its monitoring for compliance
with proposed rule 22e-4 and identifying potential outliers in fund liquidity classifications for
further inquiry, as appropriate. Furthermore, we believe that this information would help
561

Submissions on Form N-PORT would be required to be filed no later than 30 days after the close of each
month. As proposed, only information reported for the third month of each fund’s fiscal quarter on Form
N-PORT would be publicly available, and such information would not be made public until 60 days after
the end of the third month of the fund’s fiscal quarter. See Investment Company Reporting Modernization
Release, supra note 104.

562

See Investment Company Reporting Modernization Release, supra note 104.

257

investors and potential users better understand the liquidity risks in funds. Accordingly, the
Commission seeks to enhance the reporting regarding the liquidity of fund holdings by proposing
that each fund report on Form N-PORT the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum as well as the
liquidity classification for each portfolio asset, as further described below.
a.

Liquidity Classification of Portfolio Investments

Part C of proposed Form N-PORT would require a fund and its consolidated subsidiaries
to disclose its schedule of investments and certain information about the fund’s portfolio of
investments. We propose to add Item C.13 to Part C of proposed Form N-PORT, which would
require a fund to indicate the liquidity classification of each of the fund’s positions in a portfolio
asset. Funds would be required to indicate such liquidity classification using the following
categories as specified in proposed rule 22e-4:
•

Convertible to cash within 1 business day;

•

Convertible to cash within 2-3 business days;

•

Convertible to cash within 4-7 calendar days;

•

Convertible to cash within 8-15 calendar days;

•

Convertible to cash within 16-30 calendar days; and

•

Convertible to cash in more than 30 calendar days.

For portfolio assets with multiple liquidity classifications, proposed Item C.13 would require
funds to indicate the dollar amount attributable to each classification. For example, a fund could
determine that it could convert half of a portfolio position to cash in 2-3 business days and the
other half of the position in 4-7 calendar days in order to dispose of the position without creating
a market impact and receive cash for the trade. In this case, half of the position would be
reported in the 2-3 day category and the other half in the 4-7 day category.

258

We anticipate that the enhanced reporting proposed in these amendments would help our
staff better monitor liquidity trends and various funds’ liquidity risk profiles. We also believe
that making this information available to the public quarterly, as with other information on
proposed N-PORT, is appropriate. We received several comments to the Investment Company
Reporting Modernization Release that addressed our proposal to require funds to identify on
proposed Form N-PORT whether an investment is an illiquid asset. Specifically, several
commenters noted concern that public dissemination of a fund’s liquidity determinations could
lead to misinterpretation and confusion among investors, particularly because of the subjective
nature of such determinations. 563
While we appreciate commenters’ concerns and request further comment, we believe that
the liquidity-related data reported on Form N-PORT that is made publicly available would
inform investors and assist users in assessing funds’ relative liquidity and the overall liquidity of
the fund industry and of particular investment strategies and would not be confusing to
investors. 564 For example, third-party data analyzers could use the reported information to
produce useful metrics for investors about the relative liquidity of different funds with similar
strategies. We also anticipate that this publicly available data would provide a resource for fund
managers to compare the liquidity classifications assigned to various portfolio assets, which in
turn could result in making the liquidity classifications assigned to certain positions more
consistent across the fund industry, to the extent appropriate, and could provide greater market
transparency as to the liquidity characteristics of certain assets.
563

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Charles Schwab Investment Management on Investment Company Reporting
Modernization Release (Aug. 11, 2015); Comment Letter of Invesco Advisers, Inc. on Investment
Company Reporting Modernization Release (Aug. 11, 2015); Comment Letter of the Investment Company
Institute on Investment Company Reporting Modernization Release (Aug. 11, 2015); Comment Letter of
Pioneer Investments on Investment Company Reporting Modernization Release (Aug. 11, 2015).

564

See supra note 561 regarding public disclosure of information submitted on Form N-PORT.

259

We note that the liquidity classification of an asset may vary across funds depending on
the facts and circumstances relating to the funds and their trading practices. 565 For example, one
fund may hold a particular asset as a hedge against a risk in another portfolio asset. In this case,
that asset’s liquidity profile may be tied to the liquidity of the corresponding hedged asset.
Another fund not using that asset as a hedge could report a quite different liquidity classification.
Liquidity classifications also may vary based on the size of fund positions in a particular
portfolio asset. We also recognize that liquidity classifications inherently involve some level of
judgment by the fund and estimation as market conditions can change, and thus a fund may
predict liquidity based on current information that it will take a certain time period to convert a
particular asset to cash only to find that it takes longer to do so when the fund actually sells the
asset. Nevertheless, for the reasons discussed above, we believe that the proposed reporting of
liquidity classification information will provide very valuable information to us and market
participants about current fund expectations regarding portfolio liquidity.
b.

15% Standard Assets

As currently proposed, Form N-PORT would require that each fund disclose whether
each particular portfolio security is an “illiquid asset.” 566 The proposed form defines illiquid
assets in terms of current Commission guidelines (i.e., assets that cannot be sold or disposed of
by the fund within seven calendar days, at approximately the value ascribed to them by the

565

See, e.g., Comment Letter of the Investment Company Institute on Investment Company Reporting
Modernization Release (Aug. 11, 2015) (“These [liquidity] judgments may differ among personnel and
certainly among fund complexes.”); Comment Letter of Invesco Advisers, Inc. on Investment Company
Reporting Modernization Release (Aug. 11, 2015) (“Invesco and other fund complexes could reasonably
differ in their assessments of the liquidity of a particular security, even though both complexes have a
sound method for determining liquidity and follow their own reasonable procedures.”).

566

See Item C.7 of proposed Form N-PORT.

260

fund). 567 In connection with proposed rule 22e-4’s requirement regarding 15% standard
assets, 568 we propose to amend the General Instructions to proposed Form N-PORT to remove
the term “Illiquid Asset” from the definitions section and replace it with the term “15% Standard
Asset,” as such term is defined in proposed rule 22e-4. 569
This change would have the effect of requiring funds to report, for each portfolio asset,
whether the asset is a 15% standard asset. This information would allow our staff and other
interested parties to track the extent that funds are holding 15% standard assets and to discern the
nature of those holdings. This information also would help these groups in tracking the fund’s
exposure to liquidity risk.
c.

Three-Day Liquid Asset Minimum

We propose to add an Item B.7 to Part B of proposed Form N-PORT to require each fund
to disclose its “three-day liquid asset minimum,” as such term is defined in proposed rule
22e-4. 570 Requiring reporting of this information on Form N-PORT would allow our staff and
other interested parties to easily assess the three-day liquid asset minimum across funds because
of the interactive nature of how the information would be reported on proposed Form N-PORT.

567

See General Instruction E of proposed Form N-PORT.

568

See proposed rule 22e-4(a)(4); see also supra section III.C.4.a.

569

See Item C.7 of proposed Form N-PORT; revised General Instructions to proposed Form N-PORT.
The Investment Company Reporting Modernization Release also proposed amendments to Article 12 of
Regulation S-X in which funds would be required to identify illiquid securities. See, e.g., proposed rule
12-12, n. 10 of Regulation S-X (requiring funds to indicate “by an appropriate symbol each issue of illiquid
securities”). We propose to define “illiquid securities” in Regulation S-X (as well as “illiquid investment,”
which term also appears in Regulation S-X) by reference to the term “15% standard assets,” as defined in
proposed rule 22e-4(a)(4). See proposed 210.6-02(e), (f).

570

See proposed rule 22e-4(a)(9); see also supra section III.C.3. We also propose adding the term “Three-Day
Liquid Asset Minimum” to General Instruction E of proposed Form N-PORT, referencing the definition of
such term in proposed rule 22e-4.

261

This should facilitate comparisons between funds as well as the observation of trends over time
in this indicator of fund liquidity.

Request for Comment

We seek comment on each of the Commission’s proposed amendments to proposed Form
N-PORT.
•

Is there different or other information associated with liquidity that we should require
funds to report on proposed Form N-PORT? If so, please describe the information.

•

Would the proposed liquidity classification disclosure assist investors, fund boards, and
other users in analyzing liquidity among portfolio assets within the fund and across the
fund industry? What challenges, if any, may arise in reporting the liquidity classification
information, and how could we address those challenges? What concerns are raised with
public disclosure of liquidity classification information and how could we address those
concerns?

•

Should we require that the liquidity classification information on proposed Form
N-PORT only be reported to the Commission and not be publicly disclosed? If so, how
would we achieve our goal of allowing investors to become better informed, through
information provided by third-party information providers or otherwise, about the
liquidity of the funds in which they invest? Would public disclosure of liquidity
classification information facilitate predatory trading practices or exacerbate first mover
incentives? If so, how?

•

Proposed Form N-PORT has a section in which a fund can provide explanatory notes
with any information that it believes would be helpful in understanding the information

262

reported on Form N-PORT. 571 Would this allow funds to explain any methodologies,
assumptions, or estimations used in determining liquidity classifications?
3.

Proposed Amendments to Proposed Form N-CEN

As proposed, all registered investment companies, including money market funds but
excluding face amount certificate companies, would be required to file Form N-CEN annually. 572
Form N-CEN would require these registered investment companies to provide census-type
information that would assist our efforts to modernize the reporting and disclosure of
information by registered investment companies and enhance the staff’s ability to carry out its
regulatory functions, including risk monitoring and analysis of the industry. 573
a.

Lines of Credit, Interfund Lending, Interfund Borrowing and Swing
Pricing

We are proposing to amend proposed Form N-CEN to allow the Commission and other
users to track certain liquidity risk management practices that we expect funds to use on a less
frequent basis than the day-to-day portfolio construction techniques captured by proposed Form
N-PORT. More specifically, we propose amending Part C of proposed Form N-CEN to add an
item that would include certain questions regarding the use of lines of credit, interfund lending,
interfund borrowing, and swing pricing.
The proposed amendments would add a new Item 44 to Part C of proposed Form N-CEN
requiring a fund to disclose if it has available a committed line of credit, and, if so, the size of the
line of credit in U.S. dollars, the name of the institution(s) with which the fund has the line of

573

Id.

263

credit, and whether the line of credit is for that fund alone or is shared among multiple funds. 574
If the line of credit is shared among multiple funds, the fund would be required to disclose the
names and SEC File numbers of the other funds (including any series) that may use the line of
credit. 575 If the fund responds affirmatively to having available a committed line of credit, the
fund would be required to disclose whether it drew on the line of credit during the reporting
period. 576 If the fund drew on that line of credit during the reporting period, Item 44 would
require the fund to disclose the average dollar amount outstanding when the line of credit was in
use and the number of days that line of credit was in use. 577 This information would allow our
staff and other potential users to assess how often and to what extent funds rely on certain
external sources of liquidity, rather than relying on the liquidity of fund portfolio assets alone,
for liquidity risk management. It also would allow monitoring of whether such lines of credit are
concentrated in particular financial institutions.
Proposed Item 44 also would require a fund to report whether it engaged in interfund
lending or interfund borrowing during the reporting period, and, if so, the average amount of the
interfund loan when the loan was outstanding and the number of days that the interfund loan was
outstanding. 578 This information would provide some transparency regarding the extent to which
funds use interfund lending or interfund borrowing. We understand that one reason that funds

See proposed Item 44(a)(iii)(1) of Part C of proposed Form N-CEN. Under proposed Form N-CEN, “SEC

have sought exemptive relief to engage in interfund lending and borrowing is to meet redemption
obligations if necessary.
Finally, Item 44 would require a fund other than a money market fund to disclose
whether it engaged in swing pricing during the reporting period. This disclosure would inform
our staff and potential users about whether funds use swing pricing as a tool to mitigate dilution
of the value of outstanding redeemable securities through shareholder purchase and redemption
activity. 579
b.

Additional Information Concerning ETFs

Proposed Form N-CEN includes a section related specifically to ETFs. 580 Some of the
proposed reporting requirements on Form N-CEN relate to an authorized participant’s interaction
with the ETF (or its service provider), as these entities play a significant role in the
marketplace. 581 We believe collection of such information would allow us to better assess the
size, capacity, and concentration of the authorized participant framework and may allow the
Commission staff to monitor how ETF purchase and redemption activity is distributed across
authorized participants and, for example, the extent to which a particular ETF—or ETFs as a
group—may be reliant on one or more particular authorized participants. 582

579

As part of the proposed revisions to proposed Form N-CEN, we propose renumbering previously proposed
Items 44 through 79 to 45 through 80.

580

See Part E of proposed Form N-CEN. We note that the reporting requirements of proposed Form N-CEN
that are tailored for ETFs also apply to UITs organized as ETFs, as well as exchange-traded managed
funds. See General Instruction A to proposed Form N-CEN. The additional proposed reporting
requirement discussed below would apply to the same group of entities.

581

Specifically, proposed Form N-CEN would require an ETF to provide identifying information about each
of its authorized participants, as well as the dollar value of the ETF’s shares that each authorized participant
purchased or redeemed from the ETF during the reporting period. See proposed Item 60(g) of proposed
Form N-CEN.

582

See Investment Company Reporting Modernization Release, supra note 104, at section II.E.4.

265

Specifically, we are proposing to add Item 60(g) 583 to Form N-CEN, which would require
an ETF to report whether it required that an authorized participant post collateral to the ETF or
any of its designated service providers in connection with the purchase or redemption of ETF
shares during the reporting period. 584 We understand that some ETFs (or their custodians),
particularly ETFs that invest in non-U.S. securities, require authorized participants transacting
primarily on an in-kind basis to post collateral when purchasing or redeeming shares, most often
for the duration of the settlement process. This can protect the ETF in the event, for example,
that the authorized participant fails to deliver the basket securities. 585 The requirement to post
collateral for creating or redeeming ETF shares impacts the authorized participant’s operating
capital, which could, in turn, affect the ability and willingness of authorized participants to serve
such ETFs or serve other market makers on an agency basis. Accordingly, we believe that
information about required posting of collateral by authorized participants when purchasing or
redeeming shares—alongside the information we previously proposed to require in Form
N-CEN—would be helpful in understanding whether, and to what extent, there may be
concentration in the authorized participant framework for such ETFs.
c.

Request for Comment

We seek comment on each of the Commission’s proposed amendments to proposed Form
N-CEN.

583

In the Reporting Modernization Release, information requirements related to authorized participants for
ETFs were in Item 59 of Proposed Form N-CEN; however, because this release proposes to add additional
items to proposed Form N-CEN, Item 59 of proposed Form N-CEN would be renumbered to Item 60. See
infra Text of Rules and Forms.

584

Proposed Item 60(g) of proposed Form N-CEN.

585

See, e.g., Investment Company Institute, The Role and Activities of Authorized Participants of ExchangeTraded Funds, (Mar. 2015), available at https://www.ici.org/pdf/ppr_15_aps_etfs.pdf. In addition to ETFs
that invest in non-U.S. securities, Commission staff understands that there are other ETFs that have
collateral requirements for purchases and redemptions, such as ETFs that invest in debt securities.

266

•

Would the proposed reporting on the availability and use of lines of credit, interfund
lending, interfund borrowing and the use of swing pricing assist investors, Commission
staff, and market participants in assessing liquidity and liquidity risks within a fund and
across the fund industry? Would this information be readily available to funds? If not,
please explain why.

•

Do the proposed questions collect all sources of liquidity outside the liquidity of fund
portfolio assets? If not, what are these other sources?

•

Is the annual reporting time period under Form N-CEN appropriate for this requested
information? Should it be collected more frequently? If so, should we require funds to
disclose any or all of the requested information on Form N-PORT instead of Form
N-CEN?

•

Is there different or other information associated with liquidity that we should require
funds to report on proposed Form N-CEN? If so, please describe the information.

•

Should funds be required to report information on uncommitted lines of credit? Please
explain why or why not.

•

What types of ETFs tend to require posting of collateral for purchases or redemptions and
why? Please provide data on the size of such collateral deposits, and how this deposit
requirement can affect an authorized participant’s operating capital? How common is it
for an authorized participant or market maker to contract with another authorized
participant to post such collateral on its behalf? Are there situations where one
authorized participant contracts with another authorized participant to purchase or redeem
ETF shares on an agency basis rather than purchase or redeem the shares directly with the

267

ETF because of the ETF’s requirement that the purchase or redemption be collateralized
for the duration of the settlement period?
H.

Compliance Dates
1.

Liquidity Risk Management Program

Proposed rule 22e-4 would require that each registered open-end management investment
company, including open-end ETFs but not including money market funds, adopt and implement
a written liquidity risk management program, approved by a fund’s board of directors, that meets
certain minimum requirements outlined in the rule. Given the nature of the liquidity risk
management program, including the classification and ongoing review of the liquidity of each of
a fund’s positions in an asset (or portion thereof) required under proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(i) and
the three-day liquid asset minimum determination required under proposed rule 22e4(b)(2)(iv)(A), we expect to provide for a tiered set of compliance dates based on asset size for
proposed rule 22e-4.
Specifically, for larger entities – namely, funds that together with other investment
companies in the same “group of related investment companies” 586 have net assets of $1 billion
or more as of the end of the most recent fiscal year – we are proposing a compliance date of 18
months after the effective date to comply with proposed rule 22e-4. For these larger entities, we
expect that 18 months would provide an adequate period of time for funds to prepare internal

586

For these purposes, we expect that the threshold would be based on the definition of “group of related
investment companies,” as such term is defined in rule 0-10 under the Investment Company Act. Rule 0-10
defines the term in part as “two or more management companies (including series thereof) that: (i) Hold
themselves out to investors as related companies for purposes of investment and investor services; and (ii)
Either: (A) Have a common investment adviser or have investment advisers that are affiliated persons of
each other; or (B) Have a common administrator….” We believe that this broad definition would
encompass most types of fund complexes and therefore is an appropriate definition for compliance date
purposes.

268

processes, policies and procedures and implement liquidity risk management programs that meet
the requirements of the rule.
For smaller entities (i.e., funds that together with other investment companies in the same
“group of related investment companies” have net assets of less than $1 billion as of the end of
the most recent fiscal year), 587 we are proposing to provide for an extra 12 months (or 30 months
after the effective date) to comply with proposed rule 22e-4. 588 We believe that smaller entities
would benefit from this extra time to establish and implement the requirements outlined in the
rule.
On or before the applicable compliance date(s), a fund must have adopted and
implemented compliance policies and procedures that satisfy the requirements of the new rule.
These policies and procedures must have been approved by the board on or before the applicable
compliance date(s).
2.

Swing Pricing

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3), if adopted, would permit (but not require) a fund (with the
exception of a money market fund or ETF) to adopt swing pricing policies and procedures.
Related proposed amendments to rule 31a-2 (regarding the preservation of books and records
evidencing and supporting adjustments to NAV based on swing pricing policies and procedures),
Item 13 of Form N-1A and Regulation S-X (regarding financial reporting), and Item 11(c) of
Form N-1A (regarding a fund’s use of swing pricing) would apply only to funds that elect to use
587

Based on staff analysis of data obtained from Morningstar Direct, as of June 30, 2015, we estimate that a
$1 billion threshold would provide an extended compliance period to approximately 66% of the fund
groups, but only 0.6% of all fund assets. We therefore believe that the $1 billion threshold would
appropriately balance the need to provide smaller groups of investment companies with more time to
prepare internal processes, policies and procedures and implement liquidity risk management programs that
meet the requirements of proposed rule 22e-4, while still including the vast majority of fund assets in the
initial compliance period.

588

See proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(i), (ii) and (iv)(A)-(C).

269

swing pricing. As reliance on rule 22c-1(a)(3) would be optional, we believe a compliance
period would not be necessary. Therefore, we expect that a fund would be able to rely on the
rule after the effective date as soon as the fund could comply with proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) and
related records, financial reporting and prospectus disclosure requirements.
3.

Amendments to Form N-1A

Except with respect to the proposed amendments to Form N-1A related to swing pricing
(discussed above), if the other proposed amendments to Form N-1A are adopted, we expect to
require all initial registration statements on Form N-1A, and all post-effective amendments that
are annual updates to effective registration statements on Form N-1A, filed six months or more
after the effective date, to comply with the proposed amendments to Form N-1A. We do not
expect that funds would require significant amounts of time to prepare additional disclosures in
accordance with our proposed amendments regarding redemptions.
4.

Amendments to Form N-PORT

Similar to the tiered compliance dates for the liquidity classification requirements for
fund liquidity risk management programs under proposed rule 22e-4 (discussed above), we
expect to provide for a tiered set of compliance dates based on asset size for the proposed
amendments to proposed Form N-PORT. Specifically, for larger entities we are proposing a
compliance date of 18 months after the effective date to comply with the new reporting
requirements. For these larger entities, we expect that 18 months would provide an adequate
period of time for funds, intermediaries, and other service providers to conduct the requisite
operational changes to their systems and to establish internal processes to prepare, validate, and
file reports containing the additional information requested by the proposed amendments to Form
N-PORT. For smaller entities, we are proposing to provide for an extra 12 months (or 30 months

270

after the effective date) to comply with the new reporting requirements. We believe that smaller
groups would benefit from this extra time to comply with the filing requirements for Form
N-PORT and would potentially benefit from the lessons learned by larger investment companies
and groups of investment companies during the adoption period for Form N-PORT.
5.

Amendments to Form N-CEN

If Form N-CEN and the amendments we propose to the form are adopted, we are
proposing a compliance date of 18 months after the effective date to comply with the new
reporting requirements. 589 We expect that 18 months would provide an adequate period of time
for funds, intermediaries, and other service providers to conduct the requisite operational
changes to their systems and to establish internal processes to prepare, validate, and file reports
containing the additional information requested by the proposed amendments to Form N-CEN.
6.

Request for Comment

We request comment on the compliance dates discussed above.
•

How, if at all, should the proposed compliance dates be modified? What factors should
we consider when setting the compliance dates for the proposed rule and amendments to
the rules and forms? To the extent that a fund would decide to reallocate certain portions
of its portfolio in order to correlate its portfolio holdings with its three-day liquid asset
minimum, would the proposed compliance dates provide adequate time to do so in a way
that would cause the fund to incur relatively few portfolio reallocation-related costs (i.e.,

589

Unlike Form N-PORT, we do not expect to provide a tiered compliance date based on asset size because
we believe that it is less likely that smaller fund complexes would need additional time to comply with the
amendments we propose on Form N-CEN. This 18-month compliance period is consistent with the
compliance period for proposed Form N-CEN. See Investment Company Reporting Modernization
Release, supra note 104.

271

by permitting sufficient time to purchase and sell portfolio assets when it is relatively
advantageous to do so)?
•

We request comment on our proposed 18-month compliance date for proposed rule
22e-4. Is our 18-month compliance period appropriate? If not, what length of time (e.g.,
12 months or 24 months) would be appropriate for compliance with the new rule?

•

We also request comment on our proposed tiered compliance dates for proposed rule 22e4 and related reporting requirements under our proposed amendments to proposed Form
N-PORT. Is a threshold of $1 billion based on the net assets of funds together with other
investment companies in the same “group of related investment companies” as of the end
of the most recent fiscal year appropriate? Should the threshold be higher or lower? 590
Should the threshold include aggregation of net assets with other investment companies
in the same “group of related investment companies?” Why or why not? Is our 12month extension of the compliance period for smaller entities appropriate? If not, what
length of time (e.g., 6 months or 18 months) would be adequate and why?

•

With respect to our proposed amendments to Form N-PORT, is our compliance date of
18 months for larger filers appropriate? If not, what length of time would be appropriate
for compliance with the proposed amendments? Would a shorter or longer compliance
date be appropriate? Is our 12-month extension of the compliance period for smaller
entities appropriate? If not, what length of time would be appropriate for compliance
with the additional reporting requirements under the proposed amendments?

590

Based on staff analysis of data obtained from Morningstar Direct, as of June 30, 2015, we estimate that a
threshold of $100 million would include approximately 38% of fund firms and 0.1% of all fund assets. A
threshold of $3 billion would include approximately 77% of fund firms and 1.6% of fund assets.

272

•

Is our 18-month compliance period for our proposed amendments to Form N-CEN
appropriate? If not, what length of time would be appropriate? Would a shorter or
longer compliance date be appropriate?

•

We are proposing to not have a compliance period for proposed amendments to rule
22c-1 regarding swing pricing policies procedures and related amendments to rule 31a-2,
Form N-1A and Regulation S-X. Is this appropriate?

•

Is our six-month compliance period for our proposed amendments to Form N-1A
disclosure requirements regarding the redemption of fund shares adequate? If not, what
length of time would be adequate and why?

IV.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.

Introduction and Primary Goals of Proposed Regulation

The Commission is sensitive to the economic effects that could result from the proposed
liquidity risk management program requirement, the ability for funds to use swing pricing under
proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3), and the proposed new disclosure and reporting requirements regarding
liquidity risk and liquidity risk management (such proposed rule and proposed amendments to
certain rules and forms, the “proposed liquidity regulations”). These economic effects include
the benefits and costs of the proposed liquidity regulations, as well as the effects on efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. The economic effects of the proposed liquidity regulations
are discussed below in the context of the primary goals of the proposed regulation.
In summary, and as discussed in greater detail in section III above, the proposed liquidity
regulations include the following:
o Proposed new rule 22e-4 would require that each fund establish a written liquidity risk
management program. A fund’s liquidity risk management program would be required to

273

include the following elements: (i) classification and ongoing review of the classification
of the liquidity of each of the fund’s positions in a portfolio asset (or portions of a
position in a particular asset), taking into account certain specified factors; (ii) assessment
and periodic review of its liquidity risk; and (iii) management of the fund’s liquidity risk,
including limitations on the fund’s acquisition of less liquid assets or 15% standard assets
in certain circumstances.
o Under proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3), a fund (except a money market fund or ETF) would be
permitted (but not required) to establish and implement swing pricing policies and
procedures that would, under certain circumstances, require the fund to use swing pricing
to adjust its current NAV to lessen potential dilution of the value of outstanding
redeemable securities caused by shareholder purchase and redemption activity. A fund
that engages in swing pricing would be subject to certain disclosure and reporting
requirements.
o Proposed amendments to Form N-1A, Regulation S-X, proposed Form N-PORT, and
proposed Form N-CEN would require enhanced fund disclosure and reporting regarding
position liquidity, shareholder redemption practices, and swing pricing.
The proposed liquidity regulations are designed to promote effective liquidity risk
management throughout the open-end fund industry and thereby reduce the risk that funds will
be unable to meet redemption obligations and mitigate dilution of the interests of fund
shareholders in accordance with, among other provisions, section 22(e) and rule 22c-1 under the
Investment Company Act. The proposed liquidity regulations also seek to enhance disclosure
regarding fund liquidity and redemption practices. In addition, these proposed reforms are
intended to address the liquidity-related developments in the open-end fund industry discussed

274

above and are a part of a broader set of initiatives to address the impact of open-end fund
investment activities on financial markets and the risks associated with the increasingly complex
portfolio composition and operations of the asset management industry. We provide an
overview of these rulemaking goals in the following paragraphs, and the goals are discussed in
more detail below as we describe the prospective benefits and costs of each aspect of the
proposal. 591
A primary goal of the proposed liquidity regulations is to promote investor protection by
reducing the risk that funds will be unable to meet their redemption obligations, elevating the
overall quality of liquidity risk management across the fund industry, increasing transparency of
funds’ liquidity risks and risk management practices, and mitigating potential dilution of existing
shareholders’ interests. Funds are not currently subject to requirements under the federal
securities laws or Commission rules that specifically require them to maintain a minimum level
of portfolio liquidity (with the exception of money market funds), and follow Commission
guidelines (not rules) that generally limit their investment in illiquid assets. 592 Additionally,
funds today are only subject to limited disclosure requirements concerning a fund’s liquidity risk
and risk management. 593 Staff outreach has shown that funds today engage in a variety of
different practices—ranging from comprehensive and rigorous to minimal and basic—for
classifying the liquidity of their portfolio assets, assessing and managing liquidity risk, and
disclosing information about their liquidity risk, redemption practices, and liquidity risk
management practices to investors. 594 We believe that the proposed enhanced requirements for
591

594

See supra section II.D; infra sections IV.B.1.a, IV.B.1.c.

275

funds’ assessment, management, and disclosure of liquidity risk could decrease the chance that
funds would be unable to meet their redemption obligations and mitigate potential dilution of
non-redeeming shareholders’ interests.
The proposed liquidity regulations are also intended to lessen the possibility of early
redemption incentives (and investor dilution) created by insufficient liquidity risk management,
as well as the possibility that investors’ share value will be diluted by costs incurred by the fund
as a result of other investors’ purchase or redemption activity. When a fund experiences
significant redemption requests, it may sell portfolio securities or borrow funds in order to obtain
sufficient cash to meet redemptions. 595 However, sales of a fund’s portfolio assets conducted in
order to meet shareholder redemptions could result in significant adverse consequences to
non-redeeming shareholders when a fund fails to adequately manage liquidity. For example, if a
fund sells portfolio assets under unfavorable circumstances, this could create negative price
pressure on those assets and decrease the value of any of those assets still held by the fund. 596
Funds also may borrow from a bank or use interfund lending facilities to meet redemption
requests, but there are costs associated with such borrowings. Both selling of portfolio assets
and borrowing to meet redemption requests could cause funds to incur costs that would be borne
at least partially by non-redeeming shareholders. 597 These factors could result in dilution in the
value of non-redeeming shareholders’ interests in a fund, 598 and also could create incentives for
early redemptions in times of liquidity stress, which could result in further dilution of

276

non-redeeming shareholders’ interests. 599 There also is a potential for adverse effects on the
markets when open-end funds fail to adequately manage liquidity. For example, the sale of less
liquid portfolio assets at discounted or even fire sale prices can produce significant negative price
pressure on those assets and correlated assets, which can impact other investors holding these
assets and may transmit stress to other funds or portions of the markets. 600 For reasons discussed
in detail below, we believe that the liquidity risk management program requirement and the
ability for a fund to adopt swing pricing policies and procedures would mitigate the risk of
potential shareholder dilution and decrease the incentive for early redemption in times of
liquidity stress.
Finally, the proposed liquidity regulations are meant to address recent industry
developments that have underscored the significance of funds’ liquidity risk management
practices. In recent years, there has been significant growth in the assets managed by funds with
strategies that focus on holding relatively less liquid assets, such as fixed income funds
(including emerging market debt funds), open-end funds with alternative strategies, and
emerging market equity funds. 601 There also has been considerable growth in assets managed by
funds that exhibit characteristics that could give rise to increased liquidity risk, such as relatively
high investor flow volatility. 602 Additionally, as discussed in detail above, standard fund
redemption and securities settlement periods have tended to become significantly shorter over
the last several decades, which has caused funds to satisfy redemption requests within relatively

599

600

See supra note 54 and accompanying text.

See infra section IV.B.3.

277

short time periods (e.g., within T+3, T+2, and next-day periods). 603 But while fund redemption
periods have become shorter, certain funds have increased their holdings of portfolio securities
with relatively long settlement periods, which could result in a liquidity mismatch between when
a fund plans or is required to pay redeeming shareholders, and when any asset sales that the fund
has executed in order to pay redemptions will settle. 604 Collectively, these industry trends have
emphasized the importance of effective liquidity risk management among funds and enhanced
disclosure regarding liquidity risk and risk management.
B.

Economic Baseline

The proposed liquidity regulations would affect all funds and their investors, investment
advisers and other service providers, all issuers of the portfolio securities in which funds invest,
and other market participants potentially affected by fund and investor behavior. The effects of
the proposed liquidity regulations on all of these parties are analyzed in detail below in the
discussion of the costs and benefits of the proposed regulations. The economic baseline of the
proposed liquidity regulations includes funds’ current practices regarding liquidity risk
management, swing pricing, and liquidity risk disclosure, as well as the economic attributes of
funds that affect their portfolio liquidity and liquidity risk. These economic attributes include
industry-wide trends regarding funds’ liquidity and liquidity risk management, as well as
industry developments highlighting the importance of robust liquidity risk management by funds.

Funds’ Current Practices Regarding Liquidity Risk Management, Swing
Pricing, and Liquidity Risk Disclosure
a.

Funds’ Current Liquidity Risk Management Requirements and Practices

Under section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act, an open-end fund is required to
make payment to shareholders for securities tendered for redemption within seven days of their
tender. 605 In addition to the seven-day redemption requirement in section 22(e), open-end funds
that are sold through broker-dealers are required as a practical matter to meet redemption
requests within three business days because broker-dealers are subject to rule 15c6-1 under the
Exchange Act, which establishes a three-day (T+3) settlement period for security trades effected
by a broker or a dealer. Furthermore, rule 22c-1 under the Act, the “forward pricing” rule,
requires funds, their principal underwriters, and dealers to sell and redeem fund shares at a price
based on the current NAV next computed after receipt of an order to purchase or redeem fund
shares, even though cash proceeds from purchases may be invested or fund assets may be sold in
subsequent days in order to satisfy purchase requests or meet redemption obligations.
With the exception of money market funds subject to rule 2a-7 under the Act, the
Commission has not promulgated rules requiring open-end funds to invest in a minimum level of
liquid assets. 606 The Commission historically has taken the position that open-end funds should
maintain a high degree of portfolio liquidity to ensure that their portfolio securities and other
assets can be sold and the proceeds used to satisfy redemptions in a timely manner in order to
comply with section 22(e). 607 The Commission also has stated that open-end funds have a
605

See section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act. Section 22(e) of the Act provides, in part, that no
open-end fund shall suspend the right of redemption or postpone the date of payment upon redemption of
any redeemable security in accordance with its terms for more than seven days after tender of the security
absent specified unusual circumstances.

“general responsibility to maintain a level of portfolio liquidity that is appropriate under the
circumstances,” and to engage in ongoing portfolio liquidity monitoring to determine whether an
adequate level of portfolio liquidity is being maintained in light of the fund’s redemption
obligations. 608 Open-end funds also are required by rule 38a-1 under the Act to adopt and
implement written compliance policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations
of the federal securities laws, and such policies and procedures should be appropriately tailored
to reflect each fund’s particular compliance risks. 609 An open-end fund holding a significant
portion of its assets in securities with long settlement periods or with infrequent trading, for
instance, may be subject to relatively greater liquidity risks than other open-end funds, and
should have relatively more robust policies and procedures to comply with its redemption
obligations.
Additionally, long-standing Commission guidelines generally limit an open-end fund’s
aggregate holdings of “illiquid assets” to 15% of the fund’s net assets (the “15% guideline”). 610
Under the 15% guideline, a portfolio security or other asset is considered illiquid if it cannot be
sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business within seven days at approximately the
value at which the fund has valued the investment. 611 The 15% guideline has generally limited
funds’ exposure to particular types of securities that cannot be sold within seven days and that
the Commission and staff have indicated may be illiquid, depending on the facts and
circumstances.

Staff outreach has shown that funds currently employ a diversity of practices with respect
to classifying portfolio assets’ liquidity, as well as managing liquidity risk. Section II.D.3 above
provides an overview of these practices, which include, among others: assessing the ability to
sell particular assets within various time periods, taking into account relevant market, trading,
and other factors; monitoring initial liquidity determinations for portfolio assets (and modifying
these determinations, as appropriate); holding certain amounts of the fund’s portfolio in highly
liquid assets or cash equivalents; establishing committed back-up lines of credit or interfund
lending facilities; and conducting stress testing relating to the extent the fund has liquid assets to
cover possible levels of redemptions. 612 We have observed that some of the funds with relatively
more thorough liquidity risk management practices have appeared to be able to meet periods of
high redemptions without significantly altering the risk profile of the fund or materially affecting
the fund’s performance, and thus with few dilutive impacts. It therefore appears that these funds
have generally aligned their portfolio liquidity with their liquidity needs, and that their liquidity
risk management permits them to efficiently meet redemption requests. Other funds, however,
employ liquidity classification and liquidity risk management practices that are substantially less
rigorous. As discussed above in section II.D.3, some funds do not take different market
conditions into account when evaluating portfolio asset liquidity, and do not conduct ongoing
liquidity monitoring. Likewise, some funds do not have independent oversight of their liquidity
risk management outside of the portfolio management process. As a result, funds’ procedures

ability to meet redemptions over certain periods); BlackRock FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 50

management framework for collective investment vehicles, including an independent risk management
function, compliance checks to ensure portfolio holdings do not exceed regulatory limits, a risk
management function that is independent from portfolio management, and measuring levels of liquid assets

analysis).

for classifying the liquidity of their portfolio securities, as well as the comprehensiveness and
independence of their liquidity risk management, vary significantly.
b.

Funds’ Current Swing Pricing Practices

Commission rules and guidance do not currently address the ability of an open-end fund
to use swing pricing to mitigate potential dilution of fund shareholders, and U.S. registered funds
do not currently use swing pricing. However, as discussed above, certain foreign funds currently
do use swing pricing. 613 We understand that some fund complexes that include U.S. registered
funds also include foreign-domiciled funds that currently use swing pricing.
c.

Funds’ Current Liquidity Risk Disclosure Requirements and Practices

Items 4 and 9 of Form N-1A require a fund to disclose the principal risks of investing in
the fund. 614 A fund currently must disclose the risks to which the fund’s portfolio as a whole is
expected to be subject and the circumstances reasonably likely to adversely affect the fund’s
NAV, yield, or total return. 615 Some funds currently disclose that liquidity risk is a principal risk
of investing in the fund.
Item 11 of Form N-1A requires a fund to describe its procedure for redeeming fund
shares, including restrictions on redemptions, any redemption charges, and whether the fund has
reserved the right to redeem in kind. 616 Disclosure regarding other redemption information, such
as the timing of payment of redemption proceeds to fund shareholders, varies across funds as
there are currently no specific requirements for this disclosure. Some funds disclose that they
will redeem shares within a specific number of days after receiving a redemption request, other

funds disclose that they will honor such requests within seven days (as required by section 22(e)
of the Act), and others provide no specific time periods. Additionally, some funds disclose
differences in the timing of payment of redemption proceeds based on the distribution channel
through which the fund shares are redeemed, while others do not.
Funds are not currently required to disclose information about the liquidity of their
portfolio assets. However, Form N-PORT, as proposed earlier this year, would require that each
fund disclose whether each particular portfolio security is an “illiquid asset” and defines illiquid
assets in terms of current Commission guidelines (i.e., assets that cannot be sold or disposed of
by the fund within seven calendar days, at approximately the value ascribed to them by the
fund). 617 Also, some funds voluntarily disclose in their registration statements any specific
limitations applicable to the fund’s investment in 15% guideline assets, as well as types of assets
considered by the fund to be subject to the 15% guideline.
Form N-1A does not currently require funds to disclose information about liquidity risk
management practices such as the establishment (or use) of committed back-up lines of credit. A
fund is, however, required to disclose information regarding the amount and terms of unused
lines of credit for short-term financing, as well as information regarding related party
transactions in its financial statements or notes thereto. 618

Economic Trends Regarding Funds’ Liquidity and Liquidity Risk Management
a.

Overview

While the liquidity of a fund’s portfolio assets, and the fund’s overall liquidity risk,
depend on a variety of factors and are unique to the particular circumstances facing the fund, 619
analysis by staff economists has revealed trends that are useful for providing an overview of the
liquidity of funds exhibiting certain characteristics. 620 These trends are useful in estimating the
relative level of liquidity of certain types of funds, and have thus helped to shape the scope and
substance of the proposed liquidity regulations and to estimate the benefits and costs of the
proposed liquidity regulations, as discussed below. Staff economists have also analyzed how
fund portfolios change in response to decreases in market liquidity and large net outflows. These
trends may be useful in examining how redemption requests could give rise to investor
protection and potential market impact concerns.
b.

Trends in the Relationship Between Liquidity of Portfolio Assets, Market
Capitalization of Portfolio Assets, and Fund Assets

Staff economists have examined how the liquidity of U.S. equity funds’ portfolios is
influenced by both the market capitalization of a fund’s portfolio assets, as well as the size of the
fund in terms of assets. As described in more detail below, among U.S. equity funds, the average
liquidity of a fund’s equity positions is correlated with the market capitalization of a fund’s
portfolio assets, as well as the level of the fund’s assets. 621 The staff’s analysis with respect to

619

See supra section III.B.2 (discussing factors relevant to an assessment of the liquidity of a fund’s portfolio
assets); supra section III.C.1 (discussing factors relevant to an assessment of a fund’s liquidity risk).

620

The analysis discussed in this section reflects an evaluation of data on U.S. funds (primarily, U.S. equity
funds and U.S. municipal bond funds) from the years 1999-2014, conducted by economists in the
Commission’s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. DERA Study, supra note 39.

621

For these purposes, “average liquidity of a fund’s equity positions” is defined as the asset-weighted average
liquidity of the individual equity positions held by the fund. Liquidity for individual equity positions is
calculated using the Amihud liquidity measure because it is a widely accepted liquidity measure. See id.,

284

these trends is, at this point, limited to an analysis of U.S. equity funds, on account of limitations
in the availability of current data with respect to the holdings of funds that are not U.S. equity
funds. 622 To the extent that Form N-PORT is adopted, we anticipate that the fund portfolio data
filed on this form would significantly assist the staff in conducting similar liquidity-related
analyses in the future. 623
Fund liquidity tends to be highest for large cap U.S. equity funds and lowest for small cap
U.S. equity funds. 624 As a U.S. equity fund’s assets increase, fund liquidity also tends to
increase. Among U.S. equity funds with less than $100 million in assets, the median price
impact of ten million dollars in trading volume on the average portfolio asset is about 69 basis
points; among U.S. equity funds with greater than $1 billion in assets, the same amount of
trading volume has a median price impact of about 46 basis points. 625
To the extent that a fund invests in portfolio assets that are relatively less liquid, the fund
may experience greater liquidity risk than a fund that invests in portfolio assets that are highly
liquid. Based in part on our empirical analysis, we have decided not to propose any modification
of or exclusion from the proposed liquidity requirements for smaller funds, since smaller funds
tend to demonstrate relatively high flow volatility (and thus possibly greater liquidity risk). 626
Also, based in part on staff analysis finding that different types of funds within the same broad
investment strategy demonstrate different levels of liquidity (and thus, presumably, different

levels of liquidity risk), we have decided not to propose to exclude certain investment strategies
from the scope of the proposed rule. 627 Our cost estimates associated with the proposed liquidity
risk management program requirement reflect staff analysis showing that certain types of funds
tend to have relatively more liquid portfolios than others. 628
We do note, however, that the staff’s analysis discussed in the previous two paragraphs
may overstate the difference in liquidity risk between funds with differing levels of asset
liquidity for two reasons. First, the analysis performed by the staff does not reflect the fact that
smaller funds will have smaller positions in the underlying equities, and sales of relatively small
positions should result in less price impact than sales of larger positions (although the sale of
smaller positions should have greater transaction costs as a percentage of sale proceeds).
However, with respect to U.S. equity funds, staff analysis indicates that, on average, smaller
funds hold assets that are relatively less liquid, which may at least partially offset that fact. 629
Second, the analysis does not reflect the fact that less liquid funds, regardless of style or size,
may have larger cash and cash equivalent holdings or liquid asset buffers that may offset their
less liquid holdings. Staff analysis does show that cash and cash equivalent holdings vary, on
average, according to the funds’ strategy, but cash and cash equivalent holdings also vary
significantly among funds within a particular strategy. 630 That result implies that, even within a
relatively less liquid strategy, certain funds within the strategy hold relatively little cash and cash
equivalents.

c.

Trends in the Manner in Which Funds’ Portfolio Management Responds
to Changes in Flow Volatility and Decreases in Market Liquidity

While portfolio managers consider a variety of factors when constructing a fund’s
portfolio (including the fund’s investment strategies, economic and market trends, portfolio asset
credit quality, and tax considerations), meeting daily redemption obligations is fundamental for
open-end funds, and funds need to manage liquidity in order to meet obligations. We
understand, based on statements from members of the fund industry and staff outreach, that
funds generally consider the portfolio management process to be of central importance in
managing funds’ liquidity risk. 631 Commission staff has analyzed whether the liquidity of funds’
portfolio holdings, as well as funds’ holdings of cash and cash equivalents, is correlated with
certain events that could affect a fund’s liquidity risk—that is, increased flow volatility, and
decreased market liquidity. As described in more detail below, staff analysis shows empirical
results indicating that funds’ portfolio holdings tend to be less liquid, and their holdings of cash
and cash equivalents tend to be lower, when funds encounter periods of decreased flow volatility.
These results indicate that certain funds’ portfolio construction takes liquidity risk management
into account and, as discussed below, the details comprising these results have both reinforced
our understanding of the benefits of the proposed regulations and have shaped certain of the
provisions of the proposed regulations.
The results of the staff’s analysis demonstrate that, with respect to U.S. equity funds, the
liquidity of funds’ holdings of equity securities is higher when flow volatility is higher. 632 As
discussed above, staff’s analysis with respect to trends that reflect the liquidity of funds’
631

See, e.g., ICI FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 16, at 14 (“For mutual funds, the central
importance of meeting redemptions means that liquidity management is a key element of regulatory
compliance, investment risk management, and portfolio management—and a constant area of focus.”).

632

DERA Study, supra note 39, at p. 37.

287

non-cash (or cash equivalent) holdings is limited to an analysis of U.S. equity funds, on account
of limitations in the availability of current data with respect to the holdings of funds that are not
U.S. equity funds. 633 However, the staff was able to conduct similar analyses regarding the
relationship between flow volatility and portfolio liquidity with respect to U.S. municipal bond
funds, which are unique in that their holdings typically consist only of U.S. municipal bonds and
cash and cash equivalents. Because U.S. municipal bonds are less liquid than cash, any change
in the relative holdings of municipal bonds and cash and cash equivalents indicates a change in
the fund’s portfolio liquidity. Unlike U.S. municipal bond funds, other types of funds tend to
hold portfolio assets that are not as homogenous, and thus staff would not be able to assume that
changes in relative holdings across asset classes could indicate a change in the fund’s portfolio
liquidity. With respect to U.S. municipal bond funds, the holdings of municipal bonds (as
opposed to these funds’ holdings of cash and cash equivalents) are relatively lower when flow
volatility is higher; holdings of municipal bonds are higher and holdings of cash and cash
equivalents are lower when flow volatility is lower. 634 Thus, like U.S. equity funds, U.S.
municipal bond funds’ portfolio liquidity tends to be higher when flow volatility is higher.
Likewise, staff analysis of the cash and cash equivalent holdings of all funds (regardless of
strategy) shows that funds with more volatile flows tend to hold more cash and cash
equivalents. 635
The results of staff’s analysis on the relationship between portfolio liquidity and fund
flow volatility are significant for several reasons. First, these results suggest that, as indicated by
funds in the course of staff outreach and in funds’ statements regarding their liquidity risk
633

See supra notes 622-623 and accompanying text.

634

635

288

management, some funds actively manage their portfolio liquidity to respond to events that could
challenge funds’ ability to plan to meet redemption requests. These results also emphasize that
flow volatility is a relevant factor that a fund should consider when assessing liquidity risk and
managing the liquidity profile of its portfolio. Rule 22e-4 as proposed reflects this by requiring a
fund to consider its cash flow projections in assessing its liquidity risk (and determining its
three-day liquid asset minimum), including the volatility of historical purchases and redemptions
of fund shares during normal and stressed periods. 636
While increased flow volatility could make a fund less certain as to the extent of
redemption requests it will be required to meet, changes in market liquidity (that is, the extent to
which market factors affect the liquidity of a fund’s portfolio holdings) could make a fund less
certain that the assets its holds are sufficient to meet redemption requests, or meet such requests
in a way that minimizes dilution of non-redeeming shareholders. Thus, both increased flow
volatility and decreased market liquidity could increase a fund’s liquidity risk. While staff
analysis shows that U.S. equity fund liquidity decreased sharply during the 2007-2009 financial
crisis, the cause of this decrease in liquidity is initially unclear. 637 Fund liquidity could have
decreased because of a general decrease in the liquidity of all assets in the market, or fund
liquidity could have decreased as a result trading activity—for instance, if the fund were to sell
its most liquid assets to pay redeeming shareholders or if the fund were to buy less liquid assets
because of perceived profit opportunities. Staff analysis, however, suggests that decreases in the
liquidity of U.S. equity funds are generally driven by changes in market liquidity and that funds

636

See proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)(A)(1).

637

DERA Study, supra note 39, at pp. 30-31.

289

do limited trading to offset such decreases. 638 For the average U.S. equity fund, when market
liquidity decreases by 1% from the previous quarter, fund liquidity decreases by 0.93% from the
previous quarter. Conversely, when market liquidity increases by 1% from the previous quarter,
fund liquidity increases by 0.82% from the previous quarter. 639 So, while the results are
consistent with the view that U.S. equity funds actively manage their portfolio liquidity, funds
appear to make only minor adjustment to their portfolio in response to changes in market
liquidity. 640
This analysis demonstrates that fund portfolio liquidity tends to be lower during periods
of decreased market liquidity. Based on this analysis, if a shareholder were to redeem shares
during a period of decreased market liquidity, funds would likely have a less liquid portfolio of
assets available to sell to meet redemptions. To the extent that selling those relatively less liquid
assets requires the fund to accept a discount from the assets’ market value, the value of the
fund’s shares would be negatively affected. Our staff’s analysis thus highlights a source of
potential concern regarding investor protection, reinforcing our motivation to propose
regulations to better protect investors by enhancing funds’ liquidity risk management. A primary
benefit of the proposed liquidity risk management program requirement, discussed below, is the
potential for the requirement to improve investor protection by decreasing the likelihood that a

reflect the liquidity of funds’ non-cash (or cash equivalent) holdings is limited to an analysis of U.S. equity
funds, on account of limitations in the availability of current data with respect to the holdings of funds that
are not U.S. equity funds. See also supra notes 622-623 and accompanying text.

639

640

Funds may be unable to fully offset decreases in market liquidity because of their investment mandate. A
small cap mutual fund cannot simply begin buying only large cap stocks just because the liquidity of small
cap stocks has decreased.

290

fund would be unable to meet its redemption obligations, or meet such obligations by materially
affecting the fund’s NAV. 641
d. Trends in Fund Strategies to Meet Redemption Requests
A fund may meet redemption requests in a variety of ways, including by using available
cash to pay all redemptions. If a fund were to sell portfolio assets in order to meet redemption
requests, the fund’s portfolio liquidity will be affected by the choice of which assets will be sold.
Subsequent rebalancing of the fund’s portfolio after redemptions are met will also affect
portfolio liquidity. For example, a fund facing a large redemption request can lessen the price
impact of selling assets by selling the most liquid portion of the portfolio. 642 That choice benefits
non-redeeming investors by minimizing the loss in fund value due to the price impact of selling,
but it also could increase the liquidity risk of the fund portfolio. 643 If the fund instead were to sell
a “strip” of the portfolio (i.e., a cross-section or representative selection of the fund’s portfolio
assets), the impact on fund value may be greater, but the liquidity of the fund portfolio would be
unchanged as a result of the sale. Funds also could choose to meet redemptions by selling a
range of assets in between its most liquid, on one end of the spectrum, and a perfect pro rata strip
of assets, on the other end of the spectrum. Additionally, funds could choose to opportunistically
pare back or eliminate holdings in a particular asset or sector to meet redemptions.

641

See infra section IV.C.1.b.

642

We note that in some instances, selling only the most liquid assets to meet a large redemption could be
inconsistent with the fund’s investment mandate. For example, if a fund’s investment mandate required it
to hold a certain percentage of its portfolio in equities, the fund might not be able to sell a large portion of
its equity holdings to meet redemption requests and still hold the required percentage of its portfolio in
equities.

643

See, e.g., supra note 37 (discussing recent circumstances in which, during a year of heavy redemptions that
caused a high yield bond fund’s assets to shrink 33% in this period, the fund’s holdings of bonds rated
triple-C or below grew to 47% of assets, from 35% before the redemptions).

291

Staff analysis of the impact of large redemptions on portfolio liquidity suggests that the
typical U.S. equity fund does not sell a strip of its portfolio assets to meet redemptions, but
instead appears—based on changes in funds’ portfolio liquidity following net outflows—to
disproportionately sell the more liquid portion of its portfolio for this purpose. 644 Similarly, staff
analysis shows that when a U.S. municipal bond fund encounters net outflows, the typical U.S.
municipal bond fund will experience an increase in its holdings of municipal bonds (and a
decrease in its holdings of cash and cash equivalents), thus decreasing the fund’s overall
portfolio liquidity. 645 This suggests that U.S. municipal bond funds tend to satisfy redemption
requests with cash, and not by selling a strip of the fund’s portfolio assets.
Holding all else equal, as the liquidity of a U.S. equity fund portfolio decreases, the price
impact of selling a strip of that portfolio increases. 646 As a result, we would expect less liquid
U.S. equity funds to have greater incentive to meet redemption requests by selling their most
liquid assets rather than a strip of their portfolio. Staff analysis suggests that, as initial liquidity
decreases, U.S. equity funds do become more likely to disproportionately sell their relatively
more liquid assets, rather than strips of their portfolio, to meet redemptions. 647 That choice has
the effect of decreasing the liquidity of the portfolio, which could potentially disadvantage
non-redeeming shareholders by increasing the fund’s liquidity risk. 648 As discussed below, we

the staff’s assumptions that a decrease in the holdings of municipal bonds by a U.S. municipal bond fund
would increase the fund’s liquidity, as well as the reasons that the staff does not make similar assumptions
about funds other than U.S. municipal bond funds).

price impact. When using this measure, price impact increases when liquidity decreases, by definition.

note 621.

decreased possibility that a fund’s actions taken in order to pay redemptions would result in
negative effects on the fund’s liquidity profile that could ultimately harm non-redeeming
shareholders. 649

Fund Industry Developments Highlighting the Importance of Funds’ Liquidity
Risk Management
a.

Overview

Along with staff analysis of economic relationships regarding funds’ portfolio liquidity,
evaluating recent fund industry developments also point to concerns about the need for funds to
have liquidity risk management programs that will reduce the risk that funds will be unable to
meet redemption obligations without materially affecting the fund’s NAV or risk profile and
mitigate dilution of interests of fund shareholders. 650 These developments include the growth in
assets managed by funds with strategies that are generally viewed as concentrating in relatively
less liquid asset holdings, as well as the growth in assets managed by funds with strategies that
tend to exhibit relatively high portfolio flow volatility, which could give rise to increased
liquidity risk. This section provides details about these industry trends.
Below we discuss the size and growth of the U.S. fund industry generally, as well as the
growth of various investment strategies within the industry. We show that the fund industry has
grown significantly in the past two decades, and during this period, funds with international
strategies, fixed income funds, and funds with alternative strategies have grown particularly
quickly. We also examine trends regarding the volatility and predictability of fund flows,
Amihud, supra note 621, at 31), non-redeeming investors might not be aware of the change in portfolio
liquidity and would therefore maintain an allocation that does not reflect their liquidity risk preference.

293

discussing in particular those types of funds that demonstrate notably volatile and unpredictable
flows. Because volatility and predictability in a fund’s flows can affect the extent to which the
fund is able to meet expected and reasonably foreseeable redemption requests without materially
affecting a fund’s NAV or dilution of the interests of fund shareholders, assessing trends
regarding these factors can provide information about sectors of the fund industry that could be
particularly susceptible to liquidity risk.
While we believe that these trends are relevant from the perspective of addressing
potential liquidity risk in the fund industry (and in funds’ underlying portfolio assets), we
emphasize that liquidity risk is not confined to certain types of funds or investment strategies.
Although we recognize that certain fund characteristics could make a fund relatively more prone
to liquidity risk, we believe that all types of funds entail liquidity risk to some extent. 651 Thus,
while in this section we discuss certain types of funds and strategies that are generally considered
to exhibit increased liquidity risk, we are not asserting that only these types of funds and
strategies involve liquidity risk, or that a fund of the type and with the strategy discussed below
necessarily demonstrates greater liquidity risk than a fund that does not have these same
characteristics.
b. Size and Growth of the U.S. Fund Industry and Various Investment
Strategies Within the Industry
Open-end funds and ETFs manage a significant and growing amount of assets in U.S.
financial markets. As of the end of 2014, there were 8,734 open-end funds (excluding money
market funds, but including ETFs), as compared to 5,279 at the end of 1996. 652 The assets of

651

See supra section III.A.2.

652

See 2015 ICI Fact Book, supra note 3, at 177, 184.

294

these funds were $15.05 trillion in 2014, having grown from about $2.63 trillion in 1996.653
Within these figures, the number of ETFs and ETFs’ assets have increased notably in the past
decade. There were 1,411 ETFs in 2014, as opposed to a mere 119 in 2003, and ETFs’ assets
have increased from $151 billion in 2003 to $1.9 trillion in 2014. 654
U.S. equity funds represent the greatest percentage of U.S. open-end fund industry
assets. 655 Excluding ETFs, money market funds and variable annuities, open-end U.S. equity
funds held 44.5% of U.S. fund industry assets as of the end of 2014. The investment strategies
with the next-highest percentages of U.S. fund industry assets are foreign equity funds (15.4%),
mixed strategy funds (13.7%), and general bond funds (13.3%). 656 Funds with alternative
strategies only represent a small percentage of the U.S. fund industry assets, but as discussed
below, the number of alternative strategy funds and the assets of this sector have grown
considerably in recent years. 657
While the overall growth rate of funds’ assets has been generally high (about 8.0% per
year, between the years 2000 and 2014 658), it has varied significantly by investment strategy. 659
U.S. equity funds’ assets grew substantially in terms of dollars from the end of 2000 to 2014, 660
but this sector’s assets as a percentage of total U.S. fund industry assets decreased from about

corporate bond funds, government bond funds, and municipal bond funds also increased in terms
of dollars from 2000 to 2014, but each of these sectors’ assets as a percentage of the fund
industry decreased during this period. 662 On the other hand, the assets of foreign equity funds,
general bond funds, and foreign bond funds increased steadily and substantially as a percentage
of the fund industry over the same period. 663 For example, foreign equity funds increased
steadily from 10.6% of total industry assets in 2000 to 15.4% in 2014. And within these three

by almost 80% each year. However, as discussed above, funds with alternative strategies remain
a relatively small portion of the U.S. fund industry as a percentage of total assets. 666 While
growth in funds with alternative strategies has slowed over the past year, a rising interest rate
environment could cause inflows to these funds to increase once again, as investors look to
reduce their interest rate risk and/or increase income by investing in alternative strategies. 667
c. Significance of Fund Industry Developments
The industry developments discussed above are notable for several reasons. The growth
of funds generally over the past few decades demonstrates that investors have increasingly come
to rely on investments in funds to meet their financial needs. 668 As investments in funds increase,
the need for continued effective regulations to protect investors is paramount. Initiatives such as
the proposed liquidity regulations, which aim to promote shareholder protection by enhancing
funds’ liquidity risk management, are important to decrease the risk that funds will be unable to
meet redemption obligations and reduce potential dilution of the interests of fund shareholders.
These trends also demonstrate growth in particular types of funds that may entail
increased liquidity risk. In particular, there has been significant growth in high-yield bond funds,
emerging market debt funds, and funds with alternative strategies. Commissioners and
Commission staff have previously spoken about the need to focus on potential liquidity risks
relating to fixed income assets and fixed income funds, 669 and within this sector, funds that invest
in high-yield bonds could be subject to greater liquidity risk as they invest in lower-rated bonds

297

that tend to be less liquid than investment grade fixed income securities. 670 Emerging market
debt funds may invest in relatively illiquid securities with lengthy settlement periods. 671
Likewise, funds with alternative strategies may invest in portfolio assets that are relatively
illiquid.672 Moreover, Commission staff economists have found that both foreign bond funds
(including emerging market debt funds) and alternative strategy funds have historically
experienced relatively more volatile and unpredictable flows than the average mutual fund, 673
which could increase these funds’ liquidity risk by making it more difficult to plan to meet fund
redemptions (and thus, more likely that a fund may need to sell portfolio assets in a manner that
creates a market impact in order to pay redeeming shareholders). 674 On account of these
characteristics of high-yield bond funds, emerging market debt funds, and funds with alternative
strategies, we are concerned that the growth in these strategies could give rise to increased
concerns regarding these funds’ liquidity risk.

670

The Commission and Commission staff have cautioned that high yield securities may be considered to be
illiquid, depending on the facts and circumstances. See Interval Fund Proposing Release, supra note 83;
see also SEC Investor Bulletin, What Are High-Yield Corporate Bonds?, available at
http://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/ib_high-yield.pdf (noting that high-yield bonds may be subject to more
liquidity risk than, for example, investment-grade bonds). But see BlackRock, Viewpoint, Who Owns the
Assets?, supra note 79 (discussing the liquidity characteristics of high-yield bond funds in depth, and
noting that these funds have weathered multiple market environments, and are generally managed with
multiple sources of liquidity).

Benefits and Costs, and Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital
Formation

Taking into account the goals of the proposed liquidity regulations and the economic
baseline, as discussed above, this section explores the benefits and costs of the proposed liquidity
regulations, as well as the potential effects of the proposed liquidity regulations on efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. This section also discusses reasonable alternatives to
proposed rule 22e-4, proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3), and the proposed disclosure and reporting
requirements regarding funds’ liquidity risk and liquidity risk management and swing pricing.
1.

Proposed Rule 22e-4
a.

Requirements of Proposed Rule 22e-4

Proposed rule 22e-4 would require each fund to establish a written liquidity risk
management program. The proposed rule specifies that a fund’s liquidity risk management
program shall include the following required program elements: (i) classification and ongoing
review of the classification of the liquidity of each of the fund’s positions in a portfolio asset (or
portions of a position in a particular asset), taking into account certain specified factors set forth
in the rule; 675 (ii) assessment and periodic review of the fund’s liquidity risk taking into account
certain specified factors set forth in the rule; 676 and (iii) management of the fund’s liquidity
risk. 677 A fund’s policies and procedures for managing liquidity risk, in turn, must incorporate
the determination and periodic review of the adequacy of a fund’s three-day liquid asset
minimum (that is, the percentage of the fund’s net assets that must be invested in three-day liquid

assets). 678 Proposed rule 22e-4 would also prohibit a fund from acquiring any: (i) less liquid
asset, if immediately after the acquisition, the fund would have invested less than its three-day
liquid asset minimum in three-day liquid assets; 679 or (ii) 15% standard asset, if immediately after
the acquisition, the fund would have invested more than 15% of its net assets in 15% standard
assets. 680 In addition, proposed rule 22e-4 would require a fund to establish policies and
procedures regarding redemptions in kind, to the extent that the fund engages in or reserves the
right to engage in redemptions in kind.681
A fund’s board, including a majority of the fund’s independent directors, would be
required to approve the fund’s liquidity risk management program (including the fund’s
three-day liquid asset minimum), as well as any material change to the program. 682 The fund
would be required to designate the fund’s adviser or officers responsible for administering the
program, and such designation is required to be approved by the fund’s board of directors. 683
The fund’s board would also be required to review, at least annually, a written report prepared by
the fund’s investment adviser or officers administering the liquidity risk management program
reviewing the adequacy of the fund’s liquidity risk management program, including the fund’s
three-day liquid asset minimum, and the effectiveness of its implementation. 684
Proposed rule 22e-4 also includes certain recordkeeping requirements. A fund would be
required to keep a written copy of its liquidity risk management policies and procedures, as well

its three-day liquid asset minimum, and any adjustments thereto, were determined. 686
b.

Benefits

We believe that proposed rule 22e-4 is likely to produce benefits for current and potential
fund investors. Specifically, we believe that the proposed program requirement is likely to
improve investor protection by decreasing the chance that a fund would be unable to meet its
redemption obligations, would meet such obligations only by materially affecting the fund’s
NAV, or would meet such obligations through methods that would have other adverse impacts
on non-redeeming investors (e.g., increased risk exposure and decreased liquidity). Funds are
not currently subject to specific requirements under the federal securities laws or Commission
rules obliging them to manage their liquidity risk. 687 Also, with the exception of money market
funds, funds are currently guided by Commission guidelines (not rules) that generally limit their
investment in illiquid assets. 688 As discussed above, funds today employ notably different
practices for assessing and classifying the liquidity of their portfolio assets, as well as for
assessing and managing fund liquidity risk. Some of these practices take into account multiple
aspects relating to portfolio assets’ liquidity (including relevant market, trading, and
asset-specific factors), involve comprehensive assessment and robust management of fund
liquidity risk, and incorporate ongoing review of both portfolio liquidity and fund liquidity risk.

301

Outreach by Commission staff has found that practices of some funds raise concerns regarding
various funds’ ability to meet their redemption obligations and lessen the effects of dilution.
Also, while some funds have independent oversight of their liquidity risk outside of the portfolio
management process, others do not. While a fund’s portfolio management has access to a great
deal of information relevant to the liquidity of the fund’s portfolio assets, and thus pertinent to
the fund’s liquidity risk, a portfolio manager may have conflicts of interest that could impede
effective liquidity risk management. 689 For example, because investments in relatively less liquid
assets may result in higher total returns for a fund, fund managers may have incentive to increase
their funds’ investment in illiquid assets levels in a manner that is potentially inconsistent with
the funds’ expected and reasonably foreseeable redemptions. Consequently, to the extent that
some funds do not currently meet the minimum baseline requirements for fund assessment and
management of liquidity risk proposed in this rule, investor protection would be enhanced by
reducing the risk that funds will be unable to meet redemption obligations and mitigating dilution
of fund shareholders.
We believe that the proposed liquidity risk management program requirement would
promote improved alignment of the liquidity of the fund’s portfolio with the fund’s expected
(and reasonably foreseeable) levels of redemptions. As discussed above, proposed rule 22e-4
would require each fund to consider a standard set of factors, as applicable, in classifying the
liquidity of its portfolio assets and in assessing its liquidity risk, and to determine a three-day
liquid asset minimum to increase the likelihood that the fund will hold adequate liquid assets to
meet redemption requests without materially affecting the fund’s NAV. Each fund would have
flexibility to determine the particular assets that it holds in connection with its three-day liquid
689

See text accompanying supra note 258.

302

asset minimum. Assets eligible for inclusion in a fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum
holdings could include a broad variety of securities, as well as cash and cash equivalents. While
one fund may conclude that it is appropriate to hold a significant portion of its three-day liquid
assets in cash and cash equivalents, another could decide it is appropriate to hold assets that are
convertible to cash within longer periods (but not exceeding three business days) as the majority
of its three-day liquid asset minimum holdings. We believe that the proposed three-day liquid
asset minimum requirement would allow funds to continue to meet a wide variety of investors’
investment needs by obliging funds to maintain appropriate liquidity in their portfolios, while
permitting funds to remain substantially invested in portfolio assets that conform to their
investment strategies. The limitation on acquisition of 15% standard assets would complement
the three-day liquid asset minimum requirement to increase the likelihood that a fund’s portfolio
is not overly concentrated in assets whose liquidity is extraordinarily limited.
We believe that the proposed rule also would decrease the probability that a fund will be
able to meet redemption requests only through activities that can materially affect the fund’s
NAV or risk profile or dilute the interests of fund shareholders. For example, when a fund does
not effectively manage liquidity and is faced with significant redemptions, it may be forced to
sell portfolio assets under unfavorable circumstances, which could create significant negative
price pressure on those assets. 690 This, in turn, could disadvantage non-redeeming shareholders
by decreasing the value of those shareholders’ interests in the fund. 691 Even if a fund were to sell
the most liquid portion of its portfolio to meet redemption requests, which would minimize the
loss in fund value due to the price impact of selling, these asset sales could decrease the liquidity
690

See Coval & Stafford, supra note 51 (discussing how mutual fund fire sales impact asset prices).

of the fund portfolio, potentially creating increased liquidity risk for non-redeeming
shareholders. As discussed above, staff analysis suggests that U.S. equity funds may dispose of
relatively more liquid assets first, as opposed to selling a pro rata “strip” of the fund’s portfolio
assets, which minimizes price impact on a fund in the short term, but ultimately decreases the
liquidity of the fund’s portfolio. 692 Short-term borrowings by a fund to meet redemption requests
also could disadvantage non-redeeming shareholders by leveraging the fund and requiring the
fund to pay interest on the borrowed funds (although, in some instances, the costs of borrowing
may be less than the costs of selling assets to meet redemptions). For example, in a settled
enforcement action, the Commission found that certain high-yield bond funds experienced
liquidity problems and as a result, the funds borrowed heavily against a line of credit to meet
fund redemption requests, which permitted shareholders to redeem fund shares at prices above
the fair value of the fund’s holdings. The result was a benefit to redeeming shareholders at the
expense of remaining and new shareholders. 693 Moreover, the costs of borrowing (that is, the
costs associated with maintaining a committed line of credit, as well as interest expenses
associated with drawing on a credit line) could be passed on to fund shareholders in the form of
fund operating expenses, which could adversely affect a fund’s NAV. It is possible that such
costs could exceed any price impact caused by asset sales conducted to generate liquidity,
particularly since the costs of maintaining a committed line of credit are ongoing costs, whereas
the price impact caused by asset sales could be only temporary. To the extent that the proposed
program requirement results in liquidity risk assessment and management that enhance funds’
ability to meet redemption obligations, it would be less likely that a fund takes actions to pay

See supra note 39 and accompanying discussion.

693

304

redemptions that would materially affect the fund’s NAV or have other adverse impacts on
non-redeeming shareholders.
The potential negative consequences of asset sales effected to pay fund redemptions
could create incentives in times of liquidity stress in the markets for early redemptions, or a
“first-mover advantage.” 694 For example, recent academic studies have suggested that an
incentive exists for market participants to front-run trades conducted by a fund in response to
significant changes in fund flows. 695 This suggests that sophisticated fund investors could
anticipate that significant fund outflows could lead a fund to conduct trades that would
disadvantage non-redeeming shareholders, which could create an incentive to redeem ahead of
such trades. Among U.S. equity funds, staff analysis suggests that, as a fund’s liquidity
decreases, a fund will become more likely to sell its relatively more liquid assets to pay
redemptions (thus resulting in decreased liquidity in the fund’s portfolio). 696 Thus, if investors’
redemptions are motivated by a first-mover advantage, this could lead to increasing levels of
redemptions, and as the level of outflows from a fund increases, the incentive to redeem also
increases. Any negative effects on non-redeeming shareholders thus could be magnified by a
first-mover advantage to the extent that this dynamic produces growing redemptions and
decreased portfolio liquidity. While we understand that fund investors may not have historically
been motivated to redeem on account of a perceived (or actual) first-mover advantage during

694

See supra note 49 and accompanying text (discussing the possibility of a first-mover advantage with
respect to the timing of shareholder redemption from funds). But see supra note 50 (discussing arguments
that such a first-mover advantage does not exist in funds, as well as arguments that even if incentives to
redeem ahead of other shareholders do exist, this does not necessarily imply that investors will in fact
redeem en masse in times of market stress).

305

previous periods of stress, 697 we cannot predict how investors may behave in the future. The
first-mover advantage is more commonly referenced with respect to money market funds, but the
incentives that have been argued to create the first-mover advantage among those funds exist (in
possibly weaker form) among other open-end funds. To the extent that economic incentives
exist to redeem fund shares prematurely, this could lead to investor dilution as discussed above,
and the possibility of protecting against this potential dilution is one motivating aspect (but not
the only or key motivating aspect 698) of the overall goal of investor protection that we believe the
proposed rule 22e-4 would accomplish.
We recognize that certain funds already engage in fairly comprehensive liquidity risk
management practices, and the proposed program requirement would likely benefit these funds’
shareholders less than it would benefit the shareholders of funds that do not employ equally
rigorous practices. The proposed program requirement aims to promote a minimum baseline in
the fund industry, both in the assessment of portfolio assets’ liquidity and the evaluation of
factors relevant to liquidity risk management. This, in turn, we believe would promote investor
protection by elevating the overall quality of liquidity risk management across the fund industry,
reducing the likelihood that funds will meet redemption obligations only through activities that
could materially affect fund NAVs or risk profiles, and mitigating dilution of shareholder
interests. We cannot quantify the total benefits to fund operations and investor protection that
we discuss above, but to the extent that staff outreach has noted that some funds currently have

4; ICI FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 16, at 7; Nuveen FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra
note 45, at 10 (all arguing that evidence shows that fund shareholders’ redemptions are largely driven by
other concerns rather than a theoretical first-mover advantage).

698

See supra notes 690-693 and accompanying text.

306

no (or very limited) formal liquidity risk management programs in place, proposed rule 22e-4
would enhance current liquidity risk management practices.
We also believe that the liquidity risk management program requirement, as proposed,
would not adversely impact fund diversity and investor choice. While the proposed liquidity risk
management program requirement would include certain required elements, and would require a
fund to consider certain specified factors in classifying the liquidity of its portfolio assets and
assessing its liquidity risk, it would not produce a de facto prohibition against certain investment
strategies. We anticipate that the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum requirement would
be sufficiently flexible to permit funds with different investment strategies, and whose cash flow
and liquidity needs vary notably from one fund to the next, to manage their individual levels of
liquidity risk. This proposed requirement would not mandate a standard level of minimum liquid
asset holdings across the fund industry. Proposed rule 22e-4 thus would allow a fund with a
relatively less liquid investment strategy to continue operating under that strategy, so long as the
fund determines a three-day liquid asset minimum that takes into account the factors required to
be considered under the proposed rule, and invests its assets in compliance with its three-day
liquid asset minimum. (We recognize, however, that the proposed rule could result in a fund
modifying its portfolio composition if it determines that the three-day liquid asset minimum that
it should hold, as a result of its consideration of the required factors specified in the proposed
rule, does not correspond with the fund’s current portfolio composition. 699) The proposed
requirement would not adversely impact the diversity of investment strategies within the fund

699

See infra section IV.C.1.c.

307

industry and would permit a fund investor to choose appropriate investment options for his or her
risk tolerance and risk preferences. 700
Finally, to the extent that the proposed program requirement results in funds less
frequently needing to sell portfolio assets in unfavorable market conditions in order to meet
redemptions, the proposed requirement also could lower potential spillover risks that funds could
pose to the financial markets generally. For example, the proposed approach could decrease the
risk that all investors holding an asset would be affected if a fund facing heavy redemptions were
forced to sell portfolio assets under unfavorable circumstances, which in turn could create
significant negative price pressure on those assets. If, as a result of the proposed program
requirement, a fund was prepared to meet redemption requests in other ways, the proposed rule
could decrease the risk that the fund might indirectly transmit stress to other market sectors and
participants. While there have been examples of funds’ liquidity risk management preventing
spillover market effects that could have arisen in the face of significant shareholder redemptions,
this prevention of larger market effects has occurred because of funds’ organic liquidity risk
management practices, and not because of any specific liquidity risk management requirements.
It is unclear whether such organic practices will be sufficient to prevent future spillover market
events of similar or greater magnitude. The proposed rule should help all funds, not just funds
with liquidity risk management practices currently in place, operate in a manner that lessens the
chance of spillover risks. We are unable to quantify this potential benefit because we cannot
predict the extent to which funds would enhance their current liquidity risk management

We also believe that investor choice would be facilitated by the proposed enhanced disclosure
requirements, as discussed below at section IV.C.3.b.

practices as a result of proposed rule 22e-4, or predict the precise circumstances that could entail
negative spillover effects in light of less-comprehensive liquidity risk management by funds. 701
c.

Costs

One-Time and Ongoing Costs Associated With Program Establishment and
Implementation
Funds would incur one-time costs to establish and implement a liquidity risk management
program in compliance with proposed rule 22e-4, as well as ongoing program-related costs. As
discussed above, funds today employ a range of different practices, with varying levels of
comprehensiveness, for assessing and classifying the liquidity of their portfolio assets, as well as
for assessing and managing fund liquidity risk. Accordingly, funds whose practices regarding
portfolio asset liquidity classification and liquidity risk assessment and management most closely
align with the proposed liquidity risk management program requirements would incur relatively
lower costs to comply with proposed rule 22e-4. Funds whose practices for classifying the
liquidity of their portfolio assets and for assessing and managing liquidity risk are less
comprehensive or not closely aligned with our proposals, on the other hand, may incur relatively
higher initial compliance costs.
Our staff estimates that the one-time costs necessary to establish and implement a
liquidity risk management program would range from $1.3 million to $2.25 million702 per fund

701

The ability of the Commission to perform such analysis is limited by difficulties in both gathering data
about funds’ liquidity risk management practices and quantifying such data.

702

These cost estimates are based in part on the staff’s recent estimates of the one-time systems costs
associated with implementing the fees and gates provisions of the 2014 amendments to rule 2a-7 under the
1940 Act. See 2014 Money Market Fund Reform Adopting Release, supra note 85, at section III.A.5.b.
Although the substance and content of systems associated with establishing and implementing a liquidity
risk management program (including any systems changes associated with classifying the liquidity of
funds’ portfolio positions) would be different from the substance and content of systems associated with
implementing the rule 2a-7 fees and gates provisions, the one-time costs associated with proposed rule
22e-4, like the one-time costs associated with the fees and gates provisions, would entail: drafting relevant
procedures; planning, coding, testing, and installing relevant system modifications; integrating and

309

complex, depending on the particular facts and circumstances and current liquidity risk
management practices of the funds comprising the fund complex. 703 These estimated costs are
attributable to the following activities, as applicable to each of the funds within the complex: (i)
developing policies and procedures relating to each of the required program elements, 704 and the
related recordkeeping requirements of the proposed rule; (ii) planning, coding, testing, and
installing any system modifications relating to each of the required program elements; (iii)
integrating and implementing policies and procedures relating to each of the required program

implementing relevant procedures; and preparing training materials and administering training sessions for
staff in affected areas. See id. However, in estimating the one-time costs associated with proposed rule
22e-4, staff has adjusted the estimated one-time systems costs associated with implementing the fees and
gates provisions to reflect that the estimated costs associated with implementing the fees and gates
provisions include costs to be incurred by the fund and others in the distribution chain (including transfer
agents, accountants, custodians, and intermediaries), whose services would be needed if a fund were to
impose a fee or gate, whereas we anticipate that the proposed rule 22e-4 requirements would be borne
primarily by a fund complex and not by others in the distribution chain.
We note that the estimated one-time systems costs associated with implementing the fees and gates
provisions of the 2014 amendments to rule 2a-7 are generally similar to the proposed estimated one-time
systems costs associated with implementing the floating NAV provisions of the 2014 rule 2a-7
amendments. See id. at section III.B.8.a. However, the proposed estimated one-time systems costs
associated with implementing the floating NAV provisions were adjusted downward at adoption, to
account for certain considerations specific to the floating NAV reforms. Thus, staff believes that the
one-time costs associated with the fees and gates provisions would provide a closer analogue to the
estimated costs associated with proposed rule 22e-4 than the one-time costs associated with the floating
NAV provisions.
703

This estimate assumes that each fund would not bear all of the estimated costs (particularly, the costs of
systems modification) on an individual basis, but instead that these costs would likely be allocated among
the multiple users of the systems, that is, each of the members of a fund complex. Accordingly, we expect
that, in general, funds within large fund complexes would incur fewer costs on a per fund basis than funds
within smaller fund complexes, due to economies of scale in allocating costs among a group of users.

704

Specifically, a fund would be required to establish policies and procedures relating to: (i) classification and
ongoing review of the classification of the liquidity of each of the fund’s positions in a portfolio asset (or
portions of a position in a particular asset) (proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(i)-(ii)); (ii) assessment and ongoing
review of the fund’s liquidity risk (proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)); (iii) determination and periodic review
of the adequacy of the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum (proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(A)-(B)); (iv)
the requirement for the fund not to acquire any less liquid asset if, immediately after the acquisition, the
fund would have invested less than its three-day liquid asset minimum in three-day liquid assets (proposed
rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(C)); (v) the requirement for the fund not to acquire any 15% standard asset if,
immediately after the acquisition, the fund would have invested more than 15% of its net assets in 15%
standard assets (proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(D)); and (vi) the requirement to establish policies and
procedures regarding redemptions in kind, to the extent that the fund engages in or reserves the right to
engage in redemptions in kind (proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(E)).

elements (including classifying the liquidity of each of the fund’s positions in a portfolio asset
(or portions of a position in a particular asset) in a portfolio asset pursuant to proposed rule
22e-4(b)(2)(i)), as well as the recordkeeping requirements of the proposed rule; (iv) preparing
training materials and administering training sessions for staff in affected areas; and (v) board
approval of the program. We anticipate that if there is demand to develop policies and
procedures relating to each of the required program elements, third parties may develop
programs that fund complexes could purchase for less than our estimated cost to develop the
programs themselves. Indeed, we understand that third parties have already developed programs
to classify the liquidity of portfolio assets, which are currently available for purchase. 705 Because
the proposed requirement for a fund to limit acquisition of 15% standard assets under certain
circumstances is similar to existing Commission guidelines, we assume that a fund complex
would incur minimal costs associated with implementing the proposed requirement to limit
acquisition of 15% standard assets with respect to each of its respective funds. 706
We anticipate that, depending on the personnel (and/or third party service providers)
involved with respect to the activities associated with establishing and implementing a liquidity
risk management program, certain of the estimated one-time costs could be borne by the fund,
and others could be borne by the fund’s adviser. This cost allocation would be dependent on the
facts and circumstances of a particular fund’s liquidity risk management program, and thus we
cannot specify the extent to which the estimated costs would typically be allocated to the fund as

705

See text accompanying supra note 205 (discussing proposed Commission guidance on a fund’s use of
third-party service providers to obtain data to inform or supplement its consideration of the proposed
liquidity classification factors).
We understand, based on staff outreach, that annual costs to subscribe to the liquidity classification services
provided by third-party data and analytics providers currently range from $50,000 - $500,000.

706

See supra section III.C.4.a.

opposed to the adviser. Estimated costs that are allocated to the fund would be borne by fund
shareholders in the form of fund operating expenses.
Staff estimates that each fund complex would incur ongoing program-related costs, as a
result of proposed rule 22e-4, that range from 10% to 25% of the one-time costs necessary to
establish and implement a liquidity risk management program. 707 Thus, staff estimates that a
fund complex would incur ongoing annual costs associated with proposed rule 22e-4 that would
range from $130,000 to $562,500. 708 These costs are attributable to the following activities, as
applicable to each of the funds within the complex: (i) classification and ongoing review of the
classification of the liquidity of each of the fund’s positions in a portfolio asset (or portions of a
position in a particular asset) (proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(i)-(ii)); (ii) ongoing review of the fund’s
liquidity risk (proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)); (iii) periodic review of the adequacy of the fund’s
three-day liquid asset minimum (proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(B)); (iv) systems maintenance;
(v) additional staff training; (vi) approval by the board of any material change to the fund’s
liquidity risk management program (including a change to the fund’s three-day liquid asset
minimum) (proposed rule 22e-4(b)(3)(i)); (vii) periodic reports to the board of directors
reviewing the adequacy of the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum (proposed rule

707

These cost estimates are based in part on the staff’s recent estimates of the ongoing costs associated with
implementing the fees and gates provisions of the 2014 amendments to rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act. See
supra note 702 (discussing why staff believes that the costs associated with the fees and gates provisions
could be useful to estimate the costs associated with proposed rule 22e-4). In estimating the ongoing costs
associated with proposed rule 22e-4, staff has adjusted the ongoing costs associated with implementing the
fees and gates provisions to reflect that we anticipate that the costs associated with classifying the liquidity
of a fund’s portfolio positions would entail the majority of the ongoing costs associated with proposed rule
22e-4. Staff estimates that these costs, in conjunction with other ongoing costs, would exceed the estimated
ongoing costs associated with the fees and gates provisions, and thus staff has adjusted these estimates
upward (based in part on staff knowledge of costs associated with liquidity analyses prepared by third-party
service providers, as well as knowledge of the costs associated with board approval to the extent that a
fund’s board were required to approve a modified three-day liquid asset minimum).

708

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 0.10 x $1,300,000 = $130,000; 0.25 x $2,250,000 =
$562,500.

22e-4(b)(3)(ii)); and (viii) recordkeeping relating to the fund’s liquidity risk management
program (proposed rule 22e-4(c)). 709
For purposes of this analysis, Commission staff estimates, based on outreach conducted
with a variety of funds regarding funds’ current liquidity risk management practices, that
approximately 1/3 of currently-operational fund complexes (or 289 complexes 710) would incur
one-time and ongoing costs on the high end of the range of costs associated with establishing and
implementing a liquidity risk management program, and 2/3 of currently-operational fund
complexes (or 578 complexes 711) would incur one-time and ongoing costs on the low end of the

709

We anticipate that, depending on the personnel (and/or third party service providers) involved in the
activities associated with administering a liquidity risk management program, certain of the estimated
ongoing costs associated with these activities could be borne by the fund, and others could be borne by the
adviser. See paragraph following supra note 706.

710

In developing the estimate that 289 fund complexes would incur one-time and ongoing costs on the high
end of the range of costs associated with establishing and implementing a liquidity risk management
program, the staff assumed that that fund complexes that include investment grade bond funds, high yield
bond funds, world bond funds (including emerging market bond funds), multi-sector bond funds, state
municipal funds, alternative strategy funds, and emerging market equity funds, as well as ETFs with any of
these strategies, would incur costs on the high end of the range, and all other complexes would incur costs
on the low end of the range. The staff assumed that the percentage of fund complexes that includes these
selected investment strategies, as a fraction of all fund complexes, is the same as the percentage of all
mutual funds (excluding money market funds) and ETFs that these strategies represent. The actual number
of fund complexes that includes these selected strategies could be higher or lower than the number
calculated using this assumption.
605 investment grade bond mutual funds + 241 high yield bond mutual funds + 347 world bond mutual
funds + 139 multi-sector bond mutual funds + 322 state municipal mutual funds + 376 alternative strategy
funds that are equity funds (alternative strategy funds that are bond funds are included in our estimates of
the number of bond mutual funds) + 469 emerging market equity mutual funds + 264 bond ETFs + 165
emerging market ETFs = 2,928 funds. 2,928 funds ÷ 8,734 open-end funds (excluding money market
funds, and including ETFs) = approximately 33% = approximately 1/3. 1/3 x 867 currently-operational
fund complexes = 289 fund complexes. These estimates are based on figures included in the 2015 ICI Fact
Book. See 2015 ICI Fact Book, supra note 3, at Fig. 1.8.

711

In developing the estimate that 578 fund complexes would incur one-time and ongoing costs on the high
end of the range of costs associated with establishing and implementing a liquidity risk management
program, the staff assumed that that fund complexes that include investment grade bond funds, high yield
bond funds, world bond funds (including emerging market bond funds), multi-sector bond funds, state
municipal funds, alternative strategy funds, and emerging market equity funds, as well as ETFs with any of
these strategies, would incur costs on the high end of the range, and all other complexes would incur costs
on the low end of the range. The staff assumed that the percentage of fund complexes that includes these
selected investment strategies, as a fraction of all fund complexes, is the same as the percentage of all
mutual funds (excluding money market funds) and ETFs that these strategies represent. The actual number
of fund complexes that includes these selected strategies could be higher or lower than the number

313

range. Based on these estimates, staff further estimates that the total aggregate one-time costs
for all funds to establish and implement a liquidity risk management program would be
approximately $1.4 billion. 712 In addition, staff estimates that the aggregate annual costs
associated with the liquidity risk management program requirement would be approximately
$240 million.713
Certain elements of the program requirement may entail marked variability in related
compliance costs, depending on a fund’s particular circumstances and sources of potential
liquidity risk. The process of classifying the liquidity of each of a fund’s positions in a portfolio
asset, taking into account the factors specified under proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii), could give
rise to varying costs depending on the fund’s particular investment strategy. For example, a U.S.
large cap equity fund would likely incur relatively few costs to obtain the data necessary to
consider the required factors. On the other hand, a fund that invests in assets for which relevant
market, trading, and other liquidity-relevant data is less readily available would incur relatively
greater costs associated with the classification, and ongoing review of the classification, of the
funds’ portfolio positions’ liquidity. Certain of the factors that a fund would be required to
consider in assessing its liquidity risk also could entail relatively greater costs, depending on the
fund’s circumstances. For instance, a fund with a relatively short operating history could incur

calculated using this assumption.
8,734 open-end funds (excluding money market funds, and including ETFs) - 2,928 funds (see supra note
710) = 5,806 funds. 5,806 funds ÷ 8,734 open-end funds (excluding money market funds, and including
ETFs) = approximately 66% = approximately 2/3. 2/3 x 867 currently-operational fund complexes = 578
fund complexes. These estimates are based on figures included in the 2015 ICI Fact Book. See 2015 ICI
Fact Book, supra note 3, at Fig. 1.8.
712

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (578 fund complexes x $1,300,000 = $751,400,000) +
(289 fund complexes x $2,250,000 = $650,250,000) = $1,401,165,000.

713

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (578 fund complexes x $130,000 = $75,140,000) +
(289 fund complexes x $562,500 = $162,562,500) = $237,702,500.

314

greater costs in assessing the fund’s cash flow projections than a similarly situated fund with a
relatively long operating history. This is because the newer fund could find it appropriate to
assess redemption activity in similar funds during normal and stressed periods (to predict its
future cash flow patterns), which could entail additional costs to gather and analyze relevant data
about these comparison funds. Also, a fund whose shares are held largely through omnibus
accounts may wish to periodically request shareholder information from financial intermediaries
in order to determine how the fund’s ownership concentration may affect its cash flow
projections. These data requests, and related analyses, could cause a fund to incur costs that
another fund, whose shares are largely held directly, would not. A fund that deems it appropriate
to establish and implement additional liquidity risk management policies and procedures beyond
those specifically required under the proposed rule also would incur additional related costs.
While we recognize that, as described above, the costs to establish and implement a liquidity risk
management program in compliance with proposed rule 22e-4 will depend to some degree on the
level of liquidity risk facing the fund, we are unable to discuss in detail all of the ways in which a
fund’s individual risks and circumstances could affect the costs associated with establishing a
liquidity risk management program.
A fund may incur costs if it decides to reallocate portfolio assets to correspond with its
initial or subsequently modified three-day liquid asset minimum. While we are unable to
anticipate how many funds may reallocate portfolio assets in this way, or the extent of such
reallocation by any fund that does so, we anticipate that the transaction-related costs of any such
reallocation will not be significant for most funds. This is because some funds may not need to
reallocate portfolio assets at all to correspond with their three-day liquid asset minimum, and
those that decide to do so would be able to gradually adjust their portfolios in order to buy and

315

sell portfolio positions during times that are financially advantageous. We note that the
three-day liquid asset minimum requirement would limit the acquisition of less liquid assets
when such acquisition would result in a fund investing less than its three-day liquid asset
minimum in three-day liquid assets, but would not require funds always to maintain a certain
portion of their portfolio assets in three-day liquid assets. 714 Thus, while a fund may decide to
reallocate its portfolio to correspond with its three-day liquid asset minimum by the time of the
proposed compliance date or at any time the fund determined to modify the three-day liquid asset
minimum, a fund would not be required to conduct transactions in portfolio assets in any
particular timeframe, so long as it were to limit its acquisition of less liquid assets in compliance
with its three-day liquid asset minimum. If a fund wishes to reallocate its portfolio by the
proposed compliance date, we anticipate that the proposed compliance date would provide
sufficient time to do so with relatively few associated transaction costs. We request comment on
this point in section III.H above. Along with the transaction-related costs associated with any
portfolio reallocation, we recognize that this reallocation in turn could affect the performance
and/or risk profiles of funds that modify their composition, which in turn could result in costs
associated with decreased investment options available to investors and any changes to the
market for relatively less liquid assets; these costs are discussed below. 715
Potential for Decreased Investment Options and Adverse Effects
Under the proposed rule, a fund would be required to determine its three-day liquid asset
minimum based on a consideration of certain specified factors relating to the fund’s liquidity

714

See supra notes 346-348 and accompanying text.

715

See infra paragraphs accompanying notes 716-717.

316

risk. 716 Because a fund is currently not required to consider any particular factors relating to its
portfolio liquidity, we recognize that this requirement could result in a fund newly determining
its existing portfolio liquidity profile given the fund’s liquidity needs. This could lead a fund to
modify its portfolio composition if it determines that the three-day liquid asset minimum that it
should hold, as a result of its liquidity risk assessment, does not correspond with the fund’s
current portfolio composition. The proposed rule thus could result in certain funds increasing
their investments in relatively more liquid assets, which in turn could affect the performance
and/or risk profiles of funds that modify their portfolio composition in this way. This impact
may be particularly strong for funds that plan to meet redemptions within seven days after
receiving them (rather than a shorter period of time). Such modifications to funds’ portfolio
composition consequently could decrease certain investment options available to investors or
reduce investor returns. However, because these portfolio composition shifts would occur only
if a fund were to determine that it needs to adjust its existing liquidity level based on
consideration of the factors in the proposed rule, we anticipate that the potential for decreased
yield would likely only affect funds currently holding portfolios whose liquidity levels have the
potential to create redemption-related liquidity risk for fund investors. Thus, the potential for
decreased investment options for certain investors (and any related decrease in investment yield)
has the corollary benefit of potential decreased liquidity risk in the funds in which these investors
hold shares. Currently we are not able to quantify the number of funds that would need to
significantly modify their portfolios’ risk profile as a result of the proposed rule because of the
lack of information necessary to provide a reasonable estimate. Such an estimate would depend
on the number of funds that might need to modify their current portfolio composition as a result
716

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(A).

317

of the proposed rule, as well as the availability of relatively liquid assets that can act as adequate
substitutes to existing assets for those affected funds. Because funds are not required to report or
disclose information concerning the liquidity of their assets, because we cannot anticipate the
three-day liquid asset minimum that each fund would determine to be appropriate based on its
liquidity risk, and because we cannot determine what relatively more liquid assets funds would
purchase as substitutes, we are unable to quantify the total potential costs discussed in this
section. However, individual funds would only incur these costs if their current portfolio
construction lacks sufficient liquidity to allow the offering of daily redemption without creating
significant negative impact on investors.
Market for Relatively Less Liquid Assets
As discussed above, the proposed rule could result in certain funds increasing their
investments in relatively more liquid assets, which would effectively mean that these funds
would decrease their investments in relatively less liquid assets. If funds decrease their
investments in relatively less liquid assets, the market for those assets could become even less
liquid. This could discourage new issuances of similar assets and decrease the liquidity of
relatively less liquid assets that are still outstanding. The impact of decreased activity from
funds in less liquid markets will depend on how much current activity in those markets is driven
by the funds, which varies between markets. Further, these market effects could be partially
offset if other opportunistic investors with greater capacity to hold less liquid assets are attracted
to the market by any lower prices for these assets that result if funds decrease their holdings of
less liquid assets. 717 In addition, if the proposed rule leads funds to better assess the liquidity risk
717

Relatively less liquid assets have a higher expected return compared to relatively more liquid assets,
thereby compensating longer-term investors for holding relatively less liquid assets. See Yakov Amihud &
Haim Mendelson, Asset Pricing and the Bid-Ask Spread, 17 J. FIN. ECON. 223 (1986).

318

associated with certain asset holdings, any decrease in the prices of these assets could reflect
more efficient pricing of the assets (that is, risk would be better reflected in asset prices than it is
currently). Because funds currently are not required to report or disclose information concerning
the liquidity of their assets, and because we cannot anticipate the three-day liquid asset minimum
that each fund would determine to be appropriate based on its liquidity risk, it is difficult to
predict the extent to which the proposed rule could lead funds to modify their portfolio holdings,
or whether such modifications would discourage the issuance of certain assets. As a result, we
cannot quantify the potential costs discussed in this section. However, these costs will only exist
to the extent that some funds lack sufficient liquidity in their current portfolio to allow the
offering of daily redemption without creating significant negative impact on investors.
d.

Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation

The proposed liquidity risk management program requirement would require a fund to
assess its liquidity risk and to determine its three-day liquid asset minimum based on this risk
assessment. We believe that the proposed requirements would improve the alignment between
fund portfolio liquidity and fund liquidity needs. This improved alignment could enhance funds’
ability to meet redemptions in a manner that mitigates potential dilution of shareholders'
interests, and thus this improved alignment could be viewed as increasing efficiency to the extent
that dilution is viewed as a drag on the ability of a fund’s NAV to reflect the performance of its
portfolio. Additionally, the requirement for a fund to classify the liquidity of its portfolio assets
(along with the related reporting and disclosure requirements, discussed below) also could
increase allocative efficiency by assisting investors in making investment choices that better
match their risk tolerances.
By enhancing funds’ liquidity risk assessment and risk management, the proposed
program requirement also could promote pricing efficiency in the sense that it would decrease
319

the likelihood that a fund would be forced to sell portfolio assets under unfavorable
circumstances in order to meet redemptions (thus creating significant negative price pressure on
those assets) without materially affecting the fund’s NAV or risk profile. If a fund’s asset sales
were to temporarily move asset prices away from their market value, this could create a
temporary pricing inefficiency. By decreasing the likelihood that these types of price
movements would occur, the program requirement could decrease pricing inefficiency.
However, the proposed program requirement could negatively affect the efficient pricing of
relatively less liquid assets if it indirectly discourages funds from investing in them (for example,
if a fund were to decrease its investments in less liquid assets if it determines that the three-day
liquid asset minimum that it should hold, as a result of its liquidity risk assessment, does not
correspond with the fund’s current portfolio composition). But as discussed above, this market
effect could be partially offset if other investors are incentivized to buy relatively less liquid
assets on account of any lower prices for these assets that result if funds decrease their holdings
of these assets. 718 Alternatively, any price decreases experienced as a result of decreased mutual
fund investment could be considered efficient price adjustments given the reduction in liquidity
of the assets.
If the proposed liquidity risk management program requirement results in a material
decrease in funds’ investment in relatively less liquid assets, competition for these assets would
be negatively affected. Under this scenario, the relatively less liquid assets in which funds
formerly would have invested may become even less liquid, since the number of current or
potential market participants would be reduced. This decrease in competition may be partially
offset if some other investors become willing to invest in relatively less liquid assets because of
718

See supra section IV.C.1.c.

320

the larger illiquidity discount now associated with the price of those assets. As a corollary, if the
proposed liquidity risk management program requirement results in a material increase in funds’
investment in three-day liquid assets, competition for these assets would be positively affected.
As funds increase their investment in relatively more liquid assets, the liquidity of those assets
should increase. However, that increase may be partially offset if some other investors decrease
their investment in relatively more liquid assets because of the larger liquidity premium now
associated with the price of those assets.
The size of a fund, or the family of funds to which a fund belongs, could have certain
competitive effects with respect to the fund’s implementation of its liquidity risk management
program. If there are economies of scale in creating and administrating multiple liquidity risk
management programs, funds in large families would have a competitive advantage. For a fund
in a smaller complex, however, a greater portion of the fund’s (and/or adviser’s 719) resources may
be needed to create and administer a liquidity risk management program, which may increase
barriers to entry in the fund industry, and lead to an adverse effect on competition. The size of a
fund family also could produce competitive advantages or disadvantages with respect to a fund’s
use of products developed by third parties to classify the liquidity of their portfolio assets, or to
assess the fund’s liquidity risk. Funds in a large complex also could receive relatively more
favorable pricing for third-party liquidity risk management tools, if the fund complex were to
purchase discounted bulk services from the developer or receive relationship-based pricing
discounts. To the extent that they choose to use liquidity risk management tools such as
committed lines of credit and interfund lending, 720 funds in larger complexes likewise could

719

See paragraph following supra note 706.

720

See supra section III.C.5.a (discussing and providing guidance on the use of these tools).

321

receive more favorable rates on committed lines of credit than funds in smaller complexes, and
could have opportunities to establish interfund lending agreements that may not be available to
funds in smaller complexes.
Any changes in certain assets’ or asset classes’ liquidity that could indirectly result from
the proposed liquidity risk management program requirement (for example, as discussed above,
if the number of buyers and sellers for certain assets becomes significantly reduced as a result of
the program requirement) could also affect capital formation among issuers of these assets.
Some firms could be discouraged from issuing new securities in particular asset classes because
of price discounts associated with lower liquidity. Or if changes in liquidity are not equal across
all asset classes, firms may begin to shift their capital structure (e.g., begin to issue equity instead
of debt) or to change the terms of certain securities that they issue in order to increase their
liquidity (e.g., by standardizing the terms of certain debt securities, or modifying the securities’
terms to promote electronic trading).
e.

Reasonable Alternatives

In formulating our proposal, we have considered various alternatives to the individual
elements of proposed rule 22e-4. Those alternatives are outlined above in the sections discussing
the proposed rule elements, and we have requested comment on these alternatives. 721 The
following discussion addresses significant alternatives to proposed rule 22e-4, which involve
broader issues than the more granular alternatives to the individual rule elements discussed
above.

721

See supra sections III.A.3, III.B.1.b, III.B.2.j, III.B.3.b, III.C.1.e, III.C.2.b, III.C.3.d, III.C.4.b, III.C.5.e,
III.D.4, III.E.

322

Instead of proposing rule 22e-4, we could issue guidance surrounding the classification of
portfolio assets’ liquidity and the assessment and management of liquidity risk. However, on
account of the significant diversity in liquidity risk management practices that we have observed
in the fund industry, we believe that the need exists for an enhanced comprehensive baseline
requirement instead of only guidance for fund liquidity risk management. Also, an approach that
involves rulemaking, as opposed to merely guidance, would permit us to examine registrants’
compliance with the requirements and bring enforcement actions relating to non-compliance and
hence make it more likely that the benefits discussed above would be realized.
We considered proposing liquidity requirements similar to those imposed on money
market funds—that is, the requirement to hold a minimum level of highly liquid asset holdings,
and the ability to impose redemption fees and gates. 722 The requirements imposed on money
market funds, and the tools available to these funds to manage heavy redemptions, are
specifically tailored to the assets held by money market funds and the behavior of money market
fund investors. 723 Imposing similar regulatory requirements on funds that are not money market
funds would ignore significant differences between money market funds and other funds. We
discuss below why we decided not to propose that funds hold a minimum level of highly liquid
asset holdings (similar to the portfolio liquidity requirements applicable to money market funds).
While funds are currently permitted under rule 22c-2 to impose redemption fees under certain
circumstances, we understand based on fund outreach that funds are generally moving away
from the use of fees to manage short-term trading risk, and we are not proposing that the use of
fees be expanded in light of this, as well as the potential operational complexity that could

722

See supra notes 154-155 and accompanying text.

723

See 2014 Money Market Fund Reform Adopting Release, supra note 85, at section II.

323

accompany the use of fees. 724 We are not proposing that funds be permitted to impose
redemption gates because funds that are not money market funds have not demonstrated the
same risk of significant redemptions during times of market stress that money market funds may
face, and which redemption gates are meant to prevent in money market funds. For example,
while there is some evidence of a first-mover advantage among money market funds during the
financial crisis, there is currently no matching evidence of first-mover advantage among funds
that are not money market funds. 725
The Commission considered, but ultimately decided against, proposing to exclude certain
types of funds from proposed rule 22e-4. For example, the proposed rule could have carved out
exemptions for funds with investment strategies that historically have entailed relatively little
liquidity risk, or funds with relatively low assets. We are not proposing to exclude any subset of
open-end funds, other than money market funds, from the scope of the proposed rule. As
discussed above, even funds with investment strategies that historically have involved little
liquidity risk could experience liquidity stresses in certain environments. 726 And investors in
small funds could suffer from insufficient liquidity risk management just as investors in larger
funds could. Indeed, staff analysis suggests that funds with relatively low total assets can
experience greater flow volatility, including more volatility in unexpected flows, than funds with
higher assets, which could indicate increased liquidity risk. 727 The proposed program
requirement is meant to permit a fund to customize and calibrate its liquidity risk management
724

See infra paragraph accompanying note 777 for a discussion of why we are proposing swing pricing,
instead of a framework involving purchase fees or redemption fees, to address potential dilution of existing
shareholder interests when a fund encounters significant net purchases or net redemptions and for a
discussion of the operational differences between swing pricing and purchase and redemption fees.

program to reflect the liquidity risks that it typically faces (and that it could face in stressed
market conditions). This flexibility is meant to result in programs whose scope, and related costs
and burdens, are appropriate to manage the actual liquidity risks facing a particular fund.
We considered multiple alternatives to the proposed requirements regarding a fund’s
classification of the liquidity of its portfolio assets. Under proposed rule 22e-4, a fund would be
required to classify and review the liquidity of each of the fund’s positions in a portfolio asset (or
a portion of a fund’s position in a portfolio asset) based on the number of days within which a
fund’s position in a particular portfolio asset could be converted to cash at a price that does not
materially affect the value of that asset assessed immediately prior to sale, and considering
certain specified factors. 728 Instead of these proposed requirements, we could have codified a
definition of illiquid asset that reflects the current 15% guideline. Because we believe most
funds generally adhere to the 15% guideline, this approach would have had the benefit of already
being accepted and understood by the industry, and would have entailed few additional
implementation costs for funds. However, we understand, based on staff outreach, that the 15%
guideline has generally caused funds to limit their exposures to particular types of securities that
generally cannot be sold or sold quickly and that the Commission and staff have indicated are
often illiquid, depending on the facts and circumstances. We also understand that it is not
uncommon for a fund to consider very few (or none) of its portfolio assets to be 15% guideline
assets. Given the parameters of the 15% guideline, we also do not believe that this approach
would require the typical fund to consider the liquidity characteristics of a significant percentage
of its portfolio. 729 Thus, this approach alone would not have provided as comprehensive a view

728

See rule 22e-4(b)(2)(i)-(ii).

729

See supra section III.C.4.

325

of the relative liquidity of portfolio assets as our proposed approach, or strengthen funds’ ability
to meet redemption obligations and mitigate dilution of the interests of shareholders.
Instead of proposing an approach whereby a fund would be required to assign each
portfolio position to one of several liquidity categories, we could have proposed a classification
framework under which a fund would simply be required to classify a portfolio position as
“liquid” or “illiquid,” based on a number of specified factors. As discussed above, Commission
staff has found, based on outreach to a variety of funds, that funds with relatively comprehensive
liquidity classification procedures tend to view the liquidity of their portfolio positions in terms
of a liquidity spectrum rather than simply as wholly liquid or wholly illiquid. This
“spectrum”-based approach to liquidity can greatly facilitate a fund’s portfolio manager in
engaging in portfolio construction that takes into account potential varying liquidity needs of the
fund over time. Our proposed approach to liquidity classification reflects our understanding that
funds commonly evaluate assets’ liquidity across such a liquidity spectrum, as opposed to
making a binary determination of whether an asset is liquid or illiquid. It also more accurately
conveys to investors that liquidity tends to be a matter of degree.
We also considered several alternatives to the proposed requirement for each fund to
determine its three-day liquid asset minimum and limit its acquisition of less liquid assets in
contravention of that minimum. We instead could have proposed that each fund be required to
determine a minimum buffer level of cash (or cash equivalents) that it would hold, or
alternatively, to determine a minimum level of one-day liquid asset holdings. The cash buffer
alternative would help ensure that a fund would be able to meet redemptions immediately,
without the need to sell any portfolio assets. Likewise, a one-day liquid asset minimum
requirement would help ensure that a fund would be able to meet redemptions within a very

326

quick period, and could encourage a fund to hold a comparatively more liquid portfolio than the
proposed three-day liquid asset minimum. But we believe that these options have a number of
disadvantages. Namely, these options would not necessarily match a fund’s liquidity needs with
its redemption obligations, and could result in a fund being underinvested in assets that reflect
the fund’s investment strategy (and concurrent risks and performance potential). 730 We
considered proposing a “seven-day liquid asset minimum” requirement—that is, requiring a fund
to invest in a certain amount of assets that could be converted to cash within seven calendar days
or less—which would correspond with a fund’s redemption obligations under section 22(e) of
the Act. However, we were concerned that a seven-day liquid asset minimum would not provide
sufficient minimum liquidity given the regulatory requirements and disclosures that require most
funds to meet redemptions obligations in shorter time periods and market practices that
effectively require all funds to meet redemption requests within time periods shorter than seven
calendar days.
We also considered proposing to require a standard level of three-day liquid asset
minimum holdings for all funds. This alternative approach would have the advantage of being
simple for investors to understand and our examination staff to verify. However, this alternative
fails to account for notable differences between funds with respect to investment strategy, fund
flow patterns, and other characteristics that contribute to funds’ liquidity risk, which in turn
would make it reasonable for funds’ portfolios to have varying liquidity profiles. We believe
that the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum requirement would promote consistency in
funds’ consideration of the factors relevant to their liquidity risk management, while also
730

We note above that if a fund’s redemption practices require it to pay redeeming shareholders within a
period shorter than three business days, we expect the fund would consider whether a specified portion of
its three-day liquid asset minimum should consist of portfolio positions that are convertible to cash within a
period shorter than three business days.

327

permitting flexibility in implementation, which we believe is appropriate in light of the
significant diversity within the fund industry. This approach includes elements that would help
our staff to ascertain that funds are indeed considering the required factors: each fund would be
required to maintain a written record of how its three-day liquid asset minimum was determined,
as well as copies of materials submitted to the fund’s board in connection with the board’s
approval of the three-day liquid asset minimum and reports provided to the board that review the
adequacy of the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum. 731 And as discussed above, although a
fund would be permitted to determine its own three-day liquid asset minimum under the
proposed rule, we believe that the requirement for a fund to consider certain specified factors in
determining its three-day liquid asset minimum would likely preclude a fund from concluding
that zero holdings of three-day liquid assets would be appropriate. 732
Instead of requiring funds to determine and invest their assets in compliance with a
three-day liquid asset minimum, we could require funds to conduct stress tests of their own
design relating to the extent the fund has liquid assets to cover possible levels of redemptions.
This would have the benefit of permitting a fund flexibility in determining whether its portfolio
liquidity profile is appropriate given its liquidity needs. Also, since the three-day liquid asset
minimum requirement implicitly also involves the requirement for a fund to classify its portfolio
assets’ liquidity in a particular manner (since compliance with a fund’s three-day liquid asset
minimum would require knowing which assets are three-day liquid assets), not requiring funds to
determine a three-day liquid asset minimum would permit a fund to not incur the costs associated
with the proposed liquidity classification requirements. As discussed above, some funds already

731

See proposed rule 22e-4(c)(2)-(3).

732

See supra section III.C.3.a.

328

conduct stress testing incorporating the factors that a fund would be required to consider in
assessing their liquidity risk and determining their three-day liquid asset minimum based on this
assessment. 733 But, because the quality and comprehensiveness of funds’ liquidity risk
management currently varies significantly, we believe that requiring a certain set of factors to be
considered in assessing and managing liquidity risk (including determining the fund’s three-day
liquid asset minimum) is important in reducing the risk that funds will be unable to meet their
redemption obligations under the Investment Company Act and elevating the overall quality of
liquidity risk management across the fund industry. Also, we believe that it would be difficult to
determine, depending on the level of discretion a fund would have in developing stress scenarios,
whether these scenarios would accurately depict liquidity risk and lead funds to determine the
appropriate level of portfolio liquidity they should hold. For example, if a fund’s liquidity needs
were generally high during normal periods, but were not correspondingly extreme during stress
events, basing this fund’s portfolio liquidity on the results of stress testing alone could cause a
fund to hold too little liquidity during non-stressed periods. Therefore we do not believe that a
general stress testing requirement would be an adequate substitute for the three-day liquid asset
minimum requirement. 734
Finally, we considered proposing a liquidity risk management program requirement that
would not incorporate a three-day liquid asset minimum requirement (or one of the alternatives
to this requirement discussed in the preceding paragraphs). Under this alternative, a fund would
be required to adopt and implement a liquidity risk management program, which would include
733

See supra note 257 and accompanying text.

734

We do note, however, that section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act obligates the Commission to specify
certain stress testing requirements for certain large non-bank financial companies we regulate, including
investment companies. See supra note 104 and accompanying text regarding initiatives to address the
impact of open-end fund investment activities on investors and the financial markets.

329

the proposed requirements regarding a fund’s classification of the liquidity of its portfolio assets
(and related reporting and disclosure regarding its portfolio assets’ liquidity) and the proposed
requirements limiting investments in 15% standard assets, but a fund would not be required to
establish a minimum level of three-day liquid assets. This alternative would have the benefit of
permitting funds to have a large amount of flexibility in managing their liquidity risk. Although
a fund would need to ensure that it is able to meet its redemption obligations and would be
subject to the proposed limitations on investments in 15% standard assets, it would be subject to
no other requirements regarding its portfolio liquidity. This would provide flexibility, for
example, for a fund to adjust its liquidity profile very quickly in light of changing market
conditions, whereas a fund subject to the three-day liquid asset minimum requirement might not
be able to do so as quickly, to the extent the fund’s board would be required to approve a change
in the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum. It also would permit a fund to calibrate portfolio
liquidity based on the factors the fund or its adviser considers appropriate, instead of the factors
that the proposed rule would require a fund to consider in determining its three-day liquid asset
minimum. To the extent that a fund’s portfolio liquidity was not in line with investors’ risk
tolerances, investors could decide not to invest in the fund, based on information about the
fund’s portfolio liquidity reported on Form N-PORT.
We do not believe, however, that this alternative would adequately respond to primary
goals of this rulemaking, that is, reducing the risks that funds will be unable to meet their
redemption obligations and reducing potential dilution of non-redeeming shareholders. We
believe that the three-day liquid asset minimum requirement is a critical element of the proposed
liquidity risk management program requirement that is designed to provide investors with
increased protections regarding how fund portfolio liquidity is managed. As discussed above,

330

we believe that the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum requirement would result in a
portfolio liquidity standard that fosters consistency in funds’ consideration of the factors relevant
to their liquidity risk management, while simultaneously permitting flexibility in
implementation. 735 While the board approval requirement associated with the three-day liquid
asset minimum could add a layer of process if a fund wished to change its liquidity profile, we
believe that this requirement is necessary because it would add independent oversight over
funds’ liquidity risk management. 736 Although we believe that reporting and disclosure regarding
a fund’s portfolio liquidity are important, we do not believe that they would be sufficient to
promote a high quality of liquidity risk management across the fund industry because they would
not necessarily require a fund to consider its portfolio liquidity in relation to its liquidity needs.

Swing Pricing
a.

Requirements of Proposed Rule 22c-1(a)(3)

Under proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3), a fund (with the exception of a money market fund or
ETF) would be permitted to establish and implement swing pricing policies and procedures that
would, under certain circumstances, require the fund to use swing pricing to adjust its current
NAV as an additional tool to lessen potential dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable
securities caused by shareholder purchase or redemption activity. In order to use swing pricing
under the proposed rule, a fund would be required to establish and implement swing pricing
policies and procedures. 737 These policies and procedures must: (i) provide that the fund will
adjust its NAV by an amount designated as the “swing factor” once the level of net purchases or
net redemptions from the fund has exceeded a specified percentage of the fund’s net asset value
735

See supra section III.C.3.

736

See supra section III.D.1.

737

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i).

331

known as the “swing threshold”; 738 (ii) specify the fund’s swing threshold, considering certain
specified factors; 739 (iii) provide for the periodic review (at least annually) of the fund’s swing
threshold, considering certain specified factors; 740 (iv) specify how a swing factor that would be
used to adjust the fund’s NAV when the fund’s swing threshold is breached, which
determination must take into account certain specified factors. 741
A fund’s board, including a majority of the fund’s independent directors, would be
required to approve the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures (including the fund’s swing
threshold, and any swing factor upper limit specified under the fund’s swing pricing policies and
procedures), and any material change to these policies and procedures. 742 However, the board
would be required to designate the fund’s investment adviser or officers responsible for
administration of the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures and for determining a swing
factor that would be used to adjust the fund’s NAV when the fund’s swing threshold is
breached. 743
A fund that adopts swing pricing policies and procedures also would be required to keep
certain records, including a written copy of its swing pricing policies and procedures, 744 and
records of support for each computation of an adjustment to the fund’s NAV based on these

certain disclosures and reflect its use of swing pricing in its financial statements. 746
b.

Benefits

We believe proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) would promote investor protection by providing
funds with a tool to reduce the potentially dilutive effects of shareholder purchase or redemption
activity. Rule 22c-1 under the Investment Company Act, the “forward pricing” rule, requires a
fund to price its shares based on the current market prices of its portfolio assets next computed
after receipt of an order to buy or redeem shares. 747 When a fund trades portfolio assets in order
to meet purchases or redemptions, the fund’s current NAV on the trade date would reflect any
changes to the value of the fund’s assets that occurs as a result of trading on that day. But as
discussed above, when a fund trades portfolio assets in order to satisfy purchase or redemption
requests, certain costs associated with this trading activity currently may not be taken into
account in the price that the purchasing or redeeming shareholder receives for his or her fund
shares. 748 The NAV of the fund shares held by existing shareholders, however, will eventually
reflect all of these costs, including those that were not passed on to the purchasing or redeeming
shareholders. 749 Swing pricing provides funds with an additional tool—as a supplement to the
pricing conventions required by the forward pricing rule—to pass estimated near-term costs
stemming from shareholder purchase or redemption activity on to the shareholders associated

749

See id.

333

with that activity. 750 Swing pricing thus could lessen dilution of existing shareholders and limit
redemptions motivated by a potential first-mover advantage.
We recognize that swing pricing may involve potential disadvantages to funds as well as
potential advantages, and the provisions of proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) are designed to maximize
the relative advantages and respond to potential concerns associated with swing pricing. While
swing pricing may reduce dilution at the fund level and could act as a deterrent against
redemptions motivated by any first-mover advantage, the potential disadvantages to swing
pricing (described in more detail below) include increased performance volatility and the fact
that the precise impact of swing pricing on particular purchase or redemption requests would not
be known in advance and thus may not be fully transparent to investors. In addition, the swing
factor used by a fund on a particular day may not capture all costs incurred by the fund resulting
from purchases or redemptions that day.
Commission rules and guidance do not currently address the ability of a fund to use
swing pricing to mitigate potential dilution of fund shareholders, and the Commission’s current
valuation guidance could raise questions about making such NAV adjustment. 751 The proposed
swing pricing rule would provide the regulatory framework that a fund would apply to adjust its
NAV in order to effectively pass on estimated trading costs to purchasing or redeeming
shareholders. The proposed rule would require a fund that conducts swing pricing to do so in
accordance with policies and procedures and other restrictions designed to promote all
shareholders’ interests. 752 Because we cannot prospectively measure the extent to which the
swing pricing policies and procedures that a fund may adopt would mitigate potential dilution,
750

See supra paragraph accompanying note 424.

751

See supra note 423 and accompanying text.

752

See supra note 424 and accompanying text.

334

we are unable to quantify the total potential benefits discussed in this section. 753 However,
analysis by fund groups of their funds domiciled in regions that allow swing pricing indicates
that investor dilution is significantly reduced through swing pricing for some funds. 754
c.

Costs

A primary cost of implementing swing pricing is an increase in fund return volatility.
The implementation of swing pricing also could increase tracking error relative to a fund’s
benchmark. However, the impact of swing pricing on volatility and tracking error would
decrease as a function of time: for example, the impact of swing pricing on daily return volatility
and tracking error would likely be much greater than the impact on monthly volatility and
tracking error. The use of “partial” swing pricing also lessens the impact on volatility and
tracking error. When deciding whether or not to implement swing pricing, a fund would have to
weigh the cost of increased volatility and tracking error (along with the other costs discussed
below) against the previously-discussed benefits of swing pricing.
In addition, a swing pricing regime that uses a fund’s daily net purchases or net
redemptions to determine when the fund will adjust its NAV could create costs for fund
investors. For example, an investor who purchases fund shares on a day when a fund adjusts its
NAV downward will pay less to enter the fund than if the fund had not adjusted its NAV on that
day. However, investors would not be able to purposefully take advantage of this lower
purchase price without knowledge of contemporaneous intraday flows, which funds do not
publicly disclose. Further, we believe that investors who purchase shares on a day that a fund
adjusts its NAV downward would not create dilution for non-redeeming shareholders.
753

There is no database currently available that identifies whether a foreign-domiciled fund uses swing pricing
or the structure of a fund’s swing pricing program (e.g., full swing pricing versus partial swing pricing).

754

See BlackRock Swing Pricing Paper, supra note 412.

335

Shareholders’ purchase activity would provide liquidity to the fund, which could reduce the
fund’s liquidity costs and thereby could also decrease the swing factor. This could potentially
help redeeming shareholders to receive a more favorable redemption price than they otherwise
would have if there had been less purchase activity on that day, but would not affect the interests
of non-redeeming investors. Similarly, adjusting a fund’s NAV when the fund’s daily net
redemptions cross a certain threshold, regardless of the size of the component shareholder
redemptions that comprise the daily net redemptions, could produce costs to individual
redeeming shareholders whose redemptions alone would not result in redemption-related costs to
the fund. For instance, a small investor’s redemption request would not create any significant
liquidity costs for the fund on its own, but if this investor were to redeem on the same day that
the fund’s net redemptions are high, his or her redemption proceeds would be reduced by the
NAV adjustment.
We are not proposing to exempt certain investors from the NAV adjustments permitted
under proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3). We believe that the costs of exempting certain investors from
the NAV adjustment could be significant, particularly the operational costs that we believe could
result from the relatively complex process of applying the NAV adjustment only to some
investors and not to others. Exempting small investors from the NAV adjustment also may not
be beneficial to a fund because such exemption could lead to large investors engaging in gaming
behavior—that is, structuring their investments in funds using multiple small accounts—in order
to use the exemption. This could contravene the purpose of the exemption and be costly for
funds to detect.
Each fund that chooses to adopt swing pricing policies and procedures pursuant to
proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) would incur one-time costs to develop and implement the policies and

336

procedures, as well as ongoing costs relating to administration of the policies and procedures.
Those costs will directly impact the fund and may indirectly impact fund investors if the fund
passes along its costs to investors through increased fees. As discussed above, while U.S.
registered funds do not currently use swing pricing to mitigate potential dilution, certain foreign
funds affiliated with U.S. fund families currently do use swing pricing. 755 U.S. registered funds
in fund complexes that also include foreign-domiciled funds that use swing pricing may incur
relatively lower costs to implement swing pricing policies and procedures pursuant to the
proposed rule. These funds may only need to modify current swing pricing policies, procedures,
and systems used for foreign-domiciled funds to comply with proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3), instead
of developing them from scratch.
Just as the costs associated with proposed rule 22e-4 could depend largely on the level of
liquidity risk facing the fund, as well as the sources of the fund’s liquidity risk, the costs of
implementing swing pricing policies and procedures likewise could vary depending on these
factors. As discussed above, there are multiple ways in which the costs associated with
classifying portfolio positions’ liquidity and assessing a fund’s liquidity risk could vary based on
a fund’s individual risks and circumstances. 756 To determine a fund’s swing threshold, proposed
rule 22c-1(a)(3) would require a fund to consider certain of the factors required to be considered
as part of the liquidity risk assessment required under proposed rule 22e-4. 757 Therefore, the

755

See supra notes 417-420 and accompanying text.

756

See supra section IV.C.1.c.

757

See proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(B). Specifically, the requirement for a fund to consider: (i) the size,
frequency, and volatility of historical purchases and redemptions of fund shares during normal and stressed
periods, (ii) the fund’s investment strategy and the liquidity of the fund’s portfolio assets, and (ii) the fund’s
holdings of cash and cash equivalents, as well as borrowing arrangements and other funding sources
overlap with certain of the proposed liquidity risk assessment factors. See proposed rule 22e-4(b)(iii)(A),
(B), and (D).

337

costs associated with developing policies and procedures for determining the swing threshold
could also vary according to similar factors that could cause differences in the costs to funds
associated with proposed rule 22e-4. 758
Our staff estimates that the one-time costs necessary to establish and implement swing
pricing policies and procedures pursuant to proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) would range from $1.3
million to $2.25 million759 per fund complex, depending on the particular facts and circumstances
applicable to the funds comprising the fund complex.760 These estimated costs are attributable to
the following activities, as applicable to each of the funds within the complex that adopts swing

758

See supra section IV.C.1.c.

759

These cost estimates are based in part on the staff’s recent estimates of the one-time systems costs
associated with implementing the fees and gates provisions of the 2014 amendments to rule 2a-7 under the
1940 Act. See 2014 Money Market Fund Reform Adopting Release, supra note 85, at section III.A.5.b.
Although the substance and content of systems associated with establishing and implementing swing
pricing policies and procedures would be different from the substance and content of systems associated
with implementing the rule 2a-7 fees and gates provisions, the one-time costs associated with establishing
and implementing swing pricing policies and procedures, like the one-time costs associated with the fees
and gates provisions, would entail: drafting relevant procedures; planning, coding, testing, and installing
relevant system modifications; integrating and implementing relevant procedures; and preparing training
materials and administering training sessions for staff in affected areas. See id. However, in estimating the
one-time costs associated with establishing and implementing swing pricing policies and procedures, staff
has adjusted the estimated one-time systems costs associated with implementing the fees and gates
provisions to reflect that the estimated costs associated with implementing the fees and gates provisions
include costs to be incurred by the fund and others in the distribution chain (including transfer agents,
accountants, custodians, and intermediaries), whose services would be needed if a fund were to impose a
fee or gate, whereas we anticipate that the requirements associated with establishing and implementing
swing pricing policies and procedures would be borne primarily by a fund complex and not by others in the
distribution chain.
We note that the estimated one-time systems costs associated with implementing the fees and gates
provisions of the 2014 amendments to rule 2a-7 are generally similar to the proposed estimated one-time
systems costs associated with implementing the floating NAV provisions of the 2014 rule 2a-7
amendments. See id. at section III.B.8.a. However, the proposed estimated one-time systems costs
associated with implementing the floating NAV provisions were adjusted downward at adoption, to
account for certain tax considerations specific to the floating NAV reforms. Thus, staff believes that the
one-time costs associated with the fees and gates provisions would provide a closer analogue to the
estimated costs associated with establishing and implementing swing pricing policies and procedures than
the one-time costs associated with the floating NAV provisions.

760

This estimate assumes that each fund would not bear all of the estimated costs (particularly, the costs of
systems modification) on an individual basis, but instead that these costs would likely be allocated among
the multiple users of the systems, that is, each of the members of a fund complex that adopts swing pricing
policies and procedures.

338

pricing policies and procedures: (i) developing swing pricing policies and procedures that
include all of the elements required under the proposed rule, 761 as well as policies and procedures
relating to the recordkeeping requirements associated with swing pricing; 762 (ii) planning, coding,
testing, and installing any system modifications for adjusting the fund’s NAV pursuant to the
fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures; (iii) integrating and implementing the fund’s swing
pricing policies and procedures, as well as policies and procedures relating to the financial
reporting and recordkeeping requirements associated with swing pricing; (iv) preparing training
materials and administering training sessions for staff in affected areas; and (v) board approval of
the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures.
We anticipate that, depending on the personnel (and/or third party service providers)
involved in the activities associated with establishing and implementing swing pricing policies
and procedures, certain of the estimated one-time costs associated with these activities could be
borne by the fund, and others could be borne by the adviser. This cost allocation would depend
on the facts and circumstances of a particular fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures, and
thus we cannot specify the extent to which the estimated costs would typically be allocated to the
fund as opposed to the adviser. Estimated costs that are allocated to the fund would be borne by
fund shareholders in the form of fund operating expenses.
Staff estimates that, on average, a fund complex that includes funds that adopt swing
pricing policies and procedures pursuant to proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) would incur ongoing
annual costs that range from 5% to 15% of the one-time costs necessary to establish and

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(iii); proposed amendment to rule 31a-2(a)(2).

339

implement swing pricing policies and procedures pursuant to proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3). 763 Thus,
staff estimates that a fund complex that includes funds that adopt swing pricing policies and
procedures would incur ongoing annual costs associated with proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) that
would range from $65,000 to $337,500. 764 These estimated costs are attributable to the following
activities, as applicable to each of the funds within the complex that adopts swing pricing
policies and procedures: (i) costs associated with monitoring whether the fund’s net purchases or
net redemptions cross the swing threshold (which could include, to the extent a fund determines
appropriate, costs associated with obtaining interim feeds of flows from its transfer agent or
distributor in order to reasonably estimate its daily net flows) (implicated by proposed rule
22c-1(a)(3)(i)(A)); (ii) adjusting the fund’s NAV when the fund’s net purchases or net
redemptions cross the swing threshold, including costs associated with determining a swing
factor that would be used to adjust the fund’s NAV when the fund’s swing threshold is breached
(proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(A), proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(D)); (iii) periodic review of the
fund’s swing threshold (proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(i)(C)); (iv) systems maintenance; (iv)
additional staff training; (v) board approval of any material changes to the program (proposed
rule 22c-1(a)(3)(ii)(A)); and (vi) recordkeeping (proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(iii), proposed
amendments to rule 31a-2(a)(2)). 765

763

These cost estimates are based in part on the staff’s recent estimates of the ongoing costs associated with
implementing the fees and gates provisions of the 2014 amendments to rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act. See
supra note 759 (discussing why staff believes that the costs associated with the fees and gates provisions
could be useful to estimate the costs associated with establishing and implementing swing pricing policies
and procedures).

764

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 0.05 x $1,300,000 = $65,000; 0.15 x $2,250,000 =
$337,500.

765

We anticipate that, depending on the personnel (and/or third party service providers) involved in the
activities associated with administering a fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures, certain of the
estimated ongoing costs associated with these activities could be borne by the fund, and others could be
borne by the adviser. See paragraph following supra note 762.

340

A fund would be permitted, but not required, to establish and implement swing pricing
policies and procedures under proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3), and for purposes of this cost analysis,
staff estimates that 167 fund complexes would adopt swing pricing policies and procedures. In
developing this estimate, staff assumed that complexes including certain mutual fund strategies
(high-yield bond funds, world bond funds (including emerging market debt funds), multi-sector
bond funds, state municipal funds, alternative strategy funds, and emerging market equity funds)
would be relatively more likely to adopt swing pricing policies and procedures, and of
complexes with funds following these strategies, 75% would actually adopt swing pricing
policies and procedures. 766 Staff estimates that the aggregate one-time costs for fund complexes
to establish and implement swing pricing policies and procedures, and to comply with the
recordkeeping requirements of the proposed amendments to rule 31a-2(a)(2) and the financial
reporting requirements in Form N-1A and Regulation S-X, would be approximately $296

766

In developing the estimate that 167 fund complexes would adopt swing pricing policies and procedures, the
staff assumed that the percentage of fund complexes that includes high-yield bond funds, world bond funds
(including emerging market debt funds), multi-sector bond funds, state municipal funds, alternative strategy
funds, and emerging market equity funds, as a fraction of all fund complexes, is the same as the percentage
of all mutual funds (excluding money market funds) that these strategies represent. The actual number of
fund complexes that includes these selected strategies could be higher or lower than the number calculated
using this assumption. 241 high yield bond mutual funds + 347 world bond mutual funds (estimate
includes emerging market bond funds) + 139 multi-sector bond mutual funds + 322 state municipal mutual
funds + 376 alternative strategy funds that are equity funds (alternative strategy funds that are bond funds
are included in our estimates of the number of bond mutual funds) + 469 emerging market equity mutual
funds = 1,894 funds with strategies that staff assumed would be relatively more likely to adopt swing
pricing policies and procedures. 1,894 funds with selected strategies ÷ 7,395 mutual funds (excluding
money market funds) = approximately 25.6%. 0.256 x 867 fund complexes = approximately 222 fund
complexes. Assuming that 75% of these fund complexes would actually adopt swing pricing policies and
procedures, 0.75 x 222 fund complexes = approximately 167 fund complexes. These estimates are based
on figures included in the 2015 ICI Fact Book. See 2015 ICI Fact Book, supra note 3.

million. 767 In addition, staff estimates that the annual aggregate costs associated with the
proposed regulations relating to swing pricing would be approximately $34 million. 768

Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) would permit a fund, under certain circumstances, to adjust its
NAV to effectively pass on costs stemming from shareholder purchase or redemption activity to
the shareholders associated with that activity. Adjusting a fund’s NAV in this way could reduce
dilution to existing shareholders arising from trading costs. We therefore believe that the
proposed rule could increase the efficiency of cost allocation among shareholders of funds that
adopt swing pricing policies and procedures, provided that a fund’s swing threshold and swing
factor are appropriately calculated. 769 If investors believe swing pricing to be valuable, funds
that decide to implement swing pricing will be at a competitive advantage. Fund complexes
currently using swing pricing in other domiciles may be able to implement swing pricing more
quickly and more effectively.
We anticipate that proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) could indirectly foster capital formation by
bolstering investor confidence. Investors may be more inclined to invest in funds if they
understand that funds will be able to use swing pricing to prevent the purchase or redemption
activity of certain investors from diluting the interests of other investors (particularly long-term
767

Because staff is unable to estimate how many fund complexes would incur one-time costs on the low end
of the estimated range versus the high end of the estimated range, this estimate is based on the assumption
that each fund complex would incur one-time costs of $1,775,000, which represents the middle of the range
of estimated one-time costs ($1,300,000 + $2,250,000 = $3,550,000; $3,550,000 ÷ 2 = $1,775,000). 167
fund complexes x $1,775,000 = $296,425,000.

768

Because staff is unable to estimate how many fund complexes would incur ongoing costs on the low end of
the estimated range versus the high end of the estimated range, this estimate is based on the assumption that
each fund complex would incur ongoing costs of $201,250, which represents the middle of the range of
estimated ongoing costs ($65,000 + $337,500 = $402,500; $402,500 ÷ 2 = $201,250). 167 fund complexes
x $201,250 = $33,608,750.

See supra notes 748-749 (discussing cost allocation among shareholders with respect to funds that do not
use swing pricing).

investors, who represent the majority of fund shareholders). To the extent that swing pricing
preserves investment returns to investors, particularly long-term investors, 770 this could
incentivize investment in funds that use swing pricing. If proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) enhances
investor confidence in funds, investors are more likely to invest in funds, thus making additional
assets available for investment in the capital markets. On the other hand, investors could be
discouraged from investing in funds that use swing pricing if swing pricing produces increased
performance volatility, which could increase tracking error, and could make a fund’s short-term
performance appear relatively poor compared to other funds and the fund’s benchmark. Because
we do not have the information necessary to determine how investors will perceive swing
pricing, or how they will evaluate the relative benefits or detriments of investing in funds that
use swing pricing, we are unable to draw conclusions about the precise effects of proposed rule
22c-1(a)(3) on capital formation. However, to the extent that investors perceive swing pricing
improves fund performance by decreasing investor dilution, capital formation could be
encouraged.
e.

Reasonable Alternatives

The following discussion addresses significant alternatives to proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3).
More detailed alternatives to the individual elements of the proposed rule are discussed in detail
above, and we have requested comment on these alternatives. 771
Instead of permitting, but not requiring, funds to adopt swing pricing policies and
procedures under proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3), we could have proposed a rule that would require all
funds to adopt swing pricing policies and procedures. This alternative approach would have the

343

benefit of establishing a uniform regulatory framework to prevent potential shareholder dilution.
But because funds differ notably in terms of their particular circumstances and risks, as well as
with respect to the tools funds use to manage risks relating to liquidity and shareholder purchases
and redemptions, we decided to propose a rule that would permit swing pricing as a voluntary
tool for funds. Our chosen approach would allow funds to weigh the advantages of swing
pricing (e.g., improved allocation of trading costs 772) against potential disadvantages (e.g., the
potential for swing pricing to increase the volatility of a fund’s NAV in the short term 773).
While proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) envisions partial swing pricing (that is, a NAV
adjustment would not be permitted unless net purchases or redemptions exceed a threshold set by
the fund), the Commission instead could have proposed a rule that would permit full swing
pricing (that is, a NAV adjustment would be permitted any time the fund experiences net
purchases or net redemptions). Full swing pricing would result in any costs associated with
purchases or redemptions being passed along to the shareholders whose actions created those
costs, whereas the partial swing pricing contemplated by the proposed rule would only allocate
trading costs to purchasing or redeeming shareholders when net purchases or net redemptions
exceed the fund’s swing threshold. Nevertheless, we believe that the partial swing pricing
alternative is, on balance, preferable to the full swing pricing option. We expect that partial
swing pricing, as opposed to full swing pricing, would reduce any performance volatility
potentially associated with swing pricing. 774 Also, the use of partial swing pricing recognizes
that purchases or redemptions below a certain threshold might not require a fund to trade
portfolio assets, and therefore a NAV adjustment might not be appropriate if purchases or
772

See supra sections III.F.1.a, III.F.1.c, III.F.1.e.

773

See supra paragraphs accompanying note 446.

774

See supra paragraph accompanying notes 447-449.

344

redemptions would not result in costs associated with asset purchases or sales (in which case, a
NAV adjustment could unfairly penalize purchasing or redeeming shareholders). 775
We considered permitting funds to use swing pricing only to adjust their NAV downward
in the event that net redemptions exceeded a particular threshold, as there may be more
significant issues regarding potential dilution for non-redeeming shareholders in connection with
shareholder redemptions, because funds are obligated to satisfy redemption requests pursuant to
section 22(e) of the Act. In this regard, we note that unlike redemptions, funds may reserve the
right to decline purchase requests. For example, a fund may decline purchase requests from
shareholders who engaged in frequent trading, and it also may decline large purchase requests
that would negatively impact the fund. However, we are proposing to permit funds to use swing
pricing to adjust their NAV upward or downward because we believe that swing pricing could be
a useful tool in mitigating dilution associated with shareholder purchase activity as well.
We also considered limiting the swing factor, but we recognize that there could be
circumstances in which limiting the swing factor would prevent a fund from capturing the costs
associated with purchase or redemption activity in a fund. 776 We believe it is appropriate to
provide flexibility to funds to determine the appropriate swing factor that takes into account
estimated trading costs. As part of their swing pricing policies and procedures, funds may decide
to limit the swing factor.
Lastly, instead of proposing to permit funds to use swing pricing, we considered
clarifying that a fund (other than a money market fund) could impose a purchase fee or

775

See supra note 449 and accompanying text.

776

See supra paragraph accompanying notes 502-504.

345

redemption fee to address potential dilution.777 Swing pricing and purchase and redemption fees
could pass on transaction-related costs to transacting shareholders. Purchase fees and
redemption fees, as opposed to swing pricing, would have the benefit of being simple for
investors to understand, and they would not produce the same volatility and tracking error
concerns as swing pricing. However, on balance we believe that the operational costs and
difficulty of imposing a fee would be significantly higher than those associated with swing
pricing. Implementing a fee requires coordination with the fund’s service providers, which could
entail operational complexity. On the other hand, we anticipate that swing pricing would be
simpler to implement than a fee because the NAV adjustment would occur pursuant to the fund’s
own procedures and would be factored into the process by which a fund strikes its NAV.

Disclosure and Reporting Requirements Regarding Liquidity Risk and
Liquidity Risk Management
a.

Proposed Disclosure and Reporting Requirements

We are proposing amendments to Form N-1A, Regulation S-X, proposed Form N-PORT,
and proposed Form N-CEN to enhance fund disclosure and reporting regarding liquidity and
redemption practices. Specifically, proposed amendments to Form N-1A would require a fund to
disclose: (i) the number of days in which the fund will pay redemption proceeds to redeeming
shareholders 778 and (ii) the methods the fund uses to meet redemption requests in stressed and
non-stressed market conditions. 779 A fund also would be required to file as an exhibit to its

777

As discussed above, funds are currently permitted under rule 22c-2 to impose redemption fees under certain
circumstances. See supra notes 421-422 and accompanying text; see also Rule 22c-2 Adopting Release,
supra note 421 (noting that the redemption fee permitted under rule 22c-2 “is intended to allow funds to
recoup some of the direct and indirect costs incurred as a result of short-term trading strategies, such as
market timing”).

registration statement any credit agreements for the benefit of the fund. 780 Regarding swing
pricing, a fund would be required to disclose in Form N-1A a statement as to whether the fund
uses swing pricing, and an explanation of the circumstances under which it will use swing
pricing and the effects of using swing pricing. 781 The NAV reported on a fund’s financial
statements would reflect swing pricing, if applicable. Proposed amendments to proposed Form
N-PORT would require a fund to disclose: (i) for each portfolio asset, whether that security is a
15% standard asset; 782 (ii) the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum; 783 and (iii) for each of the
fund’s positions in a portfolio asset, the liquidity classification of that position as determined
pursuant to proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(i). 784 Finally, proposed amendments to proposed Form
N-CEN would require a fund to disclose certain information regarding the use of lines of credit,
interfund borrowing and lending, and swing pricing. 785 We have also proposed amendments to
Form N-CEN that would require an ETF to report whether it required that an authorized
participant post collateral to the ETF or any of its designated service providers in connection
with the purchase or redemption of ETF shares. 786

management practices, as well as funds’ redemption practices. As discussed above, funds’
disclosures to shareholders regarding their redemption practices are currently quite varied in
content and comprehensiveness. 787 While some funds voluntarily include disclosure regarding
fund limitations on illiquid asset holdings that track the 15% guideline, a fund is not currently
required to disclose information about the liquidity of its portfolio assets. A fund is also not
currently required to disclose information about liquidity risk management practices such as the
use of lines of credit. In light of the relatively few disclosure requirements regarding funds’
liquidity risks, liquidity risk management practices, and redemption practices, as well as the
current inconsistency in funds’ liquidity-related disclosures, we believe that the proposed
disclosure and reporting requirements would increase shareholder understanding of particular
funds’ liquidity-related risks and redemption policies. This in turn would assist investors in
making investment choices that better match their risk tolerances.
We note that, while proposed Form N-PORT and proposed Form N-CEN are designed
primarily to assist the Commission and its staff, we believe that the information in these
proposed forms (including the liquidity-related information proposed to be included in these
forms) also would be valuable to investors. 788 In particular, we believe that both sophisticated
institutional investors and third-party users that provide services to investors may find the
proposed liquidity-related information to be useful. And we believe that individual investors
would benefit indirectly from the information collected on reports on Form N-PORT, through
analyses prepared by third-party service providers, and through enhanced Commission
monitoring and oversight of the fund industry.

787

See supra section III.G.1.a.

See Investment Company Reporting Modernization Release, supra note 104, at sections IV.B.b, IV.E.b.

348

The liquidity-related information that funds would be required to provide on proposed
Form N-PORT and proposed Form N-CEN would enhance investor protection by improving the
Commission’s ability to monitor funds’ liquidity using relevant and targeted data. This
monitoring would permit us to analyze liquidity trends in individual funds, and among certain
types of funds and the fund industry as a whole, as well as to better understand funds’ liquidity
risk management practices. As discussed in our recent proposal to modernize investment
company reporting, the information we receive on these reports would facilitate the oversight of
funds and would assist the Commission, as the primary regulatory of such funds, to better
effectuate its mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and
facilitate capital formation. 789
Because we cannot predict the extent to which the proposed requirements would enhance
investors’ awareness of funds’ portfolio liquidity and liquidity risk, or that this enhanced
awareness would influence investors’ investments in certain funds, we are unable to quantify the
potential benefits discussed in this section.
c.

Costs

Funds would incur one-time and ongoing annual costs to comply with the proposed
disclosure and reporting requirements regarding liquidity and shareholder redemption practices.
We estimate that the one-time costs to comply with the proposed amendments to Form
N-1A would be approximately $637 per fund (plus printing costs). 790 We estimate that each fund

789

See id.

790

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 2 hours (1 hour to update registration statement to
include swing pricing-related disclosure statements + 1 hour to update registration statement disclosure
about redemption procedures and file credit agreements as exhibits, if applicable) x $318.50 (blended rate
for a compliance attorney ($334) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $637. This figure incorporates the
costs we estimated for each fund to update its registration statement to include the required disclosure
about: (i) the number of days in which the fund will pay redemption proceeds to redeeming shareholders;

349

would incur an ongoing cost associated with compliance with the proposed amendments to Form
N-1A of approximately $80 791 each year to review and update the proposed disclosure regarding
swing pricing and redemptions.
The proposed amendments to proposed Form N-PORT would require funds to report on
Form N-PORT the liquidity classification of each portfolio asset position (or portion of a
position in a particular asset), and we estimate that the average one-time compliance costs
associated with this reporting would be $15,330 per fund. 792 Furthermore, we estimate that 8,734
funds would be required to file, on a monthly basis, additional information on Form N-PORT as
a result of the proposed amendments. 793 Assuming that 35% of funds (3,057 funds) would
choose to license a software solution to file reports on Form N-PORT in house, 794 we estimate an
upper bound on the initial annual costs to file the additional information associated with the
(ii) the methods the fund uses to meet redemption requests in stressed and non-stressed market conditions;
and (iii) if the fund uses swing pricing, an explanation of the circumstances under which it will use swing
pricing and the effects of using swing pricing. This figure also includes the costs we estimate for each fund
to file any applicable credit agreements as exhibits to the fund’s registration statement. The costs
associated with these activities are all paperwork-related costs and are discussed in more detail infra at
section V.G.
791

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 0.25 hours (1/8 hour to update swing pricing-related
disclosure statements + 1/8 hour to update disclosures about redemption procedures) x $318.50 (blended
hourly rate for a compliance attorney ($334) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $79.63.

792

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (i) project planning and systems design (24 hours x
$260 (hourly rate for a senior systems analyst) = $6,240) and (ii) systems modification integration, testing,
installation and deployment (30 hours x $303 (hourly rate for a senior programmer) = $9,090). $6,240 +
$9,090 = $15,330. Estimates for drafting, integrating, implementing policies and procedures are addressed
in the discussion of proposed rule 22e-4. This figure incorporates the costs that we estimated associated
with preparing the section of the fund’s report on Form N-PORT that would incorporate the information
that would be required under proposed Item C.13. The costs associated with these activities are all
paperwork-related costs and are discussed in more detail infra at section V.E. As discussed in section V.E
infra, we believe that any external annual costs associated with filing Form N-PORT would be only
incrementally affected by compliance with proposed Item C.13 to proposed Form N-PORT, and thus
proposed Item C.13 does not affect our previous estimates of these costs.

793

There were 8,734 open-end funds (excluding money market funds, and including ETFs) as of the end of
2014. See 2015 ICI Fact Book, supra note 3, at 177, 184.

794

This assumption tracks the assumption made in the Investment Company Reporting Modernization Release
that 35% of funds would choose to license a software solution to file reports on Form N-PORT. See

proposed amendments for funds choosing this option of $780 per fund 795 with annual ongoing
costs of $260 per fund. 796 We further assume that 65% of funds (5,677 funds) would choose to
retain a third-party service provider to provide data aggregation and validation services as part of
the preparation and filing of reports on Form N-PORT, 797 and we estimate an upper bound on the
initial costs to file the additional information associated with the proposed amendments for funds
choosing this option of $1,040 per fund 798 with annual ongoing costs of $130 per fund. 799
Likewise, compliance with the proposed amendments to proposed Form N-CEN would
involve ongoing costs as well as one-time costs. We estimate that 8,734 funds would be required
to file responses on Form N-CEN as a result of the proposed amendments to the form. We
estimate that the one-time and ongoing annual compliance costs associated with providing

costs as a result of the proposed amendments. See infra at section V.E. The hourly wage figures in this
and subsequent footnotes are from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities

costs as a result of the proposed amendments.

351

additional responses to Form N-CEN as a result of the proposed amendments would be
approximately $160 per fund. 800
Based on these estimates, staff further estimates that the total one-time costs to comply
with the proposed disclosure and reporting requirements would be approximately $51 million for
all funds that would file reports on proposed Form N-PORT in house 801 and approximately $96
million for all funds that would use a third-party service provider to prepare and file reports on
proposed Form N-PORT. 802 In addition, staff estimates that the total ongoing annual costs
associated with the proposed disclosure and reporting requirements would be approximately $1.5
million for all funds that would file reports on proposed Form N-PORT in house 803 and
approximately $2.1 million for all funds that would use a third-party service provider to prepare
and file reports on proposed Form N-PORT. 804
We appreciate that the proposed amendments to proposed Form N-PORT would increase
the amount and availability of public information about investment companies’ portfolio
positions and that more frequent portfolio disclosure could potentially harm fund shareholders by
800

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 0.5 hour x $318.50 (blended hourly rate for a
compliance attorney ($334) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $159.25. This figure incorporates the costs
that we estimated associated with preparing the section of the fund’s report on Form N-CEN that would
incorporate the information that would be required under proposed Item 44. We do not estimate any
additional costs in connection with proposed Item 60(g) of Form N-CEN because the proposed new item
only requires a yes or no response. We do not estimate any change to the external costs associated with
Form N-CEN. The costs associated with these activities are all paperwork-related costs and are discussed
in more detail infra at section V.F.

801

This estimate assumes that 35% of funds (3,057 funds) would choose to file reports on proposed Form
N-PORT in house (see infra section V.E) and is based on the following calculation: 3,057 funds x
$16,587.75 ($318.50 + $15,330 + $780 + $159.25) = $50,708,751.75.

802

This estimate assumes that 65% of funds (5,677) would choose to file reports on proposed Form N-PORT
with the assistance of third-party service providers (see infra section V.E) and is based on the following
calculation: 5,677 funds x $16,847.75 ($318.50 + $15,330 + $1,040 + $159.25) = $95,644,676.75.

803

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 3,057 funds x $498.88 ($79.63 + $260 + $159.25) =
$1,525,076.16.

804

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 5,677 funds x $368.88 ($79.63 + $130 + $159.25) =

expanding the opportunities for professional traders to exploit this information by engaging in
predatory trading practices, such as “front-running” and “copycatting.” 805 Both front-running
and
copycatting can reduce the returns of shareholders who invest in actively managed funds. 806
Thus, the proposed amendments to proposed Form N-PORT could entail costs to funds and
market participants associated with any reduced profitability of funds that could result from the
increase in publicly available information. 807 We believe that these costs cannot be separated
from the overall costs to funds and market participants that could result from the increased
disclosure of currently non-public information associated with Form N-PORT in its entirety. 808
The effects of the proposed liquidity-related disclosures are intertwined with the effects of the
other proposed Form N-PORT disclosures. For example, any analyses of the liquidity-related
disclosure proposed to be required could be affected by the enhanced reporting of information
concerning the pricing of funds’ investments, information on fund flows, and disclosure of
additional information that could more clearly reveal the investment strategy and risk exposures
of reporting funds (e.g., information pertaining to derivatives and securities lending activities).
The potential costs associated with the increased disclosure of currently non-public information
on Form N-PORT are discussed in detail in our recent proposal to modernize investment

company reporting. 809 This proposal also discusses the ways in which we have endeavored to
mitigate these costs, including by proposing to maintain the status quo for the frequency and
timing of disclosure of publicly available portfolio information. 810 While proposed Form
N-PORT would be required to be filed monthly, it would be required to be disclosed quarterly
and would not be made public until 60 days after the close of the period at issue. Because funds
are currently required to disclose their portfolio investments quarterly (and this disclosure is
made public with a 60-day lag), we believe that maintaining the status quo with regard to the
frequency and the time lag of publicly available portfolio reporting would permit the
Commission (as well as the fund industry generally) to assess the impact of the Form N-PORT
filing requirement on the mix of information available to the public, and the extent to which
these changes might affect the potential for predatory trading, before determining whether more
frequent or more timely public disclosure would be beneficial to investors in funds. 811 We
cannot currently predict the extent to which the proposed enhancements to funds’ disclosures on
Form N-PORT would give rise to front-running, predatory trading, and other activities that could
be detrimental to a fund and its investors, and thus we are unable to quantify potential costs
related to these activities.
d.

Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation

We believe the proposed requirements could increase informational efficiency by
providing additional information about the liquidity of funds’ portfolio positions to investors,
third-party service providers, and the Commission. This in turn could assist investors in
evaluating the risks associated with certain funds, which could increase allocative efficiency by

354

assisting investors in making investment choices that better match their risk tolerances.
Enhanced disclosure regarding funds’ liquidity and liquidity risk management practices could
positively affect competition by permitting investors to choose whether to invest in certain funds
based on this information. However, if investors were to move their assets among funds as a
result of the disclosure requirements (for example, if the disclosure made clear that a certain fund
was able to generate higher returns than its peers through high exposure to relatively less liquid
positions, which then led investors with limited risk tolerance to move assets out of this fund),
this could negatively affect the competitive stance of certain funds.
Increased investor awareness of funds’ portfolio liquidity and liquidity risk management
practices also could promote capital formation if investors find certain funds’ liquidity profiles
and/or risk management practices attractive, and this awareness promotes increased investment
in these funds and in turn in the assets in which the funds invest. For example, disclosure that
reveals liquidity risk in funds’ portfolios could negatively impact capital formation if this
disclosure leads investors to decide that such funds pose too great of an investment risk, and
consequently decide not to invest in these funds or to decrease their investment in these funds.
Conversely, to the extent that investors assume that funds investing in relatively less liquid assets
could obtain a liquidity risk premium in the form of higher returns over some period of time, the
potential for higher returns could draw certain investors to funds investing in relatively less
liquid asset classes, which could positively affect capital formation for these funds. If investors
shift their invested assets between funds based on liquidity, there could be capital formation
effects stemming from increased (or decreased) investment in the funds’ portfolio assets, even if
the total capital invested in funds remains constant. For example, if fund investors move assets
from an investment strategy that entails relatively high liquidity risk to one whose investment

355

strategy involves relatively low liquidity risk, less liquid portfolio asset classes could experience
an adverse impact on capital formation while the more liquid portfolio asset classes could
experience a positive impact on capital formation, although the total capital invested in funds
would remain constant.

Reasonable Alternatives

The following discussion addresses significant alternatives to proposed disclosure and
reporting requirements. More detailed alternatives to the individual elements of the proposed
requirements are discussed in detail above, and we have requested comment on these
alternatives. 812
The Commission considered proposing to require each fund to disclose information about
the liquidity of its portfolio positions in the fund’s prospectus or on the fund’s website, in
addition to in reports filed on Form N-PORT. For example, we could have proposed to require a
fund to disclose its three-day liquid asset minimum, or the percentage of the fund’s portfolio
invested in each of the liquidity categories specified under proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(i), in its
prospectus or on its website. This additional disclosure could further increase transparency with
respect to funds’ portfolio liquidity and liquidity-related risks. But we had concerns that this
additional disclosure could create investor confusion; for example, an investor could mistakenly
understand statements about the liquidity of the fund’s portfolio to implicate the redeemability of
the fund’s shares. We also had concerns that this additional disclosure could inappropriately
emphasize risks relating to a fund’s portfolio liquidity over other significant risks associated with
an investment in the fund. We therefore determined that this alternative could lead to poor
investor allocation and that its costs would likely outweigh its potential benefits.
812

See supra sections III.G.1.a, III.G.1.b, III.G.2.d, and III.G.3.c.

356

Conversely, the Commission also considered limiting the proposed enhancements to
funds’ liquidity-related disclosures on proposed Form N-PORT. As discussed above, we are
sensitive to the possibility that the proposed amendments to the proposed form could facilitate
front-running, predatory trading, and other activities that could be detrimental to a fund and its
investors. Limiting the required disclosure about information concerning the liquidity of funds’
portfolio positions could allow funds to shelter certain information that they may consider a
source of competitive advantage. As discussed in our recent proposal to modernize investment
company reporting, the items included on proposed Form N-PORT reflect our careful
consideration of what information we believe to be important for our oversight activities and to
the public, and the costs to investment companies to provide the information. 813 We likewise
carefully weighed costs and benefits with respect to the new liquidity-related disclosures
proposed to be required under proposed Form N-PORT and concluded that these disclosures
appropriately balance related costs with the benefits that could arise from the ability of the
Commission, and members of the public, to monitor and analyze the liquidity of individual
funds, as well as liquidity trends within the fund industry.

Request for Comment

The Commission requests comment on all aspects of this initial economic analysis,
including whether the analysis has: (i) identified all benefits and costs, including all effects on
efficiency, competition, and capital formation; (ii) given due consideration to each benefit and
cost, including each effect on efficiency, competition, and capital formation; and (iii) identified
and considered reasonable alternatives to the proposed new rule and rule amendments. We
request and encourage any interested person to submit comments regarding the proposed rule
813

See Investment Company Reporting Modernization Release, supra note 104, at section IV.B.

357

and proposed amendments, our analysis of the potential effects of the proposed rule and
proposed amendments, and other matters that may have an effect on the proposed rule and
proposed amendments. We request that commenters identify sources of data and information as
well as provide data and information to assist us in analyzing the economic consequences of the
proposed rule and proposed amendments. We also are interested in comments on the qualitative
benefits and costs we have identified and any benefits and costs we may have overlooked. We
also request comments on all data and empirical analyses used in support of the proposed rule
and proposed amendments.
In addition to our general request for comment on the economic analysis associated with
the proposed rule and proposed amendments, we request specific comment on certain aspects of
the proposal:
•

To what extent do funds’ current practices regarding portfolio asset liquidity
classification and liquidity risk assessment and management currently align with the
proposed liquidity risk management program requirements, and what operational and
other costs would funds incur in modifying their current practices to comply with the
proposed requirements?

•

What factors, with respect to a fund’s particular risks and circumstances, would cause
particular variance in funds’ compliance costs related to the liquidity risk management
program requirement?

•

We note that rule 22e-4 as proposed is meant to provide flexibility in permitting a fund to
customize its liquidity risk management program, and thus we anticipate that the costs
and burdens relating to the program requirement will vary based on the fund’s risks and
circumstances. Does this flexibility (and the attendant requirement for each fund to adopt

358

liquidity risk management policies and procedures based on an assessment of the fund’s
individual liquidity risk) affect the extent to which a fund family could lower costs by
developing procedures, or implementing systems modifications, that could be used by all
funds within the fund family? Does this flexibility enhance the potential effectiveness of
the proposed liquidity risk management program?
•

We request comment on our estimates of the one-time and ongoing costs associated with
the proposed program requirement. Do commenters agree with our cost estimates? If
not, how should our estimates be revised, and what changes, if any, should be made to the
assumptions forming the basis for our estimates? Are there any significant costs that
have not been identified within our estimates that warrant consideration? To what degree
would economies of scale affect compliance costs for larger entities, and is the longer
proposed compliance period for small entities 814 appropriate in light of any relatively
larger burden that would be borne by smaller entities that are not able to take advantage
of economies of scale? How do commenters anticipate that these estimated costs might
be allocated between a fund and its adviser?

•

To what extent do commenters anticipate that the proposed liquidity risk management
program requirement could lead funds to modify their investment strategies or increase
their investments in relatively more liquid assets? Do commenters believe that the
proposed program requirement could significantly affect the market for relatively more
liquid assets (or, conversely, the market for relatively less liquid assets) and if so, to what
extent would these markets be affected?

•
814

We request comment on our estimate of the number of funds that would adopt swing
See supra section III.H.1.

359

pricing policies and procedures under proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3). For what reasons would
a fund decide not to adopt swing pricing policies and procedures, and would funds with
certain investment strategies be relatively more likely to adopt swing pricing policies and
procedures?
•

What operational and other costs would a fund incur in adopting swing pricing policies
and procedures, and would these costs be significantly lower if a fund is a member of a
fund complex that also includes foreign-domiciled funds that currently use swing
pricing? Do commenters agree with our cost estimates associated with proposed rule
22c-1(a)(3)? If not, how should our estimates be revised, and what changes, if any,
should be made to the assumptions forming the basis for our estimates? Are there any
significant costs that have not been identified within our estimates that warrant
consideration? How do commenters anticipate that these estimated costs might be
allocated between a fund and its adviser?

•

Would fund shareholders be more inclined or less inclined to invest in a fund that has
adopted swing pricing policies and procedures as contemplated by proposed rule
22c-1(a)(3)? Do commenters believe that swing pricing could preserve investment
returns to fund investors? If so, please provide any available data regarding the
relationship between the use of swing pricing and the preservation of investment returns.

•

Do commenters agree with our statement that swing pricing would be simpler and less
costly to implement than purchase fees or redemption fees?

•

Do the proposed disclosure and reporting requirements raise any concerns about
confidentiality relating to a fund’s portfolio holdings, investor confusion, the potential
misallocation of invested funds, or other concerns? To what extent would the proposed

360

portfolio liquidity-related enhancements to funds’ disclosures on Form N-PORT give rise

to front-running, predatory trading, and other activities that could be detrimental to a fund
and its investors?
•

Would additional prospectus disclosure about funds’ portfolio liquidity, beyond that
which would be required under the proposed Form N-1A amendments, be useful to
investors? If so, what additional disclosure would be most useful, and what disclosure
methods would permit funds to appropriately balance disclosure about liquidity-related
risks with disclosure regarding other risks facing the fund?

V.

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT ANALYSIS
A.

Introduction

Proposed rule 22e-4 and the proposed amendments to rule 22c-1 contain “collections of
information” within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). 815 In
addition, the proposed amendments to rule 31a-2, Form N-1A and Regulation S-X would impact
the collections of information burden under those rules and form. 816 The proposed amendments
to proposed Form N-CEN and proposed Form N-PORT would impact the collections of
information burdens associated with these proposed forms described in the Investment Company
Reporting Modernization Release. 817
The title for the existing collections of information are: “Rule 31a-2 Records to be

815

44 U.S.C. 3501 through 3521.

816

The paperwork burden from Regulation S-X is imposed by the rules and forms that relate to Regulation
S-X and, thus, is reflected in the analysis of those rules and forms. To avoid a PRA inventory reflecting
duplicative burdens and for administrative convenience, we have previously assigned a one-hour burden to
Regulation S-X.

preserved by registered investment companies, certain majority-owned subsidiaries thereof, and
other persons having transactions with registered investment companies” (OMB Control No.
3235-0179); and “Form N-1A under the Securities Act of 1933 and under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, Registration Statement of Open-End Management Investment
Companies” (OMB Control No. 3235-0307). In the Investment Company Reporting
Modernization Release, we submitted new collections of information for proposed Form N-CEN
and proposed Form N-PORT. 818 The titles for these new collections of information are: “Form
N-CEN Under the Investment Company Act, Annual Report for Registered Investment
Companies” and “Form N-PORT Under the Investment Company Act, Monthly Portfolio
Investments Report.” We are submitting new collections of information for proposed new rule
22e-4 and the proposed amendments to rule 22c-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The titles for these new collections of information would be: “Rule 22e-4 Under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, Liquidity risk management programs,” and “Rule 22c-1 Under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, Pricing of redeemable securities for distribution, redemption
and repurchase.” The Commission is submitting these collections of information to the OMB for
review in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11. An agency may not conduct
or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it
displays a currently valid control number.
The Commission is proposing new rule 22e-4 and amendments to rule 22c-1, rule 31a-2,
Regulation S-X and Form N-1A. The Commission also is proposing to amend proposed Form
N-CEN and proposed Form N-PORT. The new rule and proposed amendments are designed to
promote effective liquidity risk management throughout the open-end fund industry, prevent
818

See id.

362

potential dilution of interests of fund shareholders in light of redemption activity, and enhance

disclosure regarding fund liquidity and shareholder redemption practices. We discuss below the
collection of information burdens associated with these reforms.
B.

Rule 22e-4

Proposed rule 22e-4 would require funds to establish a written liquidity risk management
program that is reasonably designed to assess and manage the fund’s liquidity risk. This
program would include policies and procedures adopted by the fund that incorporate certain
program elements, including: (i) classification, and ongoing review of the classification, of the
liquidity of a fund’s portfolio positions; (ii) assessment and periodic review of a fund’s liquidity
risk; and (iii) management of the fund’s liquidity risk, including determination and periodic
review of the fund’s three-day liquidity asset minimum and establishment of policies and
procedures regarding redemptions in kind, to the extent that the fund engages in or reserves the
right to engage in redemptions in kind. The rule also would require board approval and
oversight of the program and recordkeeping. The proposed requirements that funds adopt a
written liquidity risk management program, report to the board, maintain a written record of how
the three-day liquid asset minimum and any adjustments were determined, and retain certain
records are collections of information under the PRA. The respondents to proposed rule 22e-4
would be open-end management investment companies (other than money market funds), and we
estimate that funds within 867 fund complexes would be subject to proposed rule 22e-4. 819
Compliance with proposed rule 22e-4 would be mandatory for all such funds. Information
regarding the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum would be confidential until publicly
819

See 2015 ICI Fact Book, supra note 3, at Fig. 1.8.

363

reported on Form N-PORT, as described below. Other information provided to the Commission

in connection with staff examinations or investigations would be kept confidential subject to the
provisions of applicable law.
1. Preparation of Written Liquidity Risk Management Program
We believe that most funds regularly monitor the liquidity of their portfolios as part of
the portfolio management function, but they may not have written policies and procedures
regarding liquidity management. Proposed rule 22e-4 would require funds to have a written
liquidity risk management program. We believe such a program would promote efficient
liquidity risk management, reduce the probability that a fund will be able to meet redemption
requests only through activities that could materially affect the fund’s NAV or risk profile or
dilute the interests of fund shareholders, and respond to risks associated with increasingly
complex portfolio investments and operations.
For purposes of this PRA analysis, we estimate that a fund complex would incur a
one-time average burden of 40 hours associated with documenting the liquidity risk management
programs adopted by each fund within the complex. Proposed rule 22e-4 requires fund boards to
approve the liquidity risk management program and any material changes to the program
(including the three-day liquid asset minimum), and we estimate a one-time burden of nine hours
per fund complex associated with fund boards’ review and approval of the funds’ liquidity risk
management programs and preparation of board materials. Amortized over a 3 year period, this
would be an annual burden per fund complex of about 16 hours. Accordingly, we estimate that
the total burden for initial documentation and review of funds’ written liquidity risk management

364

program would be 42,483 hours. 820 We also estimate that it would cost a fund complex

approximately $38,466 to document, review and initially approve these policies and procedures,
for a total cost of approximately $33,350,022. 821
2. Reporting Regarding the Three-Day Liquid Assets Minimum
Under proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv), each fund would be required as part of its liquidity
risk management program to determine and periodically review its three-day liquid asset
minimum. The fund’s investment adviser or officer that administers the liquidity risk
management program must provide a written report to the fund’s board at least annually that
reviews the adequacy of the fund’s liquidity risk management program, including the fund’s
three-day liquid asset minimum, and the effectiveness of its implementation.
For purposes of this PRA analysis, we estimate that, for each fund complex, compliance
with the reporting requirement would entail: (i) five hours of portfolio management time, (ii)
five hours of compliance time, (iii) five hours of professional legal time and (iv) 2.5 hours of
support staff time, requiring an additional 17.5 burden hours at a time cost of approximately
$5,193 per fund complex to draft the required report to the board. 822 We estimate that the total

820

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (40 + 9) hours x 867 fund complexes = 42,483 hours.

821

These estimates are based on the following calculations: 20 hours x $301 (hourly rate for a senior portfolio
manager) = $6,020; 20 hours x $455.5 (blended hourly rate for assistant general counsel ($426) and chief
compliance officer ($485) = $9,110; 5 hours x $4,400 (hourly rate for a board of 8 directors) = $22,000; 4
hours (for a fund attorney’s time to prepare materials for the board’s determinations) x $334 (hourly rate
for a compliance attorney) = $1,336. $6,020 + $9,110 + $22,000 + $1,336 = $38,466; $38,466 x 867 fund
complexes = $33,350,022. The hourly wages used are from SIFMA’s Management & Professional
Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013, modified to account for an 1800-hour work-year and multiplied
by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead. The staff previously estimated
in 2009 that the average cost of board of director time was $4,000 per hour for the board as a whole, based
on information received from funds and their counsel. Adjusting for inflation, the staff estimates that the
current average cost of board of director time is approximately $4,400.

822

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 5 hours x $301 (hourly rate for a senior portfolio
manager) = $1,505; 5 hours x $283 (hourly rate for compliance manager) = $1,415; 5 hours x $426 (hourly

365

burden for preparation of the board report would be 15,173 hours, at an aggregate cost of
$4,502,331. 823
3.

Recordkeeping

Proposed rule 22e-4(c) would require a fund to maintain a written copy of policies and
procedures adopted pursuant to its liquidity risk management program for five years in an easily
accessible place. The proposed rule also would require a fund to maintain copies of materials
provided to the board, as well as a written record of how the three-day liquid asset minimum and
any adjustments to the minimum were determined, for five years, the first two years in an easily
accessible place. The retention of these records would be necessary to allow the staff during
examinations of funds to determine whether a fund is in compliance with the required liquidity
risk management program. We estimate that the burden would be five hours per fund complex
to retain these records, with 2.5 hours spent by a general clerk and 2.5 hours spent by a senior
computer operator. We estimate a time cost per fund complex of $361. 824 We estimate that the
total burden for recordkeeping related to the liquidity risk management program would be 4,335
hours, at an aggregate cost of $312,987. 825

rate for assistant general counsel) = $2,130; and 2.5 hours x $57 (hourly rate for general clerk) = $143.
$1,505 + $1,415 + $2,130 + $143 = $5,193. The hourly wages used are from SIFMA’s Management &
Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013, modified to account for an 1800-hour work-year and
multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead. The hourly wage
used for the general clerk is from SIFMA’s Office Salaries in the Securities Industry 2013, modified to
account for an 1800-hour work-year and multiplied by 2.93 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee
benefits, and overhead.
Because each fund within a fund complex would be required to determine its own three-day liquid asset
minimum, this estimate assumes that the report at issue would incorporate an assessment of the three-day
liquid asset minimum for each fund within the fund complex.
823

These estimates are based on the following calculations: 867 fund complexes x 17.5 hours = 15,173 hours;
and $5,193 x 867 fund complexes = $4,502,331.

824

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 2.5 hours x $57 (hourly rate for a general clerk) =
$143; 2.5 hours x $87 (hour rate for a senior computer operator) = $218. $143 + $218 = $361.

825

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 867 fund complexes x 5 hours = 4,335 hours. 867

366

4. Estimated Total Burden
Amortized over a three-year period, the hour burdens and time costs associated with
proposed rule 22e-4, including the burden associated with (a) funds’ initial documentation and
review of the required written liquidity risk management program, (b) reporting to a fund’s board
regarding the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum, and (c) recordkeeping requirements, would
result in an average aggregate annual burden of 28,611 hours and average aggregate time costs of
$14,431,215. 826 We estimate that there are no external costs associated with this collection of
information.
C.

Rule 22c-1

We are proposing to amend rule 22c-1 and establish new collection of information
burdens under the rule. The proposed amendments would permit a fund (with the exception of a
money market fund or ETF) to establish and implement policies and procedures that would
require the fund, under certain circumstances, to use swing pricing to mitigate dilution of the
value of outstanding redeemable securities stemming from shareholder purchase or redemption
activity. We believe the proposed amendments to rule 22c-1 would promote investor protection
by providing funds with an additional tool to mitigate the potentially dilutive effects of
shareholder purchase or redemption activity and provide a set of operational standards that
would allow funds to gain comfort using swing pricing as a new means of mitigating potential

fund complexes x $361 = $312,987.
826

These estimates are based on the following calculations: 42,483 hours (year 1) + (2 x 15,173 hours) (years
2 and 3) + (3 x 4,335 hours) (years 1, 2 and 3) ÷ 3 = 28,611 hours; $33,350,022 (year 1) + (2 x $4,502,331)
(years 2 and 3) + (3 x $312,987) (years 1, 2 and 3) ÷ 3 = $14,431,215.

367

dilution.827

In order to use swing pricing under the proposed amendments, a fund would be required
to establish and implement swing pricing policies and procedures that meet certain
requirements. 828 The proposed amendments also would require a fund’s board of directors to
approve the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures, including any material change to these
policies and procedures, 829 and funds would be required to maintain a written copy of the fund’s
swing pricing policies and procedures. 830 The requirements that funds adopt policies and
procedures, obtain board approval and retain certain records related to swing pricing are
collections of information under the PRA. The respondents to the proposed amendments to rule
22c-1 would be open-end management investment companies (other than money market funds or
ETFs) that engage in swing pricing. We estimate that 167 fund complexes include funds that
would adopt swing pricing policies and procedures pursuant to the rule. 831 Compliance with rule
22c-1 would be mandatory for any fund that chose to use swing pricing to adjust its NAV in
reliance on the proposed amendments. The information when provided to the Commission in
connection with staff examinations or investigations would be kept confidential subject to the
provisions of applicable law.
For purposes of this PRA analysis, we estimate that each fund complex would incur a
one-time average burden of 24 hours to document swing pricing policies and procedures. The

830

See proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(iii).

831

See supra section IV.C.2.c.

368

proposed amendments to rule 22c-1 would require fund boards initially to approve the swing
pricing policies and procedures (including the swing threshold) and any material changes to
them, and we estimate a one-time burden of five hours per fund complex associated with the
fund board’s review and approval of swing pricing policies and procedures. Amortized over a 3
year period, this would be an annual burden per fund complex of about 10 hours. Accordingly,
we estimate that the total burden associated with the preparation and approval of swing pricing
policies and procedures by those fund complexes that we believe would use swing pricing would
be 4,843 hours. 832 We also estimate that it would cost a fund complex $21,710 to document,
review and initially approve these policies and procedures, for a total cost of $3,625,570. 833
The proposed amendments to rule 22c-1 also would require a fund that uses swing
pricing to retain a written copy of the fund’s swing policies and procedures that are in effect, or
at any time within the past six years were in effect, in an easily accessible place. 834 The retention
of these records would be necessary to allow the staff during examinations of funds to determine
whether a fund is in compliance with its swing pricing policies and procedures, and whether the
policies and procedures comply with the proposed amendments to rule 22c-1. We estimate that
the burden would be three hours per fund complex to retain these records, with 1.5 hours spent
by a general clerk and 1.5 hours spent by a senior computer operator. We estimate a time cost

832

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (24 +5) hours x 167 fund complexes = 4,843 hours.

833

These estimates are based on the following calculations: 12 hours x $198 (hourly rate for a senior
accountant) = $2,376; 12 hours x $455.5 (blended hourly rate for assistant general counsel ($426) and chief
compliance officer ($485) = $5,466; 3 hours x $4,400 (hourly rate for a board of 8 directors) = $13,200; 2
hours (for a fund attorney’s time to prepare materials for the board’s determinations) x $334 (hourly rate
for a compliance attorney) = $668; ($2,376 + $5,466 +$13,200 + $668) = $21,710; $21,710 x 167 fund
complexes = $3,625,570. The hourly wages used are from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings
in the Securities Industry 2013, modified to account for an 1800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to
account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead. See also supra note 821 (discussing basis
for estimated hourly rate for a board of directors).

834

Proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)(iii).

369

per fund complex of $216. 835 We estimate that the total for recordkeeping related to swing

pricing would be 501 hours, at an aggregate cost of $36,072 for all fund complexes that we
believe include funds that would adopt swing pricing policies and procedures. 836
Amortized over a three-year period, the hour burdens and time costs associated with the
proposed amendments to rule 22c-1, including the burden associated with the requirements that
funds adopt policies and procedures, obtain board approval and retain certain records related to
swing pricing, would result in an average aggregate annual burden of 2,115 hours and average
aggregate time costs of $1,244,595. 837 We estimate that there are no external costs associated
with this collection of information.
D.

Rule 31a-2

Section 31(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act requires registered investment
companies and certain of their majority-owned subsidiaries to maintain and preserve records as
prescribed by Commission rules. Rule 31a-1 under the Act specifies the books and records that
must be maintained. Rule 31a-2 under the Act specifies the time periods that entities must retain
certain books and records, including those required to be maintained under rule 31a-1. The
retention of records, as required by rule 31a-2, is necessary to ensure access by Commission staff
to material business and financial information about funds and certain related entities. This
information is used by the staff to evaluate fund compliance with the Investment Company Act

835

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 1.5 hours x $57 (hourly rate for a general clerk) =
$85.5; 1.5 hours x $87 (hour rate for a senior computer operator) = $130.5. $85.5 + $130.5 = $216.

836

These estimates are based on the following calculation: 3 hours x 167 fund complexes = 501 hours. 167
fund complexes x $216 = $36,072.

837

These estimates are based on the following calculations: 4,843 hours (year 1) + (3 x 501 hours) (years 1, 2
and 3) ÷ 3 = 2,115 hours; $3,625,570 (year 1) + (3 x $36,072) (years 1, 2 and 3) ÷ 3 = $1,244,595.

370

and regulations thereunder. The Commission currently estimates that the annual burden
associated with rule 31a-2 is 220 hours per fund, with 110 hours spent by a general clerk at a rate
of $52 per hour and 110 hours spent by a senior computer operator at a rate of $81 per hour. 838
The current estimate of the total annual burden for all funds to comply with rule 31a-2 is
approximately 766,480 hours at an estimated cost of $50,970.920. 839
We are proposing to amend rule 31a-2 to require a fund that chooses to use swing pricing
to create and maintain a record of support for each computation of an adjustment to the NAV of
the fund’s shares based on the fund’s swing policies and procedures. 840 This collection of
information requirement would be mandatory for any fund that chooses to use swing pricing to
adjust its NAV in reliance on the proposed amendments to rule 22c-1. To the extent that the
Commission receives confidential information pursuant to this collection of information, such
information would be kept confidential, subject to the provisions of applicable law.
We estimate that approximately 947 funds would use swing pricing pursuant to the
proposed amendments to rule 22c-1. We also estimate that each fund that uses swing pricing
generally would incur an additional burden of 1 hour per year in order to comply with the
proposed amendments to rule 31a-2. Accordingly, we estimate that the total average annual hour
burden associated with the proposed amendments to rule 31a-2 would be an additional 947 hours

838

The estimated salary rates were derived from SIFMA’s Office Salaries in the Securities Industry 2011,
modified to account for an 1800-hour work-year and multiplied by 2.93 to account for bonuses, firm size,
employee benefits, and overhead.

839

These estimates were based on the following calculations: 220 hours x 3,484 funds (the estimated number
of funds the last time the rule’s information collections were submitted for PRA renewal in 2012) =
766,480 total hours; 776,480 hours ÷ 2 = 383,240 hours; 383,240 x $52/hour for a clerk = $19,928,480;
383,240 x $81 rate per hour for a computer operator = $31,042,440; $19,928,480 + $31,042,440 =
$50,970,920 total cost.

at a cost of $68,169. 841

The Commission currently estimates that the average external cost of preserving books
and records required by rule 31a-2 is approximately $70,000 per fund at a total cost of
approximately $243,880,000 per year, 842 but that funds would already spend approximately half
this amount to preserve these same books and records, as they are also necessary to prepare
financial statements, meet various state reporting requirements, and prepare their annual federal
and state income tax returns. Therefore, the Commission estimated that the total annual cost
burden for all funds as a result of compliance with rule 31a-2 is approximately $121,940,000. 843
We estimate that the annual external cost burden of compliance with the information collection
requirements of rule 31a-2 would increase by $300 per fund that engages in swing pricing, for an
increase in the total annual cost burden of $284,100. 844
E.

Form N-PORT

On May 20, 2015, the Commission proposed Form N-PORT, which would require funds
to report information within thirty days after the end of each month about their monthly portfolio
holdings to the Commission in a structured data format. Preparing a report on Form N-PORT is
mandatory and a collection of information under the PRA, and the information required by Form
N-PORT would be data-tagged in XML format. Responses to the reporting requirements would
841

These estimates are based on the following calculations: 1 hour x 947 funds = 947 total hours; 474 hours x
$57 rate per hour for a general clerk = $27,018; 473 hours x $87 rate per hour for a senior computer
operator = $41,151; $27,018 + $41,151 = $68,169 total cost.

842

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 3,484 funds (the estimated number of funds the last
time the rule’s information collections were submitted for PRA renewal in 2012) x $70,000 =
$243,880,000.

843

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 947 funds x $300 = $284,100.

be kept confidential for reports filed with respect to the first two months of each quarter; the
third month of the quarter would not be kept confidential, but made public sixty days after the
quarter end.
In the Investment Company Reporting Modernization Release, we estimated that, for the
35% of funds that would file reports on proposed Form N-PORT in house, the per fund average
aggregate annual hour burden was estimated to be 178 hours per fund, and the average cost to
license a third-party software solution would be $4,805 per fund per year. 845 For the remaining
65% of funds that would retain the services of a third party to prepare and file reports on
proposed Form N-PORT on the fund’s behalf, we estimated the average aggregate annual hour
burden to be 125 hours per fund, and each fund would pay an average fee of $11,440 per fund
per year for the services of third-party service provider. In sum, we estimated that filing reports
on proposed Form N-PORT would impose an average total annual hour burden of 1,537,572
hours on applicable funds, and all applicable funds would incur on average, in the aggregate,
external annual costs of $97,674, 221. 846
We are proposing amendments to Form N-PORT that would require each fund to report
its three-day liquid asset minimum,847 the liquidity classification for each portfolio asset position
(or portion thereof), 848 and whether an asset is a 15% standard asset. 849 For portfolio assets with
multiple liquidity classifications, the proposed amendments would require funds to indicate the

dollar amount attributable to each classification. We believe that requiring funds to report
information about the liquidity of portfolio investments would assist the Commission in better
assessing liquidity risk in the open-end fund industry. Moreover, we believe that this
information would help investors and potential users better understand the liquidity risks in
funds.
1.

Liquidity Classification

Under proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(i), an open-end management investment company (other
than a money market fund) would be required as part of its liquidity risk management program to
classify the liquidity of each of its positions in a portfolio asset (or portions of a position in a
particular asset) based the number of days that the fund’s position in the asset (or portion thereof)
would be convertible to cash at a price that does not materially affect the value of that asset
immediately prior to sale. We estimate that 8,734 funds would be required to file, on a monthly
basis, additional information on Form N-PORT as a result of the proposed amendments. 850
Funds also would be required to conduct an ongoing review of the liquidity of their assets.
Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii) includes factors that funds must take into account when classifying
the liquidity of their assets. The liquidity classifications of each portfolio asset position would be
reported on Item C. 13 of proposed Form N-PORT.
Based on staff outreach, we understand that many funds currently categorize assets based
on their liquidity, but this proposal would require a specific type of classification and the
determination of a three-day liquid asset minimum. We expect that funds would incur a
one-time internal burden to initially classify a fund’s portfolio securities and program existing
850

There were 8,734 open-end funds (excluding money market funds, and including ETFs (for purposes of
these calculations, we exclude non-1940 Act ETFs)) as of the end of 2014. See 2015 ICI Fact Book, supra
note 3, at 177, 184.

374

systems to conduct the ongoing classifications and reviews required by the proposed rule for
reporting purposes. We estimate that each fund would incur an average one-time burden of 54
hours at a time cost of $15,330. 851 Amortized over a three year period, this would result in an
average annual hour burden of approximately 18 burden hours and a time cost of $5,110. 852
2.

Reporting on Proposed Form N-PORT

In addition to the classification and review of securities, we estimate that 8,734 853 funds
would be required to file, on a monthly basis, additional information on Form N-PORT as a
result of the proposed amendments. We estimate that each fund that files reports on Form
N-PORT in house (35%, or 3,057 funds) would require an average of approximately 3 burden
hours to compile (including review of the information), tag, and electronically file the additional
information in light of the proposed amendments for the first time and an average of
approximately 1 burden hours for subsequent filings. Therefore, we estimate the per fund
average annual hour burden associated with the incremental changes to Form N-PORT as a result
of the proposed amendments for these funds would be an additional 14 hours for the first year 854
and an additional 12 hours for each subsequent year. 855 Amortized over three years, the average
annual hour burden would be an additional 12.67 hours per fund. 856

851

We estimate that these systems modifications would include the following costs: (i) project planning and
systems design (24 hours x $260 (hourly rate for a senior systems analyst) = $6,240) and (ii) systems
modification integration, testing, installation and deployment (30 hours x $303 (hourly rate for a senior
programmer) = $9,090. $6,240 + $9,090 = $15,330.

852

$15,330 ÷ 3 = $5,110.

853

There were 8,734 open-end funds (excluding money market funds, and including ETFs) as of the end of
2014. See 2015 ICI Fact Book, supra note 3, at 177, 184.

854

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (1 filing x 3 hours) + (11 filings x 1 hour) = 14 burden
hours in the first year.

855

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 12 filings x 1 hour = 12 burden hours in each
subsequent year.

856

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (14 + (12 x 2)) ÷ 3 = 12.67.

375

We estimate that 65% of funds (5,677) would retain the services of a third party to
provide data aggregation, validation and/or filing services as part of the preparation and filing of
reports on proposed Form N-PORT on the fund’s behalf. For these funds, we estimate that each
fund would require an average of approximately 4 hours to compile and review the information
with the service provider prior to electronically filing the report for the first time and an average
of 0.5 burden hours for subsequent filings. Therefore, we estimate the per fund average annual
hour burden associated with the incremental changes to proposed Form N-PORT as a result of
the proposed amendments for these funds would be an additional 9.5 hours for the first year 857
and an additional 6 hours for each subsequent year. 858 Amortized over three years, the average
aggregate annual hour burden would be an additional 7.17 hours per fund. 859 In sum, we estimate
that the proposed amendments to Form N-PORT would impose an average total annual hour
burden of an additional 79,436.28 hours on applicable funds. 860 We do not anticipate any change
to the total external annual costs of $97,674,221. 861
F.

Form N-CEN

On May 20, 2015, we proposed to amend rule 30a-1 to require all funds to file reports
with certain census-type information on proposed Form N-CEN with the Commission on an
annual basis. Proposed Form N-CEN would be a collection of information under the PRA, and
is designed to facilitate the Commission’s oversight of funds and its ability to monitor trends and
857

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (1 filing x 4 hours) + (11 filings x 0.5 hour) = 9.5
burden hours in the first year.

858

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 12 filings x 0.5 hour = 6 burden hours in each
subsequent year.

859

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (9.5 + (6 x 2)) ÷ 3 = 7.17.

860

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (3,057 funds x 12.67 hours) + (5,677 funds x 7.17
hours) = 79,436.28 hours.

861

See Investment Company Reporting Modernization Release, supra note 104, at n. 751 and accompanying
text.

376

risks. The collection of information under Form N-CEN would be mandatory for all funds, and
responses would not be kept confidential.
In the Investment Company Reporting Modernization Release, we estimated that the
average annual hour burden per response for proposed Form N-CEN for the first year would be
32.37 hours and 12.37 hours in subsequent years. 862 Amortizing the burden over three years, we
estimated that the average annual hour burden per fund per year would be 19.04 and the total
average annual hour burden would be 59,900 hours. 863 We also estimated that all applicable
funds would incur, in the aggregate, external annual costs of $1,748,637, which would include
the costs of registering and maintaining LEIs for funds.
We are proposing amendments to Form N-CEN to enhance the reporting of a fund’s
liquidity risk management practices. Specifically, the proposed amendments to Form N-CEN
would require a fund to disclose information about committed lines of credit, including the size
of the line of credit, the number of days that the line of credit was used, and the identity of the
institution with whom the line of credit is held. The proposed amendments to Form N-CEN also
would require a fund to report whether it engaged in interfund lending or interfund borrowing.
Funds other than money market funds and ETFs would be required to report whether they used
swing pricing during the reporting period. In addition, proposed amendments to Form N-CEN
would require an ETF to report whether it required that an authorized participant post collateral
to the ETF or any of its designated service providers in connection with the purchase or
redemption of ETF shares during the reporting period. 864

862

863

Id. at n. 765 and accompanying text.

864

We do not estimate any change in burden as a result of proposed Item 60(g) of Form N-CEN because the
proposed new item only requires a yes or no response.

377

We estimate that 8,734 funds would be required to file responses on Form N-CEN as a
result of the proposed amendments to the form. We estimate that the average annual hour
burden per additional response to Form N-CEN as a result of the proposed amendments would
be 0.5 hour per fund per year for a total average annual hour burden of 4,367 hours. 865 We do not
estimate any change to the external costs associated with proposed Form N-CEN.
G.

Form N-1A

Form N-1A is the registration form used by open-end investment companies. The
respondents to the proposed amendments to Form N-1A are open-end management investment
companies registered or registering with the Commission. Compliance with the disclosure
requirements of Form N-1A is mandatory, and the responses to the disclosure requirements are
not confidential. We currently estimate for Form N-1A a total hour burden of 1,579,974 hours,
and the total annual external cost burden is $124,820,197. 866
We are proposing amendments to Form N-1A that would require funds that use swing
pricing to disclose that they use swing pricing, and, if applicable, an explanation of the
circumstances under which swing pricing is used, and the effects of using swing pricing. 867 We
also are proposing amendments to Form N-1A that would require funds to disclose on their
balance sheet the NAV as adjusted pursuant to swing pricing policies and procedures. The
proposed amendments to Form N-1A also would require funds to disclose additional information
concerning the procedures for redeeming a fund’s shares. Funds would be required to describe
the number of days following receipt of shareholder redemption requests in which the fund will

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 8,734 funds x 0.5 hours = 4,367 hours.

866

These estimates are based on the last time the rule’s information collections were submitted for PRA
renewal in 2014.

867

See proposed Item 6(d) of Form N-1A.

378

pay redemption proceeds to redeeming shareholders. 868 Funds also would be required to describe
the methods used to meet redemption requests in stressed and non-stressed market conditions. 869
Finally, funds would be required to file as exhibits to their registration statements credit
agreements for the benefit of the funds. Overall, we believe that requiring funds to provide this
additional disclosure regarding swing pricing and redemption procedures, and requiring the filing
of credit agreements would provide Commission staff, investors, and market participants with
improved information about the procedures funds use to meet their redemption obligations and
the conditions under which swing pricing procedures will be used to mitigate the effects of
dilution as a result of shareholder purchase or redemption activity.
Form N-1A generally imposes two types of reporting burdens on investment companies:
(i) the burden of preparing and filing the initial registration statement; and (ii) the burden of
preparing and filing post-effective amendments to a previously effective registration statement
(including post-effective amendments filed pursuant to rule 485(a) or 485(b) under the Securities
Act, as applicable).

We estimate that each fund would incur a one-time burden of an additional

2 hours, 870 at a time cost of an additional $637, 871 to draft and finalize the required disclosure and
amend its registration statement. In aggregate, we estimate that funds would incur a one-time
burden of an additional 17,468 hours, 872 at a time cost of an additional $5,563,558, 873 to comply

See proposed Item 11(c)(7) of Form N-1A.

See proposed Item 11(c)(8) of Form N-1A.

870

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 1 hour to update registration statement to include swing
pricing-related disclosure statements + 1 hour to update registration statement disclosure about redemption
procedures = 2 hours.

871

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 2 hours x $318.5 (blended rate for a compliance
attorney ($334) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $637.

872

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 2 hours x 8,734 funds = 17,468 hours.

873

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 17,468 hours x $318.50 (blended rate for a compliance
attorney ($334) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $5,563,558.

with the proposed Form N-1A disclosure requirements. Amortizing the one-time burden over a

three-year period results in an average annual burden of an additional 5,823 hours at a time cost
of an additional $1,854,519. 874
We estimate that each fund would incur an ongoing burden of an additional 0.25 hours, at
a time cost of an additional $80, 875 each year to review and update the proposed disclosure in
response to Item 11 and Item 28 of Form N-1A regarding the pricing and redemption of fund
shares and the inclusion of credit agreements as exhibits, respectively. In aggregate, we estimate
that funds would incur an annual burden of an additional 2,184 hours, 876 at a time cost of an
additional $695,604, 877 to comply with the proposed Form N-1A disclosure requirements.
Amortizing these one-time and ongoing hour and cost burdens over three years results in
an average annual increased burden of approximately 0.50 hours per fund, 878 at a time cost of
$265.42 per fund. 879
In total, we estimate that funds would incur an average annual increased burden of
approximately 8,007 hours, 880 at a time cost of approximately $2,550,123, 881 to comply with the

874

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 17,468 hours ÷ 3 = 5,823 average annual burden
hours; $5,563,558 burden costs ÷ 3 = $1,854,519 average annual burden cost.

875

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 0.25 hours x $318.50 (blended hourly rate for a
compliance attorney ($334) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $79.63.

876

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 0.25 hours x 8,734 funds = 2,183.5 hours.

877

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 2,184 hours x $318.50 (blended hourly rate for a
compliance attorney ($334) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $695,604.

878

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 1 burden hour (year 1) + 0.25 burden hour (year 2) +
0.25 burden hour (year 3) ÷ 3 = 0.50 hours.

879

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $637 (year 1 monetized burden hours) + $79.63 (year 2
monetized burden hours) + $79.63 (year 3 monetized burden hours) ÷ 3 = $265.42.

880

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 5,823 hours + 2,184 hours = 8,007 hours.

costs associated with the proposed amendments to Form N-1A.
H.

Request for Comments

We request comment on whether our estimates for burden hours and any external costs as
described above are reasonable. Pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(B), the Commission solicits
comments in order to: (i) evaluate whether the proposed collections of information are necessary
for the proper performance of the functions of the Commission, including whether the
information will have practical utility; (ii) evaluate the accuracy of the Commission’s estimate of
the burden of the proposed collections of information; (iii) determine whether there are ways to
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (iv) determine
whether there are ways to minimize the burden of the collections of information on those who
are to respond, including through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of
information technology.
The agency has submitted the proposed collection of information to OMB for approval.
Persons wishing to submit comments on the collection of information requirements of the
proposed amendments should direct them to the Office of Management and Budget, Attention
Desk Officer for the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, and should send a copy to Brent J. Fields, Secretary,
Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549 1090, with
reference to File No. S7-16-15. OMB is required to make a decision concerning the collections
of information between 30 and 60 days after publication of this release; therefore, a comment to
OMB is best assured of having its full effect if OMB receives it within 30 days after publication
of this release. Requests for materials submitted to OMB by the Commission with regard to

381

these collections of information should be in writing, refer to File No. S7-16-15, and be

submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street,
NE., Washington, DC 20549-2736.

INITIAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT ANALYSIS
This Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared in accordance with section

3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”). 882 It relates to: proposed rule 22e-4; proposed
amendments to rule 22c-1(a)(3) and rule 31a-2; and proposed amendments to Form N-1A,
Regulation S-X, proposed Form N-PORT, and proposed Form N-CEN.
A.

Reasons for and Objectives of the Proposed Actions

Funds are not currently subject to requirements under the federal securities laws or
Commission rules that specifically require them to manage their liquidity risk. 883 Also, with the
exception of money market funds, there are guidelines (not rules) stating that an open-end fund
should limit its investments in illiquid assets. 884 Moreover, funds are only subject to limited
disclosure and reporting requirements concerning a fund’s liquidity risk and risk management. 885
We understand that funds today engage in a variety of different practices, with varying levels of
comprehensiveness, for classifying the liquidity of their portfolio assets, assessing and managing
liquidity risk, and disclosing information about their liquidity risk, redemption practices, and
liquidity risk management practices to investors. 886

The Commission is proposing a new rule, amendments to current rules, and amendments
to current and proposed forms that are designed to promote effective liquidity risk management
throughout the open-end fund industry and thereby reduce the risk that funds will be unable to
meet redemption obligations and mitigate dilution of the interests of fund shareholders. The
proposed amendments also seek to enhance disclosure regarding fund liquidity and redemption
practices. Specifically, a primary objective of these proposed liquidity regulations is to promote
shareholder protection by elevating the overall quality of liquidity risk management across the
fund industry, as well as by increasing transparency of funds’ liquidity risks and risk
management. The proposed liquidity regulations are also intended to lessen the possibility of
early redemption incentives (and investor dilution) created by insufficient liquidity risk
management, as well as the possibility that investors’ share value will be diluted by costs
incurred by the fund as a result of other investors’ purchase and redemption activity. Finally, the
proposed liquidity regulations are meant to address recent industry developments that have
underscored the significance of funds’ liquidity risk management practices. Each of these
objectives is discussed in detail in section IV above.
B.

Legal Basis

The Commission is proposing new rule 22e-4 under the authority set forth in sections
22(c), 22(e) and 38(a) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-37(a)]. The Commission
is proposing amendments to rule 22c-1 under the authority set forth in sections 22(c) and 38(a) of
the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-22(c) and 80a-37(a)]. The Commission is
proposing amendments to rule 31a-2 under the authority set forth in section 31(a) of the
Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-31(a)]. The Commission is proposing amendments to
Form N-1A, Regulation S-X, proposed Form N-PORT, and proposed Form N-CEN under the

383

authority set forth in the Securities Act, particularly section 19 thereof [15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.],
the Trust Indenture Act, particularly, section 19 thereof [15 U.S.C. 77aaa et seq.], the Exchange
Act, particularly sections 10, 13, 15, and 23, and 35A thereof [15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.], and the
Investment Company Act, particularly, sections 8, 30, and 38 thereof [15 U.S.C. 80a et seq.].
C.

Small Entities Subject to the Proposed Liquidity Regulations

An investment company is a small entity if, together with other investment companies in
the same group of related investment companies, it has net assets of $50 million or less as of the
end of its most recent fiscal year. 887 Commission staff estimates that, as of December 2014, there
were 134 small open-end investment companies (comprising 85 fund complexes) that would be
considered small entities; this number includes open-end ETFs.
D.

Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements
1.

Proposed Rule 22e-4

Proposed new rule 22e-4 would require each fund, including each small entity, to
establish a written liquidity risk management program. 888 A fund’s liquidity risk management
program would be required to include the following elements: (i) a fund must classify, and
review the classification on an ongoing basis, the liquidity of each of the fund’s positions in a
portfolio asset (or portions of a position in a particular asset), taking into account certain
specified factors; 889 (ii) a fund must assess and periodically review its liquidity risk, taking into
account certain specified factors; 890 and (iii) a fund must manage its liquidity risk, including by

maintaining a prescribed minimum portion of net assets in three-day liquid assets. 891 A fund’s
board, including a majority of the fund’s independent directors, would be required to approve the
fund’s liquidity risk management program, as well as any material change to the program. 892
Proposed rule 22e-4 also includes certain recordkeeping requirements. 893 All of these
requirements are discussed in detail above in sections III.A. and III.E. For smaller funds and
fund groups (i.e., funds that together with other investment companies in the same “group of
related investment companies” have net assets of less than $1 billion as of the end of the most
recent fiscal year), which would include small entities, we have proposed an extra 12 months (or
30 months after the effective date) to comply with the proposed liquidity risk management
program requirement. 894
We estimate that 85 fund complexes are small fund groups that have funds that would be
required to comply with the proposed liquidity risk management program requirement. 895 As
discussed above, we estimate that, on average, a fund complex would incur one-time costs
ranging from $1,300,000 to $2,250,000, depending on the fund’s particular circumstances and
current liquidity risk management practices, to establish and implement a liquidity risk
management program. 896 We further estimate that a fund complex would incur ongoing annual
costs associated with proposed rule 22e-4 that would range from $130,000 to $562,500. 897 For

two-thirds of small fund groups would incur one-time and ongoing costs on the low end of the
range of costs associated with establishing and implementing a liquidity risk management
program, 898 and one-third of small fund groups would incur one-time and ongoing costs on the
high end of the range. 899
2.

Swing Pricing

Under proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3), all funds (except money market funds and ETFs),
including small entities, would be permitted (but not required) to use swing pricing to adjust the
fund’s current NAV to prevent potential dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable
securities caused by shareholder purchase or redemption activity. In order to use swing pricing,
a fund would be required to adopt swing pricing policies and procedures that must: (i) provide
that the fund will adjust its NAV by an amount designated as the “swing factor” once the level of
net purchases or net redemptions from the fund has exceeded a specified percentage of the fund’s
net asset value known as the “swing threshold”; 900 (ii) specify the fund’s swing threshold,
considering certain specified factors; 901 (iii) provide for the periodic review (at least annually) of
the fund’s swing threshold considering certain specified factors; 902 (iv) specify how the swing
factor to be used to adjust the fund’s NAV when the fund’s swing threshold is breached will be
determined, which determination must take into account certain specified factors. 903 A fund’s
board, including a majority of the fund’s independent directors, would be required to approve the

fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures. 904 A fund that adopts swing pricing policies and
procedures also would be subject to certain recordkeeping requirements under proposed rule
22c-1(a)(3) and proposed amendments to rule 31a-2(a)(2). 905 Because proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)
would permit, but not require, a fund to adopt swing pricing policies and procedures, there is no
compliance date associated with this proposed rule. Thus, while we anticipate that the
compliance dates for proposed rule 22e-4 and the proposed disclosure and reporting
requirements regarding liquidity risk and liquidity risk management would be tiered to permit a
longer compliance period for smaller funds and fund groups, there would be no need for tiered
compliance with respect to proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) and the proposed amendments to rule
31a-2(a)(2), because a fund would be permitted to adopt swing pricing policies and procedures
within whatever period the fund chooses. 906
As discussed above, we estimate that, on average, a fund complex would incur one-time
costs ranging from $1,300,000 to $2,250,000, depending on the fund complex’s particular
circumstances, to adopt swing pricing policies and procedures and comply with related record
retention requirements, as well as ongoing annual costs ranging from $65,000 to $337,500 per
year associated with the proposed swing pricing (and related recordkeeping) regulations. 907 We
estimate that 24 fund complexes that are small complexes would adopt swing pricing policies
and procedures under proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3). 908 Because staff is unable to estimate how many

We assume that certain types of mutual fund strategies (high-yield bond funds, world bond funds
(including emerging market debt funds), multi-sector bond funds, state municipal funds, alternative strategy
funds, and emerging market equity funds would be relatively more likely to adopt swing pricing policies
and procedures, and of the fund complexes with funds comprising these strategies, 75% would actually

small fund complexes would incur one-time and ongoing costs on the low end of the estimated
range versus the high end of the estimated range, staff estimates that each small fund complex
would incur one-time costs of $1,775,000 (which represents the middle of the range of estimated
one-time costs) 909 and ongoing costs of $201,250 (which represents the middle of the range of
estimated ongoing costs). 910

Disclosure and Reporting Requirements Regarding Liquidity Risk and
Liquidity Risk Management

We are proposing amendments to Form N-1A, proposed Form N-PORT, and proposed
Form N-CEN to enhance fund disclosure and reporting regarding the fund’s redemption
practices, portfolio liquidity, and certain liquidity risk management practices. Specifically,
proposed amendments to Form N-1A would require new disclosure regarding a fund’s
redemption practices and its use of swing pricing (as applicable); 911 and proposed amendments to
proposed Form N-PORT would require a fund to report certain information about the liquidity of
the fund’s portfolio assets. 912 Proposed amendments to proposed Form N-CEN would require a
fund to report certain information about the fund’s use of lines of credit, interfund lending and
borrowing, and swing pricing, and also would require an ETF to report whether it requires
authorized participants to post collateral in connection with the purchase or redemption of ETF
shares. 913

adopt swing pricing policies and procedures. Staff estimates that there are 32 fund complexes that are
small fund groups with funds that use these stated strategies. 0.75 x 32 funds = 24 funds.
909

This estimate is based on the following calculations: $1,300,000 + $2,250,000 = $3,550,000; $3,550,000 ÷
2 = $1,775,000.

910

This estimate is based on the following calculations: $65,000 + $337,500 = $402,500; $402,500 ÷ 2 =
$201,250.

Proposed Items 6(d), 11(c)(8), 11(c)(9) of Form N-1A.

912

Proposed Items B.7, C.7, and C.13 of proposed Form N-PORT.

913

Proposed Items 44 and 60(g) of proposed Form N-CEN.

388

All funds would be subject to the proposed disclosure and reporting requirements,
including funds that are small entities. For smaller funds and fund groups (i.e., funds that
together with other investment companies in the same “group of related investment companies”
have net assets of less than $1 billion as of the end of the most recent fiscal year), which would
include small entities, we proposed an extra 12 months (or 30 months after the effective date) to
comply with the proposed Form N-PORT reporting requirements. 914 We estimate that 134 funds
are small entities that would be required to comply with the proposed disclosure and reporting
requirements. 915
As discussed above, we estimate that each fund, including funds that are small entities,
would incur a one-time burden of an additional 2 hours, at a time cost of an additional $637 (plus
printing costs), to comply with the proposed amendments to Form N-1A. 916 We also estimate
that each fund, including small entities, would incur an ongoing burden of an additional 0.25
hours, at a time cost of approximately an additional $80 each year associated with compliance
with the proposed amendments to Form N-1A. 917 We do not estimate any change to the external
costs associated with the proposed amendments to Form N-1A. 918
We also estimate that the one-time disclosure- and reporting-related compliance costs for
a fund that files reports in compliance with the proposed amendments to Form N-PORT in house
would be approximately $780, and the one-time costs for a fund that uses a third-party service
provider to prepare and file reports on proposed Form N-PORT would be approximately

$1,040. 919 We estimate that the ongoing disclosure- and reporting-related compliance costs for a
fund that files reports to comply with the proposed amendments to Form N-PORT in house
would be approximately $260, and the ongoing costs for a fund that uses a third-party service
provider to prepare and file reports on proposed Form N-PORT would be approximately $130. 920
These compliance cost estimates would not vary based on the fund’s size. We assume that 35%
of funds that are small entities, or approximately 47 funds, would file reports on proposed Form
N-PORT in house, and 65% of funds that are small entities, or approximately 87 funds, would
use a third-party service provider to prepare and file reports on proposed Form N-PORT. 921
As discussed above, we also estimate that the average annual burden per additional
response to Form N-CEN as a result of the proposed amendments would be 0.5 hour per year per
fund, including funds that are small entities. 922 Furthermore, we estimate that the one-time and
ongoing annual compliance costs associated with providing additional responses to Form N-CEN
as a result of the proposed amendments would be approximately $160 per fund, including funds
that are small entities. 923 We do not estimate any change to the external costs associated with
proposed Form N-CEN. 924

390

The RFA directs the Commission to consider significant alternatives that would
accomplish our stated objectives, while minimizing any significant economic impact on small
entities. We considered the following alternatives for small entities in relation to the proposed
liquidity regulations: (i) exempting funds that are small entities from proposed rule 22e-4, and/or
establishing different requirements under proposed rule 22e-4 to account for resources available
to small entities; (ii) exempting funds that are small entities from the proposed disclosure and
reporting requirements, or establishing different disclosure and reporting requirements, or
different reporting frequency, to account for resources available to small entities; and (iii)
exempting funds that are small entities from proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) and the recordkeeping
requirements of the proposed amendments to rule 31a-2.
We do not believe that exempting any subset of funds, including funds that are small
entities, from proposed rule 22e-4 would permit us to achieve our stated objectives. As
discussed above, we believe that the proposed liquidity regulations would result in multiple
investor protection benefits, and these benefits should apply to investors in smaller funds as well
as investors in larger funds. 925 Small funds do not entail less liquidity risk than larger funds, and
investors in small funds could suffer from ineffective liquidity risk management just as investors
in larger funds could. Indeed, analysis by staff economists has shown that funds with relatively
low assets can actually experience greater flow volatility (including more volatility in
unexpected flows) than funds with higher assets, which in turn could lead to increased liquidity
risk for investors in smaller funds. 926 Moreover, we understand, based on staff outreach, that
small funds today are less likely than large funds to employ relatively comprehensive portfolio

925

See supra section IV.C.1.b.

926

See supra note 727 and accompanying text.

391

liquidity classification practices and liquidity risk management practices. Thus, while small
funds may face increased liquidity risk, these funds currently may have less effective systems in
place to address and mitigate this risk than larger funds. We therefore do not believe it would be
appropriate to exempt funds that are small entities from the liquidity risk management
requirements of proposed rule 22e-4. We do note, however, that we are proposing a delayed
compliance period for proposed rule 22e-4 for funds that are small entities. 927
We also do not believe that it would be desirable to establish different requirements
applicable to funds of different sizes under proposed rule 22e-4 to account for resources
available to small entities. We believe that all of the proposed program elements would be
necessary for a fund to effectively assess and manage its liquidity risk, and we anticipate that all
of the proposed program elements would work together to produce the anticipated investor
protection benefits. We do note that the costs associated with proposed rule 22e-4 would vary
depending on the fund’s particular circumstances, and thus the proposed rule could result in
different burdens on funds’ resources. In particular, we expect that a fund that pursues an
investment strategy that involves greater liquidity risk may have greater costs associated with its
liquidity risk management program. However, we believe that it is appropriate to correlate the
costs associated with the proposed rule with the level of liquidity risk facing a fund, and not
necessarily with the fund’s size. Under the proposed rule, a fund would be permitted to
customize its liquidity risk management program precisely to reflect the liquidity risks that it
typically faces, and that it could face in stressed market conditions. This flexibility in permitting
a fund to customize its liquidity risk management program is meant to result in programs whose
scope, and related costs and burdens, are appropriate to manage the actual amount of liquidity
927

See supra section III.H.

392

risk faced by a particular fund. Thus, to the extent a fund that is a small entity faces relatively
little liquidity risk, it would incur relatively low costs to comply with proposed rule 22e-4.
However, as discussed above, we believe that small funds could generally entail relatively high
liquidity risk compared to larger funds, and thus these funds could incur relatively high costs to
comply with proposed rule 22e-4. 928
Similarly, we do not believe that the interest of investors would be served by exempting
funds that are small entities from the proposed disclosure and reporting requirements, or
subjecting these funds to different disclosure and reporting requirements than larger funds. We
believe that all fund investors, including investors in funds that are small entities, would benefit
from disclosure and reporting requirements that would permit them to make investment choices
that better match their risk tolerances. 929 We also believe that all fund investors would benefit
from enhanced Commission monitoring and oversight of the fund industry, which we anticipate
would result from the proposed disclosure and reporting requirements. We note that the current
disclosure requirements for reports on Form N-1A, and the proposed requirements for reports on
proposed Form N-PORT and proposed Form N-CEN, do not distinguish between small entities
and other funds. 930 However, as discussed above, proposed Form N-PORT has a delayed
compliance period for small entities that would file reports on this form, and we are also
proposing a delayed compliance period for the amendments to proposed Form N-PORT that we

small entities currently follow the same requirements that large entities do when filing reports on Form

reporting requirements or frequency for small entities (including with respect to proposed Form N-PORT
and proposed Form N-CEN) would not be consistent with the Commission’s goal of industry oversight and
investor protection).

393

are proposing today. 931
Finally, we are not exempting funds that are small entities from proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3)
because we believe that all funds should be able to use swing pricing as a voluntary tool to
mitigate potential shareholder dilution. 932 We do not believe that the potential dilution that
proposed rule 22c-1(a)(3) is meant to prevent would affect large funds and their shareholders
more significantly than small funds and investors in small funds. Also, because the adoption of
swing pricing policies and procedures would be permitted, but not required, under proposed rule
22c-1(a)(3), a fund that is a small entity would not need to incur the costs of compliance with the
proposed rule if the fund (and the fund’s board) were to determine that the advantages of swing
pricing would not outweigh the associated disadvantages, including compliance costs.

General Request for Comment

The Commission requests comments regarding this analysis. We request comment on the
number of small entities that would be subject to the proposed liquidity regulations and whether
the proposed liquidity regulations would have any effects that have not been discussed. We
request that commenters describe the nature of any effects on small entities subject to the
proposed liquidity regulations and provide empirical data to support the nature and extent of such
effects. We also request comment on the estimated compliance burdens of the proposed liquidity
regulations and how they would affect small entities.
VII.

CONSIDERATION OF IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996

(“SBREFA”), the Commission must advise OMB whether a proposed regulation constitutes a

931

See supra section III.H.

932

See supra section IV.C.2.b.

394

“major” rule. Under SBREFA, a rule is considered “major” where, if adopted, it results in or is
likely to result in:
o An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;
o A major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or
o Significant adverse effects on competition, investment, or innovation.
We request comment on whether our proposal would be a “major rule” for purposes of
SBREFA. We solicit comment and empirical data on:
o The potential effect on the U.S. economy on an annual basis;
o Any potential increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; and
o Any potential effect on competition, investment, or innovation.
Commenters are requested to provide empirical data and other factual support for their views to
the extent possible.

(3) Notwithstanding this paragraph (a), a registered open-end management investment
company (but not a registered open-end management investment company that is regulated as a
money market fund under § 270.2a-7 or an exchange-traded fund as defined in paragraph
(a)(3)(v)(A) of this section) (a “fund”) may use swing pricing to adjust its current net asset value
per share to mitigate dilution of the value of its outstanding redeemable securities as a result of
shareholder purchase and redemption activity, provided that it has established and implemented
swing pricing policies and procedures in compliance with the paragraphs (a)(3)(i)-(v) of this
section.
(i) The fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures shall:
(A) Provide that the fund must adjust its net asset value per share by a swing factor,
determined pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(i)(D) of this section, once the level of net purchases into
or net redemptions from such fund has exceeded the fund’s swing threshold, determined pursuant
to paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section. In determining whether the fund’s level of net
purchases or net redemptions has exceeded the fund’s swing threshold, the person(s) responsible
for administering the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures pursuant to paragraph
(a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section: shall be permitted to make such determination on the basis of
information obtained after reasonable inquiry; and shall exclude any purchases or redemptions
that are made in kind and not in cash.
(B) Specify the fund’s swing threshold to be used pursuant to paragraph (3)(i)(A) of this
section, considering:

398

(1) The size, frequency, and volatility of historical net purchases or net redemptions of
fund shares during normal and stressed periods;
(2) The fund’s investment strategy and the liquidity of the fund’s portfolio assets;
(3) The fund’s holdings of cash and cash equivalents, as well as borrowing arrangements
and other funding sources; and
(4) The costs associated with transactions in the markets in which the fund invests.
(C) Provide for the periodic review, no less frequently than annually, of the fund’s swing
threshold, considering the factors set forth in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section.
(D) Specify how the swing factor to be used pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this
section shall be determined, and whether the swing factor would be subject to any upper limit.
The determination of the swing factor, as well as any upper limit on the swing factor, must take
into account:
(1) Any near-term costs expected to be incurred by the fund as a result of net purchases
or net redemptions that occur on the day the swing factor is used to adjust the fund’s net asset
value per share, including any market impact costs, spread costs, and transaction fees and
charges arising from asset purchases or asset sales to satisfy those purchases or redemptions, as
well as any borrowing-related costs associated with satisfying redemptions; and
(2) The value of assets purchased or sold by the fund as a result of net purchases or net
redemptions that occur on the day the swing factor is used to adjust the fund’s net asset value per
share, if that information would not be reflected in the current net asset value of the fund
computed that day.
(ii) The fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures shall be subject to the following
approval and oversight requirements:

399

(A) The fund’s board of directors, including a majority of directors who are not interested
persons of the fund, shall approve the swing pricing policies and procedures (including the
fund’s swing threshold, and any swing factor upper limit specified under the fund’s swing
pricing policies and procedures), as well as any material change to the policies and procedures
(including any change to the fund’s swing threshold, a change to any swing factor upper limit
specified under the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures, or any decision to suspend or
terminate the fund’s swing pricing policies and procedures).
(B) The fund’s board of directors shall designate the fund’s investment adviser or officers
responsible for administering the swing pricing policies and procedures, and for determining the
swing factor that will be used each time the swing threshold is breached; provided that
determination of the swing factor must be reasonably segregated from the portfolio management
function of the fund.
(iii) The fund shall maintain a written copy of the policies and procedures adopted by the
fund under this paragraph (a)(3) that are in effect, or at any time within the past six years were in
effect, in an easily accessible place.
(iv) Any fund (a “feeder fund”) that invests, pursuant to section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act
(15 U.S.C. 80a-12(d)(1)(E)), in another fund (a “master fund”) may not use swing pricing to
adjust the feeder fund’s net asset value per share; however, a master fund may use swing pricing
to adjust the master fund’s net asset value per share, pursuant to the requirements set forth in this
paragraph (a)(3).
(v) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(3):
(A) Exchange-traded fund means an open-end management investment company or a
class thereof, the shares of which are traded on a national securities exchange, and that operates

400

pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the Commission or in reliance on an exemptive rule
adopted by the Commission.
(B) Swing factor means the amount, expressed as a percentage of the fund’s net asset
value and determined pursuant to the fund’s swing pricing procedures, by which a fund adjusts
its net asset value per share when the level of net purchases into or net redemptions from the
fund has exceeded the fund’s swing threshold.
(C) Swing pricing means the process of adjusting a fund’s current net asset value per
share to mitigate dilution of the value of its outstanding redeemable securities as a result of
shareholder purchase and redemption activity, pursuant to the requirements set forth in this

Section 270.22e-4 is added to read as follows:

§270.22e-4 Liquidity risk management programs.
(a) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
(1) Acquisition (or acquire) means any purchase or subsequent rollover.
(2) Business day means any day, other than Saturday, Sunday, or any customary business
holiday.
(3) Convertible to cash means the ability to be sold, with the sale settled.

401

(4) 15% standard asset means an asset that may not be sold or disposed of in the ordinary
course of business within seven calendar days at approximately the value ascribed to it by the
fund. For purposes of this definition, the fund does not need to consider the size of the fund’s
position in the asset or the number of days associated with receipt of proceeds of sale or
disposition of the asset.
(5) Fund means an open-end management investment company that is registered or
required to register under section 8 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-8) and includes a separate series of
such an investment company, but does not include a registered open-end management
investment company that is regulated as a money market fund under § 270.2a-7.
(6) Less liquid asset means any position of a fund in an asset (or portion of the fund’s
position in an asset) that is not a three-day liquid asset. In determining whether a position or
portion of a position in an asset is a less liquid asset, a fund must take into account the factors set
forth in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, to the extent applicable.
(7) Liquidity risk means the risk that the fund could not meet requests to redeem shares
issued by the fund that are expected under normal conditions, or are reasonably foreseeable
under stressed conditions, without materially affecting the fund’s net asset value.
(8) Three-day liquid asset means any cash held by a fund and any position of a fund in an
asset (or portion of the fund’s position in an asset) that the fund believes is convertible into cash
within three business days at a price that does not materially affect the value of that asset
immediately prior to sale. In determining whether a position or portion of a position in an asset
is a three-day liquid asset, a fund must take into account the factors set forth in paragraph
(b)(2)(ii) of this section, to the extent applicable.

402

(9) Three-day liquid asset minimum means the percentage of the fund’s net assets to be
invested in three-day liquid assets pursuant to section (b)(2)(iv)(A) and (C) of this section.
(b) Adoption and implementation of liquidity risk management program.
(1) Program requirement. Each fund shall adopt and implement a written liquidity risk
management program (“program”) that is reasonably designed to assess and manage the fund’s
liquidity risk. The program shall include policies and procedures incorporating the elements of
paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section. The program shall be administered by the
fund’s investment adviser, or an officer or officers of the fund, but may not be administered
solely by portfolio managers of the fund.
(2) Required program elements. Each fund must:
(i) Classify and engage in an ongoing review of each of the fund’s positions in a portfolio
asset (or portions of a position in a particular asset) based on the following categories of number
of days in which it is determined, using information obtained after reasonable inquiry, that the
fund’s position in the asset (or portion thereof) would be convertible to cash at a price that does
not materially affect the value of that asset immediately prior to sale:
(A) Convertible to cash within 1 business day;
(B) Convertible to cash within 2-3 business days;
(C) Convertible to cash within 4-7 calendar days;
(D) Convertible to cash within 8-15 calendar days;
(E) Convertible to cash within 16-30 calendar days; and
(F) Convertible to cash in more than 30 calendar days.
Note to paragraph (b)(2)(i): In situations in which the period to convert a position to
cash could be viewed either as two-to-three business days or four-to-seven calendar days, a fund

403

should classify the position based on the shorter period (i.e., two-to-three business days, not
four-to-seven calendar days).
(ii) For purposes of classifying and reviewing the liquidity of a fund’s position in a
portfolio asset (or portion thereof) under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, take into account the
following factors, to the extent applicable, with respect to the asset (or similar asset(s), to the
extent that data concerning the portfolio asset is not available to the fund):
(A) Existence of an active market for the asset, including whether the asset is listed on an
exchange, as well as the number, diversity, and quality of market participants;
(B) Frequency of trades or quotes for the asset and average daily trading volume of the
asset (regardless of whether the asset is a security traded on an exchange);
(C) Volatility of trading prices for the asset;
(D) Bid-ask spreads for the asset;
(E) Whether the asset has a relatively standardized and simple structure;
(F) For fixed income securities, maturity and date of issue;
(G) Restrictions on trading of the asset and limitations on transfer of the asset;
(H) The size of the fund’s position in the asset relative to the asset’s average daily trading
volume and, as applicable, the number of units of the asset outstanding. Analysis of position size
should consider the extent to which the timing of disposing of the position could create any
market value impact; and
(I) Relationship of the asset to another portfolio asset.
(iii) Assess and periodically review the fund’s liquidity risk, considering the fund’s:
(A) Short-term and long-term cash flow projections, taking into account the following
considerations:

404

(1) Size, frequency, and volatility of historical purchases and redemptions of fund shares
during normal and stressed periods;
(2) Fund’s redemption policies;
(3) Fund’s shareholder ownership concentration;
(4) Fund’s distribution channels; and
(5) Degree of certainty associated with the fund’s short-term and long-term cash flow
projections.
(B) Investment strategy and liquidity of portfolio assets;
(C) Use of borrowings and derivatives for investment purposes; and
(D) Holdings of cash and cash equivalents, as well as borrowing arrangements and other
funding sources.
(iv) Manage the fund’s liquidity risk, including that the fund will:
(A) Determine the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum, considering the factors
specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section;
(B) Periodically review, no less frequently than semi-annually, the adequacy of the fund’s
three-day liquid asset minimum, considering the factors incorporated in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii)(A)
through (D) of this section;
(C) Not acquire any less liquid asset if, immediately after the acquisition, the fund would
have invested less than its three-day liquid asset minimum in three-day liquid assets;
(D) Not acquire any 15% standard asset if, immediately after the acquisition, the fund
would have invested more than 15% of its total assets in 15% standard assets; and
(E) Establish policies and procedures regarding redemptions in kind, to the extent that the
fund engages in or reserves the right to engage in redemptions in kind.

405

(3) Board approval and oversight of the program.
(i) The fund shall obtain initial approval of the liquidity risk management program
(including the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum), as well as any material change to the
program (including a change to the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum), from the fund’s
board of directors, including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the fund.
(ii) The fund’s board of directors, including a majority of directors who are not interested
persons of the fund, shall review, no less frequently than annually, a written report prepared by
the fund’s investment adviser or officers administering the liquidity risk management program
that describes the adequacy of the fund’s liquidity risk management program, including the
fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum, and the effectiveness of its implementation.
(iii) The fund shall designate the fund’s investment adviser or officers (which may not be
solely portfolio managers of the fund) responsible for administering the policies and procedures
incorporating the elements of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section, whose designation
must be approved by the fund’s board of directors, including a majority of the directors who are
not interested persons of the fund.
(c) Recordkeeping. The fund must maintain:
(1) A written copy of the policies and procedures adopted by the fund under paragraphs
(b)(1) of this section that are in effect, or at any time within the past five years were in effect, in
an easily accessible place;
(2) Copies of any materials provided to the board of directors in connection with its
approval under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, and written reports provided to the board of
directors under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, for at least five years after the end of the
fiscal year in which the documents were provided, the first two years in an easily accessible

406

place; and
(3) A written record of how the three-day liquid asset minimum, and any adjustments
thereto, were determined, including assessment of the factors incorporated in paragraphs
(b)(2)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section, for a period of not less than five years (the first two
years in an easily accessible place) following the determination of and each change to the
three-day liquid asset minimum.
