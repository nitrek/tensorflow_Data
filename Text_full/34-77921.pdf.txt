In the Matter of the Application of
Michael Earl McCune
For Review of Disciplinary Action Taken by
FINRA

ORDER GRANTING STAY
On March 15, 2016, the Commission issued an order and opinion sustaining disciplinary
action taken by FINRA against Michael E. McCune.1 The Commission found that McCune
willfully failed to timely amend his Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or
Transfer (“Form U4”) to disclose a bankruptcy, three federal tax liens, and one state tax lien in
violation of NASD Rule 2110, Interpretive Material-1000-1, and FINRA Rules 1122 and 2010.
The Commission sustained the sanction FINRA imposed; a six-month suspension in all
capacities and a $5,000 fine.
McCune has filed a petition for review of the Commission's order and opinion in the
United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. He seeks a stay, pending appeal, of the
sanctions assessed against him. FINRA did not file a brief in opposition.

The Commission considers the following factors in determining whether to grant a stay
of FINRA action under Rule of Practice 4012: (i) whether there is a strong likelihood that the
moving party will succeed on the merits of its appeal; (ii) whether the moving party will suffer
irreparable harm without a stay; (iii) whether any person will suffer substantial harm as a result
of a stay; and (iv) whether a stay is likely to serve the public interest.3 Each criterion is not
accorded equal weight.4 For example, a stay may be granted where there is a high probability of
irreparable harm, but a lower probability of success on the merits, or vice versa.5 The party
seeking a stay has the burden of establishing that relief is warranted. 6
Consistent with that standard, the Commission has granted stays where the sanction
imposed is of a short-term nature and requiring applicants to comply with the sanctions during
the pendency of the appeal would put them in jeopardy of losing the benefit of a successful
appeal.7 In keeping with our granting of stays in similar circumstances, we grant the stay.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the Commission's March 15, 2016 order suspending
McCune for six-months in all capacities and requiring him to pay a $5,000 fine is stayed pending
determination of McCune's appeal by the Court of Appeals.
For the Commission, by the Office of the General Counsel, pursuant to delegated
authority.
