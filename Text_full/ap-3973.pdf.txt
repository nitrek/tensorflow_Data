The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
in this matter on May 10, 2016. A prehearing conference is currently scheduled for July 12,
2016.
Today the Division of Enforcement submitted a declaration of service representing that
Respondent was personally served with the OIP on June 27, 2016. Respondent’s answer is
therefore due by July 18, 2016. See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). The declaration also
represents that Respondent has submitted an offer of settlement which the Division will submit
to the Office of the Secretary “in short order.”
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the telephonic prehearing conference currently
scheduled for July 12, 2016, is POSTPONED, and a telephonic prehearing conference shall be
held on August 15, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern, if the proceeding has not been resolved by then.
