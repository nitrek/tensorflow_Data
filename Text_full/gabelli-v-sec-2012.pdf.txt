Argument . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 

I. 	 The five-year limitations period in 28 U.S.C. 2462 did

not begin to run until the Commission discovered, or

with reasonable diligence could have discovered, petitioners’ fraudulent scheme . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 

A.	 In fraud cases, the discovery rule commences

the running of Section 2462’s limitations period upon actual or constructive discovery of

the fraud . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 

B.	 This case does not present the question of

when Section 2462 begins to run in nonfraud

cases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21 

II. 	 Petitioners’ counterarguments lack merit . . . . . . . . . . . 24 

A.	 The application of a discovery rule in cases of

fraud or concealment dates to the beginning of

the Republic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24 

1.	 Federal courts have consistently applied

the fraud discovery rule both before and

after Section 2462’s enactment . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24 

2.	 The historical exception covers cases of

fraud as well as cases of concealment . . . . . . . . 29 

B.	 In fraud cases, the discovery rule is read into

federal statutes of limitations unless Congress

specifies otherwise . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33 

C.	 When Congress has explicitly addressed discovery in other federal limitations statutes, it

has generally done so in order to expand or

contract the traditional rule . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38

D.	 The fraud discovery rule applies equally to the
government as to private plaintiffs . . . . . . . . . . . . .
E.	 The fraud discovery rule balances the need for
repose against the need to prevent abuse of
limitations statutes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
F.	 The fraud discovery rule has proved to be judicially administrable for more than two centuries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

STATEMENT

1. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers
Act or Act), 15 U.S.C. 80b-1 et seq., “was the last in a
series of Acts designed to eliminate certain abuses in the
securities industry.” SEC v. Capital Gains Research
Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 186 (1963); see id. at 186-187
(noting that the Act is part of a comprehensive statutory
scheme enacted by Congress to assure that “the highest
ethical standards prevail in every facet of the securities
industry”) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Act
reflects Congress’s judgment that an investment adviser
has “an affirmative duty of utmost good faith, and full
and fair disclosure of all material facts, as well as an
affirmative obligation to employ reasonable care to avoid
misleading his clients.” Id. at 194 (internal quotation
marks omitted). The Act is therefore designed “to eliminate, or at least to expose, all conflicts of interest which
might incline an investment adviser—consciously or
unconsciously—to render advice which was not disinterested.” Id. at 191-192.
To that end, the Act makes it unlawful for any adviser to “employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any client or prospective client.” 15 U.S.C.
80b-6(1). The Act also prohibits an adviser from “engag[ing] in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client
or prospective client.” 15 U.S.C. 80b-6(2). The “fundamental purpose” of those provisions is to ensure that
investment advisers give “full disclosure” to their clients
regarding the management of their investments. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. at 186. The
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) may bring civil enforcement actions against investment advisers, or persons associated with them, who

3

violate any of the provisions of the Act or who aid and
abet such violations. 15 U.S.C. 80b-9(d).
Before 1990, the Commission’s primary remedies in
such enforcement actions were injunctive relief and disgorgement of violators’ ill-gotten gains. In 1990, Congress authorized the SEC to seek civil monetary penalties against violators of the federal securities laws, including the Advisers Act. See Securities Enforcement
Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 (Remedies Act), Pub. L. No. 101-429, 104 Stat. 931 (15 U.S.C.
78a note); see also S. Rep. No. 337, 101st Cong., 2d Sess.
10 (1990) (explaining that civil penalties were necessary
“to increase deterrence and help maintain public confidence in the integrity of the markets”); ibid. (“Since
disgorgement merely requires the return of wrongfully
obtained profits, it does not impose any meaningful economic cost on the law violator.”).
Neither the Advisers Act nor the Remedies Act specifies a statute of limitations for an enforcement action in
which the Commission seeks monetary penalties from an
investment adviser or associated person. The timeliness
of such actions is therefore governed by 28 U.S.C. 2462,
which states:
Except as otherwise provided by Act of Congress, an
action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any
civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise, shall not be entertained unless commenced
within five years from the date when the claim first
accrued if, within the same period, the offender or
the property is found within the United States in order that proper service may be made thereon.

2. a. This case concerns a type of “market timing” of
mutual funds known as “time-zone arbitrage.” 1 As a
general rule, mutual funds are priced once a day, usually
at 4 p.m. Eastern Time when the New York Stock Exchange closes. That price, called the fund’s net asset
value (NAV), reflects the closing prices of the securities
held by the fund. If one of those securities is traded on
an overseas market, however, the closing price incorporated into the fund’s NAV can be based on stale information. For instance, if a United States mutual fund
holds stock in a Japanese company that is traded on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE)—which closes at 2 a.m.
Eastern Time—the fund’s NAV for each day incorporates the stock’s Japanese closing price from 14 hours
earlier. Positive market movements during the New
York trading day, which will later cause the TSE price
to rise when the TSE opens at 8 p.m. Eastern Time, will
not be reflected in the fund’s late-afternoon NAV. See
J.A. 78-79.
“Market timers” attempt to exploit that type of pricing inefficiency by buying or selling a mutual fund’s
shares based on events that they do not expect to be
reflected in the fund’s NAV. Market timers then reverse their positions for a profit the next day. See Janus Capital Group, Inc. v. First Derivative Traders,
131 S. Ct. 2296, 2300 n.1 (2011) (“[A] market-timing investor could buy shares of a mutual fund at the artificially low NAV and sell the next day when the NAV corrects itself upward.”). That practice harms long-term
1

This case arises on petitioners’ motion to dismiss the Commission’s
complaint. See Pet. App. 51a. The factual statements in this brief are
drawn from that complaint (which appears at J.A. 72-95) and are taken
as true at this stage of the proceedings. See, e.g., Schindler Elevator
Corp. v. United States ex rel. Kirk, 131 S. Ct. 1885, 1889 n.2 (2011).

mutual fund shareholders by capturing an arbitrage
profit that comes dollar-for-dollar out of other shareholders’ pockets. See id. at 2300 (observing that market timing “harms other investors in the mutual fund”).
b. Gabelli Funds, LLC (Gabelli Funds) is an investment adviser, within the meaning of the Act, to a mutual
fund called Gabelli Global Growth Fund (GGGF). See
Pet. 6; J.A. 77. During the relevant period, petitioner
Bruce Alpert was the Chief Operating Officer of Gabelli
Funds and was responsible for, inter alia, monitoring
trading in GGGF to eliminate market timing. See J.A.
76-77, 84, 86, 88-89. Petitioner Marc Gabelli was the
portfolio manager for GGGF and also managed other
affiliated funds. See J.A. 76.
In April 2008, the Commission brought a civil enforcement action against petitioners. The Commission alleged that petitioners had secretly permitted one
of GGGF’s investors—Headstart Advisers, Ltd. (Headstart)—to market time the mutual fund, in return for
Headstart’s investment in another fund managed by
Gabelli. See J.A. 72-75, 80-85. According to the SEC, at
the same time that petitioners had allowed Headstart to
market time the fund, they had prohibited other investors from doing the same. See J.A. 74, 83-85. The Commission alleged that, as a result of its privileged position, Headstart had earned returns of between 73 and
185% on its investments (for total profits of approximately $9.7 million), while long-term investors had lost
an average of 24% on their investments. See J.A. 73, 87.
The Commission further alleged that petitioners had
failed to disclose Headstart’s market timing (or their
quid pro quo agreement with the market timer) to
GGGF’s board of directors and other investors, but instead had falsely represented that they were taking nec-

6

essary steps to eliminate market timing. See J.A. 74-75,
86, 88-89. The SEC alleged that, by failing to disclose
the market timing arrangement and by falsely representing that Gabelli Funds was attempting to eliminate
market timing in GGGF, petitioners had aided and abetted Gabelli Funds in violating the antifraud provisions
of the Advisers Act, 15 U.S.C. 80b-6(1) and (2). See J.A.
92-93. As remedies for petitioners’ violations, the Commission sought injunctive relief, disgorgement of their
gains, and civil monetary penalties. See J.A. 93-94.2
3. The district court granted in part and denied in
part petitioners’ motion to dismiss the complaint. Pet.
App. 26a-51a. As relevant here, the court held that most
of the Commission’s claims for civil penalties were
barred by the five-year limitations period in 28 U.S.C.
2462. Pet. App. 34a-39a. The court reasoned that the
SEC’s claims against petitioners had “first accrued” for
purposes of Section 2462 when petitioners committed
their various fraudulent acts, not when the Commission
discovered or reasonably could have discovered petitioners’ fraud. Id. at 34a, 36a. Because most of petitioners’
fraudulent acts had occurred more than five years before the Commission filed its complaint in April 2008,
the court concluded that the SEC was foreclosed from

2

On the same day the Commission filed its complaint in this case,
Gabelli Funds entered into a settlement in which it agreed to cease and
desist from violating the relevant provisions of the Advisers Act.
Gabelli Funds also agreed to pay disgorgement of $9.7 million,
prejudgment interest of $1.3 million, and a civil penalty of $5 million.
As part of the settlement, Gabelli Funds neither admitted nor denied
the Commission’s allegations in this case. See In the Matter of Gabelli
Funds LLC, No. 3-13019, Order (Apr. 24, 2008), http://www.sec.gov/
litigation/admin/2008/ia-2727.pdf.

seeking civil penalties for the bulk of its claims. Id. at
37a-38a.3
4. The court of appeals reversed. Pet. App. 1a-23a.
As relevant here, the court noted that the SEC had
brought its claims under “the antifraud provisions” of
the Advisers Act and had alleged that petitioners “aided
and abetted Gabelli Funds’ fraudulent scheme.” Id. at
19a. The court held that, because the Commission’s
claims are based on fraud, they are subject to a “discovery rule” that prevents the applicable limitations period
from beginning to run until the fraud claim “is discovered, or could have been discovered with reasonable
diligence, by the plaintiff.” Id. at 18a; see Merck & Co.,
Inc. v. Reynolds, 130 S. Ct. 1784, 1793 (2010).
The court of appeals rejected petitioners’ argument
that the discovery rule was inapplicable because the
Commission had failed to plead any affirmative acts by
petitioners to conceal their fraud. Pet. App. 18a-20a.
3

After the district court dismissed the bulk of the Commission’s
claims, the SEC conditionally dismissed its remaining claim for disgorgement. The SEC agreed to reassert that disgorgement claim only
if the district court’s ruling on the motion to dismiss was reversed on
appeal and the Commission was permitted to proceed with its other
claims. See J.A. 105-106. Some courts of appeals have held that this
type of conditional dismissal does not produce a final, appealable
judgment. Compare Clos v. Corrections Corp. of Am., 597 F.3d 925, 928
(8th Cir. 2010); Federal Home Loan Mortg. Corp. v. Scottsdale Ins. Co.,
316 F.3d 431, 440 (3d Cir. 2003), with Doe v. United States, 513 F.3d
1348, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2008); Purdy v. Zeldes, 337 F.3d 253, 258 (2d Cir.
2003). Here, however, the Commission has been willing to abandon its
disgorgement claim altogether in order to ensure that the judgment is
appealable as to the other claims. See 1:08-CV-3868, Docket entry No.
36, at 2-3 (S.D.N.Y. June 15, 2010). In that circumstance, courts have
agreed that a judgment is appealable. See, e.g., India Breweries, Inc.
v. Miller Brewing Co., 612 F.3d 651, 657-658 (7th Cir. 2010); Federal
Home Loan Mortg. Corp., 316 F.3d at 440.

8

That argument, the court stated, conflates the discovery
rule with the doctrine of fraudulent concealment, which
prevents a limitations period from running when a defendant has taken steps to conceal his allegedly wrongful conduct. Id. at 18a-19a. Petitioners also contended
that, “even if the discovery rule applies” to this case, the
civil-penalty claims were time-barred because the SEC
could have discovered the relevant facts earlier if it had
exercised reasonable diligence. Id. at 21a. The court
rejected that argument as “premature” at the motion-todismiss stage of the case, explaining that expiration of
the limitations period is an affirmative defense and that
the burden is therefore on petitioners to plead and prove
the Commission’s lack of reasonable diligence. Ibid.
The court of appeals concluded that, because “the complaint expressly alleges that the [Commission] first discovered the facts of [petitioners’] fraudulent scheme in
late 2003,” less than five years before the complaint was
filed in April 2008, the Commission’s “civil penalties
claims [are] not clearly time-barred.” Ibid.
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

I. A. Section 2462 of Title 28 provides that an action
for the enforcement of any civil penalty “shall not be
entertained unless commenced within five years from
the date when the claim first accrued.” This Court has
repeatedly held that, unless Congress specifies a different rule, the limitations period in a suit for fraud does
not begin to run until the plaintiff discovers, or in the
exercise of reasonable diligence could have discovered,
the facts underlying his claim. Whether that doctrine is
labeled as one of claim accrual or equitable tolling, the
Court has never questioned that the discovery rule delays the running of an applicable limitations period in

9

cases of fraud. Here, the Commission contends that
petitioners engaged in a fraudulent scheme that violated
the antifraud provisions of the Advisers Act. The court
of appeals therefore correctly held that the Commission
was required to bring its suit within five years after it
discovered, or with reasonable diligence could have discovered, petitioners’ fraudulent scheme.
B. Petitioners invoke the general rule that a claim
accrues when a plaintiff has the right to bring suit. But
the government has not contended, and the court below
did not hold, that all claims for civil penalties under Section 2462 are subject to a discovery rule. Rather, the
government has argued, and the court of appeals
agreed, that a discovery rule applies when the government seeks civil penalties for claims based on fraud.
Like the court below, the First and Seventh Circuits
have held that, in fraud cases brought by the Commission seeking civil penalties, Section 2462’s five-year limitations period does not begin to run until the Commission knew or should have known the relevant facts. See
SEC v. Koenig, 557 F.3d 736, 739-740 (7th Cir. 2009)
(Easterbrook, C.J.); SEC v. Tambone, 550 F.3d 106,
148-149 (1st Cir. 2008).
II. Petitioners’ various counterarguments do not
withstand scrutiny.
A. The application of a discovery rule in cases of
fraud or concealment dates to the earliest days of the
Republic. See, e.g., Willison v. Watkins, 28 U.S. (3 Pet.)
43, 52 (1830) (acknowledging the “well settled and unquestioned rule[] in all courts of law and equity” that the
statute of limitations “does not run until the discovery of
the fraud”) (internal quotation marks omitted). For
nearly 175 years, Congress has relied on that settled

10

understanding in enacting, amending, and codifying Section 2462.
B. The discovery rule has long been understood as a
background principle that presumptively governs the
application of federal limitations statutes unless Congress specifies otherwise. The doctrine’s applicability
therefore does not depend on express language incorporating it into a federal limitations statute. The crucial
question with respect to the discovery rule, as with respect to other equitable doctrines like forfeiture or
waiver, is whether Congress has clearly displaced the
usual rule that limitations periods in fraud cases are
triggered by actual or constructive discovery. It has
not: nothing in the text of Section 2462 clearly displaces
the fraud discovery rule.
C. When Congress has explicitly addressed discovery in other federal limitations statutes, it has generally
done so not to codify the traditional fraud discovery
rule, but to alter the rule’s usual operation. On rare
occasions, Congress has expressly codified the traditional fraud discovery rule, perhaps “to remove any
doubt” that the rule applies in those contexts. Ali v.
Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 226 (2008).
Regardless, Congress’s occasional express endorsement
of the fraud discovery rule does not render the rule inapplicable to statutes where it is neither explicitly incorporated nor explicitly displaced.
D. This Court has long held that the fraud discovery
rule applies equally when the government is the plaintiff. See Exploration Co. v. United States, 247 U.S. 435,
449 (1918). That is because equity’s primary justification for the fraud discovery rule does not center on the
injury suffered by the plaintiff from the delay, but on
the defendant’s misconduct in causing that delay. That

11

equitable justification distinguishes cases of fraud or
concealment from other cases in which a plaintiff is reasonably unaware of her cause of action, and it is as applicable to government enforcement actions as to private
suits.
E. The traditional fraud discovery rule balances the
basic policies of all limitations provisions (like repose)
against competing values, particularly the venerable
equitable principle that a person should not profit from
her own wrong. Its core justification is that defendants
are not entitled to repose when their own deceptive conduct has effectively foreclosed potential plaintiffs from
seeking such redress. Petitioners rely on a presumption
against perpetual penalties that does not apply in the
context of a civil remedy, but in any event Section 2462’s
five-year time limit actually prevents the imposition of
perpetual penalties. To the extent petitioners remain
subject to liability, that results not from the statute but
from their own misconduct.
F. Finally, petitioners’ policy arguments are unpersuasive. For centuries, courts have applied the traditional fraud discovery rule, and they have not found it
difficult to determine when a cause of action is based on
fraud or when a plaintiff (including a government
agency) actually or constructively discovered that fraud.
Although the Commission has tools at its disposal to
investigate fraud, that does not place the SEC on notice
of the need to exercise those powers in a particular case
when a defendant’s fraud remains concealed. Petitioners’ approach unrealistically envisions that the Commission (and other federal agencies) could constantly monitor every regulated entity and transaction for any hint
of hidden fraud, which in any event would only increase
the regulatory burden on nonculpable entities. Nor is it

12

realistic to think that the court of appeals’ approach will
seriously weaken the Commission’s incentives to diligently investigate and pursue fraud claims, as it did in
this case.
ARGUMENT
I.	 THE FIVE-YEAR LIMITATIONS PERIOD IN 28 U.S.C.
2462 DID NOT BEGIN TO RUN UNTIL THE COMMISSION
DISCOVERED, OR WITH REASONABLE DILIGENCE
COULD HAVE DISCOVERED, PETITIONERS’ FRAUDULENT SCHEME

In arguing that the SEC’s suit was untimely, petitioners invoke the general rule that a claim accrues
when a plaintiff has the right to bring suit. That argument lacks merit because it ignores the distinct rule that
has long governed the commencement of limitations periods in fraud cases. This Court has repeatedly held
that, unless Congress specifies a different rule, the limitations period in a suit for fraud does not begin to run
until the plaintiff actually or constructively discovers the
facts underlying his claim. The SEC’s complaint in this
case therefore was timely unless petitioners can establish on remand that the Commission discovered the facts
underlying its claim, or could have discovered those
facts by exercising reasonable diligence, more than five
years before the suit was filed.
A.	 In Fraud Cases, The Discovery Rule Commences The
Running Of Section 2462’s Limitations Period Upon Actual Or Constructive Discovery Of The Fraud

1. Section 2462 of Title 28 provides that an action for
the enforcement of any civil penalty “shall not be entertained unless commenced within five years from the date
when the claim first accrued.” Petitioners contend (Br.

13

15-16) that the Commission’s civil-penalty claims against
them “first accrued” when petitioners’ allegedly unlawful acts occurred, regardless of when the Commission
discovered (or reasonably could have discovered) petitioners’ fraudulent scheme. That argument lacks merit.
This Court has consistently recognized that, unless Congress specifies a different rule, the limitations period in
a suit for fraud does not begin to run until the plaintiff
discovers, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence
could have discovered, the facts underlying his claim.
That rule derives from the equitable maxim that a
party should not be permitted to benefit from its own
misconduct. See, e.g., Glus v. Brooklyn E. Dist. Terminal, 359 U.S. 231, 232-233 (1959) (“[W]e need look no
further than the maxim that no man may take advantage
of his own wrong. Deeply rooted in our jurisprudence
this principle has been applied in many diverse classes
of cases by both law and equity courts and has frequently been employed to bar inequitable reliance on
statutes of limitations.”) (footnote omitted). This Court
has long held as a matter of equity that a defendant cannot use his own misconduct as a defense, including by
unfairly relying on a statute of limitations. See, e.g.,
Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392, 396-397 (1946)
(“Equity * * * bars a defendant from setting up such a
fraudulent defense, as it interposes against other forms
of fraud.”); Exploration Co. v. United States, 247 U.S.
435, 445-446 (1918); Bailey v. Glover, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.)
342, 348-349 (1875); cf. Sherwood v. Sutton, 21 F. Cas.
1303, 1307 (C.C.N.H. 1828) (Story, J.) (No. 12,782).
Most recently, in Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 130 S. Ct.
1784 (2010), the Court explained that “in the statute of
limitations context, the word ‘discovery’ is often used as
a term of art in connection with the ‘discovery rule,’ a

14

doctrine that delays accrual of a cause of action until the
plaintiff has ‘discovered’ it.” Id. at 1793. That doctrine
“arose in fraud cases as an exception to the general limitations rule that a cause of action accrues once a plaintiff
has a ‘complete and present cause of action.’ ” Ibid.
(quoting Bay Area Laundry & Dry Cleaning Pension
Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., Inc., 522 U.S. 192,
201 (1997)). The exception reflects the Court’s longstanding “recogni[tion] that something different was
needed in the case of fraud, where a defendant’s deceptive conduct may prevent a plaintiff from even knowing
that he or she has been defrauded.” Ibid. Absent an
exception for fraud cases, “ ‘the law which was designed
to prevent fraud’ could become ‘the means by which it is
made successful and secure.’ ” Id. at 1793-1794 (quoting
Bailey, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) at 349); see Sherwood,
21 F. Cas. at 1307.
2. When a particular statute (like Section 2462)
makes the “accru[al]” of a claim the event that triggers
the limitations period, the Merck Court’s description of
the discovery rule indicates that a fraud claim does not
“accrue” until the plaintiff has (actually or constructively) discovered the relevant facts. Indeed, the decision below represents a straightforward application of
the equitable principles discussed in Merck. When a
plaintiff’s claim is for fraud, and the applicable statute
of limitations runs from the accrual of the plaintiff ’s
cause of action, the discovery rule “regard[s] the cause
of action as having accrued at the time the fraud was or
should have been discovered.” 130 S. Ct. at 1794 (quoting Kirby v. Lake Shore & Mich. S. R.R., 120 U.S. 130,
138 (1887) (brackets in original)); see Kirby, 120 U.S. at
138 (noting that “[i]t is an inflexible rule” in federal

15

courts to delay the accrual of causes of action in fraud
cases). That reasoning resolves this case.
As petitioners correctly observe (Br. 29-30), Merck
involved a statute, 28 U.S.C. 1658(b), that contains an
express discovery rule. Section 1658(b) requires private
securities actions to be brought “not later than the earlier of—(1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation; or (2) 5 years after such violation.” But in construing what it means to “discover[]”
the relevant facts (i.e., whether that term encompasses
constructive as well as actual discovery), this Court relied heavily on the common-law background principles
that generally govern the application of limitations provisions to fraud claims. See 130 S. Ct. at 1793-1796.
Indeed, the Court discussed those background principles to explain that Congress had codified one of them
(i.e., constructive discovery) in Section 1658(b)(1). See
id. at 1794. The Court’s discussion is equally relevant
here. Although the question in this case is whether the
discovery rule delays a claim’s accrual in fraud cases,
rather than whether constructive discovery puts an end
to that delay, the Court’s historical analysis in Merck
directly answers both questions.
Petitioners suggest (Br. 29) that this case is different
because, unlike the statute at issue in Merck, the limitations period in Section 2462 runs from a claim’s
“accru[al].” But that only makes this case an easy one.
In Bailey, the bankruptcy statute of limitations at issue
required certain suits to be brought “within two years
from the time [when] the cause of action accrued.”
88 U.S. (21 Wall.) at 344 (quoting Bankruptcy Act of
Mar. 2, 1867, ch. 176, § 2, 14 Stat. 518) (emphasis omitted). Surveying decisions from both English and American courts, the Court observed that “the decided weight

16

of authority is in favor of the proposition that where the
party injured by the fraud remains in ignorance of it
without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part,
the bar of the statute does not begin to run until the
fraud is discovered.” Id. at 348; see id. at 348 n.*;
Rosenthal v. Walker, 111 U.S. 185, 189 (1884) (applying
the fraud discovery rule to a similar successor provision). The Court’s decisions thus make particularly
clear how the fraud discovery rule operates when the
relevant statute of limitations runs from the “accrual” of
a claim.
3. The fraud discovery rule also applies when the
relevant statute specifies some event other than the accrual of the claim as the point at which the limitations
period commences. In Exploration Co., for example, the
federal limitations period at issue required “[t]hat suits
by the United States to vacate and annul any patent
* * * shall only be brought within six years after the
date of issuance of such patents.” 247 U.S. at 445 (quoting Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 561, § 8, 26 Stat. 1099). The
six-year limitations period thus ran from the date on
which a patent was issued—not the date on which a
claim to annul the patent accrued. The Court nevertheless saw “no good reason” not to apply “the rule, now
almost universal, that statutes of limitations to set aside
fraudulent transactions shall not begin to run until the
discovery of the fraud.” Id. at 449.
In Holmberg, the Court considered an action under
the Federal Farm Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 812 (1946), to
recover for a bank’s liability against a shareholder who
had concealed his ownership of the bank’s stock. See
327 U.S. at 393. Because the Act did not provide a federal limitations period, the suit was governed by a tenyear state limitations period (the Court’s opinion does

17

not make clear what event that state law specified as the
trigger for the ten-year period). See id. at 393-394. The
plaintiffs’ action had been dismissed because it was
brought more than ten years after the shareholder became liable under the Act, even though plaintiffs had
filed suit only a year after learning the shareholder’s
concealed identity. See id. at 393. In holding that the
suit was timely, this Court recognized that it had “long
ago adopted as its own the old chancery rule that where
a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and ‘remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want of diligence or
care on his part, the bar of the statute does not begin to
run until the fraud is discovered, though there be no
special circumstances or efforts on the part of the party
committing the fraud to conceal it from the knowledge
of the other party.’ ” Id. at 397 (quoting Bailey, 88 U.S.
(21 Wall.) at 348).
The Court’s reasoning in cases like Bailey, Exploration Co., and Holmberg does not depend on whether a
limitations period commences upon a claim’s “accrual”
or upon some other event. To the contrary, the Court in
Holmberg explained that the fraud discovery rule is an
“equitable doctrine [that] is read into every federal statute of limitation.” 327 U.S. at 397; see ibid. (“If the Federal Farm Loan Act had an explicit statute of limitation
for bringing suit * * * , the time would not have begun
to run until after petitioners had discovered, or had
failed in reasonable diligence to discover, the alleged
deception * * * which is the basis of this suit.”); see
also Exploration Co., 247 U.S. at 449 (“When Congress
passed the [limitations period] in question the rule of
Bailey v. Glover was the established doctrine of this
court. [The statute] was presumably enacted with the
ruling of that case in mind.”). Thus, whatever the event

18

that normally commences the running of a limitations
period, in a fraud case that period does not begin to run
until the relevant information was discovered or could
have been discovered by a reasonably diligent plaintiff.
4. The Court has sometimes referred to the fraud
discovery rule as a doctrine of tolling rather than of accrual. See TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 27 (2001)
(TRW ) (explaining that “equity tolls the statute of limitations in cases of fraud or concealment”); Lampf, Pleva,
Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U.S. 350,
363 (1991) (Lampf ) (stating that the Court in Bailey and
Holmberg had applied an “equitable tolling doctrine”);
cf. Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89,
96 (1990) (identifying, as one circumstance where “equitable tolling” of limitations periods has been approved,
the situation “where the complainant has been induced
or tricked by his adversary’s misconduct into allowing
the filing deadline to pass”). But regardless of whether
the discovery rule is labeled as one of tolling or accrual,
the Court has never questioned that the doctrine delays
the running of a limitations period in cases of fraud.
In TRW, the Court observed that “Holmberg * * *
stands for the proposition that equity tolls the statute of
limitations in cases of fraud or concealment; it does not
establish a general presumption applicable across all
contexts.” 534 U.S. at 27. The Court declined to decide
whether to adopt a broader rule that would allow tolling
whenever a diligent potential plaintiff is unaware, for
reasons other than his adversary’s fraud or concealment,
of the facts underlying his cause of action. See id. at
27-28. Concurring in the judgment, Justice Scalia,
joined by Justice Thomas, would have addressed the
broader question and reaffirmed “the traditional rule”
that “[a]bsent other indication, a statute of limitations

19

begins to run at the time the plaintiff has the right to
apply to the court for relief.” Id. at 37 (internal quotation marks omitted). Justice Scalia expressly noted,
however, this Court’s “recognition of the historical exception for suits based on fraud, e.g., Bailey v. Glover.”
Ibid. Accordingly, whether or not the discovery rule
applies beyond cases of fraud or concealment, no Member of this Court has questioned its application to fraud
cases.
There are sound historical and equitable reasons for
this Court’s distinct treatment of cases involving fraud
or concealment. To be sure, a court’s refusal to apply a
discovery rule in other circumstances may effectively
prevent some reasonably diligent plaintiffs from obtaining redress for actionable wrongs. That result is particularly egregious, however, when the plaintiff’s ignorance
of his cause of action is attributable to the defendant’s
deception, because such cases implicate the equitable
principle that a person should not profit from his own
wrong. See, e.g., Way v. Cutting, 20 N.H. 187, 190
(1849) (“The general principle of natural justice and of
positive law that precludes a party from deriving a benefit from his own wrong, has from an early period been
applied by courts, both of law and of equity, to the construction of the statutes of limitation.”).
5. The timeliness of the Commission’s complaint in
this case does not depend on whether the fraud discovery rule is used to determine when the Commission’s
claims accrued or instead is treated as a ground for tolling the applicable limitations period. The Seventh Circuit made precisely that point in a similar fraud case
brought by the Commission for civil penalties. See SEC
v. Koenig, 557 F.3d 736 (2009) (Easterbrook, C.J.). The
court explained that it did not need to decide “when a

20

‘claim accrues’ for the purpose of [Section] 2462 generally, because the nineteenth century recognized a special
rule for fraud, a concealed wrong.” Id. at 739. That doctrine, the court noted, “is apt to be called equitable tolling.” Ibid. The court observed, however, that it is “unimportant in practice” “[w]hether a court says that a
claim for fraud accrues only on its discovery (more precisely, when it could have been discovered by a person
exercising reasonable diligence) or instead says that the
claim accrues with the wrong, but that the statute of
limitations is tolled until the fraud’s discovery.” Ibid.
“Either way,” the court explained, “a victim of fraud has
the full time from the date that the wrong came to light,
or would have done had diligence been employed.” Ibid.
Like the Seventh Circuit in Koenig, the court of appeals correctly applied the fraud discovery rule in this
case. The Commission alleges that petitioners’ conduct
aided and abetted violations of the antifraud provisions
of the Advisers Act, 15 U.S.C. 80b-6(1) and (2). Those
provisions make it unlawful for any adviser “to employ
any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any client or
prospective client,” 15 U.S.C. 80b-6(1), or “to engage in
any transaction, practice, or course of business which
operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client,” 15 U.S.C. 80b-6(2). The court of appeals
therefore held that, because “the Advisers Act claim is
made under the antifraud provisions of that Act and alleges that the defendants aided and abetted Gabelli
Funds’ fraudulent scheme, * * * the discovery rule
defines when the claim accrues.” Pet. App. 19a.
Consistent with the terminology this Court used in
Merck, see 130 S. Ct. at 1794, the court below thus
treated the fraud discovery rule as a means of identifying a fraud claim’s accrual date, rather than as a ground

21

for tolling Section 2462’s five-year limitations period. As
the Seventh Circuit recognized in Koenig, however, that
terminological choice is “unimportant in practice.”
557 F.3d at 739; cf. Sherwood, 21 F. Cas. at 1305 (noting
the existence of “some diversity of judgment” as to
whether the fraud discovery rule was “an implied exception out of the words of the statute, or whether the right
of action, in a legal sense, does not accrue until the discovery of the fraud”). Either way, the Commission was
required to bring its suit within five years after it discovered, or with reasonable diligence could have discovered, petitioners’ fraudulent scheme.
B.	 This Case Does Not Present The Question Of When Section 2462 Begins To Run In Nonfraud Cases

Petitioners argue that the Commission’s civil penalty
claims accrued at the time petitioners committed their
fraud because “a claim accrues when it arises and the
plaintiff has the right to sue.” Br. 15; see Br. 12-16. As
the Court recognized in Merck, that is the “general limitations rule”: “a cause of action accrues once a plaintiff
has a ‘complete and present cause of action.’ ” 130 S. Ct.
at 1793 (quoting Bay Area Laundry & Dry Cleaning
Pension Trust Fund, 522 U.S. at 201). But the government has not contended, and the court below did not
hold, that all claims for civil penalties under Section
2462 are subject to a discovery rule. Rather, the government has argued, and the court of appeals agreed,
that a discovery rule applies when the government seeks
civil penalties based on claims sounding in fraud. See
Pet. App. 19a-20a. And as the Merck Court explained,
the discovery rule “arose in fraud cases as an exception
to the general limitations rule.” 130 S. Ct. at 1793; see
TRW, 534 U.S. at 37 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judg-

22

ment) (noting “the historical exception for suits based on
fraud”).
All of the authorities on which petitioners rely (Br.
12-16 & nn.9-12) address the accrual of nonfraud claims,
i.e., claims presumptively subject to the general rule.
Those authorities therefore do not undermine the rationale on which the court below decided this case. At the
certiorari stage, petitioners contended (Pet. 13-19) that
the decision below was the subject of a circuit conflict
because four courts of appeals had held that a claim
“accrue[s]” for purposes of Section 2462 at the time of
the underlying violation. As the government explained
(Br. in Opp. 19-20), however, none of those decisions
even discussed, let alone rejected, application of the discovery rule to delay the accrual of a fraud claim for purposes of Section 2462. Petitioners no longer rely on (or
even cite) three of those decisions. See FEC v. Williams, 104 F.3d 237 (9th Cir. 1996), cert. denied,
522 U.S. 1015 (1997); United States v. Core Labs., Inc.,
759 F.2d 480 (5th Cir. 1985); United States v. Witherspoon, 211 F.2d 858 (6th Cir. 1954).
Petitioners continue to argue that the court in the
fourth case “reject[ed] application of the discovery rule
to Section 2462,” Br. 31, but in that case the underlying
violation had nothing to do with fraud. See 3M Co.
(Minn. Mining & Mfg.) v. Browner, 17 F.3d 1453,
1460-1463 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (defendant imported chemicals in violation of the Toxic Substances Control Act,
15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.). 3M Co. thus stands for the unremarkable proposition that a cause of action often accrues at the time of a defendant’s unlawful conduct. See
Pet. App. 20a n.4 (noting that petitioners’ reliance below
on 3M Co. was “misplaced” because that case “did not
involve fraud claims”); Koenig, 557 F.3d at 739 (distin-

23

guishing 3M Co. on the same ground). Moreover, the
court in 3M Co. recognized that concealment suspends
the running of Section 2462’s limitations period. See
17 F.3d at 1461 n.15.
Like the court below, the First and Seventh Circuits
have squarely held that, in fraud cases brought by the
Commission seeking civil penalties, Section 2462’s fiveyear limitations period does not begin to run until the
Commission knew or should have known the relevant
facts. See Br. in Opp. 18; see also Koenig, 557 F.3d at
739-740; SEC v. Tambone, 550 F.3d 106, 148-149 (1st
Cir. 2008).4 Petitioners acknowledge (Br. 53) that the
court in Koenig so held, and they do not discuss
Tambone.5 In a recent unpublished opinion, the Fifth
Circuit declined to apply the discovery rule in a fraud
case brought by the Commission seeking civil penalties.
4

The First Circuit granted en banc review in Tambone and accordingly withdrew the panel opinion, but the en banc court limited its
review to a different issue in the case. See SEC v. Tambone, 573 F.3d
54 (2009). The en banc court’s subsequent opinion was confined to that
issue, and the court expressly reinstated the panel’s conclusion that an
enforcement action by the Commission is timely if it is brought within
five years of when the Commission discovered, or reasonably could have
discovered, a defendant’s fraud. See SEC v. Tambone, 597 F.3d 436,
450 (1st Cir. 2010).
5
Petitioners suggest that in Koenig, “the individual defendant
deliberately concealed his wrongdoing,” Br. 53 n.33, but the defendant’s
fraud there was no more or less “conceal[ed]” than in this case. In
Koenig, a corporate executive used various accounting methods to
overstate the company’s profits. See 557 F.3d at 737-739. The executive falsely told outside accountants that he would discontinue using
those methods, see id. at 740, but that is not different from petitioners’
false representation to directors and investors that they were attempting to eliminate market timing. In any event, nothing in the Seventh
Circuit’s decision rested on the fact that the defendant there misled
outside accountants.

24

See SEC v. Bartek, No. 11-10594, 2012 WL 3205446, at
*3-*6 (Aug. 7, 2012). For reasons explained below, the
Fifth Circuit erred in interpreting this Court’s decisions
to hold that the discovery rule applies in a fraud case
only if the defendant allegedly took additional steps to
conceal his fraud. See id. at *4-*5; pp. 29-33, infra. This
Court has long rejected precisely that argument.
II.	 PETITIONERS’ COUNTERARGUMENTS LACK MERIT

Petitioners advance several arguments why the limitations period in 28 U.S.C. 2462 should have commenced
to run before the Commission discovered, or reasonably
could have discovered, petitioners’ fraudulent scheme.
None withstands scrutiny.
A.	 The Application Of A Discovery Rule In Cases Of Fraud
Or Concealment Dates To The Beginning Of The Republic
1.	 Federal courts have consistently applied the fraud
discovery rule both before and after Section 2462’s
enactment

a. Contrary to petitioners’ contention (Br. 49-53),
the government’s position is deeply rooted in history.
Although the Statute of James (the English predecessor
to American statutes of limitations) lacked an express
exception for fraud actions, see 21 Jac. I. ch. 16, §§ II,
VII (1623), English courts sitting in equity suspended
the statute’s operation in cases of fraud. See, e.g., South
Sea Co. v. Wymondsell, (1732) 24 Eng. Rep. 1004, 1005
(Ch.) (observing that “a bill to be relieved against a
fraud, was not within the statute of limitations”); Booth
v. Warrington, (1714) 2 Eng. Rep. 111, 112 (H.L.) (affirming that “the plea of the statute of limitations ought
not to avail [the defendant] any thing” in a claim for

25

fraud). English courts eventually recognized that this
equitable exception could apply to actions at law as well.
See, e.g., Granger v. George, (1826) 108 Eng. Rep. 56, 56
(K.B.); Clark v. Hougham, (1823) 107 Eng. Rep. 339, 341
(K.B.); Bree v. Holbech, (1781) 99 Eng. Rep. 415, 416
(K.B.) (Lord Mansfield, C.J.).
Because “most, if not all[,] the statutes of limitations” enacted in the early days of the Republic “borrowed the language” of the Statute of James, “the expositions of the statute, which had been adopted in England, both at law and in equity, were well known to
those, who framed our own.” Sherwood, 21 F. Cas. at
1307 (Story, J.). It was therefore natural “that these
expositions,” including the fraud discovery rule, “were
received as the true interpretation” of statutes of limitations by American courts during the early nineteenth
century. Ibid.6 Accordingly, treatises from both sides
6

See, e.g., Harrell v. Kelly, 13 S.C.L. (2 McCord) 426, 428 (S.C.
Const. Ct. App. 1823) (“[I]f the plaintiff prosecute his claim within four
years from the time the fraud is discovered, the case is not barred.”);
Jackson’s Assignees v. Cutright, 5 Va. (2 Munf.) 308, 323 (1817)
(“[W]here fraud has been committed, and not discovered by the party
defrauded, the Act will not run; but it will run from the time when the
fraud was discovered.”); Shelby’s Heirs v. Shelby, 3 Tenn. (Cooke) 179,
183 (1812) (acknowledging an “exception” to the statute of limitations
if “the fraud was not * * * discovered until within three years previous to the institution of the suit”); Jones v. Conoway, 4 Yeates 109,
111 (Pa. 1804) (“Wherever there is a fraud, the statute of limitations is
no plea, unless the fraud be discovered within the time.”); First Mass.
Tpk. Corp. v. Field, 3 Mass. (1 Tyng) 201, 207 (1807) (“The delay of
bringing the suit is owing to the fraud of the defendant, and the cause
of action against him ought not to be considered as having accrued, until
the plaintiff could obtain the knowledge that he had a cause of action.”);
Jones v. McKennan, 2 Del. Cas. 106, 107 (Del. C.P. New Castle 1798)
(agreeing with the plaintiff ’s argument that the limitations statute did
not run “in case[s] of frauds”).

26

of the Atlantic confirmed that if “the fraud was not discovered” within the limitations period, “the statute of
limitations is not a good plea, unless the defendant denies the fraud, or avers, that the fraud, if any, was discovered [within the limitations period].” 4 Matthew Bacon, A New Abridgment of the Law 476 (5th ed. 1798);
see 1 Isaac Espinasse, A Digest of the Law of Actions at
Nisi Prius 162 (1791).
This Court likewise acknowledged the “well settled
and unquestioned rule[] in all courts of law and equity”
that the statute of limitations “does not run until the
discovery of the fraud.” Willison v. Watkins, 28 U.S.
(3 Pet.) 43, 52-53 (1830) (quoting Kane v. Bloodgood,
7 Johns. Ch. 90, 122 (N.Y. Ch. 1823)). As the Court summarized, “[t]he courts of equity * * * from an early
day, held that where one person has been injured by the
fraud of another, and the facts constituting such fraud
do not come to the knowledge of the person injured until
some time afterward, the statute will not commence to
run until the discovery of those facts, or until by reasonable diligence they might have been discovered.” Amy
v. Watertown (No. 2), 130 U.S. 320, 324 (1889); see
Moore v. Greene, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 69, 72 (1856) (“When
fraud is alleged as a ground to set aside a title, the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is discovered.”);
1 Joseph K. Angell & John Wilder May, A Treatise on
the Limitations of Actions at Law and Suits in Equity
and Admiralty 179-192 (4th ed., rev. & enl. 1861). Indeed, in language that remains directly relevant to this
case, the Court explained that a “cause of action * * *
is not to be deemed to have accrued until the discovery
by the aggrieved party of the facts constituting the
fraud.” Case of Broderick’s Will, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 503,
518 (1875).

27

b. In 1839, when Congress enacted the earliest predecessor version of Section 2462, it did so against a settled background understanding that the federal courts
would apply the discovery rule in cases of fraud.7 Indeed, this Court had said nearly a decade earlier in
Willison that it was the “well settled and unquestioned
rule[]” in federal courts that a limitations period “does
not run until the discovery of the fraud.” 28 U.S. (3 Pet.)
at 52-53. In light of the “presumption that Congress
understands the state of existing law when it legislates,”
Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 896 (1988), Congress should be assumed to have incorporated into Section 2462 the settled principle that statutes of limitations
in cases of fraud run from the date of (actual or constructive) discovery. See, e.g., Keene Corp. v. United
States, 508 U.S. 200, 212-213 (1993). Congress subsequently amended the statute in 1874 and then recodified
it in 1948 without making any relevant substantive
change. See Rev. Stat. § 1047, 18 Stat. 193 (1874); Act of
7

Petitioners contend that “[t]he current version of Section 2462
traces back to a 1790 statute.” Br. 49; see Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9,
§ 32, 1 Stat. 119. That is incorrect. The 1790 provision on which petitioners rely forbade certain punishments for most capital and noncapital cases “unless the indictment or information * * * shall be
found or instituted within two years from the time of committing the
offence.” Ibid. The true historical antecedent to Section 2462 was
enacted in 1839 and focused solely on suits for penalties or forfeiture.
See Act of Feb. 28, 1839, ch. 36, § 4, 5 Stat. 322. Like current Section
2462, the 1839 provision had a five-year time limit, which ran “from the
time when the penalty or forfeiture accrued.” Ibid. (emphasis added);
see Cato Inst. Amicus Br. 6 (“The operative language of [Section] 2462
first appeared in an 1839 version of the statute.”). But even if Section
2462 were traceable to the 1790 provision, it was clear even at that time
that the limitations period in a suit for fraud does not begin to run until
the plaintiff discovers, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence could
have discovered, the facts constituting the fraud.

28

June 25, 1948, Pub. L. No. 80-773, 62 Stat. 974
(28 U.S.C. 2462).
c. Petitioners contend that in 1839, when the earliest predecessor version of Section 2462 was enacted, “a
claim was understood to accrue when it could be sued
on.” Br. 50. But again the authorities they cite (Br. 51)
for that proposition involve nonfraud claims and thus
implicate only the general rule that a claim accrues
when a plaintiff has the right to bring suit. See, e.g.,
Smith v. United States, 143 F.2d 228, 228-230 (9th Cir.)
(defendant was convicted of a tariff violation and failed
to pay the entire court-ordered fine; government
brought suit under Section 2462 for the unpaid balance),
cert. denied, 323 U.S. 729 (1944). Petitioners identify a
single fraud case, United States v. Maillard, 26 F. Cas.
1140 (S.D.N.Y. 1871) (No. 15,709), in which a district
court held that a fraud claim accrues for purposes of
Section 2462 at the time of the fraud, regardless of when
the government could have discovered it. See id. at
1142-1143. The district court in Maillard appeared to
believe that it was bound by state law rather than federal law in interpreting Section 2462. See id. at 1143
(citing New York cases). In any event, the district court
did not discuss this Court’s prior decisions in Willison
or Moore recognizing the fraud discovery rule, and it
expressly rejected Justice Story’s influential circuit
court opinion in Sherwood. See ibid. Petitioners thus
rely on an outlier district court decision that, even at the
time, was directly contrary to this Court’s precedent.8
8

Petitioners identify (Br. 32 n.23) a handful of early decisions in
which state courts declined to apply a discovery rule in actions at law.
Although there was some disagreement in state courts as to whether
the discovery rule could apply at law as in equity, see Sherwood,
21 F. Cas. at 1306-1307, this Court declared in Willison that in federal

29

2. The historical exception covers cases of fraud as well
as cases of concealment

a. Petitioners argue that the fraud discovery rule
applies only when “the defendant affirmatively
conceal[s] the existence of her wrongful conduct from
the plaintiff.” Br. 26; see Br. 25-28 & n.22. Petitioners
contend on that basis that the discovery rule does not
extend the limitations period in this case because they
did not take affirmative steps to conceal their fraud.
That contention, the court of appeals recognized, conflates two distinct (though related) justifications for extending an applicable limitations period. See Pet.
App. 18a-19a. One justification is that the fraudulent
nature of a defendant’s offense prevents a plaintiff from
knowing that she has been defrauded. Another is that
the defendant has misrepresented or concealed facts
that are essential to a plaintiff ’s cause of action, whether
or not that cause of action is for fraud. See, e.g., Riddell
v. Riddell Wash. Corp., 866 F.2d 1480, 1491 (D.C. Cir.
1989) (distinguishing between “wrongs as to which concealment is established by the nature of the act, and
wrongs as to which additional acts of concealment are
required”) (internal quotation marks omitted). In either
situation, an applicable limitations period does not begin
to run until the plaintiff is aware, or reasonably could
have been aware, of the facts underlying her cause of
action. See TRW, 534 U.S. at 27 (noting that the discovcourts a “statute of limitations receives the same construction and
application at law and in equity.” 28 U.S. (3 Pet.) at 52; see Bailey,
88 U.S. (21 Wall.) at 349 (“[T]he weight of judicial authority, both in this
country and in England, is in favor of the application of the [fraud
discovery] rule to suits at law as well as in equity.”). It is that view, not
the minority view of a few state courts, on which Congress continually
relied in enacting, amending, and codifying Section 2462.

30

ery rule has historically applied “in cases of fraud or
concealment”) (emphasis added).
This Court has long recognized that either of those
circumstances justifies deferring the commencement of
a limitations period for so long as the plaintiff is reasonably unaware of the facts underlying his claim. In
Bailey, the Court observed that “where the ignorance of
the fraud has been produced by affirmative acts of the
guilty party in concealing the facts from the other, the
statute will not bar relief provided suit is brought within
proper time after the discovery of the fraud.” 88 U.S.
(21 Wall.) at 347-348. The Court further explained, however, that “where the party injured by the fraud remains
in ignorance of it without any fault or want of diligence
or care on his part, the bar of the statute does not begin
to run until the fraud is discovered, though there be no
special circumstances or efforts on the part of the party
committing the fraud to conceal it from the knowledge
of the other party.” Id. at 348 (emphasis added). The
Court in Bailey thus made clear that the discovery rule
applies in both circumstances.
Petitioners correctly observe (Br. 27) that the plaintiff in Bailey alleged “that the defendants kept secret
and concealed * * * the fraud.” 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) at
348. The Court declined, however, to rest its decision on
that fact. Rather, the Court concluded that “when the
fraud has been concealed, or is of such character as to
conceal itself, the statute does not begin to run until the
fraud is discovered by, or becomes known to, the party
suing.” Id. at 349-350 (emphasis added). That conclusion was consistent with this Court’s previous recognition that a plaintiff could invoke the discovery rule by
pleading “particular acts of fraud or concealment” that

b. This Court’s conclusion in Bailey was not novel.
Long before Bailey, lower courts had held that plaintiffs
whose causes of action were based on fraud did not have
to plead additional acts of concealment in order to invoke the discovery rule. See, e.g., Carr v. Hilton,
5 F. Cas. 134, 136 (C.C.D. Me. 1852) (No. 2436) (Curtis,
J.) (“It is objected, however, that this bill does not contain any averment that the cause of action was fraudulently concealed. But it does state a case of secret fraud,
and it would be difficult to distinguish this from fraudulent concealment.”); Way v. Cutting, 20 N.H. 187, 193
(1849) (“[T]he position assumed by the defendant, that
some new act of fraud and concealment, beside the representation made at the sale, must be proved upon him
in order to deprive him of the protection of the statute,
is not supported by authority or sound reason.”); Homer
v. Fish, 1 Mass. (1 Pick.) 435, 438 (1823) (“[W]e do not
find that a particular averment of * * * any act of the
party by which the knowledge of [the fraud] was prevented, is necessary.”); see also John P. Dawson, Fraudulent Concealment and Statutes of Limitation, 31 Mich.

was the basis of liability, it was universally agreed that
no new concealment was necessary and the wrongdoer
might remain wholly passive, provided no avenues were

In Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC v. Simmonds, 132 S. Ct.
1414 (2012), this Court discussed concealment as a possible ground for
suspending the limitations provision because that was the ground
potentially applicable to that nonfraud case. Id. at 1419-1420. The
Court had no occasion to address the application of the discovery rule
to cases where the underlying violation sounds in fraud.

32

open to the plaintiff for discovery of the fraud.”)
(Dawson); id. at 880 n.12 (collecting cases).
The theory behind those cases was simple: “[A]s
fraud is a secret thing, and may remain undiscovered for
a length of time, during such time the statute of limitations shall not operate.” Hovenden v. Lord Annesley,
2 Schoales & Lefroy 634 (Ir. Ch. 1806). Or as the court
of appeals explained in this case, “fraud claims by their
very nature involve self-concealing conduct,” and thus
“it has been long established that the discovery rule applies where, as here, a claim sounds in fraud.” Pet. App.
18a. The other courts of appeals to consider the question have reached the same conclusion. See Koenig,
557 F.3d at 739 (“[T]he nineteenth century recognized a
special rule for fraud, a concealed wrong.”); Tambone,
550 F.3d at 148 (noting “the self-concealing nature of the
defendants’ [fraudulent] conduct”); cf. Texas v. Allan
Constr. Co., 851 F.2d 1526, 1529 (5th Cir. 1988) (“[I]n a
fraud case, the plaintiff need only aver the underlying
fraud in order to toll the statute of limitations until such
time as the plaintiff had some notice of the wrong; fraud
is, by its very nature, self-concealing.”).
That approach follows naturally from equity’s primary justification for the fraud discovery rule, which is
to prevent defendants from unfairly relying on statutes
of limitations when their own acts have kept potential
plaintiffs in the dark. See p. 13, supra; Glus, 359 U.S. at
232-233. The Court’s treatment of “concealment” as a
distinct ground for delaying the commencement of the
limitations period reflects a recognition that this equitable principle may be implicated even though the underlying claim does not sound in fraud. That recognition
provides no sound basis for declining to apply the discovery rule to actual fraud claims. As the Court ex-

33

plained in Bailey, “[t]o hold that * * * by committing
a fraud in a manner that it concealed itself until such
time as the party committing the fraud could plead the
statute of limitations to protect it, is to make the law
which was designed to prevent fraud the means by
which it is made sucessful and secure.” 88 U.S.
(21 Wall.) at 349; see Dawson 882 (requiring affirmative
concealment in cases of fraud is “unnecessary” because
there are “elements of immorality on the defendant’s
part * * * in the original injury”). Simply put, petitioners point to nothing in law or logic for the notion
that equity intervenes not at the original wrong (a defendant’s fraud) but only at the subsequent one (a defendant’s concealment of that fraud).
B.	 In Fraud Cases, The Discovery Rule Is Read Into Federal Statutes Of Limitations Unless Congress Specifies
Otherwise

1. Petitioners argue (Br. 11-18) that applying a
fraud discovery rule is inconsistent with the text of Section 2462, which imposes a five-year time limit without
establishing any express exception for cases involving
fraud or concealment. Whether described as a doctrine
of accrual or tolling, however, the discovery rule has
long been understood as a background principle that
presumptively governs the application of federal limitations statutes unless Congress specifies otherwise. Indeed, nearly a century ago, this Court squarely held that
the discovery rule may delay the running of a limitations
period in cases of fraud, even in the absence of an express statutory “provision that the cause of action
should not be deemed to have accrued until the discovery of the fraud.” Exploration Co., 247 U.S. at 447. As
the Court recognized there, the doctrine’s applicability

34

does not depend on express language incorporating it
into a federal limitations statute.
The court of appeals therefore correctly reasoned
“that for claims that sound in fraud a discovery rule is
read into the relevant statute of limitation.” Pet. App.
20a. This Court and other courts have long said the
same thing. See, e.g., Holmberg, 327 U.S. at 397 (“This
equitable doctrine is read into every federal statute of
limitation.”); Cada v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 920 F.2d
446, 450 (7th Cir. 1990) (“[T]he ‘discovery rule’ of federal
common law * * * is read into statutes of limitations in
federal-question cases * * * in the absence of a contrary directive from Congress.”), cert. denied, 501 U.S.
1261 (1991); Dabney v. Levy, 191 F.2d 201, 205 (2d Cir.)
(Hand, J.) (“[I]n cases of fraud, * * * when Congress
does not choose expressly to say the contrary, the period
of limitation set by it only begins to run after the injured
party has discovered, or has failed in reasonable diligence to discover[,] the wrong.”) (internal quotation
marks omitted), cert. denied, 342 U.S. 887 (1951).
For that reason, this Court has repeatedly applied
the fraud discovery rule to limitations statutes that did
not contain express language regarding the plaintiff’s
discovery of his cause of action. See Holmberg, 327 U.S.
at 397; Exploration Co., 247 U.S. at 449; Rosenthal,
111 U.S. at 189; Bailey, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) at 347; Kirby,
120 U.S. at 136. Petitioners do not attempt to reconcile
the results in those cases with their textual argument.
They characterize (Br. 26, 28 n.22) those decisions as
recognizing an exception only for concealment and not
fraud (which is itself an inaccurate characterization, see
pp. 30-31, supra), but none of the limitations statutes at
issue in those cases contained any express language regarding fraud or concealment. Petitioners’ textual argu-

35

ment simply cannot be squared with this Court’s understanding and application of the fraud discovery rule.
Abandonment of the long-settled background understanding reflected in this Court’s decisions would be
especially ill-conceived because Congress has relied on
that understanding in drafting innumerable federal limitations statutes. See, e.g., Gomez-Perez v. Potter,
553 U.S. 474, 488 (2008); Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U.S. 36,
46 (1986).
Moreover, petitioners’ argument does not depend
solely on “the plain language of Section 2462.” Br. 11
(capitalization and emphasis omitted). Petitioners contend (Br. 12, 16) that Section 2462’s five-year period
began to run when all of the events necessary to the
SEC’s cause of action had occurred. Petitioners do not
and could not contend, however, that the text of Section
2462 specifically identifies that as the applicable test.
Rather, in arguing that the claims here “accrued” upon
the commission of their violation, petitioners rely on
settled general background understandings of the term
“accrued,” while ignoring the equally settled rule that a
fraud claim “accrues” on the date of actual or constructive discovery. There is no warrant in either history or
the plain text of Section 2462 for petitioners’ pick-andchoose approach.
Section 2462’s five-year time limit likewise contains
no express exceptions for other equitable doctrines like
forfeiture, waiver, and tolling. This Court has repeatedly held, however, that federal statutes of limitations
are generally “subject to rules of forfeiture and waiver,”
and that courts are typically permitted “to toll the limitations period in light of special equitable considerations.” John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States,
552 U.S. 130, 133 (2008); see Holland v. Florida,

36

130 S. Ct. 2549, 2560 (2010) (explaining that federal statutes of limitations are “normally subject to a ‘rebuttable
presumption’ in favor ‘of equitable tolling’ ”) (quoting
Irwin, 498 U.S. at 95-96; emphasis omitted). As with the
doctrines of forfeiture and waiver, the crucial question
here is not whether Section 2462 explicitly incorporates
the fraud discovery rule, but whether Congress has
clearly displaced the usual rule that limitations periods
in fraud cases are triggered by actual or constructive
discovery.
2. Petitioners also argue (Br. 16-18) that Congress
clearly displaced the fraud discovery rule in the text of
Section 2462. Petitioners note (Br. 17) that Section 2462
imposes a five-year time limit on civil penalty actions
“[e]xcept as otherwise provided by Act of Congress.”
That phrase merely recognizes that Section 2462 is a
catch-all provision governing numerous actions brought
by different federal agencies, and that particular statutes authorizing suits for civil penalties may have their
own limitations provisions. See 3M Co., 17 F.3d at 1461;
see also United States v. Providence Journal Co.,
485 U.S. 693, 705 n.9 (1988). Congress has not “otherwise provided” here, however, because the Advisers Act
authorizes the SEC to seek civil penalties but does not
specify the time within which the Commission must sue.
Because (as explained above) the date of actual or constructive discovery is ordinarily the “accrual” date of a
fraud claim, the introductory language of Section 2462
provides no basis for departing from that approach here.
Similarly, petitioners contend that “the language of
Section 2462 is peremptory” because “[i]t directs that
courts ‘shall’ not entertain” suits for civil penalties after
five years. Br. 17. But that is a common feature of federal limitations statutes. This Court has often invoked

37

the fraud discovery rule in cases where the limitations
statutes at issue contained the verb “shall.” See Exploration Co., 247 U.S. at 445; Rosenthal, 111 U.S. at 189;
Bailey, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) at 344. Section 2462’s directive that a court “shall” dismiss an untimely action sheds
no light on whether any particular suit is untimely. In
particular, it does not suggest that Congress departed
here from the usual rule that a fraud claim “accrues” on
the date of actual or constructive discovery.
Petitioners emphasize (Br. 17) that the time limit in
Section 2462 runs “from the date when the claim first
accrued” (emphasis added). The term “first,” however,
adds nothing to the parties’ dispute about when the Commission’s claims “accrued.” Each of the Commission’s
claims could accrue only at a particular point in time.
For petitioners, that point in time is when they committed the fraud underlying the claim; for the government,
it is the Commission’s actual or constructive discovery
of the same fraud. There is consequently no difference
for these purposes between when the Commission’s
claims “accrued” and “first accrued.” See Franconia
Assocs. v. United States, 536 U.S. 129, 145 (2002) (explaining that the words “first accrues” are “unexceptional” and do not create “a special accrual rule”). In
determining when a claim first accrues, courts should
take into account the background principles governing
accrual in a particular context, see ibid., and one of
those principles is the fraud discovery rule.
Finally, petitioners argue (Br. 16-17) that, by creating an exception to Section 2462’s five-year time limit
when “the offender or the property is [not] found within
the United States,” Congress precluded any further exception for cases of fraud or concealment. That argument is inconsistent with the history and nature of the

38

fraud discovery rule, which English courts applied under a limitations statute—the Statute of James—that
contained express exceptions. See Sherwood, 21 F. Cas.
at 1303 (applying the discovery rule even though “[t]he
statute of limitations * * * contains like exceptions [to
the Statute of James] in favour of infants, femes covert,
&c.”); see also Jackson v. Speer, 974 F.2d 676, 678-680
(5th Cir. 1992); Cada, 920 F.2d at 451. This Court has
applied the fraud discovery rule in the same way. See
Kirby, 120 U.S. at 135-139.
C.	 When Congress Has Explicitly Addressed Discovery In
Other Federal Limitations Statutes, It Has Generally
Done So In Order To Expand Or Contract The Traditional Rule

1. Petitioners contend (Br. 18-25) that when Congress intends the discovery rule to apply in a particular
context, Congress says so expressly in the relevant federal limitations statute. That contention is incorrect for
the same reasons as petitioners’ plain-text argument. In
cases of fraud or concealment, the discovery rule “is
read into every federal statute of limitation.” Holmberg,
327 U.S. at 397. Accordingly, as the court of appeals
explained, Congress typically has addressed discovery
in other federal statutes not to codify the traditional
fraud discovery rule, but to alter the rule’s usual operation in either of two ways: (a) by expanding the discovery rule to include nonfraud cases or (b) by contracting
the amount of time a plaintiff would otherwise have to
bring suit. See Pet. App. 20a.
a. In some federal statutes, Congress has specified
that a limitations period commences upon discovery of
a cause of action that is not based on fraud. By specifying that the limitations period runs from a claim’s dis-

39

covery, Congress has ensured that the period does not
run instead from the date of the events giving rise to
the plaintiff’s cause of action. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C.
78u-6(h)(B)(1)(iii)(I)(bb) (Supp. V 2011) (three-year time
limit for antiretaliation actions by securities whistleblowers from “the date when facts material to the right
of action are known or reasonably should have been
known by the employee alleging a violation”); 26 U.S.C.
7431(d) (two-year time limit for certain taxpayer actions
from “the date of discovery by the plaintiff of the unauthorized inspection or disclosure”).
Similarly, Congress sometimes specifies that a limitations period commences upon discovery when the provision governs both fraudulent and nonfraudulent conduct. For instance, Section 2415 of Title 28 establishes
general time limits on contract and tort claims brought
by the United States for money damages. See 28 U.S.C.
2415(a) (six-year time limit for contract claims);
28 U.S.C. 2415(b) (three-year time limit for tort claims).
Those time limits run from the accrual of the government’s right of action. Section 2416(c) provides, however, that those time limits do not run during any period
when “facts material to the right of action are not known
and reasonably could not be known by an official of the
United States charged with the responsibility to act in
the circumstances.” Section 2416(c) thus ensures that
the discovery rule operates with respect to all of the government’s contract and tort claims, regardless of
whether those claims are based on fraud, and regardless
of whether the government’s unawareness of the relevant facts is attributable to affirmative acts of concealment by the defendant.
b. In other statutes, Congress has addressed discovery not to expand the traditional rule, but to contract or

40

displace it. In particular, Congress sometimes establishes time limits with a two-part structure that combines an express discovery rule with an absolute period
of repose. See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. 335b(b)(3)(B) (requiring
that suit must be commenced within six years from discovery of material facts, but in no event more than ten
years after the violation); 28 U.S.C. 1658(b) (same; two
years from discovery of the facts constituting the violation, but in no event more than five years after the violation). In that type of dual-prong provision, the express
discovery rule functions very differently from its traditional counterpart. First, those express discovery rules
can only shorten the time for bringing suit: a plaintiff
who becomes aware of her claim must bring suit within
the defined period after discovery, even if the repose
period has not yet elapsed. Second, the repose limit displaces the traditional fraud discovery rule in cases
where, as a result of fraud or concealment, plaintiffs
discover violations after the repose period has elapsed.
For both of those reasons, petitioners are wrong in arguing (Br. 21 & n.18, 23) that such dual-prong provisions
codify the traditional fraud discovery rule.10
2. Petitioners are correct (Br. 20-21) that, on rare
occasions, Congress has expressly codified the traditional fraud discovery rule. See 19 U.S.C. 1621 (requir10

It makes no difference if, in a limitations provision that combines
an express discovery rule with an absolute period of repose, the outer
limit runs from the date on which the claim accrued rather than the
date of the violation. See 15 U.S.C. 77www(a) (2000) (requiring suit
“within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the cause
of action and within three years after such cause of action accrued”);
15 U.S.C. 78r (2000). The text and structure of such a provision make
clear that, even in cases of fraud or concealment, a claim’s accrual is
governed by general accrual principles, not by the traditional fraud
discovery rule.

41

ing that suit be commenced “within 5 years after the
date of the alleged violation or, if such violation arises
out of fraud, within 5 years after the date of discovery of
fraud”); 19 U.S.C. 1641(d)(4) (similar); cf. 15 U.S.C.
1679i (extending the limitations period in misrepresentation cases against credit repair organizations until
“the date of the discovery by the consumer”). By doing
so, Congress “may have simply intended to remove any
doubt” that the fraud discovery rule applies in those
contexts. Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S.
214, 226 (2008); see Fort Stewart Schs. v. FLRA,
495 U.S. 641, 646 (1990) (noting that “technically unnecessary” exceptions may have been “inserted out of an
abundance of caution”). In any event, petitioners cite no
authority for the counterintuitive proposition that, when
Congress codifies an established canon of construction
in a particular federal law, the canon ceases to govern
the interpretation of other federal statutes. Congress’s
occasional express endorsement of the fraud discovery
rule does not render the rule inapplicable to statutes
where it is neither explicitly incorporated nor explicitly
displaced.
D.	 The Fraud Discovery Rule Applies Equally To The Government As To Private Plaintiffs

1. Petitioners contend (Br. 31, 33) that the fraud
discovery rule applies only to suits brought by private
plaintiffs, not to government actions for civil penalties.
Nearly a century ago, however, this Court explained
that there is “no good reason why the rule, now almost
universal, that statutes of limitations upon suits to set
aside fraudulent transactions shall not begin to run until
the discovery of the fraud, should not apply in favor of
the Government as well as a private individual.” Explo-

42

ration Co., 247 U.S. at 449; see ibid. (“We cannot believe
that Congress intended to give immunity to those who
for the period named in the statute might be able to conceal their fraudulent action from the knowledge of the
agents of the Government.”); Koenig, 557 F.3d at 739
(“[T]he United States is entitled to the benefit of [the
fraud discovery] rule even when it sues to enforce laws
that protect the citizenry from fraud, but is not itself a
victim.”) (citing Exploration Co.). To the extent that
Section 2462 is unclear, its interpretation is governed by
the canon that “when the sovereign elects to subject
itself to a statute of limitations, the sovereign is given
the benefit of the doubt if the scope of the statute is ambiguous.” BP Am. Prod. Co. v. Burton, 549 U.S. 84, 96
(2006). Petitioners provide no reason to abandon that
approach here. Equitable-tolling principles are presumptively applicable to private suits against the government, see Irwin, 498 U.S. at 95-96, and it would be
perverse to deny the sovereign alone the benefit of the
fraud discovery rule.
Petitioners argue that, in Exploration Co., “the government was suing for restitution [and] standing in for
a private stakeholder who was defrauded by a private
party.” Br. 28 n.22. That is incorrect. The defendants
in Exploration Co. had obtained federal lands by fraud,
and the United States brought suit to annul the land
patents. See 247 U.S. at 445-446. The same type of action was at issue in United States v. Minor, 114 U.S. 233
(1885). In both cases, this Court held that equitable
doctrines—the discovery rule in Exploration Co. and
laches in Minor—apply in the same way to suits brought
by the government as to suits brought by private plaintiffs. See Minor, 114 U.S. at 238 (“Of course, lapse of
time[] as a defence to a suit for relief for these frauds

43

did not begin to run until the fraud was discovered.”).
Just as the government brought those cases to vindicate
the public interest in lawful disposal of federal lands, the
Commission brought this case to vindicate the public
interest in lawful participation in the securities markets.
See, e.g., SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc.,
375 U.S. 180, 189-190 (1963).11
2. Petitioners maintain (Br. 30-33) that the discovery rule applies only “where the party injured by the
fraud remains in ignorance of it.” Bailey, 88 U.S.
(21 Wall.) at 348 (emphasis added). Petitioners contend
that, because the Commission need not establish injury
as an element of its fraud claims under the Advisers Act,
the discovery rule does not apply to “a statutory [Advisers Act] claim—or any other statutory fraud claim.”
Br. 31. But equity’s primary justification for the fraud
discovery rule has centered on the defendant’s misconduct, not on the particular disadvantage the plaintiff
would suffer if its suit were dismissed as untimely. See
Glus, 359 U.S. at 232 (“[W]e need look no further than
the maxim that no man may take advantage of his own
wrong.”); Holmberg, 327 U.S. at 386 (“[F]raudulent con11

Notably, the arguments that the defendants advanced in Exploration Co. are virtually indistinguishable from those pressed by petitioners here. See Appellants’ Br., Exploration Co., supra (No. 277). The
defendants in that case argued that the plain text of the limitations
provision did not contain an exception for fraud, id. at 36; that Congress
could have included such an exception if it had desired, id. at 27-35,
60-62; that the defendants had not taken affirmative steps to conceal
their fraud, id. at 42, 72-73; that the discovery rule could be invoked
only by private litigants, not the government, id. at 63-66; and that
adopting a contrary approach would raise administrability concerns and
permit the government to delay investigating land patent fraud, id. at
67-72. The Court in Exploration Co. squarely rejected each of those
arguments.

44

duct on the part of the defendant * * * may make it
unfair to bar appeal to equity because of mere lapse of
time.”). Indeed, that equitable principle provides the
core justification for distinguishing cases that involve
fraud or concealment from other cases in which the
plaintiff is reasonably unaware of the facts giving rise to
his cause of action. See p. 19, supra. That principle is as
applicable to government enforcement actions as to private suits.
To be sure, the Court in Bailey referred to the discovery rule as applying when the eventual plaintiff was
“injured by the fraud [and] remains in ignorance of it.”
88 U.S. (21 Wall.) at 348. But in Bailey and other cases
where that language was repeated, the plaintiffs were
private parties that had been injured by the defendants’
fraud. See id. at 343; see also Holmberg, 327 U.S. at
393; Kirby, 120 U.S. at 131-132. Because private plaintiffs who sue for fraud typically must prove injury, see
Restatement (Second) of Torts § 525 (1976), the language in Bailey accurately describes most of the cases
in which the fraud discovery rule has been applied. But
as the Court recognized in Exploration Co., equity’s
rationale for the discovery rule is fully applicable to
cases where Congress has authorized the government to
bring fraud claims without a showing of injury. Indeed,
the Court sometimes has stated that a limitations period
does not begin to run “until the discovery of the facts
constituting the fraud.” Amy, 130 U.S. at 324-325; Case
of Broderick’s Will, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) at 518-519. That
formulation accurately captures the relevant inquiry and

45

encompasses the current SEC enforcement action for
civil penalties.12
3. Petitioners contend (Br. 23) that it would be
anomalous to allow the SEC, but not private plaintiffs,
to bring suit more than five years after the defendant’s
fraudulent conduct occurred. See 28 U.S.C. 1658(b) (establishing a five-year period of repose in private
securities-fraud suits). When Congress established that
repose period on private suits in 2002, it did nothing to
indicate that it intended to displace the traditional fraud
discovery rule in enforcement actions brought by the
government. And even under petitioners’ reading of
Section 2462, that provision is more generous to the government than Section 1658(b) is to private plaintiffs,
because Section 2462 establishes a five-year period to
sue even when the violation is discovered immediately,
whereas suits under Section 1658(b) must be filed within
“2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting the
violation.”
In any event, there is nothing unusual about permitting greater remedies to the government than to private
parties. See, e.g., Minor, 114 U.S. at 240; United States
v. Hoar, 26 F. Cas. 329, 330 (1821) (No. 15, 373) (Story,
J.). Congress wants to deter securities violations
through the Commission’s enforcement authority, and
that purpose is separate from seeking to compensate
12

This Court has extended the traditional discovery rule for cases of
fraud or concealment to two other contexts: “latent disease and medical
malpractice.” TRW, 534 U.S. at 27; see, e.g., Rotella v. Wood, 528 U.S.
549, 555 (2000); Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163, 170-171 (1949). In
those contexts, the application of the discovery rule may be linked to
the nature of plaintiffs’ injuries, but those cases are distinct from “the
historical exception for suits based on fraud.” TRW, 534 U.S. at 37
(Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment).

46

injured victims. In addition, Section 2462 governs civil
penalty actions in other contexts where the limitations
provisions that apply to private suits may not clearly
displace the discovery rule. In those contexts, it would
be petitioners’ approach creating the anomaly: private
plaintiffs would be able to invoke the discovery rule in
cases of fraud or concealment, but the government alone
would not.
E.	 The Fraud Discovery Rule Balances The Need For Repose Against The Need To Prevent Abuse Of Limitations
Statutes

1. Petitioners argue (Br. 37-43) that the fraud discovery rule is “at odds with the basic policies of all limitations provisions: repose, elimination of stale claims,
and certainty about a plaintiff ’s opportunity for recovery and a defendant’s potential liabilities.” Rotella v.
Wood, 528 U.S. 549, 555 (2000). But the fraud discovery
rule does not reject those policies altogether; it simply
balances them against competing values in cases where
the defendant’s own deceptive conduct has hindered his
adversary’s ability to seek redress. Its core justification
is that defendants are not entitled to repose when their
own deceptive conduct has effectively foreclosed potential plaintiffs from seeking redress. If defendants want
to eliminate stale claims and uncertainty about their
liabilities, they need only make public whatever they
have previously concealed. Here, if petitioners had disclosed the market timing scheme to the fund’s investors
or to the Commission, the limitations period in Section
2462 would have commenced to run.
Petitioners argue (Br. 34-37) that this approach
would allow perpetual penalties when the government
alleges fraudulent violations of the securities laws. This

Court’s response to that concern, however, has never
been to require affirmative acts of concealment over and
above the defendant’s fraud. Rather, the Court has limited the potential consequences of the fraud discovery
rule by emphasizing that actual or constructive discovery will trigger the limitations period. See, e.g., Credit
Suisse Secs. (USA) LLC v. Simmonds, 132 S. Ct. 1414,
1420 (2012); Merck, 130 S. Ct. at 1794-1795. Where a
defendant’s fraud or concealment would prevent a diligent plaintiff from learning the facts that give rise to his
cause of action, the discovery rule appropriately ensures
that the defendant does not benefit from his own wrongdoing. See, e.g., Prevost v. Gratz, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.)
481, 498 (1821) (observing that although the “length of
time necessarily obscures all human evidence,” it is likewise true that “the length of time, during which the
fraud has been successfully concealed and practised, is
rather an aggravation of the offence, and calls more
loudly upon a Court of equity to grant ample and decisive relief”).
Petitioners rely (Br. 34-37) on a presumption against
perpetual penalties, but that presumption is inapposite
here. Congress has consistently described the SEC’s
monetary penalties imposed for regulatory violations as
“civil” in nature, see, e.g., 15 U.S.C. 77t(d) (2000),
78u(d)(3) (2000), 80b-9(e)(1), and “only the clearest proof
will suffice to override legislative intent and transform
what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty,” Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93, 100
(1997) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Taylor v.
United States, 44 U.S. (3 How.) 197, 210-211 (1845)
(Story, J.) (recognizing that civil penalty provisions are
not penal laws to which the rule of lenity applies). Moreover, Section 2462 actually prevents the imposition of

48

perpetual penalties by placing a five-year time limit on
civil penalty actions. Cf. Adams v. Woods, 6 U.S.
(2 Cranch) 336, 342 (1805) (Marshall, C.J.) (holding that
a criminal forfeiture action should be subject to a limitations period). Although that limitations period is suspended in cases of fraud or concealment, the delay results from the defendant’s conduct, not the government’s.
2. As noted above, the traditional discovery rule
accounts for the importance of repose by providing that
the limitations period in a fraud case begins to run when
a reasonably diligent plaintiff could have discovered the
relevant facts, even if the actual plaintiff did not discover them until later. Petitioners suggest in passing
(Br. 29) that the Commission did not exercise reasonable
diligence here. As the court of appeals recognized, however, that argument is, “at best, premature.” Pet. App.
21a. This case arises on petitioners’ motion to dismiss,
and the complaint alleges that the SEC “did not discover
[petitioners’] illegal conduct until late 2003” and “could
not have discovered that wrongdoing earlier.” J.A. 89.
The court of appeals therefore correctly held that “at
this stage in the litigation [petitioners] have not met
their burden of demonstrating that a reasonably diligent
plaintiff would have discovered this fraud prior to September 2003.” Pet. App. 21a-22a.
F.	 The Fraud Discovery Rule Has Proved To Be Judicially
Administrable For More Than Two Centuries

Petitioners advance various policy arguments why
the traditional discovery rule should not apply to the
Commission’s civil penalty actions. None is persuasive.
1. Petitioners argue (Br. 43-49) that the decision
below will be difficult to administer in two respects.

49

First, petitioners assert (Br. 47-49) that it will be hard
for courts to determine whether a cause of action is
based on fraud. That is not a difficult inquiry here. The
relevant provisions of the Advisers Act make it unlawful
for an adviser “to employ any device, scheme, or artifice
to defraud any client or prospective client,” 15 U.S.C.
80b-6(1) (emphasis added), or “to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a
fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client,”
15 U.S.C. 80b-6(2) (emphasis added). Nor do petitioners
identify any prior case in which the inquiry has been
difficult. In cases of fraud or concealment, courts in
England and America have applied the discovery rule
for centuries. And, as explained earlier, this Court has
long distinguished between cases involving fraud or concealment and cases in which the plaintiff is unaware for
some other reason of the facts underlying his cause of
action. Petitioners offer no reason to suppose that this
distinction has proved unworkable in practice.
Petitioners also assert (Br. 44) that it will be hard for
courts to determine when a large agency like the Commission constructively discovered a defendant’s fraud.
Again, petitioners identify no cases in which that inquiry
has proved to be difficult. See Koenig, 557 F.3d at
739-740; Tambone, 550 F.3d at 148-149; see also Exploration Co., 247 U.S. at 438 (“There was nothing in the
[government] records * * * which could possibly have
aroused a suspicion * * * until the reports of the special agents of the General Land Office were made in the
latter part of 1909.”); cf. Merck, 130 S. Ct. at 1798
(“[C]ourts applying the traditional discovery rule have
long had to ask what a reasonably diligent plaintiff
would have known and done in myriad circumstances.”).
Indeed, petitioners concede (Br. 43-44) that other fed-

50

eral statutes require courts to undertake virtually identical inquiries into the knowledge of government officials.
2. Petitioners assert that the Commission “has extensive powers and the five-year statute of limitations
gives it sufficient time to fulfill the interest in law enforcement.” Br. 40. That assertion places the cart before the horse. The Commission “can take evidence,
subpoena documents, and compel testimony,” ibid., but
its ability to exercise those powers does not put it on
notice of the need to do so in a particular case when a
defendant’s fraud has concealed a violation of the securities laws. Indeed, petitioners’ approach unrealistically
envisions that the Commission (and other federal agencies that employ Section 2462) could constantly monitor
every regulated entity and transaction for any hint of
hidden fraud. That inefficient approach would only increase the burden on regulated entities generally, including those entities that have not engaged in any fraud
or concealment.
In any event, the SEC’s argument is not that “it has
insufficient time to investigate” securities fraud, Br. 41,
but that it should receive the five years granted to it by
Congress in Section 2462. In authorizing the Commission to seek civil penalties, Congress recognized that
increasingly “[i]nvestigations involve more complex issues of fact and law, the collection of evidence from foreign countries and the prosecution of defendants who, in
many cases, have the financial means to fight and delay
SEC actions for long periods of time, thus requiring a
greater commitment of the SEC’s resources.” S. Rep.
No. 337, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1990). Fraud claims
are typically more difficult to investigate and pursue
than other types of claims, see Lampf, 501 U.S. at 377

51

(Kennedy, J., dissenting) (“The most extensive and corrupt schemes may not be discovered within the time allowed for bringing an express cause of action.”), and
there is no reason why Congress would have wanted the
Commission and other agencies to have less time to do
so.
3. Finally, petitioners suggest (Br. 39) that the court
of appeals’ approach would weaken the Commission’s
incentives to investigate fraud cases. Under the traditional fraud discovery rule, however, Section 2462’s limitations period begins to run when a reasonably diligent
plaintiff could have discovered the relevant facts, regardless of the date of actual discovery. Defendants can
take limited discovery and can obtain summary judgment if there is no genuine issue of fact that the SEC
failed to file in time. See, e.g., Corwin v. Marney, Orton
Invs., 843 F.2d 194, 197-198 (5th Cir.), cert. denied,
488 U.S. 924 (1988). To bring an enforcement action like
this one, moreover, the Commission must satisfy not
only Section 2462’s timing requirement, but also the
pleading standards for fraud, which may become more
difficult to meet as the defendant’s conduct becomes
more remote in time. See, e.g., SEC v. Cuban, 620 F.3d
551, 552-553 & n.4 (5th Cir. 2010) (discussing those standards). If an enforcement suit is allowed to go forward
and the Commission prevails on the merits, the district
court has discretion to set the amount of any civil penalty, and it can consider the passage of time as well
as other relevant factors.
See, e.g., 15 U.S.C.
80b-9(e)(2)(A) (providing that the “amount of the penalty shall be determined by the court in light of the facts
and circumstances”). Taken together, the relevant statutory provisions create ample incentives for the Com-

52

mission to pursue its claims diligently, as it did in this
case.
CONCLUSION

The judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed.
