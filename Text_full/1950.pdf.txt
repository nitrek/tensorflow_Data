FOREWORD
This is the Sixteenth Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. It covers the year July 1, 1949 to June 30, 1950.
The report first outlines the activities of the Commission under the
major statutes entrusted to it and, in later sections, deals with over-all
activities that cut through statutory lines.
For the Securities and Exchange Commission the year was an extremely active one. Financing by industry, the major source of workload for the Commission, has continued at a high rate. The Commission's job in a particular financing may be the clearance of a registration statement under the Securities Act or the approval of the financing
under the Public Utility Holding Company Act, or it may be, by
formal or informal means, to issue an opinion as to whether the financing is exempted from these statutes. In any case the work must be
done thoroughly and promptly-to
guard the interest of investors
and to be fair to business whose timing schedules may be closely
geared to market conditions.
This balance of interests is, in our view, essential to the effectiveness
of the laws. Thorough performance is a necessity in order to serve
the investor whom the laws seek to protect. Unwarranted delays are a
disservice to those who must live with and comply with the laws. The
basic philosophy behind these statutes is that free enterprise is facilitated by honest and decent relations between investor and management.
The Commission stresses the facilitative aspect of these laws.
Past reports of the S. E. C. have outlined its progress toward simplifying administration and compliance. Those efforts continue. They
are--in the context of our disclosure laws-e-eflorts to transform disclosure on paper into effective information of the investor. For
example, the Commission has by dint of constant pressure succeeded
in eliminating from prospectuses destined for investors a good deal of
technical and confusing detail. This process of simplification has not
yet reached the financial statements in prospectuses to the extent the
Commission would like to see that done. The accounting profession
has recently been invited to join the Commission in an effort to reduce the present formal presentation of information in balance sheets
and income statements to homely and understandable terms.
Material problems have faced the Commission in its study of methods
of revising the mechanics of prospectus distribution under t'he Securities Act. These difficulties have delayed the recommendation of statutory changes. However, the study has proved to be a fruitful one
nevertheless. It has stimulated an active interest in the usefulness
of the prospectus as a vehicle of investor information. It has
prompted active attempts-with
revisions already made and more in
the offing-to change the prospectus into a piece of informative literature useful to the layman. It has led to a consideration of the
possibilities of authorizing more informative identifying literature
xt

XII

FOREWORD

to be used by distributors in advance of effectiveness of registration.
It has resulted in a consideration of the possibility of encouraging
preeffective use of adequate informative material. One possible rule
now being discussed would allow this pre-effective material to be
supplemented (after effectiveness) with a simple sheet giving missing
information about price, yields, and spreads, so that the pre-effective
material and the supplemental sheet together would constitute the
prospectus. In this way the need for printing and distributing after
effectiveness a wholly new prospectus (duplicating much of the information previously circulated) could be avoided.
These rule revisions are designed to encourage investors to read
pros.l?ectuses and to stimulate distributor interest in making timely
distribution of adequate information. "Whether they are substitutes
for a revision of the statute, which would make it mandatory to provide a prospectus before selling a security, cannot now be stated
with any assurance.
Of particular significance in this report is the record of our progress
under section 11 of the Public Utility Holdin~ Company Act. That
section requires the integration and simplification of holding company
systems, and-under certain circumstances-the elimination of holding companies. These aims are accomplished by voluntary plans,
approved by the Commission and, in many cases, by the courts, for
disposal of holding companies' controlling interests in operating companies, for reorganization of system companies, or for dissolution of
top or intermediate holding companies.
In the 12 years of active administration of these provisions over
$10,000,000,000of assets have been released from jurisdiction under the
Holding Company Act. There remain subject to the act about
$13,000,000,000of assets in holding company systems; and it is guessed
that the Commission will remain with a $6,000,000,000to $7,000,000,000
industry to regulate under the standards of the act.
The completion of this vast program would bring administration
of the Holding Company Act into a new phase. Enormous increases
in utility construction in recent years have put a heavy demand on the
staff for the processing of financing applications. The defense program will continue to require large outlays by the industry for capital
expansion, and that work alone will draw heavily on personnel
resources no longer committed to the section 11 phase of our work.
Of necessity many duties under the act have had to be rationed in
order to concentrate on the task of integration and simplification. A
resurvey of those duties is in progress.
On January 9, 1950, the Commission transmitted to the Congress a
report recommending an amendment to the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 which would extend to investors in unregistered securities the
protections afforded by the act in respect of the availability of public
information, the provision of data necessary for intelligent exercise
of the right to vote, and the regulation of insiders' short-term trading.
This report supplemented and brought up to date an earlier report
which had been submitted on June 19, 1946.
Economic development since 1946, the report indicated, had made
more essential the need for this legislation. Individual holdings of
cash, deposits, and U. S. Government securities were at a record high,

and yet investment in equity securities had not correspondingly
increased. Where idle funds were used for the purchase of such
securities, they were used largely to increase the investment in securities subject to the protections of the Securities Exchange Act. The
lack of publicity about companies outside of the scope of the act has,
in our view, been a substantial factor in the lack of investor interest
in these securities. A survey of the financial manuals disclosed that
there were approximately 1,800 companies which would be covered
by the proposed legislation.
After the receipt of these recommendations by the Commission,
there were introduced into the Senate by Senator Frear and into the
House of Representatives by Representative Sadowski identical bills
providing for the amendment of the Securities Exchange Act in
accordance with the Commission's proposals. Hearings were held
before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, but no committee
report was rendered to the Congress. Senator Frear explained in a
speech delivered on the floor of the Senate that this was caused by
the continuous emergency which faced the Banking and Currency
Committee as a result of the Korean War. According to the Senator,
it was decided that the subcommittee should further study the legislation with a view to action on it at the next session.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES

ACT OF 1933

The purpose of the Securities Act of 1933 is to provide full and fair
disclosure and to prevent fraud in the sale of securities in interstate
and foreign commerce and through the mails. To this end, the act
requires that issuers of securities to be offered for such public sale
must file with the Commission registration statements setting forth
prescribed information about the securities; that investors must be
furnished, at or before delivery of the security purchased, a copy of a
required prospectus containing the more significant items of such
information; and civil and criminal penalties are provided for securities frauds. The act does not authorize the Commission to pass on
the investment merits of securities and it makes representations to the
contrary unlawful.
THE REGISTRATION PROCESS
Purpose of Registration

Unless exempted from the Securities Act, securities offered for sale
in interstate commerce or by the use of the mails must be registered.
Securities for which such exemption is provided consist, in general, of
government and municipal securities and the issues of banks, railroads,
cooperatives and other organizations and associations specified in section 3 (a) of the act or covered by exemptions in rules and regulations
adopted by the Commission, as discussed elsewhere in this report, pursuant to section 3 (b) of the act. In addition, while the act contains
no exemption for securities of governmental or other foreign issuers
as such, Public Law 142, 81st Congress, approved by President Truman on June 29, 1949, extended a specific exemption to securities issued
or guaranteed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development from the registration requirements of both the Securities
Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
An integral part of each registration statement is the prospectus,
which sets forth the more pertinent information about the security
offering. As a basic method of direct disclosure to investors, the
prospectus plays a vital role in carrying out the purpose of the act.
The registration statement as a whole discloses material facts
dealing, among other things, with the character, size, and profitableness of the business, its capital structure, the uses to which the company
intends to put the proceeds realized from the sale of the securities,
options outstanding against securities of the issuer, remuneration of
officers and directors, bonus and profit-sharing arrangements, underwriters' commissions, and pending and threatened legal proceedings.
There must also be included in this document certified financial statements of the business enterprise.

SECURITIES AJ\TJ)

EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The information contained in registration statements filed with the
Commission is not only made available immediately for public inspection at the officesof the Commission but also forms the basis of widespread publicity released by financial news services, financial writers,
and newspapers throughout the nation, which further accelerates the
process of getting this information rapidly before a greatly enlarged
field of potential investors.
While the purpose of registration is thus to secure full and fair
disclosure of material facts about securities to enable prospective
investors to judge the risk involved intelligently, it is not intended
to remove the risk from investment decisions. The Commission is not
authorized under the Securities Act of 1933 to pass on the investment
merits of securities, and an effective registration statement does not
imply that the Commission has in any way passed upon the merits
of or given approval to the securities covered. Section 23 of the act
makes it unlawful to make any contrary representation to any prospective purchaser.
Examination Procedures

One of the Commission's most important undertakings has been
its development of procedures and techniques, which are constantly
undergoing improvements as dictated by experience, for the fast and
thorough examination of registration statements to determine compliance with the disclosure requirements of the act. The need for
speed in the examination process arises not only from the statutory
prescription of an effective date of the registration statement, in the
ordinary case on the twentieth day after its filing, but also from the
Commission's desire to avoid unnecessary interference with financing
plans.
"'Whereexamination shows the registration statement to be inaccurate or incomplete in disclosure of material information, the Commission may resort to its power under section 8 of the act and issue
an order preventing or suspending the effectiveness of the registration
statement. However, the Commission has, during the past five years.
continued its policy of exercising this power sparingly. Instead, it
has relied for enforcement mainly upon the long-standing practice of
securing an amendment to the registration statement. Accordingly,
registrants are informally advised, as promptly as possible after the
statements are filed, of any material misrepresentations or omissions
found upon examination and they are afforded an opportunity to
file correcting amendments before the statements become effective.
This advice is furnished by means of an informal "letter of comment"
which indicates what information should be corrected or supplemented to meet the disclosure standards.
Another informal procedure that has proved effective in speeding
the registration process is the "pre-filing conference" between staff
members and representatives of registrants and underwriters. In this
manner registrants are encouraged to discuss problems in connection
with the proposed filing for the purpose of determining in advance
what types or methods of disclosure may be necessary under the circumstances. This has contributed to the marked reduction in the num-

SIXTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

bel' of instances where the Commission has found it necessary to resort
to stop-order proceedings or other formal action under section 8.
Neither the Commission, the issuer, nor the underwriter desires a
statement to become effective unless it complies with the act. Often,
the staff will ascertain that deficiencies exist in the registration statement as filed, or the issuer or underwriter may wish either to amend
the statement or simply to delay its effectiveness because of changes
in the securities market or for other business reasons. In such cases,
if there is a danger that the registration statement may become effective in defective form or prematurely for the purposes of the issuer or
underwriter, it is customary for the registrant to file a minor amendment, called a "delaying amendment," which starts the 20-day waiting period running anew.
Effective Date of Registration Statement

The 20-day waiting period between the filing and effectiveness of
registration statements was provided by the Congress in order to permit widespread publicity among investors of the information contained in the registration statement before it becomes effective. The
Commission is, however, empowered at its discretion to accelerate the
effective date where the facts justify such action so that the full20-day
period need not elapse before the registration statement can become
effective. In the exercise of this power, the Commission must have
due regard to the adequacy of the information about the security
already available to the public, to the complexity of the particular
financing, and to the public interest and the protection of investors.
Time Required for Registration

For some years the Commission has made every effort to complete
the registration process within the 20-day waiting period. This
effort has been largely successful, and the median elapsed time from
the filing date of a registration statement to its effective date has been
progressively shortened from 30y:! days in the 1947 fiscal year to 21
days in the 1950fiscal year. A breakdown of this elapsed time for the
1950fiscal year is contained in the following table:

A.lthough the median elapsed time from filing to effectiveness was
21 days in the 1950 fiscal year, this time was 20 days or less in six
months of the year, accounting for more than half of all the registration statements which became effective during the year. The Commission intends to continue its efforts to bring the total elapsed median
time down to 20 days or less in all months.'

1There Is no necessary connection between the total
time elapsed In the registration
process and the 20 day waitIng perIod required by the statute.
Under section 8 of the
SecuritIes Act a regtstratlon statement becomes ell'ectIve on the 20th day after filing
(unless the CommIssIon has accelerated ell'ectIveness). The filing of an amendment to the
registration statement begins the waIting period running anew, unless the CommIssIon has
consented to or required the filing of the amendment.
After due notice and hearing the CommIssIon may refuse to permit a statement to become ell'ective. or may issue a stop-order determinIng the ell'ectiveness of the statement.
In view of the tradition of the CommissIon to rely on careful examination of registration
statements and the procurement of corrections by voluntary means, emphasis In the registration process is upon correction In response to a stair letter of comment, rather than upon
formal procedures to refuse or terminate eftectiveness.
The total time elapsed in the registration process is not completely withIn the control of
the CommissIon. As will be noted from the chart above, a substantial part of this total time
Includes the time taken by the registrant to make corrections pursuant to a letter of comment and the subsequent time taken to examIne the amended statement.
As the chart shows the median elapsed tIme from the date of filing to the first letter of
comment runs between 9 and 12 days. The remainder of the time Is consumed by the
registrant In making corrections and In a revIew of those correctIons by the stall'.
Customarily a statement Is declared eftectlve shortly after the receipt of the corrections
made pursuant to the letter of comment.
At times, however, more than one letter is
necessary.
• This figure di1l'ers from the 488 shown in the table on p. 176 due to dill'erence in
elasslfteatton as to time of ell'ectIveness of registration statements.
See appendix table I,
footnote 2 for details.

ANNUAL REPORT

It should be noted that while the volume of bonds registered by
issuers for cash sale decreased substantially, stock so registered showed
a marked increase.
From September 1934 through June 1949 new money purposes
represented 37 percent of the net proceeds expected from the cash sale
of issues registered for the accounts of the issuers. In the 1950 fiscal
year new money purposes represented 51 percent of the expected net
proceeds for the year-large enough to raise the 16-year average 2
points to 39 percent,"
The table below shows the amount of each type of security registered
for cash sale for the accounts of the issuers in each of the fiscal years
1935through 1950as well as the three 5-year totals. In addition to the
totals of the new issues for cash sale, all registrations are shown for the
same periods.

The Commission's Section of Operational Statistics continues to
study the costs of flotation of security issues. The greatest part of
these costs continues to be commissions and discount, which are the
amounts paid to investment bankers, the balance being distributed
among other expenses such as (a) those not affected by registration:
exchange listings, Federal revenue, stamp taxes, State fees and taxes,
trustees, transfer agents, etc., (b) those partly affected by registration : printing and engraving, legal fees and expenses, accounting fees
and expenses, engineering, appraising, etc., and miscellaneous and
(c) those entirely attributable to registration: the S. E. C. filing fee
of one one-hundredth of 1 percent of the maximum offering price of
the securities registered.
During the past 5 calendar years, 1945-49 inclusive, registrations
of all types of securities (for cash sale and otherwise) amounted to
approximately $29,000,000,000.
The cost of flotation of these securities was $2.64 per hundred dollars of gross proceeds. Of this, compensation paid to underwriters amounted to $2.12 and other expenses
amounted to $0.52.
In the 1950 fiscal year, investment bankers were used in the sale of
89 percent of the total registered for cash sale for the accounts of
issuers as compared with 79 percent in the 1949 fiscal year. Commitments by investment bankers to purchase for resale involved 67 percent of the total registered for cash sale for the accounts of issuers,
as compared with 66 percent in the 1949fiscal year.~
That part of cost of flotation represented by commissions and discounts to investment bankers, but excluding other expenses, is shown
ior each type of security for each of the past 10 fiscal years. The

Total Registered and Unregistered Securities

Proceeds from corporate securities flotations, both registered and
unregistered, applicable to expansion of fixed and working capital
amounted to $3,940,000,000. This is considerably lower than the
volume of securities sold for this purpose during the 1949 and 1948
fiscal years, the amount being approximately $5,800,000,000 in each
of these two periods. Electric and gas companies accounted for 41
percent of the new money financing, manufacturing firms 17 percent,
communication companies 8 percent, railroads 9 percent, and all
others 25 percent. Securities offered for retirement of outstanding
securities and repayment of bank loans amounted to $1,601,000,000in
the 1950 fiscal period compared with $921,000,000 in the preceding
year. The increase was due to a substantial rise in the amount of
securities refunded, particularly by electric and gas utility companies."

EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT

The Commission is authorized by section 3 (b) of the act to adopt
rules and regulations granting exemptions from the registration requirements for issues of securities whose aggregate offering price to
the public does not exceed $300,000.
The Commission has adopted five regulations pursuant to this
authority: Regulation A, a general exemption for small issues; regulation A-R, a special exemption for notes and bonds secured by first
liens on family dwellings; regulation A-M, a special exemption for
assessable shares of stock of mining companies; regulation B, an
exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights, and
regulation B-T, an exemption for interests in oil royalty trusts or
similar types of trusts or unincorporated associations.
Small offerings of securities may be made and sold to the public
pursuant to a section 3 (b) exemption on the basis of a less complete
disclosure than that required by the act in the case of a registered
security. For example, regulation A provides for the filing of a simple
letter of notification, containing limited information about the issuer
and the offering, with the appropriate regional officeof the Commission, and provides further that the offering may be made five business
days thereafter.
It should be emphasized, however, that exemption from registration permitted under section 3 (b) carries no exemption from civil
liabilities under section 12 for misstatements or omissions, or from
the criminal liabilities for fraud under section 17. For the proper
enforcement of these sections, the conditions for the availability of the
exemptions provided under section 3 (b) include, with the exception
of regulation A-R, the requirement that certain minimum information
be filed with the Commission and that disclosure of certain inform ation
be made in sales literature, if any sales literature is used. While no
prospectus need be used, selling literature must be filed in advance of
Its use.
Exempt

Ofi'erings under Regulation

A

In the 1950 fiscal year 1,357 letters of notification were filed under
regulation A, covering offerings in the aggregate amount of $171,743,472, compared with 1,392 filings totaling $186,782,661during the 1949

fiscal year. The 1950 fiscal year figures include 136 letters of notification covering stock offerings aggregating $19,909,525 filed by companies engaged in some phase of the oil and gas business.
In addition to the 1,357letters of notification filed in the 1950 fiscal
year, 1,159 amendments to these letters of notification were received
and examined and there were 1,844 filings of sales literature to be
used in connection with such offerings.
Of 1,345letters of notification covering completed offerings filed in
the 1950fiscal year, 787 covered proposed offerings of $100,000or less;
218 covered offerings for more than $100,000 and less than $200,000;
and 340 covered offerings of more than $200,000 but not more than
$300,000. Issuing companies made 1,134 of these offerings, stockholders made 199, and both issuers and stockholders joined in making the
remaining 12. Commercial underwriters marketed 398 of the offermgs,
officers and directors or other persons not regularly engaged in the
underwriting business handled 164, and there was no underwriting
of the remaining 803.
The procedure for making an exempt offering under regulation A
is simple. All that is necessary is to file the prescribed letter of notification, and such sales literature as the offeror intends to employ, with
the appropriate regional officeof the Commission five busmess days
before the offering is to be made. In processing by the Commission this
material is examined in the field and reviewed by the staff at the Commission's headquarters. This review involves a search for pertinent
information in the Commission's extensive files and an examination
to determine whether the exemption provided by the regulation is
applicable to the particular case and whether the information filed
discloses any violation of any of the acts administered by the Commission. The results of this review are made available promptly to the
regional office. The Commission also follows the practice of cooperating with the proper local authorities in the States in which the securities are proposed to be offered by furnishing them significant data
about the proposed offering.
Exempt Offerings under Regulation A-M

During the 1950fiscal year the Commission received and examined !)
prospectuses covering an aggregate offering price of $303,122 for assessable shares of mining corporations exempt from registration under
this regulation.
Exempt Offerings under Regulation B

The Commission maintains a specialized unit in its headquarters
officeto administer regulation B and to advise and assist with technical
phases of all offerings of oil and gas securities arising under other provisions of the Securities Act. In addition, the Commission maintains
a petroleum geologist in Tulsa, Okla., who advises the Commission as
to the development of tracts and wells in the Mid-Continent and
Coastal regions. Development has been active in the Rocky Mountains
during the 1950 fiscal year.
The exemption from registration provided by regulation B for
fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights is limited to a maximum aggregate offering price of $100,000. Regulation B requires that

t

an offering sheet be filed with the Commission summarizing pertinent
information regarding the security being offered.
In addition to 136 offerings under regulation A which covered oil
and gas securities, 88 offering sheets and 61 amendments were filed under regulation B during the 1950 fiscal year. The following actions
were taken on these filings:

Oonfidential written reports of sales under regulation B.-Another
function of the Commission in the administration of regulation B
is to determine from confidential written reports of actual sales
that no violations of law occurred in the marketing of oil and gas
securities exempted under this regulation. Such reports are required
to be filed pursuant to rules 320 (a) and 322 (c) and (d) concerning
sales made by broker-dealers to investors and by dealers to other
dealers. During the 1950 fiscal year 1,132 such reports were received
with respect to aggregate sales of $829,875.
Oil and gas investigations.-Most
oil and gas investigations arise
out of complaints received by the Commission. They are conducted
primarily to ascertain whether there has been any violation of section
r>, which requires registration, or of section 17, which prohibits fraud
in securities transactions.
A typical investigation was made in the 1950 fiscal year to determine whether certain claims of profits in sales literature used to sell
oil royalties under regulation B were misleading. The offering circular claimed that the royalties would return a profit of 8 to 12 percent and would be a better investment than most stocks and bonds.
The staff made an extensive study of the total income received from
royalties sold by the offeror under offering sheets relating to as many
as 46 tracts since 1940. Inasmuch as information as to production
and income from these tracts was not a matter of published record,
a large part of the necessary data was obtained from the producer
and the purchaser of the oil. It was found that out of the 46 tracts
under review, only 2 had returned the capital invested, with a profit;
4 should eventually do so, with a modest profit; and of the remaining
40 tracts only a very few can reasonably be expected ever to return
even as much as the capital invested.
The offeror agreed to cease claiming an 8 to 12 percent yield, to
cease comparing any return on these royalties with that available from
stocks and bonds, and to describe his royalties as liquidating assets
the return from which cannot be regarded as profit until the capital
invested has been recovered by the purchaser.

AA""DEXCHANGE

COMMISSION

The Commission instituted 10 new investigations involving oil and
gas securities during the 1950 fiscal year and 23 such cases were closed.
This brought the total pending during the year to 135 and the number
pending at the close of the year to 112. As a result of evidence developed in two cases, the Commission secured injunctions in the courts
restraining violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of
the act. The facts in two other cases were referred to the Department
of Justice for criminal prosecution, in which the Commission cooperated. The conviction of Claude Cleve Alfred in connection with
fraudulent sales of oil securities is mentioned in another section of
this report.
FORMAL ACTION UNDER SECTION 8

The purpose of the Commission's informal procedures in processing
registration statements is to get registration statements which comply
with the requirements of the act before the statements become
effective. In almost all cases conference and comment by letter are
sufficient both for the needs of the registrant and for the adequate
protection of investors. It is sometimes necessary, however, for the
Commission to exercise its powers under section 8 in order to prevent
a reg-istration statement from becoming effective in deficient or misleading form or to suspend the effectiveness of a registration statement
which has already become effective.
Under section 8 (b) the Commission may institute proceedings to
determine whether It should issue an order to prevent a registration
statement from becoming effective. Such proceedings are authorized
if the registration statement as filed is on its face inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect. Under section 8 (d) proceedings may be
instituted at any time to determine whether the Commission should
issue a stop-order to suspend the effectiveness of a registration statement if it appears to the Commission that the registration statement
includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated or otherwise necessary to make the
statements included not misleading. Under section 8 (e) the Commission may make an examination to determine whether to issue a
stop-order under section 8 (d).
Stop-order Proceedings under Section 8 (d)

Two stop order proceedings were pending at the beginning of the
1950 fiscal year and one was instituted during the year under section
8 (d). These cases are described below.
Pan American Gold. Limited. (no personai lialJility)-File No.
2-7603.-This Canadian company filed a registration statement covering 1,983,295of its common shares, $1 par value, to be offered at 45
cents per share and net about $670,500 to the issuer. According to
the registration statement, these proceeds were to be used (1) for the
exploration of a gold mining prospect located in South Dakota,
and (2) for the equipment of a South American gold placer mining
property.
Upon examination the registration statement appeared to contain
materially misleading representations, and in the 1949 fiscal year the
Commission authorized a private examination under section 8 (e) to

SIXTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

13

determine the adequacy and accuracy of certain of these representations and to determine whether stop-order proceedings should be instituted. On the basis of testimony adduced at the examination, stoporder proceedings were instituted. Following these proceedings and
after the registrant filed amendments to the registration statement
which substantially corrected deficiences, the Commission issued its
opinion, deferring issuance of a stop-order pending correction by the
registrant of the remaining deficiencies, at which time the registration
statement could become effective,"
The Commission found that the original registration statement was
materially misleading in numerous respects. The prospectus filed as
a part of the original registration statement contained information
to the effect that the registrant's South Dakota property is located
along the southern border of the famous Homestake Mine. A map,
forming a part of the prospectus, showed what purported to be the
southeasterly "trend" of the Homestake gold ore bodies into and
through the registrant's property. This representation was said to
rest on the authority of United States Geological Survey Atlas Folio
219. The Commission found that the map was not supported by
such folio and that the registrant had no factual basis for portraying
the extension of the Homestake ore bodies into and through its property. The prospectus was amended to omit this unjustifiable claim
and also to delete a report on the property which the Commission held
to be materially inaccurate, inadequate, and misleading. In addition
it was amended to show for the first time that the registrant was aware
of several unfavorable geological reports made after exploratory
drilling.
The South American property of the registrant was described origally in the registration statement as being ready for productive
operation upon installation of mining equipment. The amount of
commercial gravel said to be available for mining was estimated at a
minimum of 5,000,000cubic yards averaging $1 per cubic yard in gold.
The planned rate of production was said to be at least 1,000,000cubic
yards of gravel per year. The registrant stated that it believed that
operations on the property should enable it to obtain steady earning
power from this property. The amended registration statement discloses that the registrant made no investigation of the property, and
has no factual information about the presence, extent, or character of
gravel deposits on the property. The prospectus, as revised, shows
that the registrant intends to test the property as an initial step in
order to determine whether it warrants the installation of machinery
for production. Specifically, it is stated in the revised prospectus:
"If the further exploratory work and shafting as contemplated do not
show sufficient values to justify further development, this property
will be abandoned."
The Maumee Oil Oorporation-File
No. fJ-7976.- This case was completed during the 1950fiscal year although instituted previously. The
company was incorporated in Ohio on July 30, 1947 and on May 11,

value common stock to be offered at $100 a share. Its assets consisted

SECURITIES A!\'D EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of assignments of oil and gas leases and an undivided one-half interest
in four wells (two of which were not productive) in the Beddo field in
the vicinity of Ballinger, Runnels County, Tex. A.fter examination
of the registration statement, stop-order proceedings were instituted
on May 27, 1949.
From information developed at the hearing it appeared that the
registration statement failed to disclose that the Beddo field was an
inferior field which seldom, if ever, marketed more than 60 percent
of its allowable production, and often much less, and that the number
of dry holes in the field exceeded the number of producing wells. The
registration statement also failed to provide adequate information
with respect to the wells in which the registrant had an interest. The
prospectus stated that two of the four wells were unproductive, but
it failed to state that the other two producing wells had no reasonable
chance of profitable production and were bemg operated on a day to
day basis only because this was more economical than to abandon them.
At the time the registration statement was filed the registrant was
in possession of two reports from geologists which indicated that, at
best, only 5 percent of the registrant's acreage had a reasonable chance
to produce oil in any amount. The Commission held that in such
circumstances, where there had been significant exploration in the area
indicating that the possibilities of success were extremely remote, it
was misleading to imply a fair chance of profit by describing the
offering as "speculative," or to state or imply that the area in which
the registrant's properties were located had not been proved, or that
the registrant's own acreage should be regarded as unproved. As
to the registrant's plan for new drilling, to be financed with proceeds
from the sale of the securities sought to be registered, it was held
misleading for the registrant to characterize the projected wells as
"exploratory" without disclosing the information in its possession
indicating that since the projected wells were to be located in the
vicinity of its existing unprofitable wells there was no reasonable
factual basis for an expectation that new wells would be better than
the existing wells.
The registration statement and prospectus failed to name Eldrid~e
S. Price as a promoter although required to do so by the Commission's rules, and to provide a fair disclosure of the registrant's dealings with him. Price, although not an officer,director, or stockholder,
sold assignments of oil and gas leases on some 2,677 acres of his holdings in Runnels County, Tex., to the persons who became the original
shareholders of the company. Price received about $290,340, about
92 percent of all the money obtained by the registrant from the sale
of securities. The original amount paid to Price was $43.75 an acre,
but this was later raised to $100 although Price was apparently at the
same time acquiring additional acreage for about $1 per acre.
The Commission's opinion mentions other omissions and inconsistencies in the registration statement relating to such matters as
the amount of the offering, the liability of certain shareholders for
assessment, the business experience of officers, inaccurate financial
statements, and the failure to file material exhibits." At the close of

respects, challenging 19 items specifically, instituted stop-order proceedings during the 1950 fiscal year that were still pending at the

DEFICIENCIES

DISCOVERED

IN EXAMINATION
STATEMENTS

OF REGISTRATION

The examination of registration statements during the waiting
period brings to light many deficiencies in the registration statements
which would, if undiscovered, be published and furnished to investors.
These are sometimes corrected; often they are of such material character that the statements are withdrawn on discovery of the deficiency.
The following are examples of deficiencies discovered in examination
of registration statements.
Overstated Oil Reserves

An oil-producing company filed a registration statement covering
$2,937,254 of 4% percent senior cumulative interest debentures, due
January 1, 1965; $1,147,150of 5 percent junior income debentures, due
January 1, 1970; 30,500 shares of $5 cumulative class A preferred
stock, no par; 51,000 shares of $5 cumulative class B preferred stock,
no par; and 2,000 shares of common stock, no par.
Prior to the formation of the company, the promoters of its predecessors had sold working interests in oil leases, in which the promoters
retained overriding royalties, to some 350 investors in and around
Boston. These royalties and other assets were subsequently conveyed
to the company by the promoters. The company appears to have been
continuously short of working capital although, in addition to substantial loans from insurance companies and banks, it had received
additional funds from a syndicate composed of some of the original
investors in the leases. A plan of reorganization was devised which
provided for: (1) A large loan from the RFC; (2) the acquisition
of additional 011 properties; (3) the repayment of part of the outstanding loans; and (4) payments in cash and new securities for the
properties owned and to be acquired. The Commission determined
that the proposed offering of debentures, preferred stock, and common
stock, in addition to cash, to the 350 investors was a public offering
and required the filing of a registration statement.
It became apparent upon review by the Commission of the reports
prepared by various petroleum engineers in respect of the company's
oil and gas reserves, and after conference with such engineers, that
11

16

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the reserve estimates were too high, that upon a reasonable estimate
of these reserves there was no present value behind the securities proposed to be offered, and that the prospects of any future values were
remote and contingent.
Consequently the company proposed, in lieu
of furnishing an estimate of oil and gas reserves in the registration
statement, to state the fact that the securities being offered were without present value and of extremely remote and contingent future value,
and also to make a more detailed statement of such facts on the second

furnishing to prospective purchasers in a readily understandable form
the ultimate conclusion as to the effect of the factors of value-such as
the estimated amount of reserves, the dollar value of oil, lifting costs,
and rate of extractions-instead
of a mere itemization of these factors
themselves.
Understatement of Liability

The adoption of pension plans during the year presented new problems to some registrants as in the case of a registrant which adopted a
5-year plan to become effective on a date within an interim period for
which unaudited financial statements were furnished as permitted by
the rules. The company's financial statements filed with the Commission included a charge to profit and loss for the interim period pro~>ortionate to the total estimated cost for the 5-year period with an equivalent amount reflected in the balance sheet as a liability.
Examination
of the plan indicated that in the first year a much larger number of
employees would be eligible under the plan than in the succeeding
years due to the fact that all employees over the required age and term
of service for eligibility could claim their pension rights immediately,
although not all of them were expected to do so. When this feature
was called to the attention of the registrant the financial statements
were amended to increase the liability shown in the balance sheet under
the pension plan from the previous estimate of approximately $500,000
to $2,000,000, of which $400,000 was classified as current.
The previously determined accrual was charged to profit and loss and the remaining $1,500,000 was set up as a deferred charge to be allocated against
future operations.
A comprehensive footnote described the pension
plan and indicated that the liability included in the balance sheet was
based upon the best indication at the date of filing of the intention of
eligible employees to retire within the terms of the plan.
Restatement of Reserves

A company filing a registration statement covering 76,983 shares
preferred stock owned several old established operating mining companies, which followed a widespread
practice of making no provision for depletion of their mining properties. However, in its latest balance sheet accompanying the registration statement the parent company reflected a reserve for contmgencies amounting to $4,000,000, created by a charge to earned surplus
"for the eventual write-off of its investment direct or indirect in mining property upon the exhaustion of any such property." It al?peared
to the staff that one of the mines, the mining property of which was
carried at $4,388,410, was practically in a salvage status. The reserve,
previously described as a contingency reserve, was thereafter changed
of 4% percent cumulative

SIXTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

17

to "Reserve for exhaustion of mining property," and shown in the
company balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying value of the
investments in the mining companies and in the consolidated balance
sheet as a deduction from the carrying value of mining property. In
each case, the carrying value was thereby reduced $4,000,000 thus
giving unambiguous recognition to the status at the balance sheet
date, which in the original filing could be determined only by a very
careful reading of pertinent parts of the text of the prospectus.
A significant amendment to the prospectus was also obtained in
view of the indications in the text that one of the principal mines of
the company was practically exhausted. The summary of earnings
was amended to call attention to the present status of the company's
principal revenue-producing mine.
Statement of Potential Profits

A company in the promotional stage included in its prospectus a
statement indicating the company's estimate of annual production in
units of the items to be manufactured and gave the estimated factor
prices of the units, so that a gross sales estimate could have been calculated by a prospective investor. The estimated annual cost of operations was given in round figures, with a minimum of detail, and omitting certain important elements of cost such as depreciation, maintenance, repairs, and rents. The over-all effect was to imply that substantial profits might be realized by the company, despite the disclaimer contained in the prospectus to the effect that the company
could not assure the rate of production upon which the estimates were
based or that the prices quoted would be received for the product.
When these uncertainties were pointed out the registrant deleted those
elements of the presentation which provided the basis for possible
misleading calculations of profit.
Failure to Disclose History and Risks Involved

A company, organized in 1947 as the successor to companies which
have been engaged since 1945 in developing a small automobile, filed
a registration statement on May 10, 1949 covering 5,000,000shares of
co:m,monstock to be offered to the public at $1 per share through an
underwriter pursuant to a "best efforts" arrangement. The prospectus
stated that the registrant's first product was to be a station wagon.
As a result of inadequacies cited by the staff in its letter of comment,
the prospectus was extensively revised and disclosed, among other
things, that: (1) None of the registrant's 18 existing model cars met
the exact specifications proposed for the car to be built, and additional
testing was required which might result in substantial design changes,
increased preproduction expense, and production delays; (2) the
registrant and its predecessors in the period from October 8, 1945 to
June 30, 1949 had received $2,271,482 in cash, including $1,476,633
for dealer and distributor franchise fees, and had paid out $2,150,198,
including $656,351 for salaries and wages; (3) the registrant's balance sheet at June 30, 1949 showed assets in excess of liabilities of
only $12,026; (4) the registrant's cost estimates and production plans
were predicated upon the attainment of an annual production and
sales volume which represented approximately 70 percent of the entire

price of the car, in which event it might be difficult, or impossible, to
overcome the resultant competitive disadvantages; and (6) there was
no provision for the return of funds to the purchasers of the stock if
the registrant were unable to sell all the shares being offered and carry
out its plans. The registration statement as amended became effective
October 3, 1949.
On February 17, 1950, the registrant filed a petition for reorganization pursuant to chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, and was declared
bankrupt May 19, 1950. No shares covered by the registration statement had been sold.
Questionable Selling Activities

A registration statement of a Montana corporation, proposing to
engage in the manufacture and sale of ground wood pulp, became effective in August 1949. The corporation was in the promotional stage,
its tangible assets consisting of a plant site in Montana and about
$150,000obtained from the sale of securities in Montana several years
before. The registration statement included a report of a forestry
expert which indicated that the best source of timber for the project
would be in Montana, north of the plant site. Shortly after the registration statement became effective, it was learned that the corporation
was receiving extensive publicity in the Idaho-Washington area about
a proposed purchase of land in Idaho for the purpose of constructing
a paper and pulp plant there. Investigation by the Commission's
regional officerevealed that the land had been purchased and, moreover, that the corporation had been making sales of stock in Montana
without using a prospectus required by the Securities Act and without
a proper license from the State of Montana.
Following this investigation, the corporation filed an amended
prospectus which referred to the purchase of land in Idaho, implying
that it might be used for timber-storage purposes and justifying the
purchase on the grounds that funds for that purpose had not been
obtained from its offering of registered securities. The corporation
was requested to reconcile the proposed use of the Idaho property with
the above-mentioned report of its forestry expert, and to point out in
the prospectus that the use of funds in Idaho was not consistent with
representations made in selling literature employed in the original
sale of securities in Montana, namely that all proceeds would be used
to construct a plant in Montana. The registrant canceled its agreement to purchase the Idaho property and offered to make rescission
to all purchasers of stock who had not received a proper prospectus.

and interest, by the International Bank tor Reconstruction and Development. However. the bank is required to file with the Commission
such annual and other reports with respect to such securities as the
Commission shall determine to be appropriate, in view of the special
character of the bank and its operations. and necessary in the public
interest and for the protection of investors. The Commission has
heretofore expressed its opinion that an exemption is available under
the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
New rules and regulations were adopted on January 9, 1950,designated regulation BW, to require the bank to file with the Commission
substantially the same information, documents, and reports as would
be required if the bank had securities registered under the Secruities
Exchange Act of 1934. The bank is required also to file a report with
the Commission not less than 7 days prior to the date on which any
of its primary obligations are sold to the public in the United States.
This report and the periodic reports filed make available at the Commission information quite similar to the information which would
be required in a registration statement under the Securities Act of
1933. This carries out the intention which the Commission expressed
to the Congress when the amendment to the Bretton 'V"oodsAgreement Act was under consideration.
The Commission announced at the same time that it was informed
by the hank that no public offering of securities guaranteed by the
bank was presently contemplated." Accordingly, the new rules, insofar as they require the reporting of the proposed public sale of securities, were limited to the sale of primary obligations of the bank.
The Commission at the same time rescinded certain rules previously
adopted under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934with particular reference to the bank.
Regulation A-Ge'fleral eeem.ption. for emall i88ue8.-Three amendments to regulation A, which provides an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for certain small issues, were adopted by
the Commission during the 1950fiscal year."
The first of these amendments raised from $100,000to $300,000the
amount of the aggregate offering price of securities which may be
offered by the estate of a deceased person for the purpose of paying
taxes or other expenses of the estate. There are situations in which
the deceased person did not stand in a control relation with the issuer
but in which the executor or administrator (because of direct or indirect holdings of his own) does stand in such a relationship and would
be prevented from selling without registration. The enlarged exemption is available, however, only if the deceased person was not in a
control relationship with the issuer and would not have been required
to register the securities if the offering had been made by him prior
to his death.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The second amendment is intended to prevent the commencement
or continuance of the sale of securities under regulation A during the
pendency of injunction proceedings instituted by the Commission.
Under a literal construction of the rule previously in effect, a person
who had filed a letter of notification under which a portion of the
securities thereby qualified remained unsold might continue to sell
(insofar as the rule was concerned) such securities without registration despite the pendency of an action instituted by the Commission
to enjoin the issuer or other person affiliated with the issuer from
engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with
the sale of any security of such issuer.
It is obviously inconsistent with the Commission's action in securing
an injunction to prevent violations of the act to continue in effect a
discretionary exemption which might tend to a substantial degree to
nullify the relief being sought.
The third amendment makes it clear that the maximum aggregate
amount of securities which may be sold under regulation A in any 12month period is $300,000 in actual gross proceeds from the public.
The amendment was made to correct an erroneous impression in some
quarters that if the initial offering price did not exceed that amount,
the entire offering might be sold for an actual aggregate price to the
public exceeding $300,000.
LITIGATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
The bulk of litigation in connection with the enforcement of the
Securities Act deals with persons who fail to register securities before
offering them to the public as required by section 5 and persons who
make fraudulent security sales in violation of section 17. Violations
of section 5 deprive the public of information essential to intelligent
investing and violations of section 17 involve outright deception of
public investors. In either situation, maximum protection is afforded
to the public by enjoining further sales. For this reason, it is customary for the Commission to enjoin t~e illegal activities promptly,
even though criminal action may be instituted later.
Some cases involve violations of both sections of the act; some include also violations of other acts administered by the Commission,
particularly the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which contains
antifraud provisions.
During the course of the year the Commission obtained temporary
or permanent injunctions against further violations of section 5 in
cases involving sales of securities of mining companies,H oil and gas
corporations," and other types of business." As in the past, some

of the securities sold were not in conventional form. For example,
the Chinchilla Chateau case 11 promoters offered unregistered investment contracts evidenced by purchase agreements for among other
things, pairs of live chinchillas.
Some of the recurring types of misrepresentation are illustrated in
the following cases. In S. E. O. v. Helcolicon Mines, t-»; et
the
court enjoined further sales of the stock of Helcolicon Mines upon a
showing that the individual defendants had falsely represented,
among other things, that tests in an area covered by the company's
mining claims had established the existence of gold in sufficientquantities and value to justify large-scale operations and that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and certain banks in Alaska had agreed
to participate in production loans to the company aggregating
$1,000,000as soon as minerals in the ground covered by its claims had
been evaluated to the extent of $2,000,000. In S. E. O. v. (Iharles A.
Howe and Maryland-Nevada Operating 00., Ino.,19 defendants were
enjoined from violating both sections 5 and 17 of the act on the basis
of a complaint charging that, in order to sell investment contracts,
they falsely stated that they intended to operate certain mining equipment to recover, by using a special process, commercially valuable
gold from about 100 miles of beach on the west coast of California.
S. E. O. v. Diamonds db Metals Exploration 00., Lnc., et aUo was
another mining case where the defendants were enjoined from violations of both sections 5 and 17 of the act. Violation of both sections
were also enjoined in several oil promotions during the past year."
An injunction was issued in S. E. O. v. Empire Insurance Agenoy
and. J elf B. Burleson 22 upon a complaint that the defendants made
untrue statements with respect to the amount of stock of the corporate
defendant subscribed during the first week of public offering, with
respect to the retention of a sizable surplus after paying a dividend
and with respect to leases entered into for occupancy of a building to
be constructed.

which a broker-dealer who had formerly operated as a sole proprietor
attempted to continue his business in corporate form by selling the
corporation's stock to the public. No section 5 violation was charged
because a letter of notification had been filed pursuant to the requirements of the Commission's rules relating to the exemption of small
offerings. But the complaint alleged that in the course of sales of
stock there were many violations of section 17. Among them were
failure to disclose the existence of substantial operating deficits and
the fact that dividends had been paid out of capital surplus contributed
by investors in the stock; falsely representing that the corporation
was earning money when it was actually losing money; and appropriating customers' cash and securities without their knowledge or
consent and substituting the stock of Mercer Hicks Corp. Subsequent
to the close of the fiscal year a preliminary injunction was obtained
by the Commission. The Commission also requested the appointment
of a receiver but withdrew its motion when a receiver was appointed
under the New York Martin Act.
As an aid to its investigative function, the Commission often finds
it necessary to subpena witnesses or their records. If Commission
subpenas are resisted the Commission applies to the courts for an order
directing the production of the witnesses or documents. Two cases
during the past year arose out of such applications to the court. They
were S. E. O. v. Ooeur D'Alene Uonsolidated Silver-Lead Mines, Inc.

PART II
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE
ACT OF 1934
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is designed to eliminate fraud,
manipulation, and other abuses in the trading of securities both on the
organized exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets, which together constitute the Nation's facilities for trading in securities; to
make available to the public information regarding the condition of
corporations whose securities are listed on any national securities exchange; to provide for the regulation of proxies respecting listed
securities; and to regulate the use of the Nation's credit in securities
trading. The authority to issue rules on the use of credit in securities transactions is lodged in the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, but the administration of these rules and of the other
provisions of the act is vested in the Commission.
The act provides for the registration of national securities exchanges,
brokers, and dealers in securities, and associations of brokers and
dealers.
REGULATION OF EXCHANGES AND EXCHANGE TRADING
Registration and Exemption of Exchanges

Section 5 of the act requires each securities exchange within the
United States or subject to its jurisdiction to register with the Commission as a national securities exchange or to apply for exemption
from such registration.
Exemption from registration may be granted
to an exchange which has such a limited volume of transactions effected
thereon that, in the opinion of the Commission, it is not practicable and
not necessary pI' appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors to require its registration.
At the close of the 1950 fiscal year the following 16 exchanges were
registered as national securities exchanges:
Boston Stock Exchange
Chicago Board of Trade
Cincinnati Stock Exchange
Detroit Stock Exchange
Los Angeles Stock Exchange
Midwest Stock Exchange
New Orleans Stock Exchange
New York Curb Exchange

New York Stock Exchange
Phtladelphia-Baltimoro Stock ExcIJallge
Pittsburgh Stock E!x:change
Salt Lake Stock Exchange
San Francisco Mining Exchange
San Francisco Stock Exchange
Spokane Stock Exchange
Washington Stock Exchange

Four exchanges were exempted from registration at the close of the
1950 fiscal year. These were:
Colorado Springs Stock Exchange
Honolulu Stock Exchange

Richmond Stock Exchange
Wheeling Stock Exchange

In the latter part of 1!).f\), the Chicago, Cleveland, and St. Louis
Stock Exchanges, all registered national securities exchanges, and the
Minneapolis:St. Paul Stock Exchange, an exempted exchange, entered
23

24

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

into an agreement providing for the consolidation of their membership and operations. The plan of consolidation became effective on
December 1, 1949, and provided that the Chicago Stock Exchange
would have the status of a continuing exchange with its name changed
to the Midwest Stock Exchange. Accordingly, the registration of the
Chicago Stock Exchange as a national securities exchange continued
in effect for the new Midwest Stock Exchange; the other three exchanges were liquidated and the registration of the Cleveland and
St. Louis Stock Exchanges and the exemption of the Minneapolis-St.
Paul Stock Exchange were withdrawn. A majority of the members
of the three liquidated exchanges acquired membership in the Midwest Stock Exchange, and a majority of the issuers of securities listed
on such exchanges transferred their listing and registration to the new
exchange. Headquarters of the Midwest Stock Exchange is in the
city of Chicago, and branches have been opened in the cities of Cleveland and St. Louis. These branches are connected directly with the
exchange floor in Chicago by private duplex teletype and buy and sell
orders are transmitted from the branches over these wires to Chicago.
These two branches serve also as local clearing officesfor receipt and
delivery between member firms, in their respective cities, of items
which have been processed through the clearance department in Chicago. Thus, member brokers in branch office cities, as well as those
in other cities using the clearing-by-mail plan (an innovation developed by the Chicago Stock Exchange during the past several years)
are able to handle their own orders without the intermediary services
of a Chicago correspondent clearing house member firm. The consolidation was intended to enlarge and broaden markets in the Midwest for stockholders in that section of the country.
Effective January 1, 1950, the Commission revised its forms and
rules pertaining to the registration and exemption of exchanges.'
The purpose of the revision was to simplify the application for registration as a national securities exchange, or for exemption from such
registration, and to reduce the number of formal amendments required to be filed in keeping the information contained in such an application up to date. As in the previous form, the revised form of
application requires an exchange to furnish information about its
organization, rules of procedure, trading practices, membership requirements, and related matters. The revised application has eliminated the need for an exchange to duplicate in the statement, which is
part of the application, many items of information which experience
has shown are furnished in its constitution and rules filed as an exhibit to the application. Under the revised procedure an exchange
ordinarily will be required to file a formal amendment only once each
year. Changes effected during the year are to be reported by an exchange either by letter or by the filing of copies of notices made generally available to its members. In view of the substantial number of
amendments which had been filed by each exchange to its original
application in 1934, the Commission requested each registered and
exempted exchange to file as an amendment a complete new application on the revised form prior to June 30, 1950.

Securities Exchange Act release No•• 883.

SIXTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

25

Including the amendments containing the revised applications, the
exchanges filed a total of 50 amendments during the fiscal year. 'Vhile
many of these amendments contained only periodic information required by the rules, such as membership lists, names of officers and
directors of the exchange and financial statements of the exchange
many other changes relating to the internal operations of the exchanges also were reflected in these amendments. Each amendment
was reviewed to ascertain whether the changes reflected therein were
in the public interest and complied with the provisions of the act. The
nature of the changes effected in the exchanges' rules and trading practices varied considerably; some of the more significant changes occurring during the fiscal year are briefly outlined below:
Boston Stock Exchange amended its rules relating to the execution
of odd-lot orders in securities having a primary market on another
exchange. The amendment provides that unless otherwise specifically
requested such orders involving less than five shares would be filled on
the basis of the last reported round-lot transaction occurring on the
exchange on which the primary market for the security exists. Previously all odd-lot orders were required to be executed on the basis of
the next round-lot transaction occurring on the primary exchange.
Cincinnati Stock Exchange amended its rules with respect to the
execution of odd-lot orders in securities dually traded on that exchange
and either the New York Stock or New York Curb Exchange, to permit the execution of such orders on a round lot sale occurring on the
Cincinnati Stock Exchange, subject to certain conditions. Previously
all odd-lot orders in such securities were required to be executed on an
appropriate round-lot sale occurring on a New York exchange.
Detroit Stock Exchange amended its rules to permit members to
transact business for nonmembers who are members of the National
Association of Security Dealers, Inc., at a commission rate of not less
than 60 percent of the usual minimum nonmember commission rates.
This follows a procedure adopted by several west coast exchanges
some years ago.
Boston, New York, and San Francisco Stock Exchanges and New
York Curb Exchange amended their rules to permit registered employees of members to be compensated on a commission basis as well as
on a salary basis.
New York Stock Exchange amended its constitution to provide for
an increase in the size of its board of governors and to change the
composition thereof. This exchange also adopted new general qualifications for the listing of securities. It revised its schedule of listing
fees and discontinued the optional method of permitting issuers to pay
the listing fee for additional shares on a lump-sum basis rather than
on an annual continuing fee basis. Its board of governors approved
and submitted to the membership for vote a proposed general amendment to its constitution to provide for the permissive incorporation of
members firms and the admission of corporations, under prescribed
restrictions, as member corporations. The proposed amendment was
disapproved by the membership.
After conferences between New York Stock Exchange and members
of the Commission's staff, the exchange again modified its floor-trading
rules which had been originally adopted in 1945. Shortly thereafter,

26

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

New York Curb Exchange revised its floor trading rules to conform
with those of New York Stock Exchange. The revised rules removed
certain restrictions on floor traders' purchases at prices below the previous day's close and permitted a limited amount of purchases above
the last sale price even if this purchase price exceeded the previous
day's close. Some restriction was placed for the first time on the
number of purchases a floor trader could effect on his bid at rising
prices. These exchanges also adopted a rule forbidding floor traders
from congregating in or dominating the market.
Disciplinary

Actions by Exchanges

Against Members

Each national securities exchange, pursuant to a request of the
Commission, reports to the Commission any action of a disciplinary
nature taken by it against any of its members or against any partner
or employee of a member for violation of the Securities Exchange Act
of any rule or regulation thereunder, or of any exchange rule. During
the past fiscal year five exchanges reported taking disciplinary action
against 25 members, member firms, and partners of member firms.
The nature of the actions reported included fines ranging from $25
to $1,000in seven cases, with total fines aggregating $2,375; suspension
of an individual from exchange membership; censure of individuals
or firms for infractions of the rules, and warnings against further violations. The disciplinary actions resulted from violations of exchange
rules, principally those pertaining to capital requirements, floor trading, partnership agreements, and handling of customers' accounts.
REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES
Purpose

and Nature of Registration

Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act forbids trading in any
security on a national securities exchange unless the security is registered or exempt from registration. The purpose of this provision
is to make available to investors reliable and comprehensive information regarding the affairs of the issuing company by requiring an
issuer to file with the Commission and the exchange an application for
registration disclosing pertinent information regarding the issuer
and its securities. A companion provision contained in section 13 of
the act requires the filing of annual, quarterly, and other periodic
reports to keep this information up to date. These applications and
reports must be filed on forms prescribed by the Commission as appropriate to the class of issuer or security involved.
Examination

of Applications

and Reports

All applications and reports filed pursuant to sections 12 and 13 are
examined by the staff to determine whether accurate and adequate
disclosure has been made of the specific types of information required
by the act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The
examination under the Securities Exchange Act, like that under the
Securities Act of 1933, does not involve an appraisal and is not concerned with the merits of the registrant's securities. When examination of an application or a report discloses that material information
has been omitted, or that sound principles have not been followed

SIXTEEKTH

AXKUAL REPORT

27

in the preparation and presentation of accompanying financial data,
the examining staff follows much the same procedure as that developed
in its work under the Securities Act in sending to the registrant a letter
of comment, or in holding a conference with its attorneys or accountants or other representatives, pointing out any inadequacies in the
information filed in order that necessary correcting amendments may
be obtained. Here again, amendments are examined in the same manner as the original documents. Where a particular inadequacy is not
material, the registrant is notified by letter pointing out the defect and
suggesting the proper procedure to be followed in the preparation and
filing of future reports, without insistence upon the filing of an amendment to the particular document in question.
Examination of financial data-Applications
and reports are examined to make sure that sound accounting principles have been followed
in the presentation of accompanying financial data. At times extensive revisions become necessary. An example of accounting for fixed
assets and depreciation arose during the year in connection with the
financial statements of a large public utility holding company. The
Division of Corporation Finance had commented to the effect that th«
accountants' certificate, which included the phrase "subject to the
adequacy of the companies' provisions for property retirement as to
which we are not in a position to express an opinion" was unsatisfactory under the Comrnission's rules. The company responded that its
auditors were in the process of making comprehensive studies of the
situation and that amendments could not be made until these studies
were completed. In due course a conference was arranged with the
staff of the division in which officers of the company, accompanied
by their accountants and counsel, reported on the results of this study
of the property and provisions for its retirement. Consequently the
company effected a change in property retirement reserve appropriations and accumulated reserves, which resulted in an increase in the
reserve balances of $18,793,528, of which $17,152,641 was charged
to surplus and $1,640,887 to current profit and loss. Thereupon the
registrant filed amended financial statements in accord with this
change.
In its 1948 annual report another registrant, engaged in paint and
chemicals manufacturing, set up a reserve of $750,000on the liability
side of the balance sheet with a corresponding charge to earned surplus, to provide for an indicated loss on sale of its investment in a subsidiary company at approximately $750,000less than the book value of
the investment on the parent's books.
Since the reserve was clearly a valuation reserve, the Division of
Corporation Finance requested that it be deducted from the investment account on the asset side of the balance sheet i and, since the
charge was clearly a loss recognized in the year, the division requested
that it be included in the profit and loss statement rather than earned
surplus. The financial statements were amended, showing an increase
from $555,920.64to $1,305,920.64in consolidated net loss for the year.
The sale was consummated in 1949 at an aggregate loss of $859,138.60
or $109,138.60in excess of the $750,000reserve provided in 1948.
Coordination. of annual reports to stockholders and filings ioith. the
Oommission.-Financial
statements filed during the year revealed an

28

SECUlHTIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

increasing trend toward the use of the same basic statements (balance
sheet, income and surplus statements) in the annual reports to the
Commission and in the companies' published annual reports to stockholders. The rules of the Commission permit the filing of the report to
stockholders to meet the financial statement requirements of the Form
1Q-K annual report to the Commission insofar as the former substantially complies with the provisions of the latter form. A current example of this growing practice, which avoids duplication of reporting,
may be found in the Form 1Q-K for the fiscal year ended June 30,1949
of the Colorado Fuel & Iron Corp. and subsidiary companies in which
the annual report to stockholders, when supplemented by schedules
not included in the published report and covered by a signed certificate
of the independent accountants, met the requirements of the form in all
material respects.
Statistics of Securities Registered on Exchanges

At the close of the 1950 fiscal year, 2,128 issuers had 3,544 security
issues listed and registered on national securities exchanges. These
securities consisted of 2,573 stock issues aggregating 3,147,684,318
shares, and 971 bond issues aggregating $20,898,718,791 in principal
amount. This represents increases of 182,312,982 shares and $121,419,744 in principal amount, respectively, over the aggregate amounts
of securities listed and registered on national securities exchanges at
the close of the 1949 fiscal year. The following table shows the number
of applications and reports filed during the fiscal year in connection
with the registration of securities on national securities exchanges:

During the 1950 fiscal year 49 new issuers registered securities under
the Securities Exchange Act on national securities exchanges, and the
registration of all securities of 61 issuers was terminated, principally
by reason of retirement and redemption and through mergers and consolidations.
Included in these 61 issuers are 16 whose securities were
removed from registration by reason of the termination of the registration of the Cleveland and St. Louis Stock Exchanges on December
1, 1949, such issuers having determined not to transfer the registration
of their securities to the Midwest Stock Exchange.

effected on an exchange in such substituted or additional securities
pending their registration or admission to unlisted trading privileges
on an exchange.
The exchanges filed notifications of admission to trading under this
rule with respect to 118 issues during the year. In some instances,
the same issue was admitted to trading on more than one exchange,
so that the total admissions to such trading, including duplications,
numbered 211.
Special Offerings on Exchanges

Rule X-10B-2 under the Securities Exchange Act permits special
offerings of large blocks of securities to be made on a national securities exchange provided such offerings are effected pursuant to a plan
which has been filed with and approved by the Commission. A security may be the subject of a special offering when it has been determined
that the auction market on the floor of the exchange cannot absorb a
particular block within a reasonable period of time without undue
disturbance to the current price of the security. A special offering of
a security is made at a fixed price consistent with the existing auction
market price of the security, and members acting as brokers for public
buyers are paid a special commission by the seller which ordinarily
exceeds the regular brokerage commission. Buyers of the security
are not charged any commission on their purchases and obtain the
security at the net price of the offering.
Since February 6, 1942, the date on which rule X-10B-2 was
amended to permit special offerings, the Commission has declared
effective special offering plans of the following nine exchanges on the
date shown opposite each:
New York Stock Exchange

Formerly the Chicago Stock Exchange; name changed Dec. 1, 1949.

During the past year the New York Stock Exchange, New York
Curb Exchange, and San Francisco Stock Exchange each submitted
to the Commission proposed amendments to their special offering
plans, and the Commission declared effective, for an experimental
period ending December 30, 1950, the amended plans of each of these
exchanges. The purposes of the amendments to the special offering
plans of these exchanges were: (1) To permit the offeror to allot on
a firm basis, to member firms engaged in the distributing business,
not more than 50 percent of the securities involved in the offering. Up
to this time when buy orders in a special offering exceeded the amount
of the offering the entire amount of the offered securities was required
to be allocated in reasonably proportionate amounts. Under the
amendment only those shares not allotted to member firms on a firm
basis must be allocated. (2) To permit members and member firms
to retain the special commission applicable to securities received under

30

SECURITIES

A:I\"'DEXCHANGE

COMMIESION

a firm allotment for the bona fide purpose of distribution even though
their efforts to distribute such securities are unsuccessful. Under the
old plans members and member firms were prohibited from retaining
any part of the special commission in connection with purchases for
their own account. This modification is designed to supplement and
give effect to the provisions of the amendment mentioned under (1)
above. (3) To provide that the special commission may not be less
than a regular single nonmember commission based upon the per share
rate of 100 shares at the price of the special offering. (4) To make
it permissive rather than mandatory that certain specified factors be
taken into consideration by the exchanges in determining whether a
particular block of securities may be made the subject of a special
offering. This will give the exchanges a certain administrative discretion in determining whether to permit the use of exchange facilities
for a special offering. This amendment also reduces from 6 months
to 1 month the period of time during which price range and volume of
transactions in the particular security must be considered in making
the necessary determination.
Each exchange with a special-offering plan in effect has been requested to report certain information to the Commission on each
offering effected on the exchange under the plan. Such reports showed
a total of 29 offerings effected on the New York Stock Exchange and
New York Curb Exchange during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1950.
These offerings involved the sale of 430,955 shares of stock with an
aggregate market value of $11,129,000and ranging in market value
from $40,400to $1,293,800. Special commissions paid to brokers participating in these 29 offerings totaled $266,000. By comparison, in
the preceding fiscal year a total of 25 offerings involving 263,700shares
of stock having a market value of $5,750,000 were effected on five
exchanges, with special commissions paid to brokers totaling $161,000.
Further details of special offerings during the year are' given in appendix table 10.
During the period February 19, 1942 throuzh June 30,1950, a total
of 435 offerings have been effected. These o1ferings totaled 5,346,855
shares with a market value of $155,464,000and brokers have been paid
special commissions totaling $3,081,800.
Secondary Distributions Approved by Exchanges

A "secondary distribution," as the term is used in this section, is a
distribution over-the-counter by a dealer 01' group of dealers of a comparatively large block of a J?reviously issued and outstanding security
listed 01' admitted to trading on an exchange. Such distributions
take place when it has been determined that it would not be in the best
interest of the various parties involved to sell the shares on the exchange in the regular way or by special offering. The distributions
generally take place after the close of exchange trading. As in the
case of special offerings, buyers obtain the security from the dealer
at the net price of the offering, which usually is at or below the most
recent price registered on the exchange. It is generally the practice
of exchanges to require members to obtain the approval of the exchange
before participating in such secondary distributions.

SIXTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1950, 5 exchanges reported
having approved a total of 78 secondary distributions under which
3,705,320shares of stock with a market value of $99,077,000were sold.
Further details of secondary distributions of exchange stocks are given
in appendix table 11.
Termination of Registration Under Section 19 (a) (2)

Where it is found that the issuer of any security registered on an
exchange has failed to comply with any applicable provision of the
Securities Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, the
Commission has authority under Section 19 (a) (2) of the act, after
appropriate notice and opportunity for hearmg, to deny, to suspend
the effective date of, to suspend for a period of not exceeding 12months,
or to withdraw the registration of that security.
The Commission has little occasion to resort to formal action under
this authority, and no such proceedings were instituted during the 1950
fiscal year. However, as noted in the fifteenth annual report, page 38,
proceedings were pending in one case at the beginning of the year.
This case involved the registration of Barnhart-Morrow consolidated
common capital stock $1 par value on the Los Angeles Stock Exchange.
After successive postponements of the hearings at the request of the
exchange and the issuer, the registrant filed, in connection with its
annual reports required under the law, amended financial statements
for the years 1945, 1946, 1947, and 1948, satisfactorily correcting the
deficiencies cited. As a result the Commission dismissed the proceedings.
As originally filed, the balance sheets of the company for those
dates had included under "Intangible assets" an item of about $219,000
captioned "Capital stock issued for services and leases." This represented capital stock issued to the two organizers of the company
for alleged services and for a lease interest acquired from the organizers but abandoned and quit-claimed by the company to the lessor in
1927. Furthermore, the company had been in receivership from 1931
to 1936. After objection was made by the staff to inclusion of the
$219,000 item it was deducted from the common stock account.
Unlisted Trading Privileges on Exchanges

A security, unless exempted, which is not registered on a national
securities exchange under section 12 (b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, may not be traded on such exchanges unless unlisted
trading privileges are available under section 12 (f) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.
Section 12 (f) provides that upon application to and approval by
the Commission a national securities exchange may: (1) continue
unlisted trading privileges to which a security had been admitted
on such exchange prior to March 1, 1934; (2) under certain conditions extend unlisted trading privileges to any security duly listed
and registered on any other national securities exchange; or (3)
extend unlisted trading privileges to any security in respect of which
there is available from a registration statement and periodic reports
or other data filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the

32

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Securities Act of 1933, information substantially equivalent to that
filed in respect of a security duly listed and registered on a national
securities exchange. The statute requires that appropriate notice be
issued and an opportunity for hearing provided, and that the applicant exchange establish to the satisfaction of the Commission that
there exists m the vicinity of that exchange sufficiently widespread
public distribution and sufficient public trading activity in the security
to render the extension of unlisted trading privileges on that exchange
necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection
of investors.

The first grant of an application by an exchange under section
12 (f) (2) for unlisted tradmg in stocks listed on some other registered exchange was in April, 1937. There have been 692 admissions
of such stocks to the various exchanges. Stocks covered by 599 admissions were extant as of June 30, 1950. The number of actual issues
involved is less than this figure because many issues have been
admitted to unlisted trading on two or more exchanges. The numerous admissions, including the record number of 130 during the past
fiscal year, have, however, barely maintained the ratio of listed stocks
traded unlisted on other exchanges to all listed stocks. On June 30,
1945, for example, 21.8 percent of all registered (listed) stock issues
and 54.9 percent of all registered shares were also admitted to unlisted
trading on other exchanges, while 5 years later, after 396 section 12
(f) (2) admissions," the comparable figures were 21.2 percent of the
issues and 54.3 percent of the shares. During this 5-year period, the
number of stocks listed on New York Stock Exchange and traded on
other exchanges has declined from 51.6 to 49.8 percent of all stocks
listed thereon. Securities registered on that exchange are the principal source of unlisted admissions under section 12 (f) (2). Listed
stocks which are also traded unlisted on other exchanges, numbering
545 as of June 30,1950, and were 554 on June 30,1937. However, the
11 regional exchanges which have availed themselves of section 12 (f)
in order to procure trading privileges in securities listed on other
exchanges had only 84 more stocks to trade in on June 30, 1950, than
they had on June 30,1937, and 598 of the total stock issues traded on
those exchanges in 1950 were admitted pursuant to section 12 (f)
(2), without which it appears that these exchanges might have suffered a decline of more than 500 stocks :
"33 in 1945, 78 in 1946, 71 in 1947, 46 in 1948, 38 in 1949, and 130 in 1950, all In
fiscal years ending June 30. Part of the Increase in 1950 Is due to the Commission's requests for 12 (f) (2) applications rather than applleatfons for determination of sub
stantlal equivalence pursuant to rule X-12 (f)-2 (b), in numerous cases where new issues
were succeeding old ones in corporate changes and where the llsted status of the fss~p
made recourse to section 12 (f) (2) possible and appropriate.

, The sole increase over 1937.

New York Curb Exchange does not trade in New York Stock Exchanges issues. The single section 12 (f) (2) extant admission of a
stock on the Curb is Utah-Idaho Sugar common, listed on Salt Lake
Stock Exchange. Stocks available for trading on the Curb have declined from 1,149 in 1937 to 779 in 1950, both figures as of June 30.
New York Stock Exchange does not have any section 12 (f) (2) admissions, since it does not permit trading in unlisted securities. Since the
section 12 (f) (2) adniissions of stocks to the regional exchanges are
principally of issues listed on New York Stock Exchange, and since
these admissions constitute an ever-increasing proportion of the stocks
available for trading on the regional exchanges, their effect is to concentrate trading- on the regional exchanges more and more in the
national, as against the local issues.
The 332 stocks admitted to unlisted trading- without being listed on
any registered exchange aggregated 329,904,324 shares, or about 91/2
percent of the total shares admitted to trading on the registered exchanges as of June 30, 1950. Reported volume of trading in the 332
issues for the calendar year 1949 was 21,715,000 shares, or about 41,4
percent of the total share volume on the registered exchanges. In
this compilation "shares" include warrants, American depositary receipts, voting trust certificates, etc. New York Curb Exchange accounted for about 93 percent of the 21,715,000 reported share volume,
San Francisco Stock Exchange for about 6 percent and 1 percent was
scattered among 6 other regional exchanges. Reported volumes are
about seven-eighths of actual volumes on New York Curb Exchange,
principally because odd lots are not usually reported on the ticker.
Considering this factor and the volume in stocks removed from unlisted trading during 1949, it appears that approximately one-third of
the share volume in that year on New York Curb Exchange was in
unlisted stocks not registered pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934.
In June 1950, the stocks traded on an unlisted basis pursuant to
section 12 (f) (3) were reduced to six, upon retirement of American
Gas & Electric preferred.

Changes in Securities Admitted to Unlisted Trading Privileges

Rule X-12F-2 under the Securities Exchange Act provides for the
case where a change is made in a security previously admitted to unlisted trading privileges. Under paragraph (a) of this rule if the
change is in the title of the security or the name of the issuer, in the
maturity, interest rate or outstanding aggregate principal amount of
an issue of bonds, debentures or notes, or in the par value, dividend
rate, number of shares authorized or the outstanding number of shares
of a stock, the security as changed is deemed to be the security originally
admitted to unlisted trading privileges on the exchange. The exchange is required to notify the Commission of such changes promptly
after it learns of the change and many such notifications are received
during the year.
Paragraph (b) of rule X-12F -2 provides for changes in a security
admitted to unlisted trading privileges where the change is more comprehensive than those enumerated in paragraph (a) of the rule. In
such case the exchange may file an application requesting a Commission
determination of the effect of the change, describing each change effected in the security and furnishing copies of all written matter submitted by the issuer to its security holders relating to such changes.
If the Commission determines that the security after such change is
substantially equivalent to the security originally admitted to unlisted
trading privileges, than the security as changed is deemed to be the
security originally admitted to unlisted trading privileges on that exchange. Pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of rule X-12F -2,
the Commission granted four applications for a determination of substantial equivalence by New York Curb Exchange •

DELISTING OF SECURITIES FROM EXCHANGES
Securities Delisted by Application

Section 12 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act provides that upon
application by the issuer or the exchange to the Commission, a security
may be withdrawn or stricken from listing and registration on a national securities exchange in accordance with the rules of the exchange
and subject to such terms as the Commission deems necessary for the
protection of investors. In accordance with this procedure, six bond
Issues and three stock issues were stricken from listing and registration
upon application by exchanges. All six bond issues 7 and one of the
stock issues" were delisted by New York Stock Exchange, on the
ground that the amounts of the issues remaining outstanding had been
reduced to inconsequential proportions by reason of exchanges or redemptions. The two remaining stock issues were delisted by New
York Curb Exchange (and one of them also by Philadelphia-Baltimore
Stock Exchange 9) by reason of reacquisition of most of the shares in
the one case and liquidation in the other.'.
The Commission granted the application by the receivers of one
corporation to withdraw its common stock from registration and listing on New York Curb Exchange on the ground that the company
was insolvent and in process of liquidation." It granted the application of another corporation to withdraw its common stock from registration and listing on Chicago Board of Trade since the company had
already registered and listed the same security upon Midwest Stock
Exchange,"
Securities Delisted by Certification

Securities which have been paid at maturity, redeemed, or retired in
full, or which have become exchangeable for other securities in substitution therefor, may be removed from listing and registration on a
national securities exchange if the exchange files a certification with
the Commission to the effect that such retirement has occurred. The
removal of the security becomes effective automatically after the interval of time prescribed by rule X -12D2-2 (a). The exchanges filed
certifications under this rule effecting the removal of 152 separate
issues. In some instances the same issue was removed from more than
one exchange, so that the total number of removals, including duplications, was 181. Successor issues to those removed became listed and
registered OIl exchanges in many cases.

SECURiTIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In accordance with the provisions of rule X-12D2-1 (d), New York
Curb Exchange removed 16 issues from listing and registration when
they became listed and registered on New York Stock Exchange.
This
rule permits a national securities exchange to remove a security from
listing and registration in the event trading therein has been terminated pursuant to a rule of the exchange which requires such termination if the security becomes listed and registered and admitted to
trading on another exchange. Removal under this rule is automatic,
the exchange being required merely to notify the Commission of the
removal.
Securities Removed From Listing on Exempted Exchange

A security may be removed from listing on an exempted exchange
by such an exchange filing an appropriate amendment to its exemption
statement setting forth a statement of the reasons for the removal.
One exempted exchange removed two issues from listing thereon during the year, due in one case to the redemption of the security and in
the other to the expiration of a voting trust agreement.
MANIPULATION AND STABILIZATION

Sections 9, 10, and 15 of the Securities Exchange Act prohibit
manipulation of securities prices. Section 9 forbids certain specifically described forms of manipulative activity. Transactions which
create actual or apparent trading activity or which raise or lower prices
are declared to be unlawful if they are effected for the l?urpose of
inducing others to buy or to sell. Certain practices desiznated as
"wash sales" and "matched orders" effected for the purpose of creating
a false or misleading appearance of active trading or a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for a security are declared to be illegal. Persons selling or offering securities for sale are
prohibited from disseminating false information to the effect that the
price of a security will, or is likely to, rise or fall because of market
operations conducted for the purpose of raising or depressing the price
of a security. Persons selling or buying securities are forbidden to
make false or misleading statements of material facts, with knowledge
of their falsity, or willfully to omit material information regarding
such securities for the purpose of inducing purchases or sales.
Pursuant to its statutory authority, the Commission has adopted
rules and regulations to aid it in carrying out the expressed will of
Congress. Sections 9, 10, and 15, as augmented by the Commission's
rules and regulations, are aimed at freezing our securities markets
from artificial influence and maintaining fair and honest markets
whose prices are established by supply and demand and are uninfluenced by manipulative activity.
Manipulation

The manipulation of securities prices which in previous years took
millions of dollars annually from the J?ublic, was one of the principal
reasons for the adoption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In
the early days of the Commission's existence, some market operators
attempted to continue their manipulative activities. The Commission
uncovered these activities and as a result various penalties were im-

SIXTEENTH! ANNUAL REPORT

37

posed upon certain operators, including expulsions from exchanges,
Jail sentences, and fines. As a result of the administration of the act,
manipulation is believed no longer to be an appreciable factor in our
markets. However, sporadic attempts artificially to raise or depress
the prices of securities are still encountered, and it is evident that any
relaxation of market surveillance on the part of the Commission would
create a danger of reestablishment of many of the manipulative practices the act was designed to prevent.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1950, several actions arising
out of manipulative investigations were undertaken. A permanent
injunction was obtained against Henry M. Stanley on the basis of
attempts to manipulate the market in the stock of Friars Ale Brewing
Co, Public hearings were begun in Chicago to revoke the brokerdealer registration of Adams & Co., Bennett, Spanier & Co., and Ray
T. Haas for their manipulation of the price of Mohawk Liqueur Co.
stock. The registration of W. H. Bell & Co., Inc., was revoked for
Securities Act violations in the stock of Bost, Inc. A series of frauds
perpetrated on an investment trust resulted in the jailing of William
A. Hancock and led to an action to revoke the registration of the firm
of Junger, Anderson & Co. All of the above cases were discovered
during investigations which arose out of the detection methods described in the following paragraphs, A clarification of certain issues
involving the propriety of trading by underwriters was made in an
opinion dealing with the underwriting of bonds of Northern Indiana
Public Service Co.
In administering the antimanipulative requirements there is a premium on prompt action to prevent harm before it occurs, and on the
avoidance of interference WIth the legitimate functioning of the markets. To accomplish this the Commission has continuously modified
and sought to improve its procedures for the systematic surveillance
of trading in securities. Methods used to detect manipulation have
necessarily been flexible, since techniques employed by manipulators
change constantly, increasing in subtlety and complexity.
The staff regularly scrutinizes price movements in approximately
8,500 securities, including about 3,700 issues traded on the exchanges
and 4,800 which have the most active markets over the counter. Information maintained concerning these securities includes not only
data reflecting the market action of such securities, but also includes
news items, earnings figures, dividends, options, and other facts which
might explain price and volume changes. In addition, monthly observations are made of the price movements of thousands of other
issues which occasionally change hands in our public markets. The
markets for securities about to be sold to the public are watched very
closely. In this connection the markets for almost 1,400 issues in the
amount of about $172,000,000, offered under regulation A, were carefully checked for improper pricing or market grooming. Several hundred other securities were kept under special daily observation during
the 1950 fiscal year, for periods ranging from 14 to 90 days, because
a public offering under a registration statement was proposed and
either the underwriter or the Issuer had reserved the right to stabilize
the market for the security. The issues actually offered had a public
offering price in excess of $3,000,000,000.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

"Whenno apparent explanation can be found for an unusual movement in a security or for an unusual volume of trading, the matter
may be referred to one of the regional officesof the Commission for a
field investigation. For reasons of policy the Commission keeps confidential the fact that trading in a given security is under investigation, for it has found that knowledge of the existence of such investigations may unduly affect the market or reflect unfairly upon individuals whose activities are being investigated. As a result, the Commission occasionally receives criticism for failing to investigate certain cases when, in fact, it is actually engaged in an intensive investigation.
The Commission's investigations of unusual market activity take
two forms. The "quiz," or preliminary investigation, is designed to
detect and discourage incipient manipulation by a prompt determination of the reasons for unusual market behavior. Often the results of
a quiz point to a legitimate reason for the activity under review and
the case is closed. Frequently, facts are uncovered which require more
extended investigation, and in these cases formal orders of investigation are issued by the Commission. In a formal investigation, members of the Commission staff are empowered to subpena pertinent
material and to take testimony under oath. In the course of such in-'
vestigations, data on purchases and sales over substantial periods of
time are often compiled and trading operations involving considerable
quantities of securities are scrutinized.
The Commission operates on the premise that manipulation should
be suppressed at its inception. Many of the cases investigated never
come to the attention of the public because the promptness of the Commission's investigations, t'hrough the quiz technique, stops the manipulation before it is fully developed. Losses by the public are seldom recoverable even though the perpetrator of a fraud is brought to
justice. Therefore it is believed that these investigatory methods afford more protection to the public than allowin~ unlawful market
operations to continue until it appears that sufficient evidence for a
successful prosecution is obtainable.

Stabilization

During the 1950fiscal year many conferences were held with representatives of issuers and underwriters in order to assist them to
avoid violation of the statutory provisions and rules of the Com-

SIXTEENTH

mission dealing with stabilizing, manipulation, and frau~ and many
written and telephone requests were answered. Formal Commission
rules dealing directly with stabilization relate only to offerings "at
the market" or at prices relating to market prices. The practice
applicable to fixed price offerings is embodied in a wealth of interpretive material. It is the Commission's experience that such issuers
and underwriters place great value on the immediate service which
the Commission is able to render them by being at all times available to give them responsible advice as to problems dealing with
proper stabilizing techniques in the offering of securities.
During the 1950 fiscal year the Commission continued the administration of rules X-17A-2 and X-9A6-I. Rule X-17A-2 and Form
X-17A-l (the form on which stabilizing transactions are reported)
were amended in the interest of simplification and clarity. Rule
X-17A-2 requires the filing of detailed reports of all transactions
incident to offerings in respect of which a registration statement has
been filed under the Securities Act of 1933 and where any stabilizing
operation is undertaken to facilitate the offerings of securities registered on national securities exchanges, in which the offering prices are
represented to be "at the market" or at prices related to market prices.
Of almost 500 registration statements filed during the 1950 fiscal
year, 220 contained a statement of intention to stabilize to facilitate
the offerings covered by such registration statements. Each of the
latter filings was examined as to the propriety of the proposed method
of distribution and market support and the full disclosure thereof.
Because a registration statement sometimes covers more than one class
of security, there were 252 offerings of securities in respect of which
a statement was made, as required by rule 426 under the Securities
Act, to the effect that a stabilizing operation was contemplated.
Stabilizing operations were actually conducted to facilitate 59 of these
offerings, principally stocks. Offerings of stock issues aggregating
20,369,462 shares with an aggregate public offering price of $408,092,189 were stabilized, but only 1 bond offering, having a principal
amount of $4,000,000,was stabilized. In connection with these stabilizing operations, 7,990 reports were filed with the Commission during
the fiscal year. Each of these reports has been analyzed to determine
whether the stabilizing activities were within permissible limits.
SECURITY TRANSACfIONS OF CORPORATION INSIDERS
Reports of Transactions and Holdings

To give information to the public about transactions by corporation
insiders in securities of their companies, certain reports are required
to be filed with the Commission by persons closely identified with the
management or control of industrial, utility, and investment companies under the conditions specified in three of the acts whic'h the
Commission administers-e-sections 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, 17 (a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, and 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. An initial
report must be filed disclosing the amount of such security holdings,
and thereafter a report must be filed for each month in which any
c'hange occurs in these holdings. The reports show the relationship

40

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of the reporting insider to his named company; the date, number of
shares, and security involved in each transaction; the character of
the transaction (whether a purchase, sale, gift, exchange, etc.) ; and
the nature of ownership (whether direct or indirect through a holding
company, partnership, trust, etc.),
Publication of Data Reported

The reports filed by insiders are available for public inspection
from the time they are filed. However, it is impossible for the majority of investors personally to inspect them either at the Commission or
at the national stock exchanges, where additional copies of the reports
are filed. Accordingly, the Commission issues a monthly Official Summary of Security Holdings and Transactions which summarizes these
reports. Before the close of the 1950 fiscal year, as a part of the Commission's management-improvement program, a study was made to
reappraise the service afforded by this publication. In that connection, a card was attached to each copy of the summary distributed in
March asking subscribers what use was made of the summary and
what value it afforded them, and inviting their suggestions for ways
in which it might be improved for the benefit of investors.
More than 1,400 replies were received representing nearly 40 percent of the 3,814 subscribers circularized, The replies indicated, in
general, that five out of six subscribers own corporate securities-and
that those who are not stockholders consist mainly of newspapermen,
teachers, students, librarians, and government and trade association
officials. Moreover, it was indicated that each copy of the summary is
used by an average of 8.4 persons. The indirect coverage resulting
from its use by newspapermen as a source for news stories is incalculable (167 newspapermen are subscribers). It was also found that
approximately 50 percent of the summary subscribers are engaged in
some form of the securities business, that 20 percent are primarily
investors, that 20 percent are lawyers, engineers, accountants and corporation executives, and that the remaining 10 percent are journalists,
teachers, and persons engaged in a variety of miscellaneous occupations. By and large the returns demonstrate that the summary is
deemed by its users to be important particularly in reflecting insiders'
opinions of the prospects of the corporation implicit in their transactions and holdings.
Subscribers offered a number of specific suggestions for improvement of the summary. Some of the suggested changes have already
been put into effect, and a number of other suggestions proposed by
subscribers, as well as by members of the Commission's staff, are being
given further consideration with a view to improving the usefulness
of the summary and cutting down its publication costs.
Preventing Unfair Use of Inside Information

For the Jlurpose of preventing the unfair use of information which
may have been obtained by a corporation insider b.Yreason of his relationship to his company, section 16 (b) of the Securities Exchange
Act further provides that any profit he realizes from
purchase and
sale, or sale and purchase, of any equity security 0 the company
within any period of less than 6 months shall be recoverable through

court action brought by the issuer or by any security holder acting
in its behalf. Corresponding provisions are contained in section 17
(b) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and in section 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The reporting
provisions of these acts have in a number of instances brought to light
transactions involving substantial profits from short-term trades which
were recovered by or in behalf of the issuers, either through voluntary
repayment or as a result of court action.
Volume of Reports Filed and Examined

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES, CONSENTS, AND AUTHORIZATIONS

The Commission is authorized under three of the acts it administers
to prescribe rules and regulations concerning the solicitation of
proxies, consents, and authorizations in connection with securities of
the company subject to those acts." Pursuant to this authority, the
Commission has adopted regulation X-14, which is designed to protect investors by requiring the disclosure of certain information to
them when their J?roxies are being solicited. The rules afford investors an opportunity for active participation in the affairs of their
company. Under regulation X-14 each person solicited must be
furnished with such information as will enable him to act intelligently upon each separate matter in respect of which his vote or con,. Sections

the management to communicate with other security holders when
the management is soliciting proxies.
Statistics of Proxy Statements

During the 1950 fiscal irear, material relating to 1,668 different solicitations of proxies and 'follow-up" material used in connection with
186 of these solicitations was filed with the Commission, 1,653 proxy
statements were filed during the 1949 calendar year, practically the
same number as in each of the four preceding calendar years. The
comparative numbers of proxy statements filed by management and
nonmanagement groups and the principal items of business for which
stockholders' action was sought in these solicitations is shown in the

Examination of Proxies

While proxy examination work occurs throughout the year, it has
a seasonal peak during the spring. Thus, of 1,517 annual meetings

SIXTEENTH

Al\'NUAL REPORT

43

for which proxy statements were filed during the 1949 calendar year,
1,085 meetings, over 70 percent of the total, were held during March,
April, and May; 544 of the total, 36 percent, took place in April alone;
160 meetings were held in the last week of April; and as many as 65
meetings were scheduled for 1 day, the fourth Tuesday in April.
Pension plaJls.-An outstanding feature of the year was the number
of cases in which pension plans were presented to stockholders for
approval. While the plans in a single industry followed a somewhat
general pattern, there were variations due to differences in the financial
condition of the companies and the differing approaches of management. A common characteristic of many plans was the 5-year term
under which some managements insisted that the company's liability
ran only to employees who qualified and elected to go on pension during
the term. One plan of this type, submitted to its stockholders by a
large steel producer, provided for payments into a trust in five annual
installments so that the last payment would be made 4 years after the
final year of the plan. Estimates showing the cost, assuming that all
eligible employees would elect to take pensions, were clearly presented
in a table by maturing classes and payments to the fund. Assuming
that the plan might well be renewed on its expiration, the inclusion
of a statement in the proxy soliciting material was obtained indicating
an approximate range of annual cost if the plan were so continued.
This company disclaimed any intention of funding past service cost
for employees who would not qualify for pensions during the 5-year
term of the plan.
In contrast to the position taken by the above-mentioned company,
one of the leading steel producers solicited proxies with a view to
amending its existing plan to increase the benefits and broaden the
coverage, and presented in its proxy statement its summary of costs
on the assumption that the plan would continue indefinitely even
though the contract covered only 5 years specifically. In this case the
summary presented a comparison of lump-sum costs of past service
and the estimated comparative annual costs during 1950 for the existing and proposed plans. Because of the very substantial figures presented and the technical character of the references to income tax
laws, the staff requested and obtained in the management's introduction to the summaries of costs a clear statement that the figures for
costs were presented before giving effect to income taxes.
REGULATION OF BROKERS AND DEALERS IN OVER.THE.COUNTER
MARKETS
Registration

Brokers and dealers using the mails or other instrumentalities of
interstate commerce to effect transactions in securities on over-thecounter markets are required to be registered with the Commission
pursuant to section 15 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;
exemption, however, is granted to those brokers and dealers whose
business is exclusively instrastate or exclusively in exempt securities.

Proceedings

Section 15 (b) of the act provides that registration of a broker or
dealer may be denied for specific types of misconduct on the part of an
applicant.
Registration may be revoked for such misconduct if the
Commission finds after an appropriate record has been made that such
denial or revocation is necessary in the public interest. The Commission's staff, therefore, examines all applications for registration and
numerous other available sources of information to determine whether
the applicant has engaged in any violations of law which would constitute a statutory basis for challenging the propriety of giving him the
privileges of registration.
When indications of such misconduct are
discovered, the Commission orders proceedings to establish the facts.
The applicant has full opportunity to be heard on the specified charges.
Similar procedures are followed in revocation proceedings against registered brokers and dealers and in proceedings to determine whether to
suspend or expel a broker or dealer from membership in a national securities exchange or association. The following tabulation reflects the
number of proceedings instituted under sections 15 (b) and 15A 14

As shown in the foregoing tabulation, nine proceedings involving
the denial of registration as an over-the-counter broker or dealer were
ordered during the 1950 fiscal year and one was pending at the be,ginning of the year. Two applications were withdrawn after the COmmission had given notice of hearing. Six applications for registration were granted. Two proceedings were pending at the end of the
year. One proceeding involved solely the question of suspension or
expulsion from the NASD and various securities exchanges and in its
findings and opinion the Commission determined that the imposition
of a sanction was not necessary. Of the 23 revocation proceedings

Most of the proceedings brought against brokers and dealers stem
at least indirectly from the Commission's routine fraud detection
procedures designed to detect and prevent violations of law.
In proceedings brought by the Commission against Wendell Maro
Weston, doing business as Weston & Co. and Assured Warranty Corp.,
for the revocation of their registrations as a broker-dealer and investment adviser, respectively, the Commission found that over a long
course of conduct 1Veston systematically defrauded a client who
reposed great trust and confidence in him.
The client turned over to Weston $97,000 in cash for safekeeping,
and Weston soon induced her to invest $84,631 of this in securities.
Thereafter, 'Weston organized Assured Warranty Corp., in which he
took a controlling interest, which issued 200 shares of preferred stock
in his name. He held the stock for the client and paid the corporation $20,000 of her money. The client entered into an investment
advisory agreement with Assured Warranty by the terms of which
Assured 'Varranty might give orders for purchase and sale of specified securities on her behalf with Weston as broker. Weston thereupon bought and sold securities for her account, utilizing the services
of members of the New York and Boston Stock Exchanges. From
time to time during the course of these transactions, Weston obtained
a total of $50,000 more from the client's account which he used for
the purchase of additonal preferred stock in Assured Warranty.
The Commission found that the client was unaware that her funds
were being syphoned out of her account for the furchase of stock in
an unsuccessful promotional company. The tota gross income of the
company was $7,074 in a period when its expenses amounted to
$68,090, of which $27,000 was paid to Weston as salary and advances.
The total net loss was over $61,000, of which over 90 percent was borne
by her.
The Commission stated that Weston stood in the relation of fiduciary
to his client because of the trust and confidence reposed in him by the

client and because of the more formal obligation which he owed to
her as an investment adviser. As a fiduciary, Weston was required
to act in the utmost faith in every phase of their relations, to invest
her funds carefully, and to exercise any special authority granted to
him in connection with an unusual venture only when accompanied
by full disclosure of the exact nature of the proposition and the risks
undertaken. The Commission found that in putting his client's money
to a speculative use for his personal benefit, and in designedly concealing his scheme by elaborate deceptions, Weston pursued a course
of conduct which operated as a fraud on the client within the scope
of rules X-10B-5 and X-15C1-2 (adopted under sections 10 (b) and
15 (c) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), and section
17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The Commission further found
that in failing to deliver confirmations of transactions to the client
Weston had wilfully violated section 15 (c) (1) of the Securities
Exchange Act and rule X-15C1-4 thereunder.
Weston filed annual financial reports in 1945 and 1946 in which he
failed to reflect a substantial claim of the client for the return of her
misused funds and his liability on a promissory note issued in settlement of this claim, which the Commission found to be in wilful violation of section 17 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act and rule
X-17A-5 thereunder.
The Commission revoked the registration of Weston & Co. as a
broker-dealer.
Finding that in its application for registration as an investment
adviser and in supplemental reports Assured Warranty Corp, had wilfully made untrue statements and misleading omissions as to the ownership of its stock and the nature of its activities, the Commission
revoked the registration of Assured Warranty Corp. as an investment
adviser.
Three cases decided during the year involved, in part, violations
of section 5 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933. These cases involved
Green & Co., the S. T. Jackson & Co., Inc., and J. C. Flannery & Co.
All three respondents were found to have distributed the common
stock of Columbia Machinery & Engineering Corp. when no registration was in effect as to such securities. The Commission found that
in 1946 six Columbia stockholders, who constituted members of a
group in control of Columbia, sold all their holdings of Columbia
stock, consisting of 142,600 shares of 200,000 outstanding shares of
common stock and 1,600shares of 2,000shares of outstanding preferred
stock. Of the common stock, 138,300 shares were sold by the three
companies, and the preferred stock was all sold to Jackson & Co. and
Flannery & Co. acting in joint account. The Commission noted that
the selling stockholders, either directly or through their representatives in the Columbia management, constituted a cohesive group which
had organized Columbia and directed its affairs through their control of its board of directors and management. The sales of Columbia
stock by these stockholders were not unrelated independent transactions but were the culmination of continuing efforts by principal
stockholders of Columbia to dispose collectively of their interest.
These efforts were known to the respondent firms which, from early
in 1946, had cooperated among themselves in the sales of the Colum-

bia stock, were close to Columbia, and in fact took a hand in directing
its course.
The Commission concluded that the sales effected by the respondent
companies were knowingly made on behalf of members of a group in
control of Columbia, that the respondents were underwriters within
the definition contained in section 2 (11) of the Securities Act, and
that registration of the Columbia stock which they distributed was
required by that act. It found, therefore, that the S. T. Jackson &
Co. Inc., Stacy T. Jackson, J. C. Flannery & Co., and Joseph C.
Flannery wilfully violated section 5 (a) of the Securities Act in the
sale of the common and preferred stock of Columbia, and that Greene
& Co. and William F. Thompson wilfully violated that section in the
sale of Columbia stock. The S. T. Jackson & Co., Inc. and J. C.
Flannery & Co., in addition, were found to have engaged in fraudulent
practices in connection with their sales of Columbia common and
preferred stock,"
On findings of wilful violations of the antifraud provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and
other provisions of the latter act, the Commission revoked the registration of the S. T. Jackson & Co., Inc. and J. C. Flannery & Co., and
found Stacy T. Jackson and Joseph C. Flannery to be causes of such
revocations.
Proceedings instituted against Halsey, Stuart & Co., Inc., ("Halsey") and Harold L. Stuart, involved market activities in the 3% percent series C first-mortgage bonds, due 1973, of Northern Indiana
Public Service Co. and sales without delivery of prospectuses required
by the Securities Act.
Halsey was syndicate manager of a group of 92 underwriters, which
in 1943 purchased an issue of $45,000,000 of the Northern Indiana
Public Service Co. bonds from the issuing company. The bonds were
registered under section 5 of the Securities Act but were not traded
on any exchange.
When the underwriting syndicate terminated 12,561bonds remained
unsold. Halsey held 4,772, of these unsold bonds, most of them having
been bought by Halsey from other underwriters at a bid slightly
higher than cost to the underwriters.
This bid had the effect of
eliminating overhanging holdings in the hands of other underwriters,
who might have thrown them onto the market with serious consequences to the distribution as a whole and in particular to Halsey's
stake at that time of over $2,000,000in undistributed bonds.
In a period of about 400 business days Halsey published bids or
invited offers of the bonds on 292 business days. In the earlier months
following the close of the syndicate it was the heaviest known buyer
in the dealer market and made most of its purchases from liquidating
underwriters{ often bidding and paying prices at increasingly higher
levels. On the other hand, it sold comparatively few bonds in that
market, confining most of its sales to customers. The post syndicate
market developed in three stages: A first period marked by extensive
" While the Commission did not minimize the violation by Greene & Co. and Wllliam F.
Thompson of the registration requirements of the Securities Act, it did not think it necessary, in the public Interest, to impose remedial sanctions and dlsmlssed the proceedings
with respect to Greene & Co. and Wllliam F. ThompllOn.

SIXTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

liquidation by underwriters and a fall in prices to about 101; a second
period marked by a tightening supply, reduced rate of activity, net
accumulation of additional inventory by Halsey, and a price rise to
about 103; a third period in which general activity was further reduced and Halsey undertook a consistent liquidation of net inventory
as prices rose to about 107. Thereafter Halsey's trading thinned out
to insignificant proportions.
The Commission found that Halsey's activities in the market forced
not only its own bids but independent bids as well to be raised in order
to attract bonds. Beginning even prior to the close of the syndicate,
Halsey drained off the potential market over $4,000,000 of bonds.
Thereafter, it was an active purchaser whose pattern of conduct resulted in draining off the supply that came into the market and channeling it to investors who were not likely to become active traders.
Halsey's purchases demonstrably could not have been made to satisfy
existing orders. Halsey's trading created active and apparent activity
and at times it raised prices directly either by bids or transactions.
In addition, throughout long periods following the close of the syndicate, its transactions gave support to the wholesale market and tended
to fix price floors, because of their volume, because of the fact that
Halsey made large purchases while others were relatively inactive, and
because the general pattern of Halsey's trading was to remove overhang from the dealer market and to place the bonds with investors.
The Commission found that Halsey engaged in such practices for
the purpose of inducing others to buy. The Commission stated, "It
is undisputed that it desired, in the period following close of the
syndicate, to preserve as much of its inventory as it could in the hope
and belief that the price would improve. Hope, belief, and motive
are not 'purpose' in the legal sense applicable to this case. But 'purpose' must be inferred when hope, belief, and motive are implemented
by activity objectively resulting in market support, price raising,
sales at higher prices, and the protection of inventory." The Commission pointed out that Halsey had received Securities Exchange
Act release No. 3505, which deals with the legality of transactions
by underwriters during the course of a distribution and states that
conduct which would violate section 9 (a) (2) of the Exchange Act
would also constitute a violation of section 15 of that act and section
17 of the Securities Act.
The Commission found that Halsey had wilfully violated section 17
(a) of the Securities Act and sections 10 (b) and 15 (c) of the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder.
The Commission further found that from September 11, 1944
through April 2, 1945, Halsey sold these bonds without delivery of
prospectuses as required by section 5 (a) (2) of the Securities Act.
The violation was not characterized as wilful since Halsey in practice treated the bonds as fungible and had used prospectuses for a
year to cover all of its sales for the year.
Concluding that it would not be in the public interest to take no
action against Halsey, if it still maintained the view that it was free
to engage in the activities described, the Commission afforded Halsey
an opportunity to assure the Commission that it would in the future
915841-51-5

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

comply with the Commission's enunciated principles. Halsey filed a
statement of compliance and the Commission thereupon dismissed the
proceedings.
Broker-Dealer Inspections

The broker-dealer inspection program, initiated by the Commission
in 1940 under section 17 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act, which
authorizes the Commission to make periodic, special, and other examination of the books and records of brokers and dealers, is one of
the Commission's important procedures in the detection and prevention of violations of law by broker-dealers. These inspections are conducted by the staff of the Commission's regional offices. They are sometimes limited to a particular phase of a firm's operations, such as its
financial condition or its method of handling particular accounts, but
generally they involve full-scale examination of all characteristic
activities, culminating in a report on the extent to which its operations
are in compliance with the standards established by the act and rules.
Regional officesreported on 906 inspections during the year. In 59
inspections the question of financial condition was a matter for consideration; 56 inspections involved noncompliance with the Commission's hypothecation rules; in 15 inspections secret profits in agency
transactions were reported; in 165 inspections noncompliance with
regulation T was reported, involving chiefly the failure to comply
with the provisions of the regulation respecting cash accounts; other
infractions too scattered to classify were noted in 113 inspections.
As a result of the Commission's policy of explaining the application
of its rules and regulations and of urging management controls which
will afford strict compliance therewith, many violations, particularly
those involving improper hypothecation of securities, or the rule relating to the capital position of the firm, are frequently cured before the
inspection has been completed. However, in connection with more
than 40 inspections post-inspection surveillance or investigation beyond
the scope of the inspection became necessary-to ascertain whether
corrections had been made as promised and to determine whether
disciplinary or remedial action was necessary. Two of the firms inspected retired from business during investigation and revocation
proceedings are pending as to three others.
In addition to inquiry into the various matters mentioned above, the
inspection procedures call for a test check to determine whether the
firm inspected deals fairly with customers at prices reasonably related
to the current market. These test checks have a dual purpose-first
to enforce the principle, judicially established in Oharles E. Hughes
ill 00., Inc. v. S. E. 0./8 that it is fraudulent for a dealer to sell securities to customers, or buy from them, at prices not reasonably related
to the market unless he discloses the variation from the market, and
second to determine the effectiveness of the rules of the NASD relating
to fair prices and fair and equitable principles of trade.
18139 F. 2d 434 (c. A. 1943) ccrt. den. 321 U. S. 786 (1944).
On Nov. 25. 1944. the
board of g-overnorHof the NASD adopted an interpretation of sec. 1 of art. III of its Rules
of Fair Practice holding that transactions by dealers at prices not reasonably related to
the market constitute conduct Inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.

Financial Reports

Brokers and dealers are required by rule X-17A-5 to file reports of
financial condition during each calendar year. During the 1950 fiscal
year a total of 3,581 financial reports were filed. Each report is examined to determine, among other things, whether there has been any
violation of rule X-15C3-1, which provides that the aggregate indebtedness of a broker or dealer shall not exceed 20 times his net capital. When deficiencies are found steps are taken immediately to secure
compliance in this important phase of the Commission's activities in
affording protection to customers.
Failure to file the reports as required is an infraction of the rule and
may lead to disciplinary proceedings. Frequently, small firms doing

52

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

relatively little or no business fail to file reports on time. These are
handled by a procedure for cancellation of registration when the registrant's inactivity is established. Informal procedures are frequently
used to procure filing by those who do not furnish reports on time.
In some instances action becomes necessary to revoke registration.
Proceedings were instituted during the year to revoke the registrations of six firms for failure to file financial reports.
SUPERVISION OF NASD ACTIVITIES
Membership

At the end of the 1950 fiscal year there were 2,784 members of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), the only
national securities association registered as such with the Commission.
This represented an increase of 89 members in the year, as the result
of 246 admissions and 157 terminations of membership. At the same
date there were 28,794 individuals, including generally all partners,
officers, traders, salesmen, and other persons employed by member
firms in capacities which involved their doing business directly with
the public, an increase of 1,545during the year. This increase was the
result of 5,444 initial registrations or reregistrations and 3,899 terminations of registration.
Disciplinary Actions

The Commission received from the NASD during the 1950 fiscal
year reports of final action in 25 disciplinary cases in which formal
complamts had been filed against members. Three of these complaints
were dismissed on findings by the NASD district business conduct
committee of initial jurisdiction that there had been no violations of
the rules of fair practice. In the remaining 22 cases the committees
found violations of such rules and imposed various penalties.
In 13 such cases the complaints were directed solely against member
firms. In 9 of these cases fines were levied ranging from $100 to
$2,000 and aggregating $4,000. Of these 9 firms fined, 5 were also
censured and costs of the proceedings were charged in 4 cases. One
such firm was fined, censured, and suspended from membership for
90 days. In the remaining 4 cases, 1 member was expelled, 2 firms
were censured, and 1 complaint was disposed of by acceptance by the
committee of a statement pledging future observance and compliance
with the rules of fair practice.
In nine other cases complaints were directed not only against member firms but also against registered representatives of such firms.
The significance of this type of action arises from the NASD bylaws
and rules under which registered representatives have the same rights,
duties, and obligations and are subject to the same disciplinary procedures, penalties, and disqualifications as members. Thus, for example, revocation of registration by the NASD of a registered representative would operate as a barrier to membership and to employment
by or affiliation with a member unless the Commission finds it appropriate in the public interest to approve or direct to the contrary.
In three such cases the complaints were dismissed as to the member
firms although one registered representative was censured and two representatives had their registrations revoked; one firm was censured

SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT

53

and its registered representative was fined $200; one firm was censured
and fined $200 and the registration of its representative was revoked;
another firm was fined $500 and both the firm and the representatives
were censured. One such complaint was disposed of by acceptance by
the committee from the firm of a statement of future observance and
compliance with the rules of fair practice and the expulsion of the
representative (who had been a partner) and the revocation of his
registration. Another complaint filed jointly against two member
firms and the principal of one firm, who was also a registered representative, resulted in a decision by the district business conduct committee to expel each firm from membership and to revoke the registration, as registered representatives, of the principal named in the complaint and of two principals of the other firm. In addition, costs to
the maximum allowable amount of $500 were assessed against each
firm. One firm and its two principals appealed this decision to the
board of governors and this appeal was pending at the year end.
During the year the Commission continued its practice of referring
to the NASD, for appropriate action, facts concerning the business
practices of members where there was some indication of possible violations of the rules of fair practice. Five such references were made
in the year here under review and one had been in process at the start
of that year. Reports of disposition were received during the year on
two of these cases, both of which involved formal complaint procedure and are included in the description of the disposition of such
cases recited above. Four such cases were in process at the year end.
During the 1950 fiscal year the Commission was not called upon to
act in any matter arising from denial of membership by the NASD or
on a petition for approval of, or continuation in, membership. At the
year end there was before the Commission, on appeal by the aggrieved
member, one disciplinary decision by the NASD. This was the only
such matter to come before the Commission in the year here reviewed.
CHANGES IN RULES, REGULATIONS, AND FORMS

During the 1950 fiscal year, the Commission made a number of
important changes in its application and report forms and related
rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange Act.
Form 10.-This form, the principal form for the registration on an
exchange of securities of commercial and industrial companies, was
completely revised. The revision merges into this form eight other
registration forms previously prescribed for various classes of registrants. Among the more important changes made were the amplification of the items and instructions calling for a description of business
and property so as to indicate more precisely the information required,
the disclosure of material litigation, and the amendment of the remuneration items to correspond with the requirements of the Commission's
proxy rules.
Form lO-K.-This is the principal form for annual reports of listed
companies under the Securities Exchange Act and for registrants
under the Securities Act required to report under section 15 (d) of
the Securities Exchange Act. It was revised along lines similar to the
revision of Form 10 and likewise supersedes several other forms previ-

54

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

ously prescribed for the annual reports of various classes of registrants. The revised form also eliminates certain duplication which
had previously existed between the requirements of this form and
Form 8-K for current reports.
Subsequent to this revision of Form 10-K, it was further amended
to permit electric utilities and natural gas companies which file annual
reports with the Federal Power Commission on that Commission's
Form No.1 or Form No.2 to file copies of such reports with this Commission in satisfaction of most of the requirements of Form 10-Ie
This provision is optional and any company may file its report either
in accordance therewith or on Form 10-K in accordance with the
previously existing requirements.
Form 8-K.- This form prescribed for current reports was amended
to require the reporting of certain events with respect to which reports
had not previously been required. The principal additional events
required to be reported are the acquisition or disposition of a substantial amount of assets; the institution or termination of important litigation; the guaranteeing of securities of other issuers; and defaults
upon senior securities.
Form 9-K.-The Commission also adopted Form 9-K, a new quarterly report form, replacing item 11 of old Form 8-K for reporting
gross sales and operating revenues. Except for providing a separate
form for such reports and some amplification of the instructions to
include certain administrative interpretations, this new form did not
make any substantial change in the requirements with respect to such
reports.
Form 8.-During
the year the Commission also revised Form 8
which is a one-page form used as a cover or facing page for amendments to applications for registration, and annual, quarterly, and
current reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act. Use of the
form had previously been restricted to listed companies. However,
under the revision, the form is also available for use by registrants
under the Securities Act which are required to file annual and other
reports under section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act.
Revision of role X-l'2A-lr-Ewemption
for certain short-term warrants.-In addition the Commission adopted a revised rule X-12A-4.
This rule exempts certain short-term warrants from registration under
section 12 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act. Previously, the exemption had been limited to issued warrants, and under this revision the
rule has been broadened to exempt unissued warrants as well. The
Commission adopted at the same time a new Form AN-4, which is
prescribed for the exemption statements required by rule X-12A-4,
and rescinded Form 15-AN, heretofore prescribed for such statements.
LITIGATION

UNDER

THE SECURITIES

EXCHANGE

ACT

During the past year the Commission's litigation under the Securities Exchange Act consisted principally of injunction actions instituted by the Commission and its participation as amious curiae in
private suits involving important questions of construction of various
provisions of the act and rules thereunder.

SIXTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

55

Injunction Actions

A permanent injunction was obtained in S. E. O. v. Walter G. Furlong 18 against a broker-dealer who had not registered as required by
section 15.19 In addition to this violation, the complaint alleged that
the defendant had falsely represented that he was employed by a
brokerage firm, had obtained secret profits from its customers by selling securities at prices substantially above the prevailing market prices
and had converted customers' funds to his own use.
A number of other injunctions were sought in cases involving registered broker-dealers." Most of these were based on charges of failure
to conform to required financial standards. The common element in
S. E. O. v. General Stock and Bond Uorp." and S. E. O. v, Adams &
00., et al.22 was solicitation of business by the defendants while their
liabilities exceeded their assets. In the General Stock and Bond case,
where a permanent injunction was obtained by consent, the complaint
also charged violation of the Commission's rule X-15C3-1, in that the
firm permitted its indebtedness to exceed 2'0 times net capital. Additional violations charged in the Adams case included the hypothecation of customers' securities without their consent," In that case
the company's affairs were placed in the hands of a receiver in order
to obtain equitable treatment for its customers. An injunction was
obtained in S. E. O. v. Gordon B. Todd,24 where the defendant had
violated the margin requirements and had failed to keep books and
records in the manner required by law.
Violation of the antimanipulation provisions of the act, sections
9 (a) (1) and (2), was enjoined in S. E. O. v. Henry M. Stanley.25
The complaint alleged that Stanley effected a series of transactions
in a security listed on the Detroit Stock Exchange to create actual and
apparent trading in the security for the purpose of inducing others
to purchase the stock and that he consummated "wash sales" and
entered "matched" orders to cause a false and misleading appearance
with respect to the market for the security.
The Commission's proxy regulations were involved in S. E. O. v.
John A. TOpf!ing,26 where a decree was obtained by consent permanently enjoining a shareholder of Certain-Teed Products Corp., a
registered corporation, from further violation of section 14 (a) of
the act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder. It was based
upon the defendant's failure to file with the Commission letters to
various common stockholders preliminary to a proposed solicitation of
proxies 27 and certain false and misleading statements in this material.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The first litigated case in which the Commission relied on its power

to bring an action in the United States district courts to enforce compliance with section 13 of the act and rules thereunder requiring the
filing of annual and quarterly reports by a listed corporation registered under the act was S. E. O. v, Atlas TMk Oorporation."
It
was alleged that Atlas Tack Corp. had failed to file annual reports
for the years 1947 and 1948, had submitted materially deficient annual reports for the years 1945 and 1946, had failed to file a number
of quarterly reports and had made such tardy filing in most instances
that investors were deprived of the timely information with which
the statute is designed to provide them. The evidence was clear that
the Commission had made repeated requests for the information before resorting to judicial compulsion. This litigation resulted in a
decree after the close of the fiscal year compelling correction of the
deficienciesin past filings.and requiring the corporation to file reports
at the times and in the manner prescribed by the statute and regulations.
Participation

as Amicus Curiae

Most of the cases in which the Commission participated as amious
curiae involved construction of section 16 (b) of the act, which accords
to a corporation the right to recapture Short-swing (less than 6
months) profits realized from transactions in its equity securities by
"insiders." vVhether a production manager was an "insider" within
the intent of section 16 (b) was the question posed in Oolby v. Klune.2'
The district court in granting summary judgment for the defendant
held that the employee involved was not an "officer" subjected to liability by the statute. The Commission, though taking no 'Position upon
the ultimate issue, appeared amicus curiae on the appeal and submitted a memorandum urging that whether a person is an officer depends
upon the employee's "responsibility for the policy of at least a substantial segment of the corporation's affairs" and "participation in
executive councils of the corporation as an officer." The appellate
court remanded the case to the district court to take evidence on the
question whether the defendant performed "important executive
duties of such character that he would be likely, in discharging these
duties, to obtain confidential information about the company's affairs
that would aid him if he engaged in personal market transactions." 30
An interpretation dealing with the valuation of stock purchase
warrants was rendered in Trumoale v. Blumberg et al.,31 where plaintiff, a stockholder in Universal Pictures Co., invoked section 16 (b)
to recover on behalf of the corporation profits which he alleged the
defendants, who were officers and directors of the company, had
made. It appeared that, pursuant to an employment contract, the
defendants received 3,000 warrants for the purchase of stock of the
company. At the time they were received, these warrants were
worth $11,500. Within 6 months prior to their receipt the defendants had sold, for $120,688, 3,000 other warrants they owned.
Plaintiff, contending that the warrants had a cost basis of zero, sought

to recover the entire sale price. The district court held no profit was
realized. On appeal the Commission took the position that whether
these warrants were considered as compensation or not there was no
recoverable profit. As compensation their cost basis would be the
value of the services performed which might properly be valued in
excess of the sales price. If considered as an incentive payment, no
profit was realized under the circumstances of this case because there
was no causal relationship between the purchase and sale such as the
statute was designed to reach. The court of appeals affirmed on
the basis of the opinion of the district court.
The issue in Arbetman v. Playford, et al.,32 in which the Commission appeared amicus curiae, was whether an insider must account
for profits from a purchase and sale within a 6 months period, where
the profit is realized by sale which follows registration but purchase
preceded registration.
The Commission took the position that an
insider should be liable under such circumstances because a contrary
construction would defeat the purpose of the statute by allowing an
opportunity for abuse of inside information.
No opinion on the
merits was reached, however, because the litigation was terminated
by a settlement between the parties.
In another case, R. Hoe ill Co., Inc. v. I1fcCune,33a corporation proposed to compromise a claim, based on section 16 (b), against one of
its directors and by motion requested a district court to approve the
settlement. In answer to an order to show cause, the Commission
advised that the Court should not undertake to pass upon the acequacy of the settlement in any manner which would prejudice the
right of action of plaintiff's shareholder to sue on behalf of the corporation for the full amount of the profit involved. This position
was adopted by the court in its opinion."
The Commission also participated as amicus curiae in Robinson et
al. v. Difford et al., E. D. Pa., Civil Action No. 10,322, which invoked
section 10 (b) of the act and rule X-10B-5 thereunder. The Commission opposed the contention, presented by a motion to dismiss the
complaint, that the provisions do not apply to so-called private transactions in securities, i. e., transactions in securities not registered on
an exchange nor traded over-the-counter by securities brokers and
dealers. The fraudulent transactions charged in this case were purchases by a majority "control group" (including officers and directors) of a closely held corporation of the stock holdings of minority
shareholders allegedly by means of fraudulent misrepresentations,
half truths and omissions of material facts. As indicated above, the
complaint did not aver that the stock was registered upon an exchange
or had ever been the subj ect of trading by a broker or dealer. On July
14, 1950, shortly after the close of the fiscal year, the court denied the
motion to dismiss in an opinion which upheld the Commission's view
that the section was applicable." The same question, among others,

THE KAISER-FRAZER

INVESTIGATION AND THE LITIGATION
OTIS & CO.

WITH

Early in 1948, the Commission instituted an investigation into the
circumstances surrounding the failure of a stock offering by KaiserFrazer Corp., and there ensued a series of administrative and court
proceedings which, from the standpoint of sheer volume, have been
among the most extensive in the history of the Commission. By June
30, 1950, the administrative and judicial proceedings (including private suits) aggregated nine in number, not counting numerous appeals, and attorneys for the Commission had prepared a total of 35
briefs or documents in the nature of briefs, and 43 other legal documents such as pleadings and affidavits. The history of these proceedings is discussed in some detail in the Fifteenth Annual Report of the
Commission."
During the past fiscal year the Commission obtained a decision in
the Supreme Court of the United States 40 which left it free to commence hearings in an administrative proceeding under the Securities
Exchange Act to determine whether Otis & Co., an investment banking concern, had violated the act and the rules thereunder in connection with the Kaiser-Frazer stock offering, and, if so, whether the
registration of Otis & Co. as a broker-dealer should be revoked and
whether it should be suspended or expelled from the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD).
After the disposition of various prehearing motions, the hearings
were finally commenced in the Spring of 1950. Thereafter they were
suspended while counsel attempted to settle the details involved in
incorporation by reference of major blocks of testimony adduced in
the Commission's earlier investigation, which had been conducted
without cross-examination. This was the status of the hearings at the
close of the fiscal year .

REPORT

While the hearings were proceeding at the administrative level, the
Commission was continuing its efforts to clarify certain issues raised
in claims of res judicata advanced by Otis & Co. Following a decision on this point in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit," (which the court indicated was intended to defer the
issue for later consideration) the Commission applied to the Supreme
Court (after the close of the fiscal year) for a petition for a writ of
certiorari."
Meanwhile the NASD had pressed to a conclusion a proceeding of
its own to determine whether Otis & Co., a member of the Association,
had violated the Association's rules in refusing, upon a claim of attorney-client privilege, to supply certain information to an investigating
committee of the NASD which was also examining the Kaiser-Frazer
stock offering. The outcome of this proceeding was a 2-year suspension of Otis & Co. from membership in the NASD. Otis & Co.
appealed to the Commission under section 15A (g) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, which provides for an automatic stay of the
NASD's action pending the Commission's decision. This appeal was
still pending before the Commission at the end of the fiscal year.
Otis & Co. had unsuccessfully attempted in the courts to stay this
NASD proceeding and to stay the Commission from taking any action
in the matter as well. During the fiscal year Otis & Co. had continued
its efforts in this direction by way of appeal to the United States Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit," but this appeal was
voluntarily dismissed following the Supreme Court decision above
noted.
So far as concerns the stockholders' actions which were instituted
against Kaiser-Frazer Corp. after the collapse of its stock offering
in 1948, the Commission, in accordance with its usual practice, had
not participated (except to the limited extent noted at page 77 of the
Fifteenth Annual Report) because of the general absence of issues
bearing on the construction of the securities laws. During the fiscal
year, however, attempts were made by litigants in two of these actions
to subpena large numbers of interpretations rendered by the Commission in matters other than the Kaiser-Frazer stock offering. Upon
the Commission's explanation of the public interest reasons which have
caused it from its inception to keep such interpretations confidential
except in very unsuual circumstances, the subpenas were quashed by
the court."
The various stockholders' actions, which involved largely overlapping claims, moved far towards a conclusion during the fiscal year
when a proposed settlement in one of the suits was approved by the
court after extensive hearings in which the parties to the other suits
were heard on the question of the adequacy of the settlement.w After
the close of the fiscal year, however, certain of the parties filed a notice
of appeal from the order approving the settlement.

m

ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANY ACT OF 1935
The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935was passed by the
Seventy-fourth Congress following an extensive investigation by the
Federal Trade Commission. That investigation disclosed a variety
of abuses in public-utility holding company finance and operations, the
more significant of which are enumerated in section 1 (b) of the act:
(1) Inadequate disclosure to investors of the information necessary
to appraise the financial position and earning power of the companies
whose securities they purchase; (2) the issuance of securities against
fictitious and unsound values; (3) the overloading of operating companies with debt and fixed charges thus tending to prevent voluntary
rate reductions; (4) the imposition of excessive charges upon operating companies for various services such as management, supervision
of construction and the purchase of supplies and equipment; (5) the
control by holding companies of the accounting practices and rate,
dividend and other policies of their operating subsidiaries so as to
complicate or obstruct State regulation; (6) the control of subsidiary
holding companies and operatmg companies through disproportionately small investment; (7) the extension of holding company systems
without relation to economy of operations or to the integration and coordination of related properties.
The statute provides for regulation of public-utility holding company systems which are engaged in the electric utility business or in
the retail distribution of natural or manufactured gas. The provisions of the act are in two basic categories. The first deals with the
financing and operations of holding company systems. These regulations, however, are carefully designed not to conflict with, but to supplement and strengthen State regulation. Thus, the jurisdiction of
the act does not extend to rate making and does not authorize the
Commission to prescribe accounting systems for operating subsidiaries,
except in a comparatively few instances where there are neither State
nor other Federal laws prescribing such accounting systems. The
second area of regulatory jurisdiction under the act provides for the
geographical integration and corporate simplification of holding company systems.
THE PUBLIC UTILITY INDUSTRY UNDER THE ACT

Public utility properties subject to the Holding Company Act on
June 30, 1950continue to represent an important segment of the electric and gas utility industries of the United States, despite the release
of 98 companies from the regulatory jurisdiction of the Commission
during the past year. At the close of the fiscal year, there were registered with the Commission 46 holding company systems whose
aggregate consolidated system assets On that date amounted to ap60

SIXTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

proximately $12,822,000,000. These figures may be compared with
46 systems on June 30,1949, having system assets of $14,294,000,000.
The decrease of approximately $1,472,000,000 represents a net
change reflecting primarily the difference between divestments of
companies which are no longer subject to the act with aggregate assets
of $2,231,000,000 and property additions totaling some $600,000,000,
which were occasioned by the tremendous growth in the industry in
evidence since the close of World War II. Because of this expansion
in plant facilities, not only by utility subsidiaries, but also by nonutility subsidiaries of holding- company systems, it is not possible to
present an intelligent comparison of those assets of registered holding
company systems which were subject to the act when the statute was
first enacted with the assets of systems subject to the act at the present
time.
On June 30, 1950 there were 543 companies subject to regulation by
the Commission under the act as registered holding companies and
subsidiaries thereof. These included 68 holding companies, 223 electric and gas utility companies, and 252 nonutility companies. Corresponding data for June 30, 1949 showed 641 companies subject to
regulation, consisting of 72 holding companies, 274 electric and gas
utility companies, and 295 nonutility companies. The changes in the
number of companies subject to regulation under the act during the
past year, and for the entire period of the Commission's administration of the statute, are summarized in the following tables.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

While it is not possible at this date to predict accurately the ultimate
disposition of all holding company systems it is estimated that, when
all problems arising under section 11 (b) have been settled, there will
remain subject to the Commission's continuing regulatory jurisdiction
approximately 20 systems with aggregate assets of 6 or 7 billion dollars.
PROGRESS UNDER SECTION II-OYER-ALL

SUMMARY

The fiscal year ended June 30, 1950 has been a significant year from
the standpoint of consummation of reorganization and dissolution
plans under section 11. Seventy-eight companies with aggregate
assets of $2,231,000,000were divested by holding companies and, as a
result, are no longer subject to the act. This compares with the divestment of 44 companies with assets of $1,749,000,000in the fiscal year
1949 and 111 companies with assets of $1,244,000,000 in 1948. In
addition, holding companies divested themselves of 52 other companies with assets aggregating some $2,000,000,000 which continued
subject to the act on June 30, 1950 as registered holding companies or
subsidiaries thereof. Of this latter number, 25 companies with assets
of approximately $1,200,000,000 are expected to remain subject to
regulation by the Commission indefinitely as components of simplified
and integrated holding company systems meeting all of the requirements of section 11 (b).
During the entire 15-year life of the statute, 751 companies with
assets of $10,326,000,000have been divested from holding company
control and are, therefore, no longer subject to regulation by the Commission. Divested companies in the "still subject" category for the
15-year period number 233 with aggregate assets of $5,692,000,000.
Of this number, 166 companies with assets of $4,541,000,000 are
presently expected to continue in operation as holding company systems subject to the Commission's regulatory supervision under the act.
Analyses of these divestments by types of companies and method of
divestment are presented in the following tables.

Further evidence of the impact upon the utility industry of the
transition in ownership of operating companies under section 11 is
afforded by noting the increase in trading activity in common stocks
of the classes A and B electric utilities, as classified by the Federal
Power Commission. At December 31, 1939, there were 383 companies
in these categories and, of this number, only 56 companies or 14.6
percent had common stock in which there was some evidence of trading activity. At December 31, 1949, the total number of companies
in classes A and B had declined to 316, but of this number, 130 or 41.1
percent had all or a substantial proportion of their common shares in
the hands of the public and hence were listed on an exchange or
traded in the over-the-counter market. Eight additional stocks became available for public trading during the period from January
1 to June 30, 1950. A few of the companies in this group remained
subject to the Holding Company Act because they are holding com-

panies as well as operating companies, or because a portion of their
common stock was still held by a holding company subject to future
divestment. Most of the 130companies, however, are now independent
operating utilities no longer subject to Commission jurisdiction.
Of the balance of 186 companies whose stocks were not actively
traded at the close of 1949, 1091 were still subject to the Holding
Company Act, although this number has been further reduced by divestments, mergers, and exemptions which have occurred in 1950.
Most of the companies which are now subject to the Holding Company Act, and whose common stocks are not traded, are expected to
remain in that status as subsidiaries of continuing holding companies.
In these instances, however, the public has access to the common
stocks of integrated parent holding companies which have gone
through the processes of section 11.
PROGRESS UNDER SECTION ll-SURVEY

OF INDIVIDUAL SYSTEMS

During the past year the task of bringing the holding company systems into conformity with section 11 has gone forward at a rapid
pace. Many of the important interpretive problems, which in earlier
years required extensive consideration by the Commission as well as
frequent judicial review, are now resolved and the patterns for
achievement of compliance are well established. In addition. the
condition of the security market during the past year has been generally favorable to the consummation of necessary portfolio security
offerings.
Outstanding among the section 11 (e) plans (or segments thereof)
consummated during the past fiscal year were those of the Commonwealth & Southern Corp., American Power & Light Corp., Niagara
Hudson Power Corp. and United Light & Railways Co. During the
same period, the extensive reorganization plans of Long Island Lighting Co. and Pittsburgh Railways Co. were approved by the Commission and, with court approval, were expected to be consummated
within a short time.
The Commission also issued three supplemental orders which determined the respective rights of the preferred stockholders of Electric Bond & Share Co. and Federal Light & Traction Co. and the
prior lien preferred stockholders of New England Public Service
Co. to receive certain cash payments in addition to the sum of involuntary liquidating values and accrued dividends.
The achievements in these and other systems are described in the
following summaries which set forth with respect to each of 19 systems the historical developments and current progress toward compliance with section 11.
Cities Service Company

Cities Service Co., at the time of its registration in 1941, was the
top holding company in a system containing 125 companies of which
49 were electric and gas utility companies with consolidated assets of

consists of companies which are
not subject to the Holding Company Act and whose stocks are not actively traded. Generally speaking, these are either subsidiaries of holding companies exempt from the provlsions of the act or are companies of small size whose stocks are closely held.

approximately $1,000,000,000. This system owned or operated properties in each of the 48 States and in several foreign countries. Utility
properties were held by three subholding companies, Cities Service
Power & Light Co., Federal Light & Traction Co., and Arkansas Natural Gas Corp., each controlling one or more utility systems.
In proceedings under section 11 (b) of the act, the Commission
found that Cities should be limited in its operations to those of a single
integrated gas utility system and required Cities to dispose of its other
interests." However, Cities expressed a desire to retain instead its
nonutility businesses and, accordingly, the Commission modified its
section 11 (b) (1) order so as to permit Cities to effect compliance
by disposing of all of its utility interests,"
Cities Service Power & Light Co., pursuant to a plan approved on
March 14, 1944,4simplified its corporate structure by eliminating its
debentures and preferred stocks. In August 1946, Power & Light liquidated and dissolved, transferring to Cities its portfolio holdings,"
These consisted of an interest of approximately 65 percent in Federal
Light & Traction Co., the common stocks of four operating utility
companies, Ohio Public Service Co., Spokane Gas & Fuel Co., the
Toledo Edison Co., and Doniphan County Light & Power Co., and
other miscellaneous holdings.
Federal Light & Traction Co. has likewise completed liquidation
proceedings. A number of its smaller properties were sold to individuals or other private purchasers and the stock of Tucson Gas, Electric
Light & Power Co. was sold to underwriters for public distribution.
Federal also merged four of its subsidiaries to form Public Service Co.
of New Mexico and the stock of this company was distributed to Federal's common stockholders.
Federal distributed to its preferred stockholders $100 per share plus
accrued and unpaid dividends, but the Commission at that time
reserved jurisdiction with respect to the right of the preferred stockholders to receive any additional amount. This right was evidenced
by certificates of contingent interest. By order dated June 19t 1950,
the Commission determined this reserved issue and ordered. that
holders of the certificates be paid $10 per share together with compensation for delay in payment at the rate of 5.45 percent per annum
from October 2, 1947.6
On January 26, 1950, Arkansas Natural Gas Corp. filed a new plan
under section 11 (e) designed to effect compliance with the requirements of section 11 (b). It provides for simplification of the company's corporate structure and for the disposition by Arkansas Natural, as a partial liquidating dividend, of its stock holdings in ArkansasLouisiana Gas Co., a natural gas utility subsidiary. Its other subsidiary, Arkansas Fuel Oil Co., will then merge with Arkansas
NaturaI. This plan is still pending before the Commission.
On April 24, 1947, the Commission approved a section 11 (e) plan
filed by Cities for the simplification of its corporate structure. This
plan provided for the issuance of approximately $115,000,000 prinHolding

cipal amount of new debentures to the holders of Cities' outstanding
preferred and preference stocks representing a principal amount
equivalent to the redemption prices of the three series of preferred
and preference stocks plus accumulated dividend arrears of approximately $50,000,000/ In addition, provision was made for the immediate retirement of approximately $40,000,000of the company's previously existing long-term debt and for the application of anticipated
proceeds from the disposition of its utility subsidiaries to the retirement of the remaining old debt plus a reduction in the amount of the
new debentures. Since consummation of that plan in June 1947,
Cities has disposed of its interests in the common stocks of Public
Service Co. of New Mexico (acquired through liquidation of Federal
Light & Traction Co.) , Ohio Public Service Co., and the Toledo Edison Co. Proceeds derived from the sales of these holdings together
with other available cash have been employed to reduce the outstanding debt of Cities by more than $87,400,000.
The Commonwealth & Southern Corporation

At the time of its registration as a public utility holding company
in March 1938, the Commonwealth & Southern Corp: controlled a
holding company system consisting of some 43 compames. Its prmcipal subsidiaries were 11 public utility companies all of which rendered electric service and some of which also furnished gas, transportation, and other services. These companies conducted their operations in five Northern and six Southern States. Although some of
the electric properties in the south were interconnected, the northern
electric properties for the most part were situated in separate and
distinct areas. The publicly held securities of the subsidiaries, consisting primarily of bonds and preferred stocks, aggregated about
$711,000,000while Commonwealth's own debt securities and preferred
stock totaled about $52,000,000and $150,000,000 respectively. Thus
the system had outstanding an extremely large amount of senior securities ranking ahead of Commonwealth's common stock. Dividends
on this common stock had not been paid since March 1932 and dividends on the cumulative preferred stock had been paid at a reduced
rate for several years resulting in dividend arrearages of ahout
$18,000,000.
Divestments from time to time eliminated from Commonwealth's
holding company system all the transportation companies and nearly
all the small nonutility companies. Commonwealth also sold its interests in three utility subsidiaries operating in Tennessee, South Carolina, and Indiana, and transferred its interests in the public utility
companies which conduct integrated electric operations in Georgia,
Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi to the Southern Co., a newly organized public utility holding company.
The past fiscal year witnessed the consummation of the final section
11 plan of Commonwealth, after its approval by this Commission 8
and upon order for enforcement by the District Court of the United
States for the District of Delaware." This plan, which became effec7 Holding Company Act release No. 736R.

tive on October 1, 1949,provided for the distribution of common stock
of Consumers Power Co. and Central Illinois Light Co., together with
$1 per share in cash, in exchange for the preferred stock of Commonwealth, and for the distribution of Commonwealth's remaining assets,
after provision for its liabilities, in exchange for Commonwealth's
common stock. These remaining assets consisted chiefly of common
stock of the Southern Co. and Ohio Edison Co. Pursuant to the
plan, Commonwealth was dissolved as of Ocotber 1, 1949,and is in the
final stages of liquidation.
Thus the original system of 43 companies has been resolved into
a number of independent operating companies, and two integrated
regional holding company systems which are expected to continue
under the jurisdiction of the Commission. One of these systems consists of Ohio Edison Co. and its subsidiary, Pennsylvania Power Co.;
the other is composed of the Southern Co. and its 4 interconnected
public utility subsidiaries.
In connection with the consummation of Commonwealth's plan,
the Commission, in September 1949,approved an application to change
the mutual service company of Commonwealth's holding company
system into an independent service company." The Commission, at
the same time, approved the organization of a new company, Southern
Services, Inc., to become a mutual service company for the subsidiary
companies of the Southern Co.
Electric Bond and Share Company

The Electric Bond & Share Co. system was the largest to register
under the Holding Company Act. At the time of its registration in
1938, it controlled 121 domestic subsidiaries including 5 major subholding companies with combined assets of nearly 3lh billion dollars.
These subholding companies were American & Foreign Power Co.
Inc., American Gas & Electric Co., American Power & Light Co.,
Electric Power & Light Corp., and National Power & Light Co. Of
these, American Gas & Electric and American Power & Light have
been severed from the system. Electric Power & Light has been
dissolved pursuant to a plan consummated in May and July 1949.
National Power & Light has disposed of substantially all of its holdings and has few remaining assets.
Pursuant to plans filed in 1945 and 1946, which were approved by
the Commission and ordered enforced by the district court, Bond &
Share paid $100 per share, or an aggregate amount of $104,328,000,
to the holders of its $5 and $6 preferred stocks and, in addition, delivered to each of such holders a certificate evidencing the right to
receive any additional amounts which the Commission or the courts
might approve or direct."
On April 7, 1947, Bond & Share filed plan II-B in which it proposed that no further payment be made to the certificate holders. On
June 19, 1950, after hearings and oral argument, the Commission
issued its order in connection with plan II-B and held that the holders
of certificates issued with respect to the $6 preferred stock should

receive $10 per share together with compensation for delay in payment
at the rate of 5.45 percent from March 6, 1947, and that no further
payments should be made to holders of certificates issued with respect
to the $5 preferred stock."
In the past, Bond & Share had filed plans with the Commission
which contemplated the divestment of all of its public utility holdings in the United States in order that its status might be changed to
that of an investment company. However, in September 1949, Bond &
Share applied to the Commission for relief from its commitment to
dispose of the stock of United Gas Corp. received in connection with
the dissolution of Electric Power & Light Corp.
The plan described in this application contemplates the disposition
of all domestic utilities other than United Gas, the creation of a "pool
of capital" by Bond & Share to be invested in special situations and the
exemption of Bond & Share from the Holding Company Act except
with respect to reorganization
proceedings affecting American &
Foreign Power Co., Inc. and with respect to distributions of securities
not theretofore authorized by the Commission. Hearings have been
completed in respect to that phase of the proceeding involving Bond &
Share's request for relief of Its commitment to dispose of its holdings
in United Gas Corp.
During December 1949, Bond & Share distributed and sold its
holdings of the common stock of Middle South Utilities, Inc. which
had been received in connection with the dissolution plan of Electric
Power & Light Corp." Subsequent to the close of the past fiscal year,
Bond & Share filed an application to acquire 381,0671j2 shares of common stock of the Southern Co. in exchange for its holdings of 254,045
shares of common stock of Birmingham Electric CO.14
American & Foreign Power Company, Inc.

American & Foreign Power Co., Inc. (an Electric Bond & Share
subsidiary) controls a mutual service company and some 70 subsidiary
companies located in Central and South America, Cuba, Mexico, China,
and India. Since the operations of all of Foreign Power's subsidiaries
are in foreign countries, the Commission's principal concern is with
respect to the simplification of the company's corporate structure and
its relationship to Electric Bond & Share Co. Foreign Power's capital
structure at December 31, 1949, consisted of debentures, serial notes,
bank notes, three classes of preferred stock with dividend arrearages of
some $410,000,000, common stock, and option warrants.
Bond & Share
holds all the serial notes and substantial blocks of the junior securities.
On October 24, 1944, Foreign Power and Bond & Share filed a plan
for the reorganization of Foreign Power. After extensive hearings,
this plan was amended by the two companies and on November 19,
1947, the Commission approved such amended plan after the filing of
certain additional modifications."
The plan, as approved by the Com" Holding Company Act release Nos. 9931 and 9980.

mission, was subsequently approved by the United States District
Court for the District of Maine.I6
However, because the company could not effectuate the financing
necessary to consummate the plan, both the district court and the
Commission vacated their orders approving it. On May 2, 1949, the
Commission issued an order pursuant to section 11 (b) (2) of the act
requiring Bond & Share and Foreign Power to take steps to reorganize
Foreign Power in such a manner that its resulting capital structure
will consist only of common stock plus such amount of debt as will
meet the applicable standards of the act,"
During December 1949, pursuant to authority granted by the Commission, Bond & Share transferred to Foreign Power $19,500,000principal amount of past due 6 percent debentures of Cuban Electric Co.
and $30,000,000principal amount of past due serial notes of Foreign
Power in exchange for $49,500,000 principal amount of new 6-year
notes of Foreign Power. This step was taken to facilitate the reorganization of Foreign Power's Cuban subsidiaries and to enable Foreign
Power to obtain a bank credit of $15,000,000.18
Early in 1950,Foreign Power prepared and made available to representatives of its security holders detailed information concerning the
operations of the company and its subsidiaries. It invited suggestions
from security holders with respect to a new overall reorganization
plan. As of the close of the fiscal year, the company was considering
such suggestions and contemplated filing a new plan within the next
few months.
American Power & Light Co.

On August 22, 1942,American Power & Light Co. (an Electric Bond
& Share subsidiary) was ordered to dissolve on grounds similar to
those set forth with regard to National Power & Light Co. At the
time of the issuance of this dissolution order, American controlled
directly or indirectly 35 subsidiaries, 16 of which were public utility
companies. American's capital structure consisted of long-term debt,
two classes of cumulative preferred stock with dividend arrearages of
more than $35,000,000,and common stock. By the close of the past
fiscal year, this company had accomplished the major phases of its program of compliance with section 11 and controlled only 2 utility
subsidiaries.
Earlier steps taken by American included disposition of its interest
in Nebraska Power Co., Arizona Light & Power Co., and New Mexico
Electric Service Co. and retirement of its long-term debt. In October
1945, the Commission approved the formation by American of a new
Texas holding company, Texas Utilities Co., which acquired from
American its interest in Texas Electric Service Co. and Texas Power
& Light Co. and from Electric Power & Light Corp., the latter's interest in Dallas Power & Light Co.
In April 1947,two other subsidiaries, Northwestern Electric Co. and
Pacific Power & Light Co. were merged with Commission authorization. The stockholdings of American in Kansas Gas & Electric Co.

were disposed of in two public offerings made in May 1948 and July
1949.
In October 1949, the Commission approved the section 11 (e) plan
of American 19 which was subsequently ordered enforced by the United
States district court. The plan was consummated on February 15,
1950 and pursuant thereto, American distributed to its preferred stock
and common stockholders its holdings of stock of Texas Utilities CO.,2O
Florida Power & Light Co., Minnesota Power & Light Co., and the
Montana Power Co., as well as shares of new common stock in American. Coincidentally with this distribution, settlement of claims
against Bond & Share by American and its subsidiaries was accomplished through the payment to American of $2,500,000 by Bond &
Share. Part of this amount was contributed by American to a number
of its subsidiaries.
Prior to consummation of this plan, American sold its holdings of
common stock of Pacific Power & Light Co. to a group of underwriters
for a cash consideration of $16,125,000. It has since proposed to distribute the proceeds of this sale to its present stockholders.
The distribution was approved by the Commission in June 1950 21 and following the close of the fiscal year has been ordered enforced by the United
States district court.
At June 30, 1950, American's remaining assets consisted of the common stock of the Washington Water Power Co., the common stock of
Portland Gas & Coke Co., a substantial amount of cash and other
miscellaneous assets. Portland Gas & Coke Co. has on file with the
Commission an extensive plan of reorganization.
Proceedings on this
plan are now in progress."
Electric Power & Light Corp.

At the time the Commission issued its dissolution order against Electric Power & Light Corp. (an Electric Bond & Share subsidiary),
this company controlled directly or indirectly 24 subsidiaries, 10 of
which were public utility companies under the act. Electric's capital
structure at that time consisted of long-term debt, 3 classes of cumulative preferred stock with aggregate arrearages of $53,000,000, common
stock and option warrants.
Before consummation of the final section
11 plan, which resulted in the dissolution of Electric during the past
fiscal year, it had already disposed of its holdings in Idaho Power Co.
and Dallas Railway & Terminal Co. through sales to the public. Its
holdings in Dallas Power & Light Co. had been sold to the new Texas
Utilities Co. organized by American Power & Light Co. Its holdings
in Utah Power & Light Co. were disposed of pursuant to a reorganization of the latter company which provided, in part, for the reclassification of Utah's preferred and common stocks into a new common stock. 23
United Gas Corp., Electric's principal subsidiary, was reorganized
under section 11 in a proceeding which resolved alI claims of United

and Electric against Electric Bond & Share Co., arising out of the
formation and financing of United."
In 1945, Electric retired its outstanding long-term debt with the
proceeds derived from the disposition of properties described above
and from retained earnings. In addition, the accounts and capital
structures of Electric's remaining subsidiaries were brought into compliance with the requirements of the act.
The dissolution plan filed by Electric and approved by the Commission on March 7, 194925 was subsequently approved by the United
States district court and by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit." Stays were denied by the court of appeals and by the Supreme
Court 21 and the plan was consummated by the end of July 1949.
Under the plan a new holding company, Middle South Utilities, Inc.,
was created. It acquired Electric's holdings of the common stocks
of Arkansas Power & Light Co., Louisiana Power & Light Co., Mississippi Power & Light Co., New Orleans Public Service Co., Il~C.,
and Gentilly Development Co. The common stocks of Middle South
and of the United (Jas Corp. previously held by Electric were then
distributed to Electric's stockholders in exchange for its outstanding
securities. At the same time, a settlement of all suits and claims
against Bond & Share by and on behalf of Electric and its subsidiaries
was consummated with a cash payment of $2,200,000by Bond & Share.
Thus the Electric system as such has been entirely eliminated. The
only aspect remaining for determination arises in connection with
applications for compensation and reimbursement of expenses, aggregating approximately $1,300,000. These are now pending before the
Commission.
National Power & Light Co.

On August 23, 1941,pursuant to proceedings instituted by the Commission, National Power & Light Co. (an Electric Bond & Share subsidiary), was ordered to dissolve, because it constituted an undue and
unnecessary complexity in the Bond & Share system." At the time
of the issuance of this order, National had 27 subsidiaries, 9 of which
were public utility companies. The work of bringing about National's
ultimate dissolution is now nearing completion. All of its long-term
debt has been retired through the use of treasury cash and its preferred
stock has been retired partly through a voluntary exchange for common stock of Houston Lighting & Power Co. and in part by cash at
the rate of $100per share derived from the sale of other shares of Houston stock. In May 1946, the Commission approved a plan for the
settlement of all suits and claims against Bond & Share by or on behalf
of National, its subsidiary and certain former subsidiaries, through
payment of $750,000by Bond & Share."
This settlement was subsequently approved by the United States
district court and in August 1946, National distributed the common

distribution of these companies, National's only remaining subsidiaries
were Lehigh Valley Transit Co., the Memphis Street Railway Co.,
and Memphis Generating Co.
National's interest in Memphis Street Railway was subsequently
eliminated through a reorganization plan consummated in May 1949.
In May 1950, its security holdings in Memphis Generating Co. were
sold to the Tennessee Valley Authority for a consideration of
$1,405,000. In April 1950, National also entered into a contract for
the sale of its holdings of common stock of Lehigh Valley Transit Co.
(received as a result of the reclassification of that company's stock
pursuant to a section 11 (e) plan) to Cincinnati, Newport & Covington
Railway Co., a nonaffiliated company. Upon consummation of this
sale, National's only remaining assets will consist of 34,156 common
shares of Pennsylvania Power & Light Co. and approximately
$2,475,000in cash.
General Public Utilities Corp.

This company is the top holding company emerging from reorganization of the former Associated Gas & Electric Co. system. Associated Gas & Electric Co. and its immediate subsidiary Associated Gas
& Electric Corp. registered as holding companies on March 28, 1938.
At that time, the system consisted of 164 companies, including 11 subholding companies, and was unequalled for the complexity of its
corporate structure. Four of the utility companies were as many as
6 tiers of subholding companies removed from the top holding company. The system was engaged in business in 26 States scattered from
Maine to Arizona and in the Philippine Islands; the businesses included such diverse activities as electric, gas, water, ice, street railway,
bus, heating, hotel, insurance, real estate, engineering, marine towing,
toll bridge, coal mining, and ferry operations. Associated Gas &
Electric Co., itself, had outstanding 10 different kinds of fixed-interest
debt obligations, several series of income debentures, a number of
securities variously known as convertible debenture certificates and
convertible obligations, two different classes of preferred stock, a class
A stock, a class B stock, a common stock and warrants to purchase
common stock.
Most of Associated's subsidiaries also had senior securities outstanding in the hands of the public. The consolidated assets of the system
were stated at a little over $1,000,000,000and the corporate assets of
Associated Gas & Electric itself were stated at approximately
$450,000,000.
In ID40,Associated Gas & Electric Co. and Associated Gas & Electric Corp. filed petitions for reorganization pursuant to chapter X of
the Bankruptcy Act. In 1942, pursuant to the provisions of section
11 (b) (1) of the act, the trustees of Associated Gas & Electric Corp.
were ordered to divest themselves of all their interests in some 114
companies located primarily outside the 3 States of New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, no determination being made at that time
as to the status of the majority of the properties in these last-named
States." Of the 114 companies, 112 have been divested. The two

that remain operate in the Philippine Islands and as to these our
divestment order has been temporarily suspended.
As at January 1, 1946, a comprehensive plan of reorganization of
Associated Gas & Electric Co. and Associated Gas & Electric Corp.
was consummated pursuant to chapter X and section 11 (f) of the
act. In place of the two companies and their many securities there
was substituted a single company, General Public Utilities Corp.,
which had a security structure consisting of 10-year convertible debentures, bank loans, and common stock. The debentures were redeemed
in 1947 and at June 30, 1950, GPU had outstanding only $3,950,000
of notes payable to banks, maturing during the period 1951 to 1955,
and common equity of $120,000,000.
After consummation of the plan of reorganization in 1946, the
assets of GPU consisted primarily of securities of three subholding
companies which in turn controlled the operating utility properties.
Two of these subholding companies have since been dissolved, and
during the past fiscal year, all debt securities of the third company,
Associated Electric Co., totaling over $52,000,000,have been retired.
Funds for this purpose were derived principally from the proceeds of sales made by GPU of its common stock holdings in New
York State Electric & Gas Corp. ($35,282,208), Rochester Gas & Electric Corp. ($22,998,726), and its preferred holdings in Staten Island
Edison Corp. ($4,000,000). With these proceeds, GPU made capital
contributions totaling $49,000,000 to Associated Electric, less the
amount of $1,492,7M representing consideration paid for 107,000 of
its common shares repurchased from Associated Electric and canceled.
In March 1950, the Commission approved the sale by GPU of its
common stock interest in Staten Island Edison Corp. to Consolidated
Edison Co. of New York, Inc. for $10,720,000.In May, it also approved
the merger of Edison Light & Power Co. into Metropolitan Edison
Co. The latter company is a direct subsidiary of GPo.
Since June 1949, section 11 (b) (1) proceedings have been continuing before the Commission for the purpose of determining what further steps should be taken by General Public Utilities to bring its
system mto conformity with the standards of that section. While
these proceedings have been in progress, GPU has completed the
divestment of all of its New York companies and contends that it
should be permitted to retain its present group of subsidiaries in New
Jersey and Pennsylvania as one or more integrated public utility systems and incidental businesses.
International

Hydro-Electric System

At the time of registration, International Hydro-Electric System
(IHES), a Massachusetts voluntary association, owned directly
Gatineau Power Co., a Canadian public utility company, and two
wholesale electric utilities operating in the United States. It also
owned the equity in New England Power Association, which since
its reorganization is known as New England Electric System (NEES).
NEES was a holding company in its own right and while the managements of the two companies were interrelated they functioned separately. Accordingly the reorganizations of the two companies were
bandled in separate proceedings.

SIXTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

75

Originally, IRES had outstanding debentures due in 1944, preferred stock, class A stock, class B stock, and common stock. The
company was in a precarious financial position, having a huge deficit
in its earned surplus account. It performed no functions for its subsidiaries and voting control was vested in the stock junior to the preferred stock. Moreover, NEES, its subsidiary holding company, had
two layers of intermediate holding companies beneath it, with the
result that the corporate structures of both IRES and NEES violated
the "great-grandfather clause" of section 11 (b) (2) of the act.
The Commission initiated proceedings under section 11 (b) (2) with
respect to IRES.
The first important step in these proceedings was
to cause the cancellation of the class B and common stock. Subsequently, in 1942, the Commission directed IHES to liquidate and
and dissolve." However, many system problems had to be resolved
before the portfolio securities of IRES could be distributed. Among
these were litigation of claims on behalf of IHES against its former
parent, International Paper Co., the reor~anization of NEES, and
the merger of IHES's two New York subsidiaries into a single company. These matters were not fully disposed of until 1947, when
the reorganization of NEES was completed and the sum of $10,000,000,
together with other considerations, was finally paid to IHES in settlement of the claims against International Paper Co.
The separate reorganization of NEES was, of itself, a major operation. NEES had five subholding companies, in two tiers, over its
operating subsidiaries. Under a voluntary plan filed under section
11 (e) of the act the subholding companies were eliminated by the retirement of their securities in exchange for cash or new common stock
of NEES.32 NEES emerged from the reorganization with two classes
of securities, debt and common stock, which replaced 18 classes of old
securities. IHES now owns only 8 percent of the common stock of
NEES, and is no longer a holding company with respect to it.
While it is contemplated that NEES will continue indefinitely as a
registered holding company, steps are being taken toward the eventual
liquidation and dissolution of illES.
During the past fiscal year, the
Commission approved the second step of the Trustee's four phase plan
of liquidation. This proposal was designed to eliminate all of IHES
outstanding debentures which had previously been reduced by cash
payments from $1,000 to $600 principal amount per unit. With the
approval of the Commission 33and the United States district court,
the Trustee developed a plan which included (1) an exchange offer
to the holders of the debentures of 600,000 shares of Gatineau Power
Co. common stock, (2) an agreement for the underwriting of the
sale or exchange of a minimum of 340,000 shares of Gatineau common
with an option to the underwriters to purchase the balance of 260,000
shares and (3) the negotiation of a 2-year loan of not more than
$10,000,000to secure the balance of funds required to retire the debentures not surrendered for exchange. Consummation of these transactions occurred at the close of the fiscal year.

SECUR'ITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Long Island Lighting Co.

On March 27, 1936, pursuant to section 3 (a) (1) of the act, the
Commission granted Long Island, as a holding company, and each
of its subsidiary companies as such, an exemption from all the provisions of the act.34 However, on April 21, 1945, pursuant to section
3 (c), the Commission modified the exemption order so as to subject
Long Island and its subsidiary companies to certain provisions of
the act, particularly the reorganization provisions of section 11.35
The order of modification was entered in view of the fact that the
financial situation of Long Island and its subsidiaries had deteriorated
materially since the entry of the exemption order. As the Commission noted in its opinion, Long Island, on December 31, 1935, was not
in arrears on its preferred stock dividends whereas by September 30,
1944, an aggregate of $10,384,075of arrears had accumulated, which
represented unpaid dividends for a period of 6Y2 years. Further,
unpaid dividends on the publicly held preferred stocks of its public
utility subsidiary companies had also accumulated to the extent of
$4,740,699. An analysis of the financial aspects of the system, including the foregoing accumulation of arrears, the grossly inflated property accounts, and the earnings history of the system, caused the
Commission to conclude that the common stock of Long Island exercised voting control of the system with "disproportionately small
investment."
In addition, Long Island, on December 16, 1944, after the Commission had instituted the modification proceeding, had filed in the
officeof the Secretary of State of the State of New York a certificate
of reduction of capital which, among other things, provided for a
reduction of 40 percent in the par value, redemption value, and future
dividend rights of the preferred stock, and for the cancellation of
the then existing common stock and the issuance of 503,800 shares of
new common stock to its preferred and common stockholders on the
basis of 1 share of new common stock for each share of preferred
stock and for each 12 shares of common stock outstanding. Under
such plan of recapitalization, the holders of the preferred stock would
have received 50.38 percent of the new common stock and the holders
of the common stock would have received 49.62 percent of the new
common stock. The Commission commented on the plan, although
the plan was not before it for determination, and the Commission
stated that the plan failed to give adequate recognition to the rights
and claims of the preferred stockholders and that it was extremely
doubtful that the plan cold be found to satisfy the "fair and equitable"
standard of section 11 (e) or that the proposed capital structure could
be approved under other standards of the act.
As a result of certain legal proceedings involving the Commission
and Long Island, none of the certificates contemplated by the certificate of reduction of capital has been issued and none of the accounting
entries contemplated in connection therewith has been made upon its
books." After the Commission entered its order modifying the ex.. 1 S. E. C. 345.

emption of Long Island, the company, on April 23, 1945,filed a notification of registration as a holding company pursuant to section 5 (a)
of the act.
Thereafter, on October 25, 1945, pursuant to section 11 (e), Long
Island filed a plan which, as amended, provided for the consolidation
of itself with its two principal subsidiary public utility companies.
Or, November 9, 1945, the Commission instituted proceedings under
section 11 (b) (2) directed to Long Island and each of its public
utility subsidiary companies in order to determine whether voting
power was unfairly and inequitably distributed among the security
holders of each of the companies and what action, if any, should be
taken.
The two proceedings were consolidated and, on August 25, 1948,
the Commission entered an order in the section 11 (b) (2) proceeding
which ordered each of the companies to be recapitalized on the basis
of a single class of stock, i. e., common stock, and that the new common stock be distributed among the holders of each company's preferred and common stock in a fair and equitable manner."
Subsequently, on November 16, 1949, the Commission approved the
section 11 (e) plan which provided for the consolidation of the three
companies, the resultant consolidated company to have outstanding
only one class of new common stock, which was to be apportioned
among the common stockholders of Long Island and the preferred
stockholders of the three companies." In place of the preferred
stocks of the three companies, having an aggregate par value of
$34,792,200with dividend arrears thereon totaling $27,406,105as at
June 30, 1950, and of old common stock having a stated value of
$3,000,000,the consolidated company would have new common stock
which at June 30,1950, would have a stated value of $33,650,848. The
accounts of the consolidated company would be stated in such form
as to exclude all items in its property accounts in excess of original
cost and all its accounts would be stated in conformity with the requirements of the New York Public Service Commission.
The plan was approved and ordered enforced by the United States
district court on February 17, 1950."9 Upon appeal, by opinion entered June 1, 1950, the court of appeals affirmed the decision on all
issues, except with respect to one item as to which the proceeding was
remanded to the Commission." On July 5, 1950, subsequent to the
close of the fiscal year, upon the filing with the court of appeals by the
Commission of a petition for modification of decision, the court of
appeals modified its former opinion and affirmed the order of the
district court in all respects." A petition for certiorari was filed.
The Middle West Corp.

The Middle West Corp. (Middle West), successor in bankruptcy
to Middle West Utilities Co., registered under the act in December
1935. At that time it had 152 subsidiaries, including 62 electric or

sidiaries were themselves in process of reorganization under the Bankruptcy Act, and these, in turn, controlled an additional 74 of the
system companies. In contrast, Middle West at June 30, 1950 had
divested itself of every subsidiary company except United Public
Service Corp. which is presently in liquidation.
As a result of proceedings under section 11 (b) (1) of the act,
Middle West was ordered in January 1944 to sever its relations with
all properties, operations, and companies except Central Illinois Public
Service Co. and its subsidiaries, and Kentucky Utilities Co. and its
subsidiaries, jurisdiction being reserved to consider the retainability
of these companies."
In 1947, however, the management of Middle West decided to dissolve the corporation and a resolution was presented to stockholders
who voted in favor of the dissolution. Pursuant to this decision,
Middle West distributed to its stockholders its principal assets, consisting of the common stocks of Central Illinois Public Service Co.,
Kentucky Utilities Co., Public Service Co. of Indiana, and Wisconsin
Power & Light CO.43 Many of its smaller properties were sold or
merged into other companies in the system.
In April 1946, the Commission approved the creation of the Central
& South West Corp. system 44 which is comprised of four electric
utility companies of substantial size. The new system was formed by
merging two subholding companies which between them had four outstanding issues of 6 and 7 percent preferred stock with dividend
arrearages totaling about $16,000,000. These shares were retired at
the redemption price plus accrued dividends. The merger also resulted in increasing the combined common equity from 9.5 percent
of total capitalization and surplus to 29.5 percent. The new Central
& South West Corp. continues to be subject to the act as a registered
holdin~ company controlling an integrated electric utility system.
Durmg the past fiscal year, Middle West has completed its divestment program by disposing of its interest in four service companies
and selling its common stockholdings in Upper Peninsula Power
Co. and in Middle West Utilities Co. of Canada, Ltd. In addition,
Sand Springs Water Co., a nonutility subsidiary, sold its water plant
and distribution system and is in process of liquidation. On June 5,
1950, the Commission approved the final plan of Middle West under
which it will make an initial cash distribution to its stockholders and
thereafter seek to convert all remaining assets to cash, in order to
effect a final distribution after December 31, 1951, and bring about
its liquidation and dissolution." This plan was approved by the
United States district court on June 29,1950.

North Carolina, South Carolina, and Colorado. At the time National
registered with the Commission, the total assets of the system
amounted to $6,461,000. Thereafter, through the process of merging
some properties and selling others, the system was reduced to four
subsidiaries,
A final plan under section 11 (e) was filed in June 1949.
The Commission approved the plan on November 30, 1949,46after
which it was ordered enforced by the United States district court.
The plan provided, among other things, for the merger of National
into its subsidiary, National Gas & Oil Corp. (Gas & Oil), and for the
distribution to National's common stockholders, in respect of each
share held, of one share of new common stock of Gas & Oil and onehalf share of new common stock of another subsidiary, National Utilities Co. of Michigan (Michigan).
The plan effected a divorcement of Michigan from the system, eliminated National as a holding company and resulted in Gas & Oil, a
nonutility, becoming the parent of Newark Consumers Gas Co., a utility, and the Fritz Oil & Gas Co., a nonutility.
The surviving Gas &
Oil and its two subsidiaries are all Ohio corporations and operate
within the State of Ohio.
On June 16, 1950, the Commission issued an order exempting Gas
& Oil and its subsidiaries from the provisions of the Holding Company Act pursuant to section 3 (a) (3).41
New England Public Service Co.

New England Public Service Co. (NEPSCO), at the time of its registration, had five major operating subsidiaries, of which two operated
in Maine, one in New Hampshire and two in New Hampshire and Vermont. It also owned, through an industrial subsidiary, five textile
mills, a paper company, and a forest products manufacturing company. The company was heavily overcapitalized, having outstanding
two classes of prior lien preferred stock and, junior thereto, four
classes of preferred stock. All these preferred issues had substantial
dividend arrearages.
As a result of simplification proceedings instituted by the Commission under section 11 (b) (2) of the act, the
company was directed, in 1941, to reorganize on a one-stock basis, or,
in the alternative at its election, to liquidate and dissolve." The
company did not appeal this decision and has elected to dissolve. The
industrial compames were sold for cash. NEPSCO has merged Cumberland County Power & Light Co. into Central Maine Power Co. It
has also caused Public Service Co. of New Hampshire to acquire the
New Hampshire properties of the Twin State Gas & Electric Co. and
Central Vermont Public Service Corp. to acquire the Vermont properties of the Twin State company.
In 1947, the Commission approved a modified plan under section
11 (e) as a result of which NEPSCO paid $100 per share plus accrued
dividends on its outstanding $7 series and $6 series prior lien preferred
stocks and deposited in escrow the difference between these payments
and voluntary redemption values on the two series. The Commission
at that time reserved for future determination the question as to what

additional amounts, if any, should be paid on these shares. In June
1950 it acted on this issue and ordered that the $7 series should receive
an additional payment of $12.25 per share and the $6 series $2.25 per
share, together with compensation for delay in payment at the rate
of 5.5 percent per annum from October 10, 1947.49 Since the close of
the fiscal year application has been made to the United States district
court for enforcement of this order.
In February 1950, a motion was filed with the Commission by counsel
for a protective committee for the holders of preferred stock requesting
an order of the Commission affirmatively directing NEPSCO on or
before May 15, 1950, to sell 200,000 shares of the common stock of
Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, or, in the alternative, a sufficient number of shares of common stock of Central Maine Power Co.
to raise an equivalent sum, and to apply the proceeds of such sale
to the payment of outstanding notes payable to banks which then
aggregated $9,900,000.
Oral argument was held before the Commission on this motion after
which the Commission issued a memorandum opinion 50 in which it
afforded NEPSCO an opportunity to amend a pending declaration
so as to effect a sale. Subsequently, NEPSCO filed a new declaration
proposing to sell, at competitive bidding, 260,000 shares of its holdings
of the common stock of Central Maine Power Co.
Superimposed on NEPSCO is Northern New England Co., a voluntary association, which owns approximately one-third of the former
company's common stock. The Commission has approved a plan for
the partial liquidation of this company by distribution of cash to its
stockholders." At the same time it directed that the company
liquidate and dissolve. Northern New England Co. is awaiting the
filing and approval of a final plan by NEPSCO, in which the participation to be accorded to the common stock of the latter company will
be determined, before it can take the required steps to complete its
liquidation.
Niagara Hudson Power Corp.

In 1942,the Commission instituted proceedings under section 11 (b)
(2) in respect of the Niagara Hudson Power Corp. system at which
time it included 26 corporate entities. Among the more important
problems under section 11 (b) (2) were those related to the system's
western companies, which were subsidiaries of Buffalo Niagara &
Eastern Power Corp. (BNE), a holding company subsidiary of
Niagara Hudson. In June 1944, an order was issued requiring BNE
to recapitalize on a one-stock basis.
BNE and Niagara Hudson then filed plans providing for the consolidation of BNE and certain of its subsidiaries into Buffalo Niagara
Electric Corp. as a surviving company," To accomplish this reorganization, Niagara Hudson used funds totaling approximately
$63,000,000 in retiring the publicly held second preferred stock of
BNE at its call price plus accrued dividends. These funds were obtained from bank loans, treasury cash, and proceeds from the sale of

certain of Niagara Hudson's portfolio securities. The total effect of
plans and refinancing proposals was to eliminate, by June 30, 1949, 13
corporate entities from the system and to simplify security structures
of the remaining subsidiaries.
During the past fiscal year Niagara Hudson carried forward its
program of merger and consolidation which has now resulted in the
formation of one of the largest utility operating companies in the
United States. Preliminary steps in this program included the merger
of Ticonderoga Electric Light & Power Co. into New York Power &
Light Corp. in July 1949; and in September 1949, the mergers of Old
Forge Electric Corp. into Central New York Power Corp. and Union
Bag & Paper Corp. into New York Power & Light Corp.
On January 5,1950, the "Consolidation plan" and the "Dissolution
plan" of Niagara Hudson became effective pursuant to the order of this
Commission 53 and the subsequent order of the United States district
court." An appeal taken in respect to one phase of the "Dissolution
plan" is still in litigation. In accordance with these plans, the principal remaining subsidiaries of Niagara Hudson, Buffalo Niagara
Electric Corp., Central New York Power Corp., and New York Power
& Light Corp., were merged into a new operating utility company,
Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. The common stocks of the former
subsidiaries were converted into shares of Niagara Mohawk which were
then reclassified into class A stock and new common stock.
Niagara Hudson also contributed to Niagara Mohawk its common
stock holdings in its other subsidiaries including Frontier Corp., the
Oswego Canal Co., and St. Lawrence Co., Ltd., together with miscellaneous investments.
The class A stock of Niagara Mohawk was distributed in exchange
for the outstanding preferred stock of Niagara Hudson. Holders of
Niagara Hudson common shares had the right until July 5, 1950,either
to exchange their shares together with a cash payment for shares of
Niagara Mohawk or to retain their shares until the final distribution
of Niagara Hudson's holdings is effected. Cash payments made by
holders effecting the immediate exchange were applied to the repayment of Niagara Hudson's outstanding bank loan.
After the closing date of the exchange period, July 5, 1950,Niagara
Hudson still held 2,209,955 shares of Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.
common stock as compared with 7,473,172shares originally received.
Its bank loan had been reduced from $9,580,000to $1,500,000.
In application for a supplemental order in connection with the
"Dissolution plan," filed after the close of the fiscal year, Niagara Hudson has proposed steps to expedite the liquidation of its remaining
indebtedness and the distribution of its remaining holdings in Niagara
Mohawk. The Commission issued its supplemental order on September 7, 1950 55 approving the final steps in connection with the consummation of the "Dissolution plan," and on September 28, 1950 the
United States District Court of the Northern District of New York
issued its order enforcing the supplemental order of the Commission.

The North American Co.

At its registration in 1937, the North American Co. was the top
holding company in a system, which through several subholding companies, controlled 36 utility and 46 nonutility subsidiaries. Electric
utility operations were conducted by system companies in 10 States
and the District of Columbia; gas utility operations were conducted in
9 States. The consolidated balance sheet of North American and its
subsidiaries showed assets of over $900,000,000,and, through the direct
and indirect ownership of securities, North American controlled an
empire whose aggregate value was stated to be approximately
$2,200,000,000.
During the last 5 years, North American has taken substantial steps
toward compliance with the Commission's section 11 (b) (1) order,
which was issued in 1942.56 By a number of means, including dividend
payments in portfolio securities, outright distribution, the issuance of
p_urchasewarrants to its stockholders and sale at competitive bidding,
North American has disposed of nearly all of its assets except Union
Electric Co. of Missouri, Missouri Power & Light Co., and several
minor nonutility subsidiaries.
Among major interests which have been divested are those in Pacific
Gas & Electric Co., Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., Wisconsin
Electric Power Co., Potomac Electric Power Co., Detroit Edison Co.,
Illinois Power Co., St. Louis County Gas Co., Northern Natural Gas
Co., Des Moines Electric Light Co. and Tllinois Terminal Co.
During the past fiscal year North American sold its interest in the
capital stock of Kansas Power & Light Co. and its holdings in Capital
Transit Co. It distributed its investment in West Kentucky Coal Co.
after transferring a portion of that company's assets to the Poplar
Ridge Coal Co. which was organized as a subsidiary of Union Electric
Co. of M'issouri.
The North American Co. which, concurrently with its divestment
program, eliminated all of its outstanding debt and preferred stock,
has indicated its intention to submit to the Commission 8. plan designed
to effect its merger into Union Electric Co. of Missouri its principal
remaining utility subsidiary. However, no formal application in respect to such a program had been received at the close of the fiscal year.
North Continent Utilities Corp.

North Continent Utilities Corp. registered as a holding company in
1938 and, at that time, owned or controlled nine utility and eight nonutility subsidiary companies. The subsidiaries were engaged in the
electric, gas (manufactured and natural), water, ice, cold storage, coal,
coke, oil, feed, and telephone business. The operations of the subsidiary companies were conducted in seven widely separated States,
Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana.7 and New
Mexico, and in the provinces of Ontario and Alberta, Canada.
In 1943, North Continent filed a plan under section 11 (e) which, as
amended, provided generally for the sale or distribution in kind of its
interests in its subsidiaries and application of the proceeds to the
retirement of its bonds and preferred stock. North Continent had

paid no dividends on its stock for a considerable time prior to a recapitalization effected in 1935 and had paid none thereafter. At the time
the plan was filed the company was faced with the early maturity of its
bonded indebtedness. The plan was consolidated with proceedings
instituted by the Commission and was approved in November 1943,57
the Commission ordering North Continent to take such steps as may
be necessary to cause its' liquidation and dissolution and reserving
jurisdiction with respect of the treatment to be accorded the preferred
and common stockholders.
The plan was enforced by a United States district court shortly
thereafter. 58 Pursuant to the plan, North Continent disposed of six
electric and gas companies, principally by piecemeal sales to cooperatives and municipalities, and two nonutility companies by sales of
securities to the public. North Continent from time to time applied
the proceeds from these sales to the reduction of its bonds and these
were fully retired on July 1, 1947.
In February 1950, the Commission approved a supplemental plan 59
which provided for the allocation of North Continent's assets between
its preferred and common stockholders and for the immediate distribution to its stockholders of all of its available cash and all of its
portfolio securities, except its investment in one foreign public utility
company which was not in distributable form. Pending disposition
of the foreign subsidiary, North Continent was to be recapitalized on
a one-stock basis. This program was ordered enforced by the United
States district court in April and was consummated on June 1, 1950.
Standard Power & Light Corp. and Standard Gas & Electric Co.

The Standard holding company system presented in extreme degree
the evils of corporate pyramiding and scatteration of properties which
the integration and simplification provisions of the act were designed
to eliminate. In 1936, the Standard system consisted of 105 active
companies operating in 20 States and in Mexico; it contained 9 registered holding companies including the 2 top companies, Standard
Power & Light Corp. and its subsidiary, Standard Gas & Electric Co.
By June 30, 1950, the number of active companies had been reduced
to 58 (including 43 street railway companies, which are part of one
transit system) operating in 5 States. The important remaining utility subsidiaries of the system are Duquesne Light Co. (a subsidiary of
Philadelphia Co.), Wisconsin Public Service Corp., and Oklahoma
Gas & Electric Co.
The most significant developments in the Standard system during
the last fiscal year were concerned with subholding companies of Philadelphia Co.
On October 10, 1949, the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia unanimously affirmed an order of the Commission
dated June 1, 1948, issued under section 11 (b) of the act, directing
Philadelphia Co. to dispose of its interests in the gas utility and transportation business and thereafter to liquidate and dissolve."

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In March 1950, Philadelphia Co. effected a reorganization of its
natural gas subsidiaries by transferring its stockholdings in KentuckyWest Virginia Gas Co. and Pittsburgh & West Virginia Gas Co. to
Equitable Gas CO.61and thereafter sold to underwriters the common
stock of Equitable Gas Co. for $45,755,000. Philadelphia Co. utilized
the major portion of the proceeds from this sale to redeem all of its
outstanding funded debt amounting to approximately $36,000,000.
In the reorganization of its former gas subsidiaries, Philadelphia Co.
received $17,500,000principal amount of debentures of Equitable Gas
Co. In June 1950, Philadelphia Co. sold $11,000,000of these debentures utilizing the proceeds to redeem all of its outstanding $6 cumulative preference stock, aggregating $10,000,000in par value. Thus
during the fiscal year Philadelphia Co. eliminated $46,000,000in face
amount of its senior securities.
Substantial progress was also made toward the reorganization of
Philadelphia Co.'s subsidiary, Pittsburgh Railways Co., which has
been in bankruptcy since 1938. Pittsburgh Railways operates the
transit system in the city of Pittsburgh under lease and operating
agreements covering the properties owned by 55 separate corporations.
Philadelphia Co. itself has guaranteed the payment of lease rentals,
bond interest, taxes, and other obligations of some of the underlying
companies. During 1949,hearings were held on a combined plan for
reorganization of the railways system which was filed jointly by Philadelphia Co. and the trustee of Pittsburgh Railways under section 11
of the act and chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act. The plan provides
for the formation of a new company to replace all the existing companies; the security structure of the reorganized company would consist of common stock, not more than $6,000,000principal amount of
first mortgage bonds, and equipment obligations. Under the plan,
Philadelphia Co. would be discharged from its guaranty obligations
and would receive 51 percent of the common stock of the new company.
The balance of the common stock, all the bonds and approximately
$17,000,000of cash would be distributed to the public holders of securities of Pittsburgh Railways and its underliers,
The Commission approved the combined plan on March 27, 1950,
subject to the subsequent reexamination of certain aspects of the
plan 62 and on May 1, 1950, the United States District Court for the
'Vestern District of Pennsylvania entered its order approving the
plan. Thereafter, the plan was submitted to the security holders
for their approval. Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, the
necessary assents to the plan had been secured and it is expected that
the plan will be consummated in the near future.
In October 1949, Standard Gas filed an amended plan for simplification of the corporate structure of the Philadelphia Co. system.
It provided, among other things, for the elimination of the noncallable
preferred stocks of Philadelphia Co. and its inactive subsidiary, The
Consolidated Gas Co. of the City of Pittsburgh. Extensive hearings
were held, but were adjourned pending consummation of the reorganization of the gas properties and the sale of the common stock of
Equitable Gas Co. The plan was thereafter further amended to pro61 Holding Company Act releases NOR.9740 and 9766.

vide for the retirement of all of Philadelphia CO.'s remaining pre.
ferred stocks and the preferred stock of The Consolidated Gas Co.
of the City of Pittsburgh, having aggregate par values of approximately $31,700,000.
Standard Gas & Electric Co. in September H)49, also effected the
sale of 250,000 shares of its common stock holdings in Louisville Gas
& Electric Co. for $7,441,250. Since this reduced Standard's voting
interest in Louisville to less than 10 percent, that company is no
longer a statutory subsidiary in the Standard system.
The United Corp.

The United Corp. registered as a holding company in March 1938,
at which time its portfolio was comprised largely of the common
stock of four holding company subsidiaries. These subsidiaries, with
the percentage of voting control held by United. were as follows: The
United Gas Improvement Co., 26.2 percent; Public Service Corp. of
New Jersey, 13.9 percent; Niagara Hudson Power Corp., 23.4 percent; and Columbia Gas & Electric Corp. (now the Columbia Gas
System, IInc.), 19.6 percent.
In June 1941, the Commission instituted proceedings with respect
to United under sections 11 (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2) of the act. At
that time the 125 companies in the United system operated in 22
States and in Canada. Their combined total assets approximated
$2,765,000,000. Subsequently, the Commission by order dated August
]4, 1943, directed United to change its existing capitalization, which
consisted of preferred and common stocks, to one class of stock and
to cease to be a holding company."
United has since retired all of its preferred stock by exchanging
therefor certain portfolio securities and cash. Through the retirement of its preferred stock and sales of pOltfolio securities, United
reduced its 'percentage of voting securities to 7.7 percent in UGI,
6.41 percent III Columbia and 5.71 percent in Public Service. Through
the reorganization of Public Service it had, however, acquired another subsidiary, South Jersey Gas Co., 28 percent of whose voting
securities it now holds.
On October 20, 1949, the Commission approved a plan filed by
United whereby it distributed to its stockholders, as a special dividend,
one-tenth of a share of common stock of its subsidiary, Niagara Hudson Power Corp., for each share of United common." This distribution reduced United's holdings of the outstanding voting securities
of Niagara Hudson from '28.5 percent to 14.1 percent. Approval
of this plan was granted on condition that United undertake to file
promptly a comprehensive plan under section 11 (e) detailing the
remaining steps to be taken, and the timing thereof, to complete

filed in December 1949.
Among the provisions contained in this proposed program, was
the exchange by United of its holdings of preferred stock in Niagara
Hudson for the class A stock of its successor, Niagara Mohawk Power
Corp., and the exchange of its common holdings in Niagara Hudson,

together with the requisite amount of cash, for new common shares
of Niagara Mohawk. It also proposed the prompt sale of the Niagara
Mohawk class A stock to be received by United. These transactions
were approved by Commission orders Issued in February and April
1950.65 Jurisdiction was reserved on other matters and the plan
has been amended several times since initial filing.
As amended, the pending proposals include (1) the sale by United
of its entire interest in South Jersey Gas Co.; (2) an offering to each
qualified common stockholder of United, owning 99 shares or less,
to purchase his shares for cash; (3) an offering to holders of more
than 100 shares to exchange their stock for the common shares of
Niagara Mohawk; and (4) the sale by United of sufficient shares of
its holdings in the Columbia Gas System, Inc., the United Gas Improvement Co. and Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. to reduce its holdings in each to not in excess of 4.9 percent of the voting stock
outstanding.
The United Light & Railways Co.

On February 18, 1938, the United Light & Power Co. registered
as a holding company with a system comprised of 10 holding companies, 7 of which were registered holding companies, 21 electric and
gas utility subsidiaries, 20 nonutility subsidiaries, and a service company. In 1941 the Commission directed the dissolution of United
Light & Power Co. and United American Co., a subholding company."
Bya subsequent order the Commission directed the divestment of the
interests of United Light & Power Co. and the subholding companies
in 22 subsidiaries in order to comply with the standards of section
11 of the act.6T
After a series of transactions designed to enable United Light &
Power to comply with the outstanding order of dissolution, the Commission approved a plan which provided, in substance, for the distribution of United Light & Power's remaining investment, the
common stock of United Light & Railways Co., to its common stockholders." The residual net assets of United Light & Power were
transferred to United Railways, and United Light & Power was dissolved. Thus, United Railways became the system's top holding company with two principal subholding company systems, Continental
Gas & Electric Corp., and American Light & Traction Co.
In June 1947 United Railways and American Light filed a plan
which provided, among other things, for the divestment by United
Railways of its entire interest in American Light and the continuation of the latter as a registered holding company "controlling" an integrated gas utility system. American Light had, in the interim,
embarked on a program to finance -and construct a la.rge interstate
natural gas pipeline from the operating areas of its natural gas subsidiaries to fields in the Hugoton area. Other more important provisions of the plan provided for the divestment of the common stock
of Detroit Edison Co. and Madison Gas & Electric Co. held by American Light and United Railways and the retirement of the preferred

stocks of the two holding companies. After appeals were taken by
two stockholders, this plan was approved by the court of appeals in
November 194869 and consummated early in 1949. American Light
changed its name and is now known as the American Natural Gas Co.
In February 1949, United Railways and Continental publicly announced their intention to liquidate and dissolve and a plan under
section 11 (e) was accordingly filed with the Commission. On December 30, 1949, the plan was approved by the Commission subject to
certain amendments including provision for cumulative voting rights
and the listing on a national securities exchange of the subsidiary
stocks being distributed within 6 months after the date they became
available for distribution."
The company filed appropriate amendments to comply with these requirements.
Pursuant to the plan, the common stocks of St. Joseph Light &
Power Co. and Iowa Power & Light Co. have been distributed and the
stock of Kansas City Power & Light Co. has been sold to the stockholders of United Railways pursuant to a rights offering. In addition, two mining company investments have been disposed of and
Continental has been liquidated. Subsequent to the close of the
fiscal year, distribution of the stocks of Eastern Kansas Utilities, Inc.
and Iowa-Illinois Gas & Electric Co. was also effected. In connection
with each of these divestments certain other transactions have been
required which were designed to strengthen the capital structures of
those operating utilities being freed from holding company control.
THE CONTINUING BOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS

Although enforcement of the Holding Company Act is bringing
about the complete liquidation of many of the multitiered and widely
scattered holding-company systems of the past, it will not eliminate
the holding company as a useful corporate device in the public utility
field. A holding company system which can measure up to the physical integration and corporate simplification requirements of section
11 (b) is expressly permitted by the act to function and develop as
a regional system. Such a system, of course, remains subject to the
general, regulatory jurisdiction of the Commission with respect to
financing, intercompany transactions, servicing arrangements, and
other transactions in order to insure that there will be no recurrence
of those abuses which reduced the holding company to a state of public
disfavor prior to passage of the act.
A number of the continuing systems have completed their compliance programs; others still have important problems to solve. It
has been estimated that about 20 regional systems with aggregate
assets of $6 or $7 billion will remain permanently subject to the act.
In general, these continuing systems are of three major types. The
first is the electric holdinp company system, which usually consists
of one holding company above a number of interconnected electric
operating companies. In this category one finds such systems as those
of the American Gas & Electric Co., Central and South West Corp.,
the Southern Co., and Middle South Utilities, Inc .

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The second type is the natural gas holding company system which
may control gas transmission as well as gas distribution companies.
Typical of this group are Columbia Gas System, Inc., American
Natural Gas Co., and Consolidated Natural Gas Co.
The third type is the operating-holding company system. The holding company in this group derives a substantial portion of its total
income from its own utility operations, but also has one or more subsidiary operating companies. The Delaware Power & Light Co.,
Ohio Edison Co., and Interstate Power Co. are representative of this
type.
The holding company system can be justified as a continuing enterprise only if Its component companies are knit together as a compact
group having basic functional relationships with one another. There
must be a showing of important economies from group operation, and,
in addition, each system should be able to meet the problems of plant
expansion and to undertake the requisite financing on a sound and
economical basis. Because it must approve all proposals for financing
and supervise servicing arrangements and intercompany transactions,
the Commission retains substantial jurisdiction over these systems.
The following summaries provide a review of the more important
actions taken by the Commission during the past year in respect to
several of the continuing holding-company systems. At this point
it should be emphasized that a number of these systems still have
residual problems to be solved under sections 11 (b) (1) and 11 (b)
(2), and, in one or two cases, registered holding companies may eventually be able to qualify for exemption from the act pursuant to the
provisions of section 3 (a).
American Gas & Electric Co.

With consolidated assets of over $750,000,000, American Gas &
Electric Co. is the largest of the continuing holding company systems. Its operations, almost wholly electric, extend over a seven State
area from Kentucky to Michigan. As in other systems, the rapid
post war expansion of electric power demand has required the operating subsidiaries of American to carry forward a tremendous program
of new construction. This, in turn, has been accomplished by the
undertaking of a large amount of financing by the subsidiary operating companies. Before granting approval of $18,000,000 of bank
borrowings by one major subsidiary, Appalachian Electric Power
Co., the Comrnission in July 1949 gave careful consideration to the
over-all financmg program of American as well as to the program of
Appalachian and devoted particular attention to the responsibility
and intentions of the holding company to preserve the balance of
underlying equity in the system.
American, in response to this inquiry, placed before the Commission the details of its 3-year construction and financing program
amounting to more than $250,000,000. Proposed financing included
$86,000,000of mortgage bond offerings, $10,500,000of temporary bank
loans, and common stock financing to the extent of 913,150 shares.
The Commission observed that the financing program" * * *
appears feasible and sound in the light of the standards of the act." 71

An important step in this program was taken with the sale in October
1949 of 498,081 shares of its common shares by means of a rights
offering. Of the proceeds derived from this sale approximately $20,000,000 was earmarked for investment in the equity of Appalachian
Electric Power CO.72 The balance was to be used for equity investments in other subsidiaries and for other purposes. American contemplates the sale of the additional common shares in 1951.
In past years, American has effected several acquisitions of property in the interest of rounding out its service area. This program
was continued during the fiscal year 1950 when its subsidiary, Indiana
& Michigan Electric Co., negotiated an exchange of electric properties
with its nonaffiliated neighbor, Public Service Co. of Indiana. The
exchange of properties was arranged to promote more efficientservice
in each of the companies and to achieve certain economies of operation." Another subsidiary, the Ohio Power Co., purchased from
Public Service Co. of Indiana its interest in Union City Electric Co.
for a cash consideration of $294,000.74
In April 1950, the Commission approved the sale by American of
$27,000,000 of serial notes with maturities of $500,000 in each of the
years 1952 to 1955 and $2,500,000 in each of the years 1956 to 1965. 75
Proceeds of the issue were used by American to redeem the company's
151,623 shares of outstanding preferred stock as well as to repay
$10,300,000 of outstanding serial bank loan notes. The Commission
noted, among other things, that while it generally disfavors the
issuance of senior securities by holding companies, having subsidiaries with publicly-held senior securities, the pending issue was, in
effect a, replacement of senior securities already outstanding. It,
noted also that the effect of the gradual retirement of debt would be
to improve the consolidated capitalization ratios of the system and
the end result would be the elimination of all corporate debt from
the capital structure of American.
American Natural Gas Co.

On December 30, 1947, the Commission approved a plan pursuant
to section 11 (e) of the act which provided, in part, that American
Light & Traction Co. (now American Natural Gas Co.) would be
divested by its former parent, United Light & Railways Co. and
would undergo a comprehensive reorganization of its capital structure. 76 American also proposed to retire its 6 percent noncallable
preferred stock, divest itself of certain nonretainable holdings and
make a substantial investment in a newly organized gas transmission
pipeline (Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co.) which was to bring
natural gas from the Hugoton field in Texas to the gas utility subsidiaries of American.
The past 3 years have witnessed the consummation of these proposals and the rapid growth of Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co.
as a major long-distance transmission system. Because of the heavy
cash requirements and the absence of earnings income during the

construction period, the debt financing of Michigan-Wisconsin presented the Commission with difficult regulatory problems. In this
instance, it permitted the initial bonding of property at 75 percent
of net bondable value instead of the 60 percent rate usually required;
it also granted an exemption from competitive bidding and permitted
private placement of $66,000,000 of first mortgage bonds,"
The first phase of this program is now substantially completed
but American plans to expand the capacity of Michigan-Wisconsin
and to undertake other system construction which, in total, will
amount to approximately $110,000,000 for the 2-year period 1950-51.
This, in turn, will require some $70,000,000 of additional system
financing to be undertaken, subject to Commission approval.
In line with this rapid growth, American increased its common
equity in November 1949 through the sale by means of a rights offering to common stockholders of 276,805 additional shares. A second
offering of 380,607 shares was pending at the close of the fiscal year.
On July 25, 1950, the Commission also permitted American's subsidiary, Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co., to enter a credit agreement with banks to cover note borrowing up to $20,000,000. This is
an interim step after which it is contemplated that additional bonds
and common stock will be issued by the company. 79
On January 24, 1950, the Commission approved the organization
of American Natural Gas Service Co. and conduct of its business as
a subsidiary service company in the American Natural holding coml)any system," The order was conditioned in several respects, however, to enable the Commission to review the company's cost
allocations and operations at any future time and, if necessary, after
notice and opportunity for hearing, to revoke, suspend, or modify
the permission granted to continue operations.

Central and South West Corp.

Central and South West Corp. and its four electric utility subsidiaries were divested by Middle West Corp. in 1947 and have operated
since that time as a separate holding company system, having complied
with the integration and simplification requirements of section 11.
They served a four-State area including communities in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas.
To keep pace with the increased demand for electric service, the
Central and South West system expended over $33,000,000 during the
past fiscal year for new construction.
To finance this program some
$17,000,000 of senior securities were sold by the utility subsidiaries and
the parent company in November 1949 undertook its second common
stock rights offering which yielded approximately $9,000,000 in proceeds." As a result of this step, common stock equity of the system
was increased to 34 percent of total capitalization and surplus.

engaged in the production, transmission, and distribution of natural
gas in an area embracing seven States and the District of Columbia.
Prior to the issuance of orders by the Commission under section 11 of
the act, Columbia Gas was a subsidiary of the United Corp. and, in
addition to its gas properties, controlled through subsidiaries substantial electric facilities in Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. The holdings
of the United Corp. have since been reduced to less than 10 percent and
divestment of Columbia's electric properties was completed in 1946.
Columbia is expected to continue as a registered holding company
system.
Financing procedure in the Columbia system differs somewhat from
that of many other holding company systems. Instead of permitting
subsidiary companies to undertake public senior financing when necessary Columbia retains complete ownership of all outstanding securities
of its operating subsidiaries. Public financing of the system, both in
respect to debt and equity requirements, is provided at the holding
company level. Thus, the senior securities of Columbia Gas take the
form of unsecured debentures having a broad claim on all system
properties rather than the mortgage bond form generally employed
by operating companies for debt financing. The Commission has approved this arrangement as long as overall system capitalization ratios
are maintained in accordance with statutory standards.
During the postwar period, the Columbia system has carried forward
an aggressive program of developing sources of gas supplies and
expanding its transmission service and distribution facilities. It is
presently initiating service to the city of Baltimore, Md.; Charlottesville, W. Va.; and Poughkeepsie, Newburg, Beacon, and Kingston in
the State of New York. Other connections are in prospect.
This growth is reflected in its active program of financing which
has continued without interruption.
In January 1950, the Commission approved the sale by Columbia of 304,998 shares of its common
stock. 82 On June 13, 1950, Commission approval was granted to
Columbia to issue $110,000,000 principal amount of debentures due
1975. Proceeds of this offering were to be used in part for refunding
purposes; the balance for construction." Another declaration proposing an additional offering of $90,000,000of debentures was filed with
the Commission and approved by it just after the close of the fiscal
year.54
Consolidated Natural Gas Co.

Consolidated Natural Gas Co. was organized in 1942 by Standard
Oil Co. of New Jersey. Standard Oil then transferred to Consolidated its holdings in certain operating subsidiaries engaged in the
transmission and distribution of natural gas. By a subsequent distribution of its holdings in Consolidated, Standard Oil completed
divestment of its utility properties."
Consolidated is expected to continue as a registered holding company system. It has operations in West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York and reports assets in excess of $360,000,000.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Though the system has shared fully in the postwar growth of the
natural gas industry, it has not been required to do as much public
financing as other systems. This factor is explained in part by the
conservative dividend policy of the management which has retained
out of net income approximately $20,000,000during the past 3-year
period.
However, Consolidated has sold, with Commission approval, 545,672 shares of common stock with net proceeds of $20,270,000in July
1947,and $30,000,000of debentures in 1948. In March 1950,the Commission approved the additional sale by Consolidated, pursuant to a
loan agreement with four commercial banks, of an aggregate of $14,000,000of promissory notes to be issued during 1950.S6 This borrowing was undertaken as an interim step in Consolidated's long-range
financing program. Proceeds will be used primarily to finance the
construction and gas-storage programs of two of the operating subsidiaries. Consolidated had almost no indebtedness prior to the postwar expansion program, and, even with the $54,000,000 of debt
incurred during the past year, the present debt ratio of the system
remains under 20 percent.
Delaware Power & Light Co.

Delaware Power & Light Co. is an operating-holding company subject to Commission jurisdiction because of its operations through subsidiaries in Maryland and Virginia. Delaware was formerly a
subsidiary of United Gas Improvement Co., but achieved independent
status in 1943with the distribution by the latter of its stockholdings
in the company.
Substantial growth in recent years has necessitated considerable
financing activity by Delaware and, beginning in 1947, the Commission approved five proposals submitted by the company. In March
1947, the company sold $5,000,000of preferred stock at competitive
bidding. This was followed by another $5,000,000in July 1949 together with $10,000,000of mortgage bonds. Offerings of additional
common stock to shareholders were made in February 1949and again
in April 1950 with proceeds aggregating over $9,000,000. These offerings enabled Delaware, while proceeding with necessary debt financing, to retain a ratio of common equity to total capitalization and
surplus in excess of 33 percent.
Interstate Power Co.

Interstate Power Co. is an operating-holding company which together with its two subsidiaries is engaged principally in the electric
utility business in Minnesota, Iowa, South Dakota, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Pursuant to a plan filed under section 11 (e) of the act,
Interstate underwent a complete financial reorganization in March
1948.S7 Prior to this, the company was burdened with a very topheavy capital structure, including excessive indebtedness and preferred stocks with large dividend arrearages.
Through operation of the reorganization plan, the former parentsubsidiary relationship existing between Ogden Corp. and Interstate

was eliminated and 944,961shares of Interstate's new common shares
were placed in escrow for the benefit of the holders (including Ogden)
of its old securities junior to its old mortgage bonds. Proceedings
relating to the plan for distribution of these escrowed shares are still
inlrogress before the district court and the Commission.
lthough Interstate's reorganization of March 1948 resulted in a
substantially improved financial position, the exigencies of that reorganization nevertheless still left the company's capital structure far
from ideal. This situation required that subsequent security sales
by Interstate be carefully scrutinized by the Commission to assure
that each successive financing operation, in connection with the company's large construction program, would bring about a strengthening of Interstate's common stock equity, preserve its financial integrity, and facilitate the economical financing of its expanding business.
In November 1949, Interstate's new money requirements were met,
with Commission approval, by the sale of 300,000shares of additional
common stock." In May 1950, after extensive preliminary conferences with the Commission's staff, the company consummated a broad
financing program, which not only satisfied its capital requirements,
but greatly strengthened its capital structure. This undertaking
included the sale of $3,000,000of mortgage bonds, 100,000shares of
new preferred stock and 275,000shares of additional common stock."
Proceeds were applied, in part, for construction needs and also to the
retirement of certain outstanding debt securities. In addition, Interstate successfully negotiated with the holder of its $5,000,000 outstanding 4% percent Debentures for a reduction of interest rate to
3%, percent.
The rapid improvement in the company's credit rating is clearly
indicated by a comparison of the annual interest cost of 4.5 percent
on its mortgage bonds sold in October 1948 with those sold III May
1950 at a cost of 2.9 percent. This substantial change is due in large
part to the fact that, in the period following Interstate's reorganization in 1948, its common equity, after giving effect to the sale of
common stock in May 1950, has increased from 17 percent to 26.5
percent of total capitalization and surplus. If the new preferred
issue is included, aggregate underlying equity as a percentage of
capitalization and surplus has now reached 37.6 percent.
Middle South Utilities, Inc.

Middle South Utilities, Inc. is a registered utility holding company
serving through its subsidiaries a three-State area including Arkansas,
Louisiana, and western Mississippi. "Whileits revenues are derived
predominantly from sales of electricity, it is also engaged in the sale
of natural gas and in transportation operations. The company was
organized in May 1949 and acquired from Electric Power & Light
Corp., the latter's holdings in four subsidiary utility companies and
a small land company. Since the divestment by Electric and its
parent, Electric Bond & Share Co., of their holdings in the company,

tute such further proceedings under section 11 (b) with respect to
Middle South as it may consider necessary or appropriate.
The construction program of the Middle South system has been estimated to require expenditures over the 2-year period 1950-51 of more
than $92,000,000. To finance the initial portion of these requirements,
Middle South sold 640,000shares of its common stock in January 1950
for which it received net proceeds of $11,868,000.90 In June 1950,
the Commission approved additional financing proposals. These included the sale of mortgage bonds by two subsidiaries, the sale of new
preferred stock by three subsidiaries and an offer by Middle South to
holders of outstanding preferred in the three subsidiaries to exchange
new shares of Middle South common for shares of outstanding preferred." The sale of new preferred by the subsidiaries and the exchange offer by Middle South were proposed primarily to facilitate
elimination of the high dividend preferred stocks of three subsidiaries
and to provide funds for construction.
After submitting both the bond and preferred stock offerings to
competitive bidding, sales of the two subsidiary bond issues were consummated promptly, yielding approximately $13,500,000in proceeds.
However, all bids on the preferred offerings were rejected as not representing fair value for the securities offered. This, in turn, caused
Middle South to request a suspension of action on other related proposals until a further amendment could be filed.
National Fuel Gas Co.

The construction program of National Fuel Gas Co., unlike most
systems, has been on a modest scale and has not required any long-term
financing during the past year. However, progress has been made in
further simplifying the system by effecting a reduction in the number
of subsidiary corporate entities and effecting through mergers and
consolidations a number of operating economies,
On June 15, 1949 the Commission approved the merger of Iroquois
Gas Corp. a gas utility subsidiary of National, with Wanakah Gas
Corp., its wholly owned gas utility subsidiary." The merger was
effected on November 18, 1949. On August 12, 1949, the Commission
also approved the dissolution of Hanover Gas Corp., a small producing subsidiary and the distribution of its remaining assets to National."
In June 1950,National and five of its utility subsidiaries filed a joint
declaration proposing the merger of the five subsidiaries into one gas
utility company. On June 30, 1950, the Commission approved certain transactions proposed to be effected prior to the merger and
reserved jurisdiction over all other aspects of the proposed trans.
actions."

1947 and, since that time, it has been confronted with the need for
extensive system expansion, which is not expected to be completed
until 1952.
Of direct concern to the Commission has been the approach of the
system to its problems of permanent financing for this construction.
In the middle of 1948 and early 1949, the Commission permitted 23
of the subsidiary companies to borrow on promissory notes as a temporary step in the financing program." It was represented at that
time that the subsidiaries would obtain a substantial amount of cash
to retire a portion of their note indebtedness from the sale of common
stock to NEES, and that NEES would purchase these shares, in part,
out of proceeds derived from the sale of its own common stock.
In 1949,however, NEES indicated that, while it contemplated the
issuance of common stock, it was not able to state when additional
stock would be sold nor the amount to be sold. In April 1949, the
Commission reconsidered its approval of the issuance of the promissory notes and ordered 96 that NEES, and the subsidiary companies
involved show cause why its order should not be amended to the
extent necessary to terminate, in whole or in part, its authorization
with respect to notes not already issued, or to impose additional terms
and conditions with respect to such notes. In a memorandum
opinion 97 the Commission stated that the system had financed its
needs almost wholly by the issuance of debt securities and stated
that NEES should sell additional common stock. Subsequently, as
part of its financing program for the current fiscal year, NEES made
a public offering of common stock in the amount of $7,029,000.
Subsequent to this offering, NEES submitted a general financing
program proposing the sale of $7,500,000 of convertible preferred
stock and $5,000,000 of debentures by the parent company. In a
second memorandum opinion dated September 29, 1949,98the Commission found that the proposal was faulty in failing to provide for
additional common equity to balance the large amount of senior
securities proposed to be issued. It indicated that a minimum acceptable position might be reached if the $7,500,000now proposed to
be raised through convertible preferred stock were raised instead
through the sale of additional common shares.
New England Gas & Electric Association

New England Gas & Electric Association (NEGEA), a Massachusetts trust, registered as a holding company in 1938. Because
of a top-heavy capital structure, which included five debenture issues
and two classes of preferred shares with large arrearages, the Commission instituted section 11 (b) (2) proceedings against NEGEA
in September 1941.99 Added to the capitalization problem was the
presence of a complex situation involving claims and counterclaims
between NEGEA and the trustees of Associated Gas & Electric Co.

an alternate to the initial plan of recapitalization.'?" was approved
by the Commission and consummated in April 1947.101 It is expected
that NEGEA, which now has a simplified capital structure, more
equitable voting rights for stockholders and restated investment accounts, will continue as a holding company system.
Like other systems, NEGEA is presently carrying on an extensive
construction program to meet additional demands for service and
to replace existing property. An estimate of net additions to be
made in the period from 1949to 1952totals approximately $23,700,000.
On September 16, 1949,the Commission approved the sale by NEGEA
of 124,601 shares of additional common stock for approximately
$1,400,000. At the same time it approved the sale of notes by seven
subsidiaries.>" A second sale of 173,126common shares with proceeds
of $2,500,000was approved by the Commission in May 1950.103 Proceeds of the second stock sale were used by NEGEA to acquire additional common stock in its subsidiaries. Proceeds of the prior sale
were used to retire outstanding bank debt previously incurred by
the parent company for the same purpose.
During the past fiscal year, NEGEA participated with two other
nonaffiliated companies in the organization of the Algonquin Gas
Transmission CO.'04 The new company was organized for the purpose
of building or participating in the building of a pipeline for the transmission of natural gas from points in New York, New Jersey, or
Connecticut to the New England area. Participating with New England Gas & Electric are Eastern Gas & Fuel Associates and the Providence Gas Co. Other gas companies in New England have also been
invited to invest in the new enterprise.
Northern Natural Gas Co.

The primary business of Northern Natural Gas Co. is the purchase,
transmission, and wholesale distribution of natural gas which is
carried from gas fields in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas to utility companies located principally in Minnesota, Iowa, and Nebraska. The
company has one wholly owned gas utility subsidiary, Peoples Natural
Gas Co., and as a holding company is therefore subject to regulation
by this Commission. On September 25,1950, however, Northern filed
an application with this Commission pursuant to section 3 (a) (3)
seeking exemption for itself as a holding- company and for each subsidiary thereof as such from the provisions of the act.
Financing undertaken by the company to meet its construction needs
has been planned so as to preserve the substantial equity ratio which
has been a characteristic of the system for many years. Thus, in
March 19-19.the company sold 406,000 common shares pursuant to a
rights offering and realized gross proceeds of $11,977,000.'05
Again
in May HJ50, all additional 304,500shares were sold in the same manner
yielding proceeds of $9,5l.J1,750ylG Subsequent thereto, the company

of 2% percent serial debentures after approval was granted by the
Commission on May 29, 1950.107
Northern States Power Co.

Northern States Power Co. is a holding operating company engaged, either directly or through subsidiaries, in the electric and gas
business in the States of Minnesota, 'Wisconsin, North Dakota, and
South Dakota. Incorporated in Minnesota, it was formerly controlled
by a company of the same name, organized in Delaware. The latter
company was dissolved in December 1949.10S
The construction program of Northern States (Minnesota), which in
1947 was expected to amount to $96,000,000over a 5-year period, has
since been increased to the present estimate for the same period of
$160,000,000. During 1948 and 1949, mortgage bonds and preferred
stocks totaling $55,000,000were issued by the system. Since the system had been financed for some time by the sale of senior securities,
the staff of the Commission indicated its concern over the prospective
deterioration of the system's capital structure and its lack of equity
financing. Before the issuance of bonds was approved by the Commission, Northern States amended its declaration stating that it would
offer common stock within the succeeding few months. On November
17,1949, the company, with Commission approved, made a rights offering of 1,584,238 shares to its stockholders. The offering yielded
proceeds of $16,238,677.109
During the past fiscal year Northern States also accomplished a
further step in the simplification of its system. Two subsidiaries, Interstate Light & Power Co. (Delaware) and Interstate Light & Power
Corp. (Illinois) were merged with and into a third subsidiary, the
Elizabeth Light & Power Co. Upon effectuation of the merger in
August 1949, the name of the surviving company was changed to
Interstate Light & Power Co. The latter company will continue as
a direct subsidiary of Northern States.>"
Ohio Edison Co.

Upon consummation of the section 11 (e) plan of Commonwealth
& Southern Corp. on October 1, 1949,1llOhio Edison Co. became an

independent operating-holding company, subject to the jurisdiction
of this Commission by virtue of its stock ownership in Pennsylvania
Power Co., its only subsidiary.
Shortly after its divestment by Commonwealth & Southern Corp.,
Ohio Edison made application to acquire from Cities Service Co., at
a cost of $35,000,000,the latter's holdings in Ohio Public Service Co.
common stock as an initial step in a program to merge Ohio Public
Service into Ohio Edison. Funds for this purchase were to be derived from an underwritten offering of additional common stock by
Ohio Edison, subject to a rights offering to existing common stockholders. Ohio Edison also proposed an exchange offer of its com.

mon stock for shares of Ohio Public Service common stock held by
the public.
In addition to financial problems posed by this application and
declaration of Ohio Edison, substantial questions were present under
section 10 (c) (2) of the act which provides that the Commission
shall not approve an acquisition of securities unless it finds that "such
acquisition will serve the public interest by tending towards the
economical and efficient development of an integrated public utility
system." On December 2, 1949, the Commission issued its findings
and opinion approving the proposed transactions.'> In reaching
this decision, the Commission considered among other things, the fact
that the operating areas of the two companies were contiguous for
some 200 miles. Some interconnections had been made in the past
and combined operation offered many possibilities for additional tieins. Evidence indicated that substantial economies could be effected
through coordination of facilities and unified operations. Although
the resultant system would be a large one, the Commission noted the
populous and highly industrialized area of its operations and found
it "not so large as to impair the advantages of localized management,
efficient operation, and effectiveness of regulation."
In February 1950, after acquiring- about 97 percent of the common
stock of Ohio Public Service, Ohio Edison filed an application-declaration for authority to merge the two companies. This proposal involved the assumption of the debt of Public Service by Ohio Edison,
an exchange of Ohio Edison preferred stock for Public Service preferred stock, and an exchange of Ohio Edison common stock for the .
remaining publicly held common stock of Public Service. The proposals were approved by the Commission on March 29, 1950,= and
were consummated shortly thereafter. The resultant Ohio Edison
Co. and its subsidiary, Pennsylvania Power Co., have a combined
gross utility plant of about $306,000,000and annual operating revenues approximating $80,000,000.
The Southern Co.

Like Ohio Edison Co., the Southern Co. became an independent
holding company upon consummation of the section 11 (e) plan of
the Commonwealth & Southern Corp. in October 1949. The integrated electric system which it controls furnishes service, through
four electric utility subsidiaries, in Georgia, Alabama, Florida, and
Mississippi. Consolidated system assets are about $615,000,000and
annual electric revenues are in excess of $115,000,000. It is second
largest of the continuing holding company systems.
During the calendar year 1949, capital expenditures for the system
total $57,345,000and the company expects to make additional expenditures during the period 1950-52 of approximately $197,000,000. This
rapid rate of expansion has given rise to substantial financing problems
during the past fiscal year and will pose similar recurring problems
for the management and the Commission in the years ahead. In
November 1949, the Commission approved the sale by Southern of

1,500,000 additional shares of its common stock.'> Proceeds realized
from this sale at competitive bidding were in excess of $17,300,000.
As
a result of this sale consolidated common stock equity in relation to
total capitalization and surplus was raised from 26 percent to 29
percent.
In the early months of 1950, bond financings were carried out by
three of the subsidiaries and at the close of the fiscal year there was
pending a declaration filed by Southern covering the proposed sale of
1,000,000 additional common shares to assist further in the financing of
construction expenditures by the subsidiaries. After a temporary
postponement due to unsettled market conditions, this sale was consummated in October 1950 with proceeds of approximately $10,950,000.
Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, the Southern Co., together
with Electric Bond & Share Co., filed applications and declarations
proposing, among other things, that Southern acquire from Bond &
Share the latter's common-stock holding in Birmingham Electric Co.
through an exchange of the Southern Co.'s common shares. The exchange proposal was also to be made to the public stockholders of
Birmingham. Alabama Power Co., a subsidiary of the Southern Co.,
proposed to acquire the outstanding shares of Birmingham's preferred
stock through an exchange offer of its own preferred. Other steps
contemplated the eventual disposition by Birmingham Electric of its
transportation properties and the acquisition of that company's electric
properties by Alabama Power through merger, liquidation or otherwise. Approval of these transactions was granted by the Commission
on August 24,1950.115
On September 23, 1949, the Commission approved Southern Services, Inc. as a mutual service company for the Southern system.v"
While an appropriate showing was made that Southern Services
would be operated economically and efficiently for the benefit of the
companies which it proposes to serve, the Commission conditioned its
order in several respects to permit a review of its cost allocations and
operations at any future time.
Utah Power & Light Co.

Utah Power & Light Co. was removed from the control of Electric
Power & Light Corp. as a result of its recapitalization plan approved
by the Commission in 1945.117 The company is an operating-holding
company, subject to Commission jurisdiction by virtue of its ownership of securities in Western Colorado Power Co.
The expansion program of Utah Power & Light and its subsidiary
calls for expenditures of $61,000,000 during the period 1949 to 1953.
During the past fiscal year, the parent company sold $3,000,000 of
mortgage bonds with Commission approval, as well as 148,155 common
shares marketed pursuant to a rights offering to stockholders with
proceeds of $3,481,000.l1s In March 1950, the company received
authorization to borrow up to $10,000,000 from banks on a short-term

basis.u9 It was indicated that subsequent permanent financing to be
undertaken later in 1950 would include the sale of additional common
stock as well as mortgage bonds.
The West Penn Electric Co.

The West Penn Electric Co. is the parent company in a utility system which derives about 90 percent of its revenues from sales of electric
power and services a territory located principally in Pennsylvania,
West Virginia, and Maryland, also in small adjacent sections of Ohio
and Virginia. West Penn was formerly a subsidiary of American
Water Works &, Electric Co., which was liquidated in January 1948.120
During the past fiscal year, .West Penn has consummated a number
of transactions designed to simplify the corporate structure of the
system and, in addition, a thorough-going recapitalization of the
parent company was successfully completed. Prior to July 1949, the
common stock of West Penn Power Co. and the common stock of
Monongahela Power Co., two of the three principal utility subsidiaries
of West Penn, were held in two separate blocks within the system.
Two-thirds of West Penn Power's common stock was owned by West
Penn and 27.9 percent by West Penn Railways, with a small percentage
publicly held; 45.3 percent of the common stock of Monongahela was
owned by 'Vest Penn and 54.7 percent by West Penn Power. As a
result of the section 11 (e) plan approved by the Commission on July
28, 1949,121
all of the cross holdings of stock in West Penn Power and
Monongahela have now been eliminated and all shares held by the
system are owned by West Penn. In addition, the same plan provides
for an accounting reorganization of West Penn Railways and the
elimination of substantial inflation in the statement of its assets.
In September 1949, West Penn effected a complete recapitalization.
Prior to this financing, the company had one class of debt securities,
three classes of preferred stock, a "class A" stock and common stock
outstanding. Upon consummation of the refinancing, .West Penn had
outstanding $31,000,000 of 31/2percent sinking fund collateral trust
bonds and 3,200,000 shares of common stock. A small issue of West
Penn Traction Co. bonds, assumed by West Penn in connection with
the corporate simplification, remained in its capitalization.
The new
collateral trust bonds are to be retired through annual sinking-fund
payments over their 25-year life. The new common stock, to the
extent of 388,274 shares, was offered to holders of preferred and class
A stock, in exchange for their holdings; the remaining 468,621 shares
were offered to the holders of common stock. In each instance the
offers were oversubscribed and no shares remained for distribution
by the underwriters.
The approved plan also resulted in a downward
adjustment by West Penn of its can'yil1~ value in subsidiary companies
and necessitated charges to its earned surplus and capital surplus
accounts of $1,402,324 and $14,078,119respectively.
In its opinion approving the recapitalization.t" the Commission
commented "that the resulting consolidated common stock equity is
substantially less than we consider appropriate for utility systems"

and that "the issuance of debt by a holding company whose subsidiaries
have substantial amounts of debt and preferred stocks in the hands of
the public also raises a serious problem under the standards of the act."
Itnoted, however, that the proposed sale of new common stock by West
Penn was a substantial one which increased the number of outstanding
common shares by 37 percent, and that the sinking-fund provisions on
the new debt called for its complete retirement by maturity. Since the
program also facilitated the future financing of system construction
requirements, the Commission determined that it could be approved,
indicating its intention, however, to require that future financings be
designed to strengthen the common equity of West Penn in all possible
ways.
ISSUES OF SECURITIES, ASSUMPTIONS OF LIABILITY,
ALTERATIONS OF RIGHTS

AND

During the past fiscal year, 319 applications and declarations covering issues of securities under sections 6 and 7 and assumptions of liabilities and alterations of rights under section 7 were filed with the
Commission, Action was completed and Commission approval granted
in 337 cases, including some which were instituted prior to that period.
As in the preceding year, most applications under sections 6 and 7 were
undertaken to enable electric and gas utility companies under the Commission's jurisdiction to proceed with their plans for extensive plant
expansion. However, there was also a noticeable increase in the number of bond-refunding operations.
On an industry-wide basis, construction expenditures of electric and
gas utilities, exclusive of expenditures by natural gas transmission
companies, are estimated to have been in excess of $2,500,000,000 in
the past fiscal year. While it had been envisioned that these expenditures would begin to taper off within the near future as increased
facilities approached power requirements, the recent trend of domestic
and international events suggests that no early decline in the pace of
growth is in sight.
The sustained volume of construction has, of course, necessitated a
heavy program of financing. This is demonstrated by the following
tabulation showing security sales of electric and gas utilities for the
fiscal years 1948 to 1950.

Total financing during the past fiscal year was higher than that of
the two preceding years, and a portion of this increase is attributable
to a renewal of refinancing activity. Of particular significance, however, is the steady upward trend in the proportion of common stock
financing from 13.4 percent for the fiscal year 1948 to 26.1 percent for
the fiscal year 1950. This trend may be accounted for irr part by the
receptivity of the market to new common stock offerings during most
of the past year, but it also reflects an awareness and responsiveness
on the part of public utility management to the necessity of maintaining a strong foundation of equity capital. As a result, utility
companies not only are assured of meeting their cash requirements
for near term construction needs but are afforded protection against
periods of market uncertainty when it becomes more difficult to obtain funds through offering of common stock.
As the program of integration and simplification under section 11
progresses and companies are divested from holding company systems, that segment of electric and gas utility financing subject to the
provisions of sections 6 and 7 declmes accordingly. Although some
further contraction is anticipated new financing undertaken by those
holding companies and subsidiary operating companies which are
expected to remain subject to regulation by the Commission, will
continue to represent a substantial portion of the industry total. The
following tables set forth, in summary form, security sales approved
under sections 6 (b) and 7 of the act for the fiscal years 1950 and 1949.
Information is provided with respect to registered holding companies
and their electric and gas subsidiaries and non utility subsidiaries.
These totals include all cash sales and refundings accomplished by
direct exchanges. Sales from portfolios and issues offered in connection with reorganization under section 11 are excluded.

COMMISSION

A comparison of the security sales by electric and gas utilities, approved under sections 6 (b) and 7, in the fiscal years 1949 and 1950
reflects a decline in the number of offerings from 183 to 150 and in the
total dollar volume of sales from $809,319,776to $764,264,516. Sales
of both mortgage bonds and common stocks increased during 1950,
whereas sales of other securities declined. Mortgage bonds, moreover,
represented 52.6 percent of total security sales in 1950 as against 45.5
percent in the fiscal year 1949. The proportion of common stock
financing climbed from 24.4 percent to 30.8 percent, and the relative
proportions of other types of financing declined.
Because the common equity of so many utility subsidiary companies
is wholly owned by the parent holding companies, the subsidiaries are
primarily dependent on the holding companies as sources of equity
capital. In the fiscal year 1949, registered holding companies purchased common shares of subsidiary companies to the extent of $150,000,000. During 1950, this figure amounted to $134,000,000. The
availability of funds for these intrasystem stock purchases depends
directly upon the adequacy and appropriateness of public financing
undertaken by the holding companies.
In past years, substantial amounts of cash have been made available
from the sale of nonretainable subsidiaries, but this source of funds
ceases to be important as holding companies become streamlined. As
a result, sales of common stock by registered holding companies are
increasing. They rose from $70,000,000in 1949 to $115,000,000in the
fiscal year 1950. (These figures exclude sales by operating-holding
companies.)
The Commission must bear in mind standards designed to assure
that the pressure of heavy cash requirements will not result in any
over-all deterioration in the consolidated capital structure and in the
quality of securities outstanding. By insisting that parent holding
companies undertake common stock financing periodically to match
increases in system debt financing, the Commission seeks to prevent
a return of the high-leveraged, unwieldly structures which led to the
legislation it now administers. Many holding companies have recognized their responsibilities in this respect and a number of the regulated systems have already reached a point. where the market receptivity to their common stock offerings is almost comparable with that
accorded to the stock of good quality operating companies.
COMPETITIVE

BIDDING

Offerings of securities by issuing companies under sections 6 (b)
and 7 of the act and portfolio offerings by holding companies under
section 12 (d) are required to be made at competitive bidding in
accordance with the provisions of rule U-50. Certain types of sales
are automatically exempted from the requirement. In addition, the
Commission retains the right to grant exemptions in other instances,
when unusual circumstances make such action appropriate.
Securities sold at competitive bidding under rule U-50 from its
effective date, May 7, 1941, to June 30, 1950,total in excess of $6,216,000,000. A tabular presentation showing the various classes of securities, number of issues, and the respective amounts, is set forth below:

While the experience of the Commission during the past 9 years has
amply demonstrated the workability of rule U-50 and its effectiveness
in achieving competitive conditions and minimum costs of flotation,
the Commission has always recognized that appropriate administration of the rule requires flexibility of application. Thus, in the
period since the rule became effective, a total of 192 security issues
amounting to $1,414,000,000have been exempted by Commission order
from competitive bidding requirements. This is exclusive of the automatic exemptions. The following table summarizes the exempted
sales by type of security and also provides a breakdown of the total
amounts showing those issues which were underwritten and those completed without an underwriting:

As the foregoing table reveals, most of the exempted transactions
were not underwritten. The major portion of the underwritten
exempt sales consisted of common stock offerings aggregating $275,074,100. While these exemptions may not be attributed to any single
factor, they reflect the greater difficulties sometimes encountered in
the marketing of common stocks owing to either the nature of the
issue or to security market conditions. By comparison, however, common stock sales through underwriters at competitive bidding were
twice as much in both amount and number of issues.

106

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The substantial number of exemptions granted with respect to both
underwritten and non underwritten preferred stock transactions represented principally the exchange of new lower dividend preferred
stocks to refund outstanding shares of higher rate. Beginning with
the Oklahoma Gas & Electric case in March 1946,123 however, the
Commission announced the policy that future preferred stock exchange offerings would be required to be made at competitive bidding.
More recently, the limited receptivity accorded to medium grade
preferred issues has also necessitated the granting of exemptions for
some underwritten issues.
Most of the exempted nonunderwritten bond and debenture offerings are represented by private placements made by the issuers. The
aggregate figure comprises a considerable number of issues of small
size and a small group of very large offerings exempted because of
unique circumstances present at the time of sale. Of the note offerings, exempted and not underwritten, only a small portion was placed
with banks and insurance companies; the balance was represented by
sales of an unusual nature to private persons or groups, to other utilities or holding companies, or to other parties. Exempted common
stock sales which were not underwritten consisted mainly of (1) sales
to other utilities, other holding comJ?anies, or to private persons or
groups (portfolio sales) and (2) rights offerings to stockholders
made without underwriting assistance.
Because rule U-50 covers not only sales by issuers under sections
6 (b) and 7 of the act, but also portfolio sales under section 12 (d),
there is substantial variety in the nature of circumstances which, over
the years, have necessitated the granting of exemptions. Each exemption request, however, has been appraised in the Iight of the particular
situation under which it is made.
In general, rule U-50 is now recognized as a practical and successful
aid to regulation. The Federal Power Commission during the past
fiscal year adopted a similar rule.
Cooperation With State and Local Regulatory Authorities

Despite the fact that there were 100 fewer companies subject to
regulation under the act on June 30,1950 as compared with a year ago,
activities involving cooperation with State and local regulatory authorities have continued undiminished. During the past year, there
were six Holding Company Act proceedings before the Commission
in which representatives of States or municipalities either participated
or exchanged views on questions of mutual interest. This compares
with seven such instances in the preceding year.
The cooperative efforts of the past year have encompassed a wide
variety of problems. Several of the proceedings have dealt with
financings, recapitalizations, and property sales or acquisitions, where
the questions of mutual interest related to accounting, protective provisions of securities, and capital structures. An example may be
found in a recent application made to this Commission by Milwaukee
Gas Light Co. seeking approval of a $3,500,000 bank-loan agreement.
The proceeding raised four questions which required careful consideration by this Commission and by the Public Service Commission
,::I

Holding Company Act release No. 64.9,

of the State of Wisconsin. These pertained to: (a) The pending
application of the company before the State commission for authority
to amortize over a 10-year period the cost of converting to natural
gas; (b) the question of immediate or accelerated retirement of the
manufactured gas equipment; (c) adjustments in the company's present reserve for depreciation; and (d) the company's proposal for a
permanent financing program. After a helpful exchange of views
with the chief accountant of the Wisconsin commission, the questions
raised by the application were disposed of to the satisfaction of both
commissions. It was also agreed that a similar exchange of views
would be sought when the company submits its permanent financing
plan at a later date.
Early in 1950 'Visconsin Electric Power Co. presented an informal
program for: (1) The acquisition by it of the electric properties of
its subsidiary, Wisconsin Gas & Electric Co., at a purchase r-rice of
about $13,800,000; (2) the redemption of the latter company s bonds
in the principal amount of $10,500,000; and (3) the issuance of
$15,000,000principal amount of new bonds and 585,405shares of new
common stock by Wisconsin Electric.
After preliminary examination of the proposals, the staff concluded
that the overall objectives were desirable, but that it would be necessary to work out certain accounting, indenture, and capital structure
problems before recommending favorable action by this Commission.
Since these problems were also of interest to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, they were discussed at length with the chief
accountant of that commission and, as a result, the staffs of both commissions arrived at a mutually satisfactory position with respect to
each point. The company amended its proposals to reflect these views,
and thereafter the plans were approved by both commissions.
The Portland Gas & Coke Co. filed a voluntary plan of reorganization under section 11 (e) of the act proposing a reclassification of the
outstanding preferred and common stocks into a single issue of new
common stock. The Commissioner of Public Utilities for the State
of Oregon was represented in the proceedings by his chief accountant
who, at the request of counsel for the division of public utilities of
this commission, testified with respect to matters over which the
Oregon commissioner had jurisdiction and, in addition, participated
in several conferences with the staff of the division. These exchanges
of views have been very helpful to the Commission in its consideration
of the complex issues in this proceeding.
Three other proceedings during the year involved cooperation with
local authorities. In the first, it was proposed that the Interstate
Light & Power Co. (Wisconsin), a subsidiary of Northern States
Power Co. (Minnesota), sell its Platteville division to Wisconsin
Power & Light Co., and that another subsidiary of Northern States
Power Co., the Interstate Light & Power Co. (Illinois) sell all of
its properties to Northwestern Illinois Gas & Electric Co. The city
of Galena, Ill., in March 1950, submitted a request to this Commission that final approval of these proposals be deferred pending further
investigation by the city to determine whether its interest would be
adequately safeguarded. The Commission withheld action on the
matter until June 1950, when it received notice from the city that it

108

SEctJRITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

would interpose no further objection to consummation of the
transaction.
In last year's report reference was made to certain proposals by
American Power & Light Co. as to the disposition 'of its interests in
its two subsidiaries, Pacific Power & Light Co. and the Washington
Water Power Co. In substance, the first plan provided that American
donate its holdings in Pacific to Washington Water Power, and in
the second American proposed that it be permitted to continue in
existence as a holding company with respect to both of the companies.
The Public Service Commission of the State of Washington and the
Oregon commissioner were vitally concerned with these proposals
and participated actively in the proceedings.
The plans met with considerable opposition and were withdrawn.
Subsequently, American filed another plan with this Commission proposing the sale of its holdings of all the common stock of Pacific to
a purchasing group which indicated an intention to sell the physical
properties of Pacific on a piecemeal basis to municipalities or other
interests. The Washington commission, the Oregon commissioner
and the city of Portland were represented at the hearings. Representatives of the two State commissions testified in opposition to
the plan on the ground that the disposition intended by the purchasing
group would not be in the public interest.
This group then dissolved and a second purchase group sought
authority to acquire the stock of Pacific, indicating an intention to
dispose of it at a later date through public sale. This proposal was
approved by the Commission and consummated. Recently, the purchase group sold the stock to a syndicate of underwriters for public
distribution.
On February 15, 1950,American Power & Light Co. made effective
a plan under which it distributed to its security holders all of its
assets other than the common stocks of the Washington Water Power
Co. and the Portland Gas & Coke Co., cash, and certain miscellaneous
assets. In May 1950, the Washington Public Service Commission
filed a petition requesting this Commission to enter an order requiring that American cease to be a holding comJ?any with respect
to 'Washington Water Power Co. by causing American to either (a)
distribute to its stockholders all of its holdings of WaShington Water
Power capital stock, or (b) offer the stock for sale at competitive
bidding pursuant to rule U-50. The petition further requested that
this Commission hold a hearing on the matter. At about the same
time the Public Utilities Commission of Idaho filed a petition stating
that it joined in, and adopted the petition of the Washington Public
Service Commission. On June 9, 1950,this Commission ordered that
oral argument on these petitions be heard on June 19, 1950, which
date was later advanced to June 27, 1950. The two State commissions subsequently advised that it was not possible for them to enter
appearance on that date, but this Commission advised them that it
would be necessary to proceed with the argument as planned since
the issues raised by their petitions had been presented in similar petitions by stockholders of American. The Commission indicated, however, that it would entertain any further requests by either of the
State regulatory authorities subsequent to the date of the argument.

SIXTEENTH

ANNUAJL REPORT

109

The argument was concluded and the proceeding is still pending before
the Commission.
The cooperative efforts in connection with specific proceedings, however, tell only a part of the story. The entire Holding Company Act
was designed to complement and strengthen local regulation. This
objective is clearly set forth by the Congress in paragraph (C) of section 1 where it is expressly declared to be the policy of the act that all
provisions thereof shall be interpreted to meet the problems and eliminate the abuses enumerated in paragraph (b). From the following
quotation of paragraph (b), it is readily apparent that many of these
evils and abuses were found to be harmful to local regulation and to
stem directly from the imposition of unregulated holding companies
upon operating utility companies.
The act has helped State regulation to exercise the powers necessary
to meet local responsibilities. During the 15-year period in which the
Holding Company Act has been in operation, 392 electric and gas
utility companies, with assets aggregating some $9,185,000,000have
been divested and, as a result, are now operating independently of
holding-company control. Furthermore, this newly won independence
is protected by the provisions of section 2 (a) (7) (B),2 (a) (8) (B),
2 (a) (11) and 9 (a) which contain appropriate safeguards against
the recurrence of detrimental holding company and affiliate relationships. Section 11 (b) limits the size, character of business and corporate structures of existing holding companies and sections 9 and 10
impose standards which must be met in the creation of new holding
company systems or in the enlargement of existing systems. All of
these last three sections are expressly geared to the preservation of the
effectiveness of local management and local regulation.
Other sections of the act, principally sections 12 and 13, provide for
comprehensive supervision over transactions between companies within
a holding company system. Section 13 requires that all services rendered to operating utility subsidiaries by system service companies be
rendered at cost, fairly and equitably allocated among the client companies and for the benefit of the client companies. Paragraph (e) of
this section, limits the operation of affiliated servicing organizations
and paragraph (f) provides for maintenance of competitive conditions
and adequate disclosure of information by servicing organizations
principally engaged in the performance of services for public utility
and holding companies in interstate commerce. The statutory safeguards contained in sections 2, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13,by their mere existence, serve as an effective barrier to any recurrence of those impediments to local regulation enumerated in section 1 (b) and, in the
aggregate, they constitute what may be appropriately described as an
important area of passive cooperation.

Enforcement Proceedings Under Section 11 (e) of the Act

Two applications for enforcement of voluntary plans under section

The district courts approved the two plans during the fiscal year and
appeals were taken in each case, both of which were pending on June
30,1950.
The first of these two plans provided for the liquidation of the Commonwealth & Southern Corp. The district court approved the J.?lanas

to that part of the plan which provided that the holders of option warrants should not participate ill the liquidation of Commonwealth &
Southern, and this appeal was pending at the end of the fiscal year.
Thereafter, the court of appeals affirmed the district court order.l25
After consummation of the plan, a securities dealer petitioned the district court for leave to intervene in the proceedings on behalf of persons who had traded in the prospective rights of security holders to the
residual assets of Commonwealth & Southern, which, under the plan
as amended prior to consummation, were to go to the Southern company. The district court denied the petition and an appeal was taken,
which was pending in the third circuit court of appeals at the end of
the fiscal year.
The second plan involved the liquidation of Federal Water & Gas
Corporation. The district court had approved the plan except as to
that part which accorded to certain former preferred stockholders of a
predecessor company the limited amounts which had been approved by
the Commission in an order, affirmed on appeal,t26approving an earlier
plan for the reorganization of the predecessor company. On January
11, 1950, the district court approved the latter portion of the plan.v"
An appeal was taken from that order of the district court and was
pending in the third circuit court of appeals on June 30, 1950. Appellants also petitioned the Supreme Court for direct review of the district court order. Their petition for certiorari was denied after the
close of the fiscal year.l28
During the fiscal year 1950, the Commission filed 13 applications
with the United States district courts seeking approval of voluntary
plans under section 11(e) . Nine of the plans were approved by the
district courts and no appeals were taken from these orders. One of
the nine plans involved the recapitalization of Interstate Power Co.
Following approval thereof by the district court and a memorandum
of the court granting certain objectors time to apply to the Commission
for a rehearing,129the Commission requested that it be permitted to
reconvene hearings upon the plan in order to determine whether circumstances had so changed as to make the plan no longer fair and
equitable. The court granted the petition and the plan is now under
further consideration by the Commission.
A second plan involved a discharge of Philadelphia Co. from its
position as a guarantor on the debt of its underliers. This plan was
combined with a plan of reorganization of Pittsburgh Railways Co.
under chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act. Following the conclusion
of hearings on the combined plan, the Commission made its findings,
entered an order approving the plan of Philadelphia Co., and rendered
an advisory report on the plan of Pittsburgh Railways. The district
court approved the Philadelphia Co. plan under section 11 (e) and
approved the plan of Pittsburgh Railways under chapter X}30

of that company for distribution of its assets on the ground that the

plan was not fair. The district court rejected these objections and
approved the plan.>" A plan for recapitalization of Eastern Gas &
Fuel Associates was objected to as unfair and inequitable by certain
preferred and common stockholders. The district court, however,
deemed the plan to be fair and equitable and overruled the contentions of stockholders that the Commission's valuation was not supported by substantial evidence.i'" Court enforcement of a plan for
the merger of Iowa Public Service Co. into its parent, Sioux City
Gas & Electric Co., and the acquisition by Sioux City of the properties and assets of its remaining three subsidiaries, was opposed by
the secretary of state of the State of Iowa on the ground that the
proposed merger did not comply with the law of the State of Iowa.
The district court overruled the objections and approved the plan.l33
The remaining four plans, which provided, respectively, for the liquidation of the Middle West Corp., National Gas & Electric Corp., and
North Continent Utilities Corp., and for the the elimination of crossholdings in the West Penn Electric Co. system, were enforced without
opposition.
District court approvals of two plans submitted during the fiscal
year were appealed to United States court of appeals. One of these
plans involved the reorganization of the Niagara Hudson Power
Corp. system by merger of three major operating companies into a
single operating-holding company, Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., and
the liquidation and dissolution of Niagara-Hudson. The plan provided that holders of option warrants of Niagara-Hudson should not
participate in the reorganization since the warrants had no value
for reorganization purposes. The court of appeals reversed the district court, which had excluded the warrants from participation,
and remanded the plan to the Commission for further consideration.!" After the close of the fiscal year, the United States Supreme
Court granted certiorari to review the court of appeals order.>"
The other of these plans involved a reorganization of the Long
Island Lighting Co. system which provided for the consolidation of
Long Island and two of its subsidiaries to form a new operatingholding company. Common stockholders of Long Island appealed
from the order of the district court 136 approving the. plan on the
ground, among others, that the Commission in arriving at its estimate of future earnings had failed to give consideration to savings
which would result from consolidated operations. The court of
appeals upheld the district court in all other respects, but remanded
the plan to the Commission upon this sole issue.':" The Commission
petitioned for modification of the decision and filed its supplemental

Supreme Court denied certiorari.138
Two applications filed during
the fiscal year were pending in the United States district courts on
June 30, 1950.
Four appeals were pending at the beginning of the fiscal year from
orders of United States district courts approving and enforcing voluntary plans under section 11 (e) which had been approved by the
Commission. The first of these appeals was taken from an order of
the district court directing that dividends paid bY'Illinois Power Co.
on the shares of its common stock allocated to public stockholders of
North American Light & Power Co., between the date of the enforcement order and the date of consummation, should be distributed to

the order of the district court was aflirmed.l39 The second plan involved the liquidation of Electric Power & Light Corp. and the organization of a new holding company, Middle South Utilities, Inc.
Applications for a stay of consummation had been denied during the
previous fiscal year.l40 Three appeals were taken; one was dismissed
by the court of appeals, and in the others, the court of appeals affirmed
the order of the district court.l41 The appeals pending at the beginning of the fiscal year in the other two cases, involving plans of Electric Bond & Share Co. and the United Corp., were dismissed without
opinion.
Petitions

to Review Orders of the CoJllDlission

Four petitions to review orders of the Commission were pending in
court of appeals on July 1, 1949. One of these petitions, for review
of an order of the Commission allowing fees, was dismissed during
the fiscal year; 142 in the other three cases, the Commission's orders were
affirmed. One of these cases involved an order of the Commission
directing that Pennsylvania Edison Co. pay from an escrow fund, to
the former holders of its preferred stock, the difference between the
investment value of the stock found by the Commission to equal its
call price, and the $100 per share paid upon the retirement of the
stock, together with compensation for the time elapsed between date
of retirement and payment of the balances found to be due, at rates
measured by the yields on the preferred stock.143
The second affirmance involved an order of the Commission denying
effectiveness to a declaration of a common stockholders' committee of
Long Island Lighting Co., proposing to solicit funds from the common
stockholders of Long Island.
The court held that the Commission
had acted reasonably, and within the scope of its authority.>'
After
the close of the fiscal year, the Supreme Court denied certiorari.l45
The third case in which the Commission was affirmed was an appeal
from an order directing, pursuant to section 11 (b), that Philadelphia

and dissolve. Philadelphia Co. urged that the gas and electric prop-

During the fiscal year 1950, five petitions to review orders of the

In the action for an injunction to prohibit Market Street Railway
Co. from filing with the Commission an amendment to its pending

against the execution of a certain release except pursuant to a court
enforcement order in the plan proceedings.>" Thereafter the amendment was filed by Market Street and approved by the Commission;

PART IV
PARTICIPATION
OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE
REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT, AS AMENDED
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations (other than railroads) in the Federal courts.
The Commission's duties under chapter X are, first, at the request
or with the approval of the court to participate in proceedings to
provide, for the court and investors, independent expert assistance,
and second, to prepare for the benefit of the courts and investors
formal advisory reports on plans of reorganization submitted to it
by the courts. The Commission has no statutory right of appeal
in a chapter X proceeding, although it may participate in appeals
taken by others.
COMMISSION'S

FUNCTIONS

UNDER CHAPTER

X

The role of the Commission under chapter X differs markedly from
that under the acts which it administers. The Commission does not
administer chapter X. It acts in a purely advisory capacity. It
has no authority either to veto or to require the adoption of a plan
of reorganization or to render a decision on any other issue in the
proceeding. The facilities of its technical staff and its recommendations are at the services of the judge and the security holders, affording
them the views of experts in a highly complex area of corporate
law and finance.
During the year the immediate supervision of chapter X matters
at the central officeof the Commission was transferred from the Division of Corporation Finance to the Division of Public Utilities.
THE COMMISSION AS A PARTY TO PROCEEDINGS

Generally, the Commission has sought to participate only in proceedings in which there is a public investor interest; $250,000 of
publicly held securities is the rough guide used in deciding if there
is enough public interest to make it worth while for the Commission
to participate. Sometimes the Commission has entered smaller cases
where public-security holders are not adequately represented, where
it appears that the proceedings are being conducted in violation of
important provisions of the act, or if the Commission may otherwise
be useful by participating.
Because of its Nation-wide activity and its experience in chapter X
cases the Commission is able to respond to requests for help in the
interpretation and application of chapter X when it does not participate as a party.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES
The Commission actively participated during the 1950 fiscal year in
71 reorganization proceedings involving the reorganization of 98 companies with aggregate stated assets of $965,157,000 and aggregate
stated indebtedness of $851,254,000.1 During the year the Commission with court approval filed notices of appearance in 5 new proceedings under chapter X. These 5 new proceedings involved 9 companies with aggregate stated assets of $24,985,000 and aggregate stated
indebtedness of $29,006,000. At the close of the year, the Commission
was actively participating in 59 reorganization proceedings involving
83 companies with aggregate stated assets of $950,862,000 and aggregate stated indebtedness of $837,863,000.
Activities Relating to the Trusteeship

A fundamental feature of chapter X is that in every case involving
a corporation of substantial size an independent trustee is ap~ointed
to be primarily responsible for the operation of the corporation s business durin~ the proceeding, to examine and evaluate the reasons for
the debtor s financial difficulties, to appraise the ability and fidelity
of its management and to formulate and file a plan of reorganization.
The success of the reorganization depends largely on the thoroughness,
skill, and loyalty with which he and his counsel perform their tasks.
The Commission usually examines the qualifications of trustees in the
light of the standards of disinterestedness prescribed by the statute
for trustees and their counsel.
In one case during the past fiscal year the Commission and a security
holder petitioned for the removal of counsel for trustees on the ground
that they were not disinterested as required by the statute." The
Commission contended that the attorneys had represented creditors of
the debtor at the time of their appointment and that the formal termination of their representation of creditors could not eliminate the
conflicts of interest engendered by their prior relationship.
The Commission further pointed out that the danger of an active conflict of
interests was accentuated in this case because actions taken by the
creditors prior to the chapter X proceedings, when the attorneys represented them, gave rise to possible counterclaims on behalf of the
estate which the attorneys as counsel for the trustees would be required
to prosecute. In addition, issues had been raised between the creditors and other parties to the proceedings as to certain priorities and
the validity of a pledge of certain assets which also involved adverse
interests. The attorneys resigned prior to argument on the motion.
In reorganization proceedings involving two debtors, the Commission filed objections to the final accounts of a trustee who had resigned,
and urged that he be surcharged u~on the ground, among others, that
he had knowingly permitted certain of his employees to trade in the
securities of the debtors and their subsidiaries despite the fact that
he was buying similar securities for the debtor," These employees

had access to confidential information respecting the debtor, in some
instances had actively run the debtors and subsidiaries, and had purchased bonds from the public and sold them to the trustee at a profit.
After hearing, the special master agreed that trading in these securities was a breach of fiduciary duty and that the trustee's knowledge
and acquiescence rendered him culpable and liable for surcharge to
the extent of the profits. The district court approved the recommendation of the special master. On appeal, the court of appeals reversed
the decision insofar as it surcharged the trustee. A petition for rehearing is pending.
Problems in the Administration

of the Estate

A major defect of section 77B (the predecessor statute to chapter
X) was its failure to provide assurance that judicial supervision of
the reorganization process and creditor and stockholder participation
therein would be based upon complete and impartial information
regarding the affairs of the debtor. Chapter X endeavors to achieve
this goal by requiring the independent trustee, at the direction of the
court, to investigate the acts, conduct, property, liabilities, and financial condition of the debtor, the operation of its business, and the desirability of the continuance thereof, and to transmit a report of his
investigation to creditors and stockholders. Such reports enable security holders and other parties to a proceeding to make helpful and
effective suggestions for a plan of reorganization, aid the court in
considering problems in the administration of the estate as well as
the fairness and feasibility of a plan of reorganization, and give security holders the necessary information to determine the desirability
of accepting a proposed plan.
The Commission has continued its policy of consultation through
its staff with trustees in connection with their investigations and the
preparation of their reports. On the basis of its own investigations
and its wide experience the Commission has been able to supply data
and suggestions useful to the trustee. It has also continued to assist
trustees ill their investigation of possible claims against the old management and other persons.
With respect to the operation of the companies in reorganization
the Commission takes the position that important steps should not be
taken except upon a complete disclosure to the court and the parties
of all relevant factors. In one case, trustees had obtained competitive
bids for certain paving work. However, they had delayed taking
action on the matter and making a report to the court until the lowest
bidder had withdrawn his bid and the work was assigned to and
partially performed by another bidder. The Commission looked into
and brought out all the facts when the question of approval of the
contract came before the court. While the court approved the contract because it had been practically completed, it expressly reserved
the question of the trustees' culpability in the matter.
A recurrent question is whether the enterprise should be liquidated
through a sale or continued as a going concern through an internal
plan of reorganization.
The Commission does not support the sale
type of reorganization merely because of its simplicity or certainty of
result, but urges a decision based upon what will yield the largest

118

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

benefit for creditors and stockholders. Where the decision has been
made to sell the assets of the debtor, there has been some tendency
to attempt to complete the sale as an administrative matter prior to,
and not as part of, a plan of reorganization with its attendant safeguards for investors. The Commission has urged that where substantially all the assets of the debtor are sold the sale should be part
of a plan of reorganization, unless some emergency is involved, such
as the need to dispose of perishable property.
This position was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit in the chapter X proceedings involving Solar Manufacturing
Corp.' The court rejected the argument that an emergency situation
can be created simply by a condition imposed by a prospective purchaser that his offer of purchase must be accepted within a very short
time. It reversed the order of the district court which authorized the
sale, saying that "the safeguarding provisions of chapter X are not
to be ignored in the sale of the assets of a business unless an emergency
exists." It may be noted that the abortive proposal involved a price
of $525,000, and that subsequently the assets were sold for $815,000
pursuant to a plan of reorganization subject to competitive conditions.
Responsibilities of Fiduciaries

Assuring adherence to the high standards of conduct required of
fiduciaries has continued to be one of the important activities of the
Commission in chapter X proceedings. We have indicated above
our concern that the independent trustee be free from any conflicts
of interest. The Commission is concerned also with the qualifications
of other fiduciaries in the proceeding, such as indenture trustees, com.
mittees, attorneys, and other representatives of security holders. In
one case the Commission sought to disqualify members of a stockholders' committee on the ground that their interests conflicted with
those of the stockholders," The Commission contended that the conflicts of interest arose from the facts that: (1) The chairman and
sponsor of the committee owned and controlled a large block of debentures, ranking prior to the stock, (2) the chairman had traded
in the stock after assuming to act as chairman, (3) companies affiliated
with the chairman were engaged in partial competition with the
debtor and the debtor had claims against some of them, and (4) the
chairman of the committee intended apparently, to acquire control
.of the debtor for purposes not necessarily compatible with the interests
of stockholders. After the Commission filed a petition for disqualification with the court, the committee voluntarily dissolved and rescinded all authorizations, notifying stockholders of its action.
Where a fiduciary has traded in the securities of a debtor in reorganization, he has been considered guilty of a breach of trust which
courts have punished by the denial of any fees or reimbursement of
expenses. In such situations courts have also prevented fiduciaries
from profiting by such trading through the limitation of their claims
to cost or through an accounting for any profits. The application of
the sanction of limitation to cost was advocated by the Commission
in several cases in which the fiduciary purchased claims against the

119

corporation at a discount prior to the institution of the chapter X
proceedings but during a period when the corporation was insolvent.
The Commission expressed the view that the fundamental basis of
the rule, the clash of adverse interests created by the trading in claims
against the debtor, is applicable whether the corporation is not actually
in reorganization, but is insolvent and in need of rehabilitation with
respect to its liabilities, or is actually undergoing judicial reorganization. The Supreme Court, however, in a case under chapter XI of
the Bankruptcy Act, in which the Commission filed a brief as amicus
curiae, rejected this position as applied to a purchase by directors
of "unmatured obligations of a corporation which, though technically insolvent, remains nevertheless a going concern." 6 The court
held that, on the record, the probability that an actual conflict of
loyalties arose from the opportunity to purchase claims of the debtor,
while it was a going concern, was not great enough to warrant the
limitation of the purchaser's claims to cost. The court pointed out,
however, that the possibilities of a conflict of interests in the purchasing director are intensified as the corporation becomes less a going
concern and more a prospective subject of judicial relief, adding the
following significant language to its opinion:
"A word of caution as to the scope of our decision is desirable in
view of Judge Learned Hand's opinion below. He suggested that if
in fact liquidation had been imminent at the time of respondents'
purchases or if it were fairly demonstrable, as a matter of experience,
that a director free from all potential self-interest would be more
likely to initiate liquidation proceedings or to effect a debt settlement
than one not wholly disinterested, a court of equity should explore
such issues and not dismiss them out of hand. ThIS decision is not
meant to negative the relevance of these issues when raised by a
proper record. We mention these matters because the Securities and
Exchange Commission urges the importance of a decision in this case
for questions that may well arise in proceedings under chapter X. In
such proceedings the Securities and Exchange Commission, acting
as the statutory advisor to the court, would be within its rightful
function in submitting to the court the light of its experience in dealings of the general kind disclosed in this case."
In another case where the Commission had urged limitation to cost,
the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the decision of
the court below which limited to cost a claim based on bonds purchased by a member of a bondholders' committee/ In this case, the
debtor had defaulted on its interest payments and a bondholders'
committee had designated one of its own members to manage its property, when the purchases were made. The chapter X proceedings
were not commenced until 5 years after the purchases although rehabilitation or reorganization was in contemplation throughout the
period of the purchases. The court held that the rule that a trustee
can make no profit out of his trust was absolute and should be applied in the circumstances of this case. The court, as urged by the
Commission, relied upon section 212 of chapter X which provides that

the judge may limit claims acquired by fiduciaries "in contemplation or
in the course of the proceeding."
The court in the Franklin Building case did not, however, accept
the Commission's contention that close relatives of members of the
bondholders' committee should also be limited to cost. In another
case the district court rejected contentions of the Commission similar
to those made in M'(Lnujacturers Trust 00. v. Beeker and permitted
a director and his business associate to participate for the full amount
of securities purchased prior to the chapter X proceeding although
the company was insolvent," The court did, however, limit to cost
claims based upon securities purchased by the director at a time when
the chapter X proceeding was in contemplation.
Activities With Respect to Allowances

The Commission in its advisory capacity endeavors to protect the
estate from exorbitant and inequitable charges for fees and expenses
while at the same time providing fair treatment to applicants which
will adequately compensate them for services rendered and encourage
legitimate creditor and stockholder participation in the reorganization process.
The Commission itself receives no allowances from estates in reorganization. It attempts to obtain a limitation of the aggregate fees
to an amount which the estate can feasibly or should fairly pay. In
each case, the applications are carefully studied and recommendations
are made in the light of apJ?licable legal standards and, in general, on
the basis of beneficial contributions to the administration of the estate
and to the adoption of a plan of reorganization.
Specific recommendations are made to the courts in cases in which the Commission has
been a party and in which it is familiar with the services of the various
parties and all significant developments in the case.
The role of the Commission with respect to the recommendation of
allowances was clearly delineated by the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit in the Ohilds 00. case." Claimants had requested fees
aggregating over $1,400,000; the Commission recommended approximately $750,000; and the district court awarded a total of approximately $965,000. On appeal, the court of appeals pointed out that
the allowances granted by the judge amounted to 10 percent of the
value of the estate and 26 percent of the net income received during
the reorganization; that in a reorganization proceeding the aggregate
of fees must bear some reasonable relation to the estate's value and,
hence, attorneys cannot always expect to be compensated at the same
rate as in litigation of the usual kind. The court referred also to evidence of duplication in the representation of creditors and stockholders and wasteful labor in matters involving the administration of
the estate which the trustee was handling more than satisfactorily.
Indicating its view that the amounts allowed were excessive, the
court stated:
"We should have had more doubts as to our conclusions just stated,
had they not been re-enforced by those of the Securities and Exchange

Commission. In a reasoned statement discussing each petition the
Commission presented grounds for limiting the various allowances to
sums totaling $750,000. These amounts individually and collectively
seem to us quite generous, indeed, perhaps more so than some of us
would have granted as judges of first instance. They appear to support the statement of the Commission's able spokesman that these are
not intended as minima to be increased by the court, but that in fact
the Commission has raised its standards to match the compensation
awarded by other judges in other cases. * * *
"Since the Commission's recommendations represent the expert opinion of a disinterested agency skilled and experienced in reorganization
affairs, they should be a valuable aid to a judge in performing a difficult task. 6 Collier on Bankruptcy pp. 13.02, p. 4498, 14th Ed. 1947.
Some courts have refused to give S. E. C. recommendations as to fees
more weight than the suggestions of any other party, e. g., Oooke v.
Bowersock, 8 Cir., 122 F. 2d 977, 985; In re Detroit International
Bridge 00., 6 Cir., 111 F. 2d 235, 237-8. True, the Commission's
function in a reorganization proceeding is purely advisory; and it
does not have the power to fix a maximum amount for fees which it
has with regard to the reorganization of public utility holding companies under ~ 11 (f) of the Holding Company Act, 15 U. S. C. A.
~ 79k (f), and which the Interstate Commerce Commission has with
regard to a railroad reorganization under ~ 77 (c) (2), (12) of the
Bankruptcy Act, 11 U. S. C. A. ~ 205 (c) (2), (12). Nevertheless
the figures presented by the S. E. C. are not 'mere casual conjectures,'
but are 'recommendations based on closer study than a district judge
could ordinarily give to such matters.' Frank, supra, 18 N. Y. U. L. Q.
Rev. 317, 1941. We agree with District Judge Kirkpatrick's apt statement "that the Commission is about the only wholly disinterested
party in the proceeding and that, while it may not be entirely familiar
with 'the problems of making both ends meet in a law office' referred
to by counsel, its experience has made it thoroughly familiar with the
general attitude of the courts and the amounts of allowances made in
scores of comparable proceedings."
In re Philadelphia & Reading
Ooal & Iron Oo.?-D. C. E. C. Pa., 61 F. Supp. 120, 124. See also
Note, 18 N. Y. U. L. Q. Rev. 399,469-70, 1941, which suggests that the
recommendations as to fees of the S. E. C. may be the only solution
to the 'very undesirable subjectivity with variations according to the
particular judge under particular circumstances' which has made the
fixing of fees seem often to be 'upon nothing more than an ipse dimit
basis.' And see Securities and Exchange Commission, Tenth Annual
Report 148, 1944, Fourteenth Annual Report 85-6, 1948."
The court remanded the applications for allowances "for the further
consideration of the district judge, particularly in the light of the
recommendations made by the Commission," and directed that those
recommendations should not be exceeded without definite findings and
conclusions showing why this step is deemed necessary. To expedite
the reconsideration of the fees, the court stated that the Commission's
recommendations, if adopted, would be considered affirmatively reasonable and properly allowable.

122

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISS'lON

In the reorganization proceedings involving Chicago Surface
Lines 10 and Chicago Rapid Transit Co. the requests for fees and
expenses totaled $6,774,695 and $1,043,235 respectively. Previous
amounts allowed in these cases, primarily to trustees, receivers, and
their counsel were extremely large, totaling $5,000,686and $1,296,590
in the respective proceedings. The Commission, in a detailed memorandum, recommended $1,918,139 and $362,673 respectively. The
special master designated to hear the applications recommended $3,605,616and $656,375. The reason for the substantially lesser amounts
recommended by the Commission was partially due to the fact that
the Commission believed that many applicants were not entitled to a
fee or reimbursement of expenses as a matter of law. The Commission was of the opinion that certain applicants were barred from
receiving an allowance because they represented conflicting interests
in the proceedings, because they bought or sold securities during the
proceedings in contravention of section 249 of chapter X or of the
equitable rule which the section codifies, because they represented
classes of securities excluded from any participation in the reorganization and could show no benefit to the estate or contribution to the
plan; and because of other reasons. The special master's reports in
these cases and the objections of the Commission and others thereto
are pending before the district court for decision.
Another issue decided in the Ohilds 00. case, discussed previously,
involved the application of section 249. The Commission argued that
two preferred stockholders, seeking compensation for services rendered in the proceeding, and who had traded in the stock of the
debtor, should be denied any compensation because their activities in
connection with the reorganization placed them in a "representative
capacity" within the meaning of section 249. The Commission also
argued that the interests of the applicants were not entirely consistent
with other stockholders of their class in that they were seeking to
obtain control of the reorganized company with its accompanying
perquisites, and emoluments of management. The district court rejected these contentions but the court of appeals agreed that the applicants had acted in a "representative capacity" and were therefore
barred from receiving any compensation under the provisions of section 249. The court stated that the record was clear that applicants
had created a bloc of stockholders amenable to their directives, had
maintained its unity by frequent communication, asserted its strength
during the formulation and confirmation of a plan, and exerted its
power to assure the selection of a new management satisfactory to
themselves. The court reiterated the rule in chapter X that one who
undertakes to act on behalf of any part of a class becomes the representative of the whole class, and may not deal for any part of it
alone.
The court did not sustain the Commission's position on a different
point in the Ohilds 00. case. The Commission was of the view that a
certain stockholders' committee and its counsel had contributed directly to the reorganization proceedings and rendered services of
benefit to the estate although they were rendered prior to the re'0 The constltuent

organization proceeding. The court pointed out that the services
had consisted principally of defeating a voluntary reorganization
and the dismissal of a prior involuntary petition in chapter X on
the ground that it was collusive, and the court concluded that such
activity did not seem to have been of benefit to the estate. The court
held that chapter X did not sanction awards for uncertain and somewhat problematical benefits resulting from activities prior to the reorganization and in order to be compensable such services must not
only be clearly beneficial but specifically directed to the rehabilitation
of the debtor which then actually Oc~Ul'S.
In Berner v. Equitable Office Building Oorp.,ll the Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit held that the disclosure by an attorney of
private information regarding the reorganization proceeding to his
brother-in-law, on the basis of which his brother-in-law had profited
by the purchase of stock of the debtor, was a breach of trust. It held,
however, that it was within the discretion of the district court to
determine to what extent any fees earned by the attorney should be
reduced because of this breach. The court suggested that the amount
of reduction might well be not less than the loss to those who had
sold stock to the brother-in-law. On remand the district judge held
that the attorney would have been entitled to a fee of $100,000,and
that this amount should be reduced by the losses incurred by the
sellers of stock to the brother-in-law, plus an amount to make up for
the cost to the estate of the litigation that grew out of the breach of
trust, an aggregate of $30,000. The resulting figure of $70,000 was
substantially in excess of the Commission's recommendation of $15,000,
although the court accepted the Commission's suggestions as to the
amount of the loss. The judge sustained the Commission's view that
the fact that the purchases were made from short sellers was not
material, particularly since most of those selling stock owned other
securities of the debtor. The judge stated that a court of equity
should not be overly astute in an endeavor to relieve a tort-feasor from
responsibility to his trust.
The doctrine of the Berner case was followed in Silbiaer v. Prudence
Bonds (Iorp., decided by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
in March 1950. The opinion recognized that, in ordinary litigation,
an attorney who has served conflicting interests must be denied all
compensation but indicated that a more lenient rule could be applied
in corporate reorganizations. In such cases the court suggested that
it is reasonable not to impose an entire forfeiture of the allowance
when the allowance is to be paid by a group which was not prejudiced
by the attorney's divided allegiance rather by those who might have
been. The court indicated that those affected by the attorney's disloyalty were probably adequately represented but that the attorney
failed in his duty when he did not present the matter to the court and
asked to be freed of his responsibility. The court remanded the case
to the district court to fix the extent to which the attorney's allowance
should be reduced. It stated that in its view a reduction of less than
one-third would be an abuse of discretion, although it did not wish to
indicate that it believed that a reduction of one-third was enough.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

A petition to the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari has been
filed by the successor corporation and the Commission has filed a
memorandum as amicus curiae in support thereof. The Commission's
view is that any allowances of a fee to an attorney who represents
conflicting interests in a corporate reorganization is in direct conflict
with the rule laid down by the Supreme Court in the landmark case of
Woods v. Oity Bank 00.,313 U. S. 262 (1941). The Commission feels
that in making an exception to the requirements of loyal and disinterested service by fiduciaries as an absolute prerequisite to receiving
any compensation whatsoever the decision of the court departs from
the fundamental principles of equity; that the nature of a corporate
reorganization proceeding is such that, rather than affording a reason
for laxity, it requires the application of the highest standards of
fiduciary conduct.

In accordance with the legislative spirit and intent with which
chapter X was enacted, the Commission generally strives for a liberal
interpretation of its provisions in order to make the benefits and safeguards of chapter X fully available to security holders. The Commission opposed a motion to dismiss the chapter X reorganization
proceeding involving New Union Building CO.12 Against a contention that there was no need for relief because 98 percent of the bonds
had been deposited with a committee which had made no demand for
payment although principal and interest were past due, the Commission argued that the insolvency of the debtor and its inability to meet
its debts as they matured were sufficient to show the need for relief
and that reorganization under chapter X would preserve goingconcern value for the benefit of all creditors.
The Commission also
argued that the fact that a large bondholder, who was also a director
and committee member, was charged with instituting the proceedings
to gain control of the property and avoid a foreclosure, and to continue
to buy bonds at a discount, constituted no basis for a finding of lack
of good faith. The Commission pointed out that the desire to effectuate a plan which would be binding upon dissenters, if two-thirds of
the bondholders approved, was hardly a circumstance indicating bad
faith since such a result was one of the purposes sought to be achieved
by the reorganization statute to remedy a recognized deficiency in
receivership proceedings.
As to the trading activities of the bondholder, the Commission alluded to the broad and flexible powers of the
chapter X court as a court of equity with jurisdiction to prevent or
punish any inequitable or unjust conduct by any insider or fiduciary
in the proceeding.
The district court sustained the Commission's
position and denied the motion to dismiss. The moving party appealed but, after the Commission had filed its brief, the appeal was
withdrawn.
PLANS OF REORGANIZATION UNDER CHAPTER X

The formulation and consummation of a fair and feasible plan of
reorganization is, of course, the primary purpose Qf the proceeding

SIXTEENTH

under chapter X. Accordingly, the most important function of the
Commission under chapter X is to aid the courts in achieving this
objective.
Fairness of Plan

Basic to the Commission's approach to questions involving the fairness of reorganization plans under chapter X is the fixed principle,
firmly established by Supreme Court decisions, that full recognition
must be accorded to claims in the order of their legal and contractual
priority either in cash or in the equitable equivalent of new securities
and that junior claimants may participate only to the extent that the
debtor's properties have value after the satisfaction of prior claims
or to the extent that they make a fresh contribution necessary to the
reorganization of the debtor. A valuation of the debtor is essential
to provide a basis for judging the fairness as well as the feasibility
of proposed plans of reorganization. In its oral statements and in its
advisory reports the Commission has continued to urge that the proper
method of valuation for reorganization purposes is primarily an
approJ?riate capitalization of reasonably prospective earnings. An
exception to this general position was dealt with during the 1950 fiscal
year by the Commission in an advisory report in the proceedings
involving Central States Electric Corp., discussed below.
In connection with the fairness of plans and the treatment of claims
against the estate, the Commission has given careful consideration to
situations where because of mismanagement or other misconduct on
the part of a parent company or a controlling or affiliated person the
claims of the parent or affiliate should be subordinated to the claims
of the public investors or these claims limited to cost. All the
facts and circumstances in these instances are investigated since
they form an integral part of the concept of the "fair and equitable"
plan. Plans of reorganization involving problems of this type during
the past fiscal year were considered by the Commission b the following proceedings: Pittsburgh Railways 00./3 Industrial Office Building Oorp.,u International Railway 00./5 International Power Securities Oorp.,IS Silesian-American
Oorp.,l1 and the related cases of
American Fuel & Power 00., Inland Gas Oorp., and Kentucky Fuel
Gas 00.,18 In the first three of these proceedings, settlements and
compromises of the subordination and limitation issues were approved
by the court, the Commission supporting the result in the first two
proceedings and opposing the result as rnadequate in the third. A
compromise offer in the fourth of the foregoing proceedings is presently the subject of hearings before the district court. In the SilesianAmerican case, discussed below, plans of reorganization were the
subject of an advisory report.
In the related American Fuel, Inland Gas, and Kentucky Fuel cases
the Court of Appeals for the SIXth Circuit had previously ruled that
the controlling person, Columbia Gas & Electric Corp., should be
subordinated to claims of public investors. The question of the extent

of such subordination is presently the subject of an appeal. Inland
Gas Corp. owns practically all the assets of the system. A plan of
reorganization for that company subordinates Columbia's claims to
those of publicly held claims of Inland but permits Columbia a participation in Inland's assets prior to the claims of creditors of American Fuel and Kentucky Fuel. The Commission urged, in an advisory
report, that the inequities which gave rise to the decision that Columbia be subordinated to the public creditors of Inland also require that
Columbia be subordinated to public creditors of American Fuel and
Kentucky Fuel, which companies own practically all of the stock of
Inland.
In the Pittsburgh Ra{!lWays 00. case, hearings on over $76,000,000
of claims of the parent company, Philadelphia Co., had commenced
before a special master in 1947. Objections to these claims had been
raised, based upon alleged misuse by Philadelphia Co. of its control
over the Pittsburgh Railways System (consisting of Pittsburgh Railways Co., Pittsburgh Motor Coach Co., a wholly owned subsidiary,
and 53 so-called "underlier" companies linked to the System through
intricate lease and operating arrangements).
It was contended that
Philadelphia Co.'s claims should be completely subordinated to the
$27,000,000of publicly held claims and stock interests of the system,
or that its claims should be limited to cost. By the end of 1948,
Philadelphia Co. had not completed its affirmative case of showing
that its claims were free from infirmity although the record contained
over 10,000 pages of testimony and hundreds of exhibits. The primary burden of investigating the claims of Philadelphia Co., the
circumstances of their acquisition and the enormously complex history
of over 50 years of control over the railways system was carried by
the Commission's staff. This was particularly necessary since the
former "independent" trustee had filed a cursory report concluding
that Philadelphia Co. should not be subordinated. Subsequently the
Commission and others initiated proceedings to remove this trustee
alleging, among other matters, that the trustee had permitted his
report to be prepared for the most part by an officer of the debtor,
associated with the parent company, and. hence, that it could hardly
be expected to be an impartial study, or the trustee be considered
independent. The trustee resigned May 31, 1949, after a special
master had rendered a report recommending his removal.
Beginning in January 1949, the Commission's staff and other interested parties explored the possibilities of settling the Philadelphia
Co. subordination litigation as well as the numerous other conflicting
claims and problems which had already delayed the reorganization
for 10 years and gave promise of delaying it for a further long period.
As a result of these discussions, Philadelphia Co. submitted a compromise proposal, agreed to by the new disinterested trustee, by
various parties, and the Commission's staff. On the basis of this offer,
a "combined plan" was filed by the trustee, contemplating a single
company to take over the various properties comprising the Pittsburgh
Railways system. The new company will issue up to $6,000,000 of
bonds in addition to new common stock and the estate will distribute
not less than $17,000,000 in cash. To the extent that more cash is
distributed less bonds will be issued. Holders of bonds and stocks

SIXTEENTH

ANNUMJ REPORT

127

secured by guarantees of Philadelphia Co. will be paid in full by
receipt of cash of almost $11,000,000, approximately equal to the
principal amount and par value outstandmg, no interest or dividends
being in arrears; holders of bonds of the system not affected by guarantees will receive cash and new bonds aggregating $11,700,000, equal
to the principal amount outstanding, and will receive also 14 percent
of the new stock, interest being in arrears; holders of unguaranteed
stock with a par value of $4,500,000 will receive $450,000 in cash and
35 percent of the new stock; Philadelphia Co. for all its claims and
interests will receive 51 percent of the new stock and will be discharged
from all its guarantees.
The "combined plan" was submitted to the Commission for its approval under sections 11 (e) and 11 (f) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act. Section 11 (e) was applicable insofar as the plan
related to the discharge and cancellation of the guarantees of Philadelphia Co., a company subject to the Holding Company Act. Section 11 (f) was applicable since that section provides for the Commission's prior approval of a plan of reorganization for a company
subject to the Holding Company Act. Litigation regarding the validity of the Commission's modification of an exemptive rule which
had excluded Pittsburgh Railways Co. from the purview of the Holding Company Act had, 111 the meantime, been settled by the withdrawal
by Philadelphia Co. of its objections to the modification. After notice
and hearing, the Commission concluded that the "combined plan" was
fair and feasible and on March 27,1950 entered an order approving it.
Finding a value of $17,000,000 for the new company, after giving
effect to the proposed cash payments, the Commission analyzed the
treatment accorded to the claimants in the light of the contentions as
between Philadelphia Co. and public security holders, as among public
security holders themselves and as between claimants not holding
securities and the estate or security holders.
The Commission stated
that it was impossible to treat each of the 55 companies of the system
as a separate entity or to identify the property of each company in
view of the intermingling of assets, failure to keep separate records,
and operation of the system as a single unit for approximately 50
years. The Commission aJ>proved the realistic approach of the "combined plan" in dealing WIth the system as an integral whole. As to
the major problem of the standing of Philadelphia Co.'s claims, the
Commission referred to the staff's summary of the various contentions
relating to the subordination issue and an extensive statement of facts
derived from the record before the special master presented in an appendix to the staff's recommended findings. The Commission observed
that there was evidence supporting the claim of misuse of control by
Philadelphia Co.; on the other hand, it noted Philadelphia Co.'s denials, its voluntary adjustments in the system structure with alleged
benefits to security holders and its defense of laohes.
The participations accorded by the plan to Philadelphia Co. and to
public security holders were compared with parity treatment in the
estate. Under parity treatment, Philadelphia Co. with two-thirds
of the outstanding bonds and stocks would receive $22,667,000 of the
$34,000,000 estate and would still be liable on its guarantees of close
to $11,000,000; while public security holders would receive $11,333,000.

128

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Under the plan, Philadelphia Co. receives 51 percent of the stock of
the new company and is discharged of its guarantees; public security
holders receive an aggregate of $23,000,000 in cash and new bonds
and 49 percent of the stock. The improvement in the position of the
public security holders was considered to represent a reasonable settlement of difficult and intricate litigation.
Upon approval of the
"combined plan" by the Commission, It was submitted. to the district
court which likewise gave its approval. The plan was then submitted
to security holders for a vote, the material sent including a report_prepared by the Commission under section 11 (g) of the Holding Company Act to assist them in deciding whether to accept the plan. Security holders overwhelmingly accepted the plan.
Feasibility of Plan

A prerequisite to the court's approval of a plan of reorganization
is its feasibility.
In order to assure sound reorganizations, which will
not result in the company's return under the "chancellor's umbrella",
because of financial difficulties, the Commission gives a great deal of
attention to factors affecting feasibility.
The Commission is thus
concerned with the adequacy of working capital, the relationship of
funded debt and the capital structure as a whole to property values,
the adequacy of corporate earning power in relation to interest and
dividend requirements, the necessity for capital expenditures, and the
effect of the new capitalization uEon the company's prospective credit.
The Commission's views on feasibility as relating to particular types
of enterprise have been published in some detail during the past fiscal
year in several advisory reports dealing with a transit company, a
motor transportation
company, an investment company and a company organized to liquidate frozen assets.
Consummation of Plan

The Commission gives detailed scrutiny to the corporate charters,
bylaws, trust indentures, and other instruments which are to govern
the internal structure of the reorganized debtor. In general the Commission strives to assure to investors the inclusion of protective features
and safeguards which its experience has shown to be desirable.
The Commission's interest in the entire reorganization process includes not only the consummation of the plan and the winding up of
the affairs of the trusteeship (which may occur many years after a
plan has been consummated) but may also extend to the execution of
the terms of the plan by the reorganized company. In the proceedings involving PIttsburgh Terminal Coal Corp. the need for such
continued interest has been dramatically high-lighted.
The plan of
reorganization in that case, as an alternative to bankruptcy liquidation or forced sales at an inopportune time, provided for the creation of
a realization corporation to liquidate the assets in an orderly manner.
The plan, which was consummated in 1945, incorporated certain safeguards for investors: The life of the corporation was limited to 5 years
to assure reasonably expeditious liquidation, the purpose of the corporation was restricted to liquidation of its assets, and total compensation to officers and directors was not to exceed $5,000 per annum.
These provisions were incorporated in the plan over the opposition of

SIXTEENTH

ANNUM.. REPORT

129

a large preferred stockholder and his associates who apparently anticipated getting control of the new corporation.
Despite the explicit nature of these provisions, evidence was obtained by the trustee and the Commission's staff indicating that the
plan was being flouted, that salaries far in excess of $5,000 were being
paid to near relatives of the controlling stockholder, that the reorganized company, instead of liquidating, intended to finance near relatives
of the controlling stockholder in mining operations on the company's
property, that the cost of operation of the realization corporation exceeded what might be expected of that type of company, and that the
controlling stockholder intended to change the bylaws of the company to remove the $5,000 restriction so as to enable him to receive
indirectly as a bonus compensation for his services during the reorganization proceedings as chairman of a preferred stockholders' committee, compensation which he did not request the court to allow and
which might have been barred under section 249 of chapter X bl
reason of the fact that he and his family had traded in the debtor s
stock.
At about the time this evidence was obtained, a special meeting of
stockholders had been called to amend the bylaws of the reorganized
company to extend the company's existence for a period of 5 years and
to increase the salary limit. Before the date of the meeting, the Commission filed a petition with the chapter X court for an order authorizing an investigation of the trading activities of members of the preferred stockholders' committee. At the same time, the trustee, with
the Commission's support, asked for an injunction restraining the holding of the stockholders' meeting and for an order authorizing an investigation to determine whether the terms, intent, and purpose of the
plan of reorganization were being carried out. The court granted
both petitions in December 1949, although permitting the company's
existence to continue for another year.
Pittsburgh Terminal Realization Corp., the reorganized company,
appealed from the order staying the stockholders' meeting and authorizing the investigation sought by the trustee on. the ground that
the reorganization court did not have jurisdiction to supervise the
affairs of a going enterprise which had emerged from reorganization.
The Commission, in its brief in support of the district court's decision,
pointed out that the reorganization court has jurisdiction to protect
Its decrees, to prevent interference with the execution of the plan and
to aid in its operation. The Commission contended that the facts
alleged in the trustee's petition and in related affidavits clearly warranted the relief granted by the district judge to assure that the objectives of a plan painstakingly formulated and consummated under
judicial supervision with carefully thought-out legislative safeguards
should not thereafter be thwarted.
In an incisive opinion, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
affirmed the order enjoining the stockholders' meeting and authorizing
the investigation."
Holding that the reorganization court has jurisdiction to see that a plan is carried out, the court stated that, in view

of the charges made, which were not seriously disputed, the trustee
"would have been remiss in his duty if he had not brought this matter
to the attention of the court and urged that the charges be investigated." The court held that the charges concerned an important phase
of the plan in the process of being carried out, that the charges were
serious and substantial and that, under the plain mandate of the corporate reorganization law, the problem was definitely within the
Jurisdiction of the court.
ADVISORY

REPORTS

The preparation of advisory reports pursuant to section 172 of chapter X does not represent the major part of the activities of the Commission in chapter X proceedings. Nevertheless, because they often
deal with complex or novel legal and analytical problems, and because
they are usually filed in the larger cases with a greater public interest,
the advisory reports occupy a prominent position in the reorganization
field. In effect they represent a means whereby the Commission's
views on chapter X matters are made known to the public. In fact,
however, the Commission has not filed formal advisory reports in the
bulk of the cases in which it has participated, but in all these cases it
has advised the court in detail, orally or by memorandum, of its views
with respect to the various plans of reorganization proposed in the
proceeding.
During the year the Commission prepared and filed three advisory
reports and five supplemental reports. Two of these supplemental
reports dealt with the trustees' plan of reorganization in the proceedings involving International Railways Co., with respect to which the
Commission had issued an advisory report during the previous fiscal
year. The supplemental reports related to amendments which had
been filed to the trustees' plan. Most of these amendments were in
accordance with suggestions made in the advisory report, covering
matters such as cumulative voting in the election of directors and preemptive rights to subscribe to new stock. However, certain other suggestions recommended by the Commission and proposed by a bondholders' committee were not adopted by the trustees and the Commission reiterated its position in this respect. These recommendations
were that nominees for the new board of directors be selected by
creditors in accordance with their interests in the estate, and that
bondholders who had not collected interest prior to the chapter X
proceedings receive this uncollected interest in cash rather than in
new securities in order to place them on an equal footing with all other
bondholders. The second supplemental report suggested a method
for distribution among public bondholders and creditors of certain
of the new stock of the reorganized company which was to be turned
back to the estate as part of a settlement of a subordination proceeding
against former controlling persons. The suggestion made by the
Commission were thereafter substantially adopted.
Another supplemental report related to a revision of the trustee's
plan in the Inland Gas Corp. proceedings, with respect to which the
Commission had issued an advisory report during the previous fiscal
year. The major points dealt with concerned a provision for creating
a capital surplus which purported to provide a cushion for the new

S[KTEE~

~AL

REPORT

131

debt of the re~rganized company, as well as for its stock, and to improve the feasibility of the plan. The Commission pointed out that
the creation of the capital surplus out of the residuary equity would
n~t in fact effect any additional protection for security holders but
might on the contrary supply the means by which some of the existing
equity cushion for bondholders could be dissipated through payment
of unearned dividends or purchase of outstanding stock. In addition
it was pointed out that the provision was unfair to the recipient of
the residual equity since it transferred part of this equity into surplus
in which other security holders also receiving stock under the plan
would have a proportionate interest. The plan was thereafter
amended to exclude the provision for capital surplus.
Another point dealt with related to the purchase of property by the
reorganized company valued at $400,000 in exchange for stock of the
reorganized company having a par value of $600,000. In its original
advisory report the Commission indicated that the proposed step-up
of 50 percent over the value of the property was excessive, although
it agreed in principle that since the property was to be paid for in
stock rather than cash, it was appropriate to issue a greater amount
of stock. However, the Commission had recommended that the stock
to be issued in excess of the value of the property should be taken on
a pro rata basis from the shares of stock which would otherwise have
been allocated to the security holders of the debtor in order to avoid
the use of watered stock. The plan as amended followed this suggestion in its endeavor to avoid the aspect of stock watering but placed
the entire burden upon the recipient of the residual equity in the case
rather than upon all of the new stockholders of the reorganized com-pany. The Commission's supplemental report pointed out what appeared to it to be the inequity of the proposed procedure. Nevertheless, the plan was approved as amended. In this respect, as well as
in others, the order approvin~ the plan of reorganization for Inland
Gas Corp., has been appealed, and the matter IS pending before the
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.
In the proceedings involving Keeshin Freight Lines, Inc., and three
subsidiary debtors, the district court requested the Commission to
participate in the reorganization and to submit an advisory report
on two plans of reorganization."
The Commission issued its advisory
report on these plans in August 1949. The primary matter dealt with
by the Commission was the valuation of the debtor. Reviewing the
evidence relating to prospective earnings of the enterprise and to an
appropriate rate of capitalization, and considering- the expert testimony, the Commission concluded that the valuation of the debtor,
including a small amount of excess working capital, was about $2,200,000. On this basis, the Commission concluded that the trustees' plan
of reorganization which provided for a sale of the property at an
upset price of about $1,400,000 was unfair, the price being grossly
inadequate.
The Commission concluded that the other plan of reorganization
was unfair in that it gave to creditors of the parent c?mpany new
securities worth less than they wer~ entitled to. Notinz that the
parent company creditors and certain creditors of the sJilisIdIarIeS,
"N. D. Ill.

132

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

consisting of a few large business corporations and individuals, had
voluntarily agreed to receive treatment under this plan different from
that which they were entitled to under the terms of their claims, the
Commission stated that since these persons did not constitute members of the investing public, it could see no objection to their agreement to receive less than that which fairness required. The Commission also considered the feasibility of the second plan since it provided
for the issuance of new securities in part to the creditors of the debtor
and its subsidiaries. The Commission concluded that while the capital structure proposed under the plan was initially top-heavy and
complicated and should be simplified, it appeared to be feasible, particularly since a good }?art of the proposed debt obligations would
be retired within a relatively short time under the program envisaged
by the plan.
The district court disagreed with the Commission's conclusions as to
valuation and reached a determination that the property was worth
only $1,'700,000. The court concluded that both plans were unfair
and that in addition the second plan was unfeasible. The trustees'
plan providing for sale at an upset price was amended to conform to
the court's determination of value. However, before this plan could
be acted upon, an offer to purchase all the assets of the debtor and its
subsidiaries was received from another trucking concern which had
purchased all the claims against the parent company. Under this plan
all creditors of the subsidiaries would be paid in full. While the total
effective price to be paid by the purchaser could not be determined,
because the amount of claims against the subsidiaries could not be
determined until objections to claims were passed upon, the maximum
commitment of the proposed purchaser exceeded $2,000,000. A plan of
reorganization embodying the proposed purchase was approved and
confirmed by the court.
In the proceedings involving Central States Electric Corp., the Commission's advisory report covered five plans of reorganization. The
issue arising in the case were both varied and complicated. On the subject of valuation, the Commission departed from the customary procedure of capitalizing the reasonably expected earnings of the
enterprise, on the ground that an investment company which deals in
marketable securities, none of which represents a controlling interest,
cannot be valued on this basis. The Commission rejected as sheer
prophesy arguments that future capital gains had to be considered,
and pointed out that a capitalization of earnings would result in a
lower figure than a market valuation. It was further held that the
pyramided structure of the system of the debtor, which has two subsidiaries, American Cities Power & Light Corp. and Blue Ridge Corp.,
the former holding 42 percent of the stock of the latter added no additional value to the enterprise. It was the Commission's view that there
is no justification or economic basis for piling one investment company upon another, with needless increase in expenses, duplication,
and potentialities for abuse; that the common stockholders of the top
company might have some speculative advantage at the expense of
senior security holders but that all investors in the aggregate do not
benefit therefrom.

SIXTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

133

The Commission severely criticized four of the proposed plans
because they involved retention of the three-tiered system of investment companies, having as its objective the interposition of debt obligations or preferred stock in the bottom and intermediate company
so as to increase the leverage, or speculative potentialities, of the
common stock of the top company if the stock market should rise.
The Commission also criticized the failure of these four plans (proposed by the junior classes of the debtor, with little or no equity on
the basis of market values) to provide adequate asset coverages for the
bonds and preferred stocks contemplated by their plans. In considering both of these economic problems, the Commission recommended that the court should impose as minimum standards of
feasibility, those provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940
regarding asset coverage for senior securities and prohibition of
pyramiding even though that act itself provided exemption in the case
of a reorganization.
The Commission pointed out that the exemption
did not modify the findings of the Congress that the interests of investors are adversely affected by the undue speculation resulting from the
issuance of excessive senior securities and from pyramiding and the
abuses flowing therefrom.
The trustees' plan of reorganization, contemplating the emergency
of a single investment company with a single class of stock, after the
dissolution of American Cities Power & Light Corp. and the merger of
Blue Ridge Corp. with Central States Electric Corp., was considered to
be sound and feasible. The claim of the 7 percent preferred stock, next
in rank to the debentures, will be measured by its liquidating preference
and accrued dividends. The Commission expressed the opinion that
this treatment was required in equity and by judicial precedent. A
lawsuit against the former controlling person of Central States was
segregated, the suit to be handled by the trustee and any recovery to be
distributed to those classes of securities which had not been paid, in
part or in full, in the order of their priority. The Commission considered this appropriate and fair in order not to delay the reorganization,
pointing out that continued delay in consummating the reorganization
places in jeopardy the interests of the senior securities and permits the
junior interests to speculate at the risk of the seniors. Since the proceedings have been pending 8 years, any further unnecessary delay was
considered inequitable. The Commission discussed each of the other
proposed Elans in detail and concluded that they were unfair in that,
in genera, they provided for participation by junior classes at the
expense of senior security holders.
The district court thereafter adopted the recommendations of the
Commission, approved the trustees' plan, subject to suggested modifications, and disapproved all plans proposed by the junior interests.
The trustees thereupon amended their plan accordingly and the Commission in a supplemental report stated that the plan was fair and
feasible in all respects. The court approved the plan and directed
that it be sent to security holders for a vote. In the meantime, the
question of the dissolution of American Cities Power & Light Corp.
came before the court. The Commission urged that that company be
dissolved immediately as an administrative step in the proceeding 00-

134

COMMISSION

cause it was an uneconomic and unjustified complexity in the Central
States system. The junior interests argued for a delay on the ground
that their plans were based on the continued existence of American
Cities and that the status guo should be maintained pending appeals
from the order disapprovrng their plans. The Commission pointed
out, however, that the insistence that American Cities be retained in the
system could only mean that the junior interests intended to reinstate
the highly complicated, speculative system that had originally brought
financial collapse to the debtor and imposed heavy losses on security
holders; and that in no event could any plan be considered feasible
that did not eliminate American Cities as an unwarranted corporate
monstrosity. The district court denied the stay and authorized the
trustees of Central States to vote the stock of American Cities in
favor of the proposed dissolution. The Court of Appeals for the
Fourth CirCUIt affirmed the approval of the trustees' plan and the
authorization to proceed with the dissolution of American Cities, and
dissolved the stay it had granted pending appeal. Applications to
stay the proposed dissolution pending the filing of petitions for writs
of certiorari to review the approval of the trustees' plan were filed
in the Supreme Court.
In the proceedings involving Silesian-American Corp.," the questions confronting the Commission in reporting on various plans of reorganization were primarily legal questions. The debtor was promoted
as an aftermath of World War I by W. A. Harriman & Co and Anaconda Copper Mining Co. It acquired its principal asset, a Polish
mine, from a German mining company which received $5,000,000 of
the debtor's preferred stock and 49 percent of its common stock as
well as a $6,000,000 loan from the debtor. The promoters received
$7,000,000of the debtor's preferred stock and 51 percent of its common
stock for a cash contribution of less than $38,000. The promotion was
financed by selling $15,000,000of the debtor's bonds to the public. In
1937, the German mining company ceased making payments on its
indebtedness to the debtor, now amounting to $5,000,000.
After World War TI, the Polish properties of the debtor were taken
by Poland without compensation and at present the debtor has only
a claim for compensation under the Polish nationalization law. Certain transactions occurring during the war, however, giving rise to
additional claims on behalf of the estate, were uncovered. When
World War II broke out, Germany seized the Polish properties of
the debtor and placed them under the supervision of the German
company, which exploited them until hostilities ceased in 1945. Soon
after the seizure, the German company and the Hitler government
developed a scheme for the German repatriation of the American
interest in the Polish mine and the indebtedness from the German
company. To accomplish this scheme, an arrangement was made with
a syndicate of Swiss banks, to whom the German company was also
indebted, to act as a cloak for the Germans. Funds for the repatriation were to be supplied by shipments to Switzerland of zinc extracted
from the Polish and German mines. With the consent of the Swiss
and German Governments, the proceeds of the metal shipments were
"'S.D.

N.Y.

SIXTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

135

exempted from the restrictions of the Swiss-German clearing treaty,
thus leaving the proceeds with the Swiss banks.
As an initial step in the repatriation scheme, the Swiss banks acquired $640,000 of the debtor's bonds. These purchases, however,
caused market rises in the price of the bonds which rendered it impracticable and unprofitable to the Swiss banks (whose profit depended
upon the price of the bonds) to continue the acquisitions. Accordingly, the Swiss banks entered into negotiations with the AnacondaHarriman promoters, who held a majority of the debtor's stocks, for
a cash purchase of their interest and full payment of the remaining
bonds outstanding against the debtor. This transaction required
licenses from the United States Treasury Department, from whom
the Swiss banks concealed the German interest. The licenses were
denied.
Despite this obstacle to consummation of the German repatriation
program, the zinc shipments to the Swiss banks continued until
Germany's surrender. The shipments were made as a result of representations to the German Government that the repatriation had been
effected in part and would be completed as soon as feasible. The net
proceeds of the shipments approximated $6,000,000. Out of these
funds, the Swiss banks reimbursed themselves attar for the $640,000
of the debtor's bonds although the securities ha been purchased at
prices ranging from 28% to 71. Additionally, they used substantial
portions of the funds as credits against principal and interest on
prewar obligations of the German company to them. During the
same period, the debtor received nothing on its unpaid indebtedness
from the German company.
After the termination of hostilities, a Dr. Schulte, who had originally conceived the repatriation plan in his capacity as the German
company's chief executive, worked with the Swiss banks to come
to some agreement with the trustee of the debtor. The remainder of
the :funds accumulated in Switzerland (approximating $1,700,000
in cash plus the $640,000 of the debtor's bonds) had been exempted
from Swiss-German clearing for the express purpose of acquiring
the debtor's securities. It was feared that unless used for the intended purpose, the moneys would be regarded as German assets
subject to seizure by the Swiss Government. If an arrangement with
the trustee could be effectuated, it would be represented that the objectives of the clearing exemption had been achieved and the Swiss
banks would be free to use the remainder of the fund for their own
purposes. The trustee's plan embodied a Swiss proposal under which
about $650,000 would be released for a cash distribution to bondholders. For this, the Swiss banks would receive first-lien securities
on a parity with the balance due to public bondholders (over
$2,000,000); for the $640,000of the debtor's bonds, they would receive
second-lien securities.
By reason of the questions raised in the case as to the possible liability of the promoters of the debtor arising from its organization, the
issuance of its securities, and the management of its affairs, and as to
the claims against the Swiss banks, the Commission's advisory report
portrayed in some detail the history of the debtor as revealed by an

136

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

extensive and largely documented record, though lacking the completeness that can usually be attained in a domestic situation. In an appendix to the report the Commission set forth the evidentiary facts
surrounding the promotion and organization of the company and in
another appendix the history of the transactions involving the
ment of metals to Switzerland and the activities of the Swiss ba
and the German mining company in relation thereto. Against this
background the Commission concluded that the trustee's plan was
neither fair nor feasible.
The report concluded that the plan was unfair in the following
principal respects: It embodied an inadequate compromise of claims
which were believed to be legally and practicably enforceable against
the Swiss banks; 22 it accorded to the Swiss banks a dominant interest
in the reorganized company on terms unfair to public bondholders;
it made participation of stockholders dependent upon an arbitrary
value for the Polish claim instead of giving stockholders certificates
of interest contingent upon possible recoveries after satisfaction of
creditors; it failed to provide for prosecution by the trustees of causes
of action against the promoters of the debtor and instead recognized
their bonds, stock, and other claims in full; it failed to provide for the
prosecution by the trustee of claims against the German mining company; it failed to limit to cost bonds acquired by certain insiders during the proceeding; it disfranchised security holders through the
creation of a voting trust. The trustee's plan was also considered not
feasible in that it provided for the issuance of interest-bearing debt obligations with a fixed maturity although there is no assurance or basis
for expecting that the interest and principal will be paid when due.
The plan also failed to provide adequate working capital to enable the
proper prosecution of claims constituting the primary assets of the
estate.
The Commission considered that a plan proposed by a bondholders'
committee was fair in rejecting the Swiss compromise and in providing
for the prosecution of causes of action against the Swiss banks, the
promoters, and the German mining company, but it suggested that the
plan might appropriately provide for the issuance of contingent certificates of interest to stockholders in the event that a sufficient recovery was had upon the claims against Poland and others. The plan was

~b

.. As to the SwiBBtransactions, the CommiBBionconclnded trom the record that Dr.
Schulte's connection with the negotiations was tor the probable purpose ot salvaging an
interest tor the German company in these funds as well as to aid in getting some participation tor the Swiss banks in the debtor's reorganization.
The proposal embodied in the
trustee's pian, which the United States Office ot Alien Property regarded as in furtherance
of the German repatriation scheme and thus Violative of the Trading with the Enemy Act,
was considered the culmination of these negotiations.
The CommiBBionpointed out that
the record showed that the funds in controversy were deriVed in substantial part from
metals extracted trom the Polish mines belonging to the debtor; that they were intended
to be used tor the benefit of the debtor's security holders; and that they were accumulated
by a German company heavily indebted to the debtor. It was also pointed out that the
$640,000 ot bonds, originally purchased by the Swiss banks, were paid tor out of these
funds and, at a minimum, as property ot the German company, were SUbject to cancellation
on account of the unpaid obligations to the debtor.
On the merits ot the SwiBBproposal, the Commission concluded :
"In view ot what has already been said, we believe the so-called compromise must be
rejected. The bait which it holds out in the torm ot an immediate partial cash distribution to public bondholders, who have long been deprived of any return on their Investment,
cannot be permitted, in the light of the tacts as they now appear, to serve as a lure for
approval of a proposal deficient in satisfying objective equitable standards.
What may
appear on the surface as a benefit is shown by analysis and inquiry into the facts to be a
means ot accomplishing a gross preference in favor ot the SwiBBbanks. It the Swiss banks
are not wiIiing to make a superior proposal, the machinery is at hand to deal with them
promptly in the reorganization court."

SIXTEENTII~AL

REPORT

137

considered not feasible, however, because it failed to provide adequate
working capital. Other plan proposals offered by the debtor and
stockholders were considered unfair and unfeasible for reasons substantially similar to the reasons for considering the trustee's plan
unfair and unfeasible.
Despite the views urged by the Commission in its advisory report,
the district court in April 1950 approved the trustee's plan, subject
to certain minor modifications, and disapproved all other proposals.
The trustee then filed an amended plan which was submitted to the
Commission for a supplemental report. The supplemental report,
filed in May: 1950, found the plan still unfair and unfeasible. Some
of the modifications met certain objections raised by the Commission
but these related to relatively small matters. The basic features of
the trustee's plan, unfair and unfeasible in the Commission's view,
remained the same.
A bondholders' committee, among others, appealed from the order
approving the plan. Contending that certain aspects of the voting
on the plan contemplated by the trustee were unfair, the committee
moved for a stay of the voting pending the appeal from the plan
approval as well as the manner of votmg. The Commission supported the motion for a stay on two principal grounds. The Commission objected to the classification of the $640,000 of bonds held
by the Swiss banks in the same category as publicly held bonds because
of the direct conflict of interest of the two groups. The manifest
unfairness which would result if the votes of the Swiss banks were
considered in determining whether bondholders wished to accept the
offer of the Swiss banks was discussed. Additionally, the refusal
to permit the bondholders' committee to communicate with bondholders regarding acceptance or rejection of the plan concurrently
with the trustee was urged as another reason for the stay. The
statute, judicial precedents, and the equity of the case were relied
upon to support the Commission's view that an equal opportunity
to the committee was required and that thelrocedure contemplated
by the trustee was unjust. The Court of ppeals for the Second
Circuit granted the stay without opinion.

PART V
ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST INDENTURE
ACT OF 1939
The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes, debentures, and similar securities publicly offered for sale, sold, or delivered
after sale through the mails or in interstate commerce (except as
specifically exempted by the act) be issued under an indenture which
meets the requirements of the act and which has been qualified with
the Commission.
NATURE OF TRUST INDENTURE REGULATION

Individual holders of bonds, notes, debentures, and similar debt
securities often find it difficult and expensive to enforce their rights
under indentures and generally must rely upon the trustee named in
the trust indenture to protect them. The Trust Indenture Act of
1939 requires the inclusion in the trust indenture of specified provisions which facilitate the protection and enforcement of such rights.
Thus, there must be a corporate trustee free from stated conflicts
of interest; such trustee must not after default, or within 4 months
prior thereto, improve its position as a creditor to the detriment of the
indenture securities; it must make annual and periodic reports to bondholders; it must maintain bondholders lists to provide a method of
communication between bondholders as to their rights under the indenture and the bonds; and it must be authorized to file suits and proofs
of claims on behalf of the bondholders. The act prohibits exculpatory
clauses used in the past to eliminate the liability of the indenture trustee
to the indenture security holders and imposes on the trustee, after default, the duty to exercise the rights and powers vested in it, and to
use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent
man would use or exercise in the conduct of his own affairs. Specified
evidence must be supplied by the obligor to the indenture trustee
with respect to the recording of the indenture and with respect to
conditions precedent to action to be taken by the trustee at the request
of the obligor.
INTEGRATION WITH SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

The exemption provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 incorporate most of the exemptions contained in the Securities Act of
1933 and include certain other exemptions. The provisions of these
acts are so integrated that registration pursuant to the Securities Act
of 1933 of securities to be issued under a trust indenture and not
exempt from the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, is not permitted to
become effective unless the indenture conforms to the requirements
of the latter act, and such an indenture is automatically "qualified"
138

SIXTEENTH

139

ANNUAL REPORT

when registration becomes effective as to the securities themselves. An
application for qualification of an indenture, covering securities not
required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which is
filed with the Commission under the Trust Indenture Act is processed
substantially as though such application were a registration statement
filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933.
STATISTICS OF INDENTURES

QUALIFIED

There was a drop in the number and dollar amount of debt securities
Tor which qualification under the Trust Indenture Act was
sought in the 1950 fiscal year. Thus, during the year there were 96
new indentures filed representing an aggregate dollar amount of
$1,741,775,670,compared with corresponding figures in the 1949 fiscal
year of 127 new filings representing $2,605,823,365. However, the
addition of the year's new filings to the 9 indentures (aggregating
$298,141,600), which were pending at the beginning of the period
makes a total of 105 indentures aggregating $2,039,917,270 which
required examination by the staff during the past year and which were
disposed of as shown in the table below:

ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY
ACT OF 1940
The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires registration and
provides for certain types of regulation of investment companiescompanies engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting,
and trading in securities. Among other things, the act requires disclosure of the finances and investment policies of these companies in
order to afford investors full and complete information with respect
to their activities; prohibits such companies from changing the nature
of their business or their investment policies without the approval of
the stockholders; bars persons guilty of security frauds from serving
as officers and directors of such companies; regulates the means of
custody of the assets of investment companies and requires the bonding
of officers and directors having access to such assets; prevents underwriters, investment bankers, and brokers from constituting more than
a minority of the directors of such companies; requires management
contracts in the first instance to be submitted to security holders for
their approval; prohibits transactions between such companies and
their officers and directors except on the approval of the COmmission;
forbids the issuance of senior securities of such companies except in
specified instances ~
and prohibits pyramiding of such companies and
cross-ownership of their securities. The Commission is authorized to
prepare advisory reports upon plans of reorganizations of registered
investment companies upon request of such companies or 25 percent
of their stockholders and to institute proceedings to enjoin such plans
if they are grossly unfair. The act requires face amount certificate
companies to maintain reserves adequate to meet maturity payments
upon their certificates.
REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT

During the 1950 fiscal year, 26 new investment companies registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940-predominantly
open-end
management companies (companies which redeem their shares on
presentation by the stockholders).
During the nearest comparable
period for which data are available, the 12 months ended March 31,
1950, about 196 registered open-end management and closed-end management investment companies reported to the Commission sales to
the public of approximately $440,000,000 of their securities, and redemptions and retirements of approximately $135,000,000, leaving a
net investment by the public in such companies over the period of
approximately $305,000,000. As of June 30, 1950, 366 investment companies were registered under the act, and of that date it is estimated
that the value of their total assets was approximately $4,700,000,000

TYPES AND INVESTMENT POLICIES OF COMPANIES FORMED

As indicated above, most of the investment companies formed during
the period have been of the open-end type, investing primarily in
common stocks. Three of these companies have adopted a policy of
investment in so-called "growth stocks" (variously defined by each of
them) and one company has adopted a policy of investing primarily
in companies owning or engaged primarily in the development of
natural resources.
The year was also marked by the appearance of brokers and dealers
as direct sponsors and investment advisers of open-end companies
formed primarily as an investment medium for customers of the firms
and characterized by either the absence, or only a nominal amount,
of, sales load. Two such companies were formed, one in New York by
a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange and one in Boston.
Another interesting development during the year has been the formation of funds designed to enable investors to purchase on the installment plan over a period of 10 years common stock of a single company
in whose securities there is local interest. For example, a fund has
been formed in Washington, D. C., for investment in the common stock
of Potomac Electric Power Co. on the installment plan; a similar
fund was formed in Winston-Salem, N. C., for investment in the
common stock of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. Both plans were characterized by the fact that over a half of the first year's installment
payments were not invested in the underlying stock, but were absorbed
as selling loads and other charges.
Semng Literature

The act requires literature (other than the statutory prospectus)
used by issuers or underwriters in selling open-end investment company shares to be filed with the Commission within 10 days after such
literature is first employed as selling material. During the 1950 fiscal
year there was a substantial increase in the use of both literature
purporting to describe investment companies generally and literature
purporting to describe a specific company. Of considerable concern
to the Commission was the fact that in a substantial number of cases

142

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

this literature used by issuers, underwriters, and dealers to attract
investors might be materially misleading in many respects. In addition, there was serious doubt that certain of such literature could be
generally circulated under the Securities Act of 1933. Accordingly,
during the year the Commission with the cooperation of the National
Association of Securities Dealers undertook a study of such literature
in an attempt to eliminate any misleading elements contained therein.
After the close of the year there was promulg-ated, as a result of the
cooperative effort of the Commission and the National Association of
Securities Dealers, a statement of policy governing the contents of
such literature.

APPLICATIONS FILED

One of the functions of the Commission under the act is to pass on
applications by investment companies for exemptions which the act
permits under appropriate standards.
Some of the most complex problems arise out of the provisions of
the statute which forbid, III the absence of approval by the Commission,
purchases or sales of property or securities among investment companies and their affiliated persons. To approve such transactions
the Commission must find that they are fair as to price and involve
no overreaching. As a result, the applications in many instances
involve unusual questions of valuation and inside influence. During
the year 30 applications of this type were filed.
During the year 95 applications were filed under the various provisions of the act, 77 of these for orders of the Commission relating to

exemption from requirements of the act, and the remaining 18 for a
determination by the Commission that the applicant has ceased to be
an investment company within the meaning of the act. At the beginning of the year 32 applications were pending, which (together
with the 95 filed during the year) made a total of 127 applications
requiring examination and consideration by the Commission during
the year. As a result of the Commission's action 93 of these applications were disposed of during the year and 34 were pending on
June 30, 1950. The various sections of the act under which these
applications were filed, and the disposition of the applications during
the fiscal year, are shown in the following table (since an application

LITIGATION UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT

In only two instanc-es during the 1950 fiscal year did the Commission resort to injunction proceedings to enforce the obligations devolving on investment companies and their officers under the Investment Company Act. In S. E. O. v. F. L. Andrews Investment Trust
(Civil Action No. 8845, D. Mass. Nov. 30, 1949) the officer,who served
as president, treasurer, and sole trustee of the investment company,
caused the company to make unsecured loans to various business corporations which he controlled. According to the complaint, he received rebates, secret profits, and commissions for arranging these
loans, and received salaries from both the investment company and
the corporations he controlled for serving as an officer of these enterprises. The Commission brought an action which sought to prohibit
the officer from being employed by any investment company in any
capacity, and a consent decree was entered granting the relief re-

144

COMMISSION

quested. In addition, on motion of the Commission, the court appointed a receiver to hold the assets of the investment company subject
to an order to liquidate and distribute them.
In 8. E. O. v, Trusteed Funds, Ina. (Civil Action No. 8622, D. Mass.,
Sept. 9, 1949) an action was brought to enjoin the sponsor and principal underwriter of an investment company from selling its securities
by means of sales literature which had not been filed with the Commission and which contained the false statement that the investment
company was guaranteed against loss by the United States Government. In this case, too, an injunction was entered as requested and
a receiver was appointed.'
1 The complaint also charged violation of the prospectus standards, sec. 15(b) (2). and
the antifraud provisions, sec. 11 (a) (1), (2) and (3), of the Secnrities Act of 1933.

PART VII
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE INVESTMENT
ACT OF 1940

ADVISERS

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration of
investment advisers, persons engaged for compensation in the business of advising others with respect to securities. The Commission
is empowered to deny registration to or revoke registration of such
advisers if they have been convicted or enjoined because of misconduct
in connection with security transactions or have made false statements in their applications for registration.
The act makes it unlawful for investment advisers to engage in practices which constitute
fraud or deceit; requires investment advisers to disclose the nature of
their interest in transactions executed for their clients; prohibits profitsharing arrangements; and, in effect, prevents assignment of investment advisory contracts without the client's consent.

Approximately 242 registered investment advisers represent in their
applications that they engage exclusively in supervising their clients'
investments on the basis of the individual needs of each client. The
services of about 335 others are chiefly through publications of various
types; 232 investment advisers are registered also as brokers and dealers in securities. Most of the remainder offer various combinations of
investment services.
Administrative

Proceedings

Two proceedings, involving investment advisers, one of which was
pending at the be~ing
of the 1950 fiscal year and the other which
was instituted durmg the year, were determined during the year. The
latter case, Assured Warranty Corp., is discussed in the section of
this report on the regulation of brokers and dealers under the Securities Exchange Act.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In the other case, the Commission brought action to determine
whether it was necessary in the public interest to revoke the registration of Frederick N. Goldsmith, doing business as F. N. Goldsmith
Financial Service, who was permanently enjoined by a decree of
the supreme court of New York from acting- as an investment adviser,
broker, or dealer. At the hearing, Goldsmith stipulated the facts and
filed a notice of withdrawal.
Goldsmith's subscribers were led to believe that he was a skilled investment adviser applying his judgment to generally accepted objective data and that he was in a position to obtain additional or advance
information by his close contacts with particular issuers and large
holders of securities.
In view of these representations, the Commission found that his dissemination of advice, admittedly based in part
on the comic strips in which he believed there existed a code which,
interpreted by him, would reflect future movements of certain securities on the stock exchanges, was fraudulent, reckless, and without concern for the public welfare. However, the Commission concluded
that, under all the circumstances, including Mr. Goldsmith's advanced
age of 84 years and the fact that there had been no previous complaints
about the conduct of his business, it would be consistent with the public
interest to permit him to withdraw from registration as an investment
adviser. The Commission noted that the existence of the injunction
would supply a statutory basis for reviewing the public interest if he
should seek re-registration at some future time.

PART VIII
OTHER

ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION UNDER
THE VARIOUS STATUTES
THE COMMISSION IN THE COURTS

Civil Proceedings

Complete lists of all cases in which the Commission appeared before
a Federal or State court, either as a party or as amicus curiae, during
the fiscal year, and the status of such cases at the close of the year, are
contained in the appendix tables.
At the beginning of the 1950 fiscal year there were pending in the
courts 20 injunctive and related enforcement proceedings instituted by
the Commission to prevent fraudulent and other illegal practices in
the sale of securities, 34 additional proceedings were instituted during
the year and 36 cases were disposed of, so that 18 of such proceedings
were pending at the end of the year. In addition, the Commission participated in a large number of reorganization cases under chapter X
of the Bankruptcy Act ;" in 22 proceedings in the district courts under
section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Com'pany Act and in 38
miscellaneous actions, usually as amicus curiae, or intervenor, to advise
the court of its views regarding the construction of provisions of statutes administered by the Commission which were involved in private
lawsuits. The Commission also participated in 53 appeals. Of these,
12 came before the courts on petition for review of an administrative
order; 14 arose out of corporate reorganizations in which the Commission had taken an active part; 4 were appeals in actions brought by or
against the Commission; 12 were appeals from orders entered pursuant to section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act;
and 11 were appeals in cases in which the Commission appeared as
amicus curiae or intervenor.
Certain significant aspects of the Commission's litigation during
the year are discussed in the section of this report devoted to the
statute under which the litigation arose.
Criminal Proceedings

The statutes administered by the Commission provide for the transmission of evidence of violations to the Attorney General who may
institute criminal proceedings.
The Commission, largely through
its regional offices, investigates suspected violations and, in cases where
the facts appear to warrant criminal proceedings, prepares detailed
reports which are forwarded to the Attorney General. The Commission, primarily through its employees who have participated in the
investigation, also assists the United States attorneys in many of

these cases in the presentation to the grand jury, the conduct of the
trial, and the preparation of briefs on appeal. It also transmits
parole reports prepared by its investigators relating to convicted
ofl'enders. Where the investigation discloses violations of statutes
other than those administered by the Commission, reference is made
to the appropriate Federal or State agency.
Indictments were returned against 2,601 defendants in 453 cases
developed by the Commission prior to June 30, 1950.2 This includes
37 defendants in 22 cases in which indictments were returned during
the past fiscal year. At the close of the fiscal year 422 cases had been
disposed of as to one or more defendants, and convictions had been
obtained in 370 cases 3--over 87 percent--against a total of 1,271
defendants. Convictions were obtained against 20 defendants in 15
cases during the past year.' In addition, criminal contempt proceedings were instituted during this period against two defendants in two
cases. One such defendant was convicted and the other is awaiting
trial," Judgments of conviction were affirmed on appeal as to two
defendants during the year, and one case involving a single defendant
remained pending in the court of appeals at the close of the fiscal year.
Criminal cases developed and prosecuted by the Commission during
the past year covered a wide variety of promotions. In general, they
included fraudulent promotions of various mining ventures, fraud
in the sale of securities relating to oil and gas properties, new businesses and inventions, and frauds perpetrated by securities brokers
and dealers and their representatives. Frequently, the defendants,
in employing these fraudulent schemes, wilfully avoided compliance
with the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, which
are designed to provide investors with a full and fair disclosure of
material facts about the securities being sold. As a result, a number
of fraud cases involved violation of these registration provisions.
In one of the cases dealing with mining securities the fraudulent
representations made to investors were characterized by the trial court
as more fantastic than the tales of Baron Munchausen (U. S. v.lngwold S. Steensland (D. Minn.j ), Steensland was convicted of defrauding investors of an estimated $100,000 in connection with the
promotion of what he represented to be a coal mining -and timber
project in British Columbia, Canada. The defendant sold securities
in a fictitious corporation claimed to have been organized under a
"Canadian Secret Corporations Act." There is no such statute. According to the testimony of investors, the defendant represented to
them that the late President Roosevelt was obligated to an associate
in the venture by reason of his services in recovering for the Federal
Government some $23,000,000from persons who had committed frauds
against the Government. Investors were told that as a result of the
intercession of the late President on behalf of the venture and because
of their gratitude for American participation in World War II, the

British and Canadian authorities had approved a grant of 10,000
square miles of British Columbia land to the defendant containing
vast coal and ore deposits and tremendous timber reserves. Investors
were told that the governments of China, Australia, India, and New
Zealand were interested in the project and that the World Bank
would advance many millions of dollars to finance it.
Other convictions involving mining promotions were obtained
during the past year in U. S. v. William A. Snyder et al. (D. Colo.)
and U. S. v, Walter A. Stogsdill (N. D. Okla.). The first involved
sales of the stock of the Southern Potash Co., an insolvent company,
as to which it was charged misrepresentations were made regarding,
among other things, the status and value of the company's leases of
acreage from which it proposed to extract potash. In the second
case the conviction was obtained on a plea of nolo contendere to charges
of violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of
1933 in selling interests in a purported lead and zinc mining venture
known as the Little Beaver Mining Co.
Convictions were obtained in several cases involving the fraudulent
sale of securities relating to the promotion of oil and gas properties.
The indictments in such cases alleged false representations concerning, among other things, the options and leases purportedly owned
by the corporation and the status of its oil production and earnings
(U. S. v. Robert L. Burch et al., N. D. Tex.) ; 6 the use to which money
received from investors would be put (U. S. v. Galen B. Finch, S. D.
CaL), and the qualifications of a geologist (U. S. v. Glaude Oleoe
Alfred, E. D. Tenn.). In the Finch case the defendant was charged
with diverting to his own use funds which he represented would be
used solely for the purpose of drilling wells. The defendant in the
Alfred case told investors that he had been a geologist in the Federal
Government, that he had discovered an oil pool in a particular area,
and that in the past he had drilled 42 wildcat oil wells of which 40
were commercially producing wells. An additional conviction was
obtained during the year in the Oactue Oil 00. case 7 where the charges
against the defendants included the payment of corporate "dividends"
out of capital for the purpose of inducing investors to make repeated
purchases of stock.
The fraudulent sale of securities in the promotion of a so-called
"kickless automatic sport shotgun" was the basis for the conviction
during the past year in U. S. v. William Ray Baldwin (D. Del.).
Among other things, it was charged that Baldwin falsely informed
investors that the promotional corporation shortly would receive
from the United States Government some $800,000 for the use of
patents owned by the corporation which would make it possible for
the corporation to pay dividends to stockholders and that the money
received from the sale of securities would be used to develop and
manufacture a new sport shotgun. It was alleged that the defendant
• Three individual defendants were convicted. On motion of the United States attorney
the indictment was dismiBBedas to the corporation, the remaining defendant.
Misrepresentations respecting the quantity of oU being produced are included in the
charges in U. 8. v. George E. Baldwin (N. D. Ill.), a pending case, in which an indictment
was returned during the past year.

omitted to disclose to investors that the corporation was insolvent,
that all money received from them was being used for the promoters'
personal use and benefit, and that the Government had advised that
it did not owe any money to the corporation.
Other allegedly fraudulent activities involving the promotion of
mechanical devices were the subject of indictments obtained in the
past year in U. S. v. Doak Norwood, (N. D. Ill.) (desk pad device)
and U. S. v. Philip M. Carter et al. (S. D. N. Y.) (acoustical material),
both of which cases are pending.
Other business promotions resulting in criminal proceedings during
the past year were involved in U. S. v. Alfred L. Lodge et al. (W. D.
Okla.) (production, manufacture, and sale of brooms), U. S. v. Jim
May (S. D. Tex.) (grain trading venture), and U. S. v. Paul A.
Schumpert et al. (M. D. Tenn.) (small loan company). The defendants in the first two cases were indicted during the year and
convictions were obtained after the close of the fiscal year. In the
Schumpert case convictions were obtained during the year on an
earlier indictment," and another indictment was returned during the
year against additional defendants. In the Lodge case the misrepresentations included such matters as the use to be made of the proceeds
obtained from securities sales, the profits and property owned by
the corporations, and the approval of the securities by the Commission. Both the May and Schumpert cases involved, among other
things, a "Ponzi" type of swindle where, to induce further investment,
capital was returned to investors in the guise of profits.
Convictions involving securities brokers and dealers and their
representatives were obtained during the past year in U. S. v, D. S.
Walldy (W. D. Ark.), where the defendant operated a securities business while insolvent, converted customers' funds and securities, filed
false and misleading financial statements with the Commission, and
failed to keep the books and records required by section 17 (a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and by the Commission's rules thereunder; in U. S. v. Louis A. Starling et al. (W. D. Va.), where the
defendants, under the pretense of rendering impartial investment
advice, induced their customers to purchase the defendants' personally
owned shares of a tobacco company by misrepresenting, among other
things, the financial condition of the company and by failing to disclose
that the stock was being sold for the personal profit of the defendants;
and in U. S. v. Stanley M. Brown (D. D. C.), U. S. v, Alvis Roy Davis
(W. D. Mo.), and U. S. v. Otto F. Herald (N. D. Ill.), in which cases
the conversion of customers' money or securities constituted a part of
the frauds charged. The defendant in the Herald case was convicted
also of violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, since he had engaged in the business of
effecting securities transactions without being registered with the
Commission as required by section 15 (a) of the act.
Indictments involving securities brokers and dealers are presently
pending in U. S. v. Frederick F. March (N. D. IlL), U. S. v. Ed1lJin R.
Hawley (D. Ariz.), and U.S. v.EugeneF. Luck (S. D. Fla.). March
is accused of fraudulently selling interests in a purported investment

plan to be operated by him by misrepresenting, among other things,
the nature of the investment plan and the profits which investors would
make on their investments in this plan. In fact, according to the
indictment, the defendant converted to his own use and benefit, and
used for gambling purposes, a large part of the money which he obtained from investors. In addition, the indictment charges him with
paying back to investors, as "profits" resulting from the operation of
his plan, portions of their capital contributions.
The frauds charged
in the Hawley and Luck cases involve, among other things, the conversion of customers' funds and securities. As a part of the alleged fraud
employed in the latter case, it is charged that the defendant forged
various documents and sold stock of his securities brokerage firm to
his customers by means of various false representations.
Criminal contempt proceedings were instituted during_ the year in
S. v, James Nelson (S. D. Cal.) and U. S. ex rei. SEO v, Josiah
Marshall Kirby (N. D. Ohio). Nelson was convicted for violating a
1944 injunction decree which enjoined him from selling securities in
violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.
Despite this decree, Nelson sold securities, which had not been registered with the Commission, relating to certain syndicates known as the
"Apache Golden Treasure Syndicate" and the "Tayopa Golden Treasure Syndicate."
The contempt proceeding in the Kirby case is
pending. The petition alleges that Kirby continued to act as an overthe-counter securities broker and dealer, without registration under
section 15 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in violation of
preliminary and final injunction decrees obtained in 1948 and 1949
respectively.
In the only appellate case involving criminal prosecution decided
during the fiscal year, Nemec et
v, U. S., 178 F. 2d 656 (C. A. 9,
1949), certiorari denied 339 U. S. 985, the conviction of defendents
for the fraudulent sale of securities in connection with the promotion
of a purported gold mining venture was sustained.

COMPLAINTS

AND INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission is authorized under the acts it administers to investigate possible violations. Among the sources of information about
violations are the examination by the staff of material filed with the
Commission (e. g., ownership reports indicating transactions in equity
securities by officers and directors) information furnished by other
governmental agencies, better business bureaus, State authorities, and
complaints made by members of the public. Complaints from the
public provide the chief source of leads with respect to such violations. During the 1950 fiscal year 9,335 letters were received by the
principal office relating to possible violations of the Securities Act of
1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This volume of complaints represented an increase over the preceding year of more than
30 percent.
Investigations are classified generally as preliminary or docketed
investigations.
A preliminary mvestigation is one instituted for the
purpose of determining whether probable violations have occurred
and this type of investigation is carried on largely through corre-

152

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

spondence, office research, or limited interviews. If the information
developed in the preliminary investigation indicates such violations
of the law as to require a full-scale field investigation, the, case is
In a great many instances,
transferred to a docketed investigation.
however, the preliminary investigation discloses that the violation, if
any, is of a minor nature warrantmg neither a full-scale investigation
nor the imposition of any of the sanctions provided by law. These include situations in which the violation comes to the attention of the
Commission shortly after its inception, where the violation appears
to be inadvertent, and where immediate steps have been taken by the
offender to comply with the law.
The Commission has subpena powers and designates officers for the
purpose of conducting investigations, issuing subpenas, and administering oaths. Subpenas are used only where the investigation cannot
be concluded without their use and only after a preliminary report and
reasons for the necessity of issuance of the subpenas have been presented to the Commission. During the 1950 fiscal year the Commission authorized use of subpenas by issuance of formal orders for investigation in 35 cases.
The extent of the investigatory activities of the Commission during
the 1950 fiscal year under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, sections 12 (e) and (b) of the Public Utilities
Holding Company Act of 1935, the Investment Company Act of 1940,
and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 is shown in the following

Canadian Situation

During the 1950 fiscal year illegal offerings in the United States
of oil and mining securities emanating from Canada continued to be
of grave concern to the Commission. Practically all of these offerings
are made by mail from Toronto, Ontario. Complaints from the public, better business bureaus, and State authorities have been received
in large numbers from all parts of the United States. State authorities have continued to issue cease and desist orders where solicitations
have been made in violation of their securities laws. Newspapers and
magazines have performed a valuable service by warning the public
about these violations.
The Post Office Department has continued
to cooperate with the Commission in trying to prevent the losses caused

SIXTEENTH

ANNUM, REPORT

153

by these illegal mass mail campaigns. During the year the Post Office
Department issued orders against 14 individuals and firms who have
conducted such mail campaigns, based upon the use of fictitious names.
In addition, the Post Office Department, based upon information furnished by the Commission, issued fraud orders to stop the delivery
of mail to 27 firms in Toronto who, were offering shares by means of
fraudulent representations and omissions.
All of these cases involved violations of the registration provisions
of the Securities Act of 1933. Every full investigation has shown that
unregistered securities being offered and sold in the United States from
Toronto have been offered and sold by means of false and fraudulent
representations.
It is believed that the vigorous campaign by the Commission, with
the cooperation of other governmental agencies, has been effective in
reducing these violations. However, they have not been completely
eliminated.
The Commission has continued its efforts to improve
the extradition provisions of our treaties with Canada so as to enable
the Government of the United States to bring the fraudulent operators to trial.
Section of Securities Violations

Inthe first year of its existence the Commission established a section
of securities violations for assistance in the enforcement of the various
statutes which it administers and to provide a further means of preventing fraud in the purchase and sale of securities. This section has
developed files which provide the basis of maintaining a clearing
house of information concerning persons who have been charged with
violations of various Federal and State securities statutes. The specialized information in these files has been kept current through the
cooperation of the United States Post Office Department, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, parole and probation officials, State securities commissions, Federal and State prosecuting attorneys, police
officials, and members of the United States Chamber of Commerce.
By the end of the 1950 fiscal year these records contained data concerning 53,162 persons against whom Federal or State action had been
taken in connection with securities violations.
During the past year alone additional items of information relating
to 6,324 persons were added to the records of this section, including
information concerning 1,997 persons not previously identified therein.
Extensive use is made of this clearing house of information.
During the past year, in connection with the maintenance and preventive
application of these records, the Commission received 4,298 "securities
violations" letters or reports (apart from those which are classified
~s "complaint enforcement") and dispatched 3,007 communications
III turn to cooperating agencies,
ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

Many of the reports or documents required to be filed each year
with the Commission contain financial data, mostly in the form of
financial statements and related schedules. These are always a vital,
often the most significant, element of the information the investor
must have upon which to predicate investment decisions. Because

154

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

the Congress recognized that accounting and accountants perform such
an important role in achieving the statutory purpose of disclosure,
and because financial statements lend themselves readily to misleading
inferences or even deception, whether or not consciously intended, the
statutes administered by the Commission deal extensively with accounting, and activities of the Commission in the field of accounting
are necessarily significant.
Thus, for example, the Securities Act not only provides for inclusion in prospectus of balance sheets and profit and loss information
"in such form as the Commission shall prescribe," 9 but authorizes the
Commission to prescribe "the items or details to be shown in the balance sheet and earning statement, and the methods to be followed in
the preparation of accounts. * * *" 10 Similar authority is contained in the Securities Exchange .Act,ll and more comprehensive
power is embodied in the Investment Company .Act 12 and the Holding
Company .Act.13
The Securities Act provides that the required financial statements
shall be certified by "an independent public or certified accountant." 14
The other three statutes above mentioned provide that the Commission
may require that such statements be accompanied by a certificate of
independent public accountants." The Commission's rules require
that statements filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act and
the Investment Company .Act be so certified. The value of certification
has for many years been conceded but the requirement as to independence, long recognized by some individual accountants, was for the
first time authoritatively and explicitly stated by its introduction into
the statutes.
Out of this initial provision in the Securities Act and
the resulting rules established by the Commission 16 there have grown
concepts that have materially strengthened the protection afforded
investors by eliminating certain unhealthy accountant-client
relationships which theretofore were quite common.
Although the statutes administered by the Commission give it wide
rule-making power, accounting, based as it is largely upon convention
and existing financial and business concepts, is of such a nature that
the Commission has not yet found it necessary or desirable in most
areas to establish extensive accounting rules and regulations dealing
with accounting problems. The Commission has prescribed uniform
systems of accounts for certain public utility holding companies and
for public utility mutual and subsidiary service companies. It has
adopted rules under the Securities .Act governing accounting and
auditing of exchange members, brokers, and dealers. In the wider
area dealing with industrial, commercialhand investment companies
under the Securities Act, Securities Exc ange .Act, and Investment
Company .Act the form and content of most financial statements are
governed by the Commission's regulation S-X.

The rules and regulations thus established do not prescribe the
accounting to be followed except in certain basic respects. In the
large area not covered by such rules the Commission's principal reliance for the protection of investors is on the determination and
application of accounting standards which are recognized as sound
and which have come to have general acceptance. This policy of the
Commission is expressed in accounting series release No.4 (1938) (one
of the series of such releases inaugurated in 1937 to publish accounting
statements and opinions which are of general interest).
One of the inevitable results of this policy has been constant
contact and cooperation between the Commission and other governmental agencies and accountants both individually and through such
groups as the American Institute of Accountants, the American Accounting Association, the Controllers Institute of America, the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners and others.
The importance of this cooperation is emphasized by the great influence
and responsibility inherent in the Commission's authority over the several thousand financial statements filed every year with it by most of
the important commercial and industrial companies in the United
States.
The accounting staff of the Commission is organized to handle the
many day-to-day accounting problems that arise in the course of its
work and to provide central responsibility for aiding the Commission
in matters of accounting policy. The chief accountant has general
supervision with respect to accounting and auditing policy and its
application. He is assisted directly by a staff of trained accountants,
and, in addition, by assistant chief accountants assigned to and responsible for the examination of financial data and other operating
work in the Division of Corporation Finance, Division of Trading and
Exchanges and Division of Public Utilities.
Examination of Financial Statements

The majority of the accounting problems with which the Commission
is concerned arise from examination of financial statements or other
data required to be filed with the Commission. In general, deficiencies
revealed by examination are called to the attention of the registrant
by letter. These letters of comment and the corresJ?ondence or conferences that follow have proved to be a most convement aid in effecting corrections and improvements in financial reporting. Few matters
involve prolonged discussion or dispute in spite of the tremendous
volume of financial data reviewed each year by the Commission; and
it is only in rare instances that formal procedures are necessary in
order to procure disclosure.
Many problems arise as a result of inquiry by representatives of
registrants, their accountants or counsel in advance of the actual
filing of the material involved. Advance discussion of this kind is
encouraged and experienced practitioners regularly follow this procedure in dealinz with unique problems-thus saving valuable time for
themselves and their clients. As a natural outgrowth of the fact that
the Commission studies and is the repository of a vast reservoir of
financial data, the staff is frequently called on to aid in the preparation

156

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of studies of current problems such as those involved in formulating
the background of legislative proposals.
Proposed Amendment

of Regulation

SOX

Regulation S-X is the Commission's basic accounting rezulation
relating to the form and content of financial statements filed under
tbe Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, and the Investment
Company Act. This regulation was promulgated in February 1940
and in many respects simply brought together requirements theretofore contained in the separate registration and annual report forms.
The only major changes in the regulation since its issuance in 1940
have been the addition in 1942 of article 6A relating to unit investment trusts, the complete revision in 1946 of article 6 relating to
management investment companies and a new article 5A, adopted in
1948, applying to commercial, industrial, and mining companies in
the promotional, exploratory, or development stage.
Many accounting and reporting problems have arisen during the
10 years that have elapsed since the adoption of regulation S- X. Both
the incidence and solution of some of these matters have involved
changed viewpoints, not only of industry and the accounting profession, but also of the Commission. Furthermore, entirely new situations have developed requiring the establishment of new procedures.
For these reasons it has been thought desirable to revise the regulation.
When the present proposal to amend regulation S-X was made in
September 1949, copies of the preliminary draft were sent to 325 persons and an additional 15 or more were sent to persons who requested
copies, mostly as a result of an item in the October 1949 Journal of
Accountancy which invited readers to obtain and comment upon the
preliminary draft.
Several accounting firms and professional groups
requested additional copies so that, in all, approximately 600 copies
were sent out. Approximately 115 persons, including 46 controllers
or principal accounting officers of corporations, submitted comments.
The large number of comments and recommendations received was
given a great deal of careful study. Amendments originally proposed
were reconsidered as a result of these comments and the final revision
of the proposed amendments was sent out and formal notice of amendment was given under the Administrative
Procedures Act on July
12, 1950. In view of the ~reat importance of the regulation, the
most careful consideration will be given to the additional comments
and suggestions expected to be received before enactment of amendments.
Other Developments

in Accounting and Auditing

The Commission's fifteenth annual report mentioned the disclosure
and accounting problem that arose from the increasingly popular
form of financrng by means of long-term leases or more particularly
the sell-and-Iease-back device. To a considerable extent the Commission's disclosure requirements applicable to such transactions have
been in existence for a number of years. Thus, item 5 of the schedule
of "Supplementary Profit and Loss Information," rule 12-16 of regulation S-X, requires that there be stated certain minimum data as to
annual rentals, if significant.
In view of the very important nature

SIXTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

157

of lease-type financing, particularly the fixed character of the commitment undertaken, the Commission has in the past several years
asked that there also be given, by a brief reference in a footnote to
the balance sheet, the principal details of significant transactions occuring within the year or years covered by the report. The Commission also has indicated that where the transaction is such that it
is in substance a purchase of property, the transaction must, despite
the lease form, be accounted for as a purchase. The principles were
also adopted in the recommendation of the Committee on Accounting
Procedure, American Institute of Accountants, in its Accounting Research Bulletin No. 38 issued in October 1949.
Although the Commission had earlier indicated its position with
respect to accounting for the obligations created by corporate pension
plans, during the current year it was found desirable to give further
consideration to the matter. This did not involve the one-time
troublesome question of the proper disposition of expenditures to fund
payments or liabilities determined upon the basis of past services of
employees. The propriety of charging such amounts direct to income
rather than to surplus is no longer challenged. Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 36 in November 1948 by the American Institute of Accountants is, in principal, in agreement with the Commission's view.
However, there arose again the problem of the accounting for possible or implicit liabilities associated with past service elements of
pension plans where the corporation is under no contractual obligation to continue the plan beyond the current year or few years immediately following. In the case of actual liability arismg from
an irrevocable commitment to the future payment of pensions it was
not difficult to conclude that any unfunded liability for past service
benefits, actuarily determined, should, under accepted accounting
principles, be set up in the accounts. At the date of adoption of the
plan such liability would, of course, relate not only to employees
actually retired or qualified for retirement but also to the past service
of those employees who would not qualify for retirement until a future
date.
Such completely irrevocable commitments apparently occur rarely,
if at all. In recent months union-management negotiations, particularly in the steel industry, have led to the adoption of various plans
which might not legally bind the employers to fund past-service elements even though in a typical instance the plan is, by contract, to
continue for 5 years. Question arose as to the extent of disclosure required to be given in proxy statements coming before the Commission
for examination.
As an accounting matter the Commission had earlier concluded that
even though there is no contract, or the pension contract may run for
a short period only, it would be unrealistic to ignore the probability
that, once having installed a plan or entered into a short-term contract,
the company will continue it. Accordingly it was believed that there
should be disclosed in a brief footnote to the balance sheet not only the
important terms of the plan, including estimates of amounts payable annually, but also the company's best estimate of the amount that
would be necessary to fund, or complete the funding of, past service
obligations at the balance sheet date on the assumption that the plan

158

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

is to be continued. In the case of employees who have retired or are
eligible to retire, an equally realistic approach seems to require that,
apart from any question as to legal liability, balance sheet provision
should be made in an amount equal to the sum necessary to fund the
obligation.
Upon request, in connection with the proxy material filed with it,
the Commission informally reconsidered its position and concluded
that it could find no sound and reasonable basis for a different view
than that held earlier as to the appropriate treatment in financial
statements. The Commission also indicated that the disclosure requirements in proxy material, to be furnished to stockholders as a basis
for stockholder action on the pension plan, are essentially the same as
in the case of financial statements and that therefore substantially the
same treatment should be given to the facts.
InSeptember 1949, the British Government announced a very material devaluation of its currency in terms of the United States dollar.
Devaluations were almost immediately announced by many other foreign governments with the result that a large number of domestic
corporations engaged in business in these countries were presented with
problems as to how to state the accounts of their foreign subsidiaries
and branches interms of United States currency. Since many of these
corporations publish quarterly financial data for the benefit of stockholders and others, prompt decisions were necessary. Although the
Commission generally does not exercise jurisdiction over stockholders'
reports as such, many inquiries as to the Commission's views were
received from registrants in anticipation of the later filing of their
annual reports.
The first problem presented in many instances was whether to continue the previous practice of consolidating foreign and domestic operations. The Commission recognized that the decision on this point
is one primarily to be reached by the company and its independent
accountants, having due regard for all the facts, and having in mind
the objective of most clearly exhibiting the financial condition and results of operations of the parent company and its subsidiaries. While
not then called upon to make a decision in any particular case, the staff,
in answer to a number of inquiries, indicated its general conclusion
that the consolidation question might well be determined upon the
basis of the degree of integration of the foreign operations with
domestic operations.
If such foreign operations are essentially an arm or extension of domestic operations, and are actively being conducted, the view held is
that there is a presumption in favor of the consolidation thereof, despite the probable impact upon the foreign operations of unfavorable
political and economic factors. If, in an instance of this kind, remittances to the parent company are restricted, appropriate disclosure
of the facts would be necessary and the consolidated profit and loss
statement should reflect only earnings of foreign subsidiaries which are
available to the parent in terms of United States dollars. If, on the
other hand, the foreign operations constitute a complete and separate
business unit in and of themselves, and serious economic problems are
presented, nonconsolidation would generally appear to be indicated.
In the examination of reports filed with the Commission since these

SIXTEE~

~AL

REPORT

159

developments it has been observed that in a substantial number of
cases foreign operations previously included in consolidation have
been removed therefrom and, where falling within the Commission's
tests of significance, have been reported on separately.
A more persistent question was whether, as a result of widespread
devaluations and foreign conditions generally, any new principles were
applicable with respect to the conversion of foreign assets into a dollar
equivalent. It was the staff's opinion, expressed in numerous instances, that no new problem existed and that the well-established
practices of the past are quite adequate and appropriate to cope with
any situation that has come to its attention. The general principles
applicable in the case of conversion of foreign net assets are well expressed in Accounting Research Bulletin No.4 (1939) of the American
Institute of Accountants. Question arose, however, concerning the
extent to which losses recognized in connection with the devaluation
should be recognized by charges against income. The staff's position,
concurred in by the Commission in a recent informal ruling, is that
losses of this nature, even though large in amount, are a risk incident
to doing business and are therefore proper charges against income.
This conclusion was arrived at independently of the general question
of the propriety of charges and credits to earned surplus.
Among the proposed amendments to regulation S-X are provisions
dealing in certain important respects with the above described problems as to long-term lease commitments, pension plans, accountin~ for
operations of foreign subsidiaries, and the impropriety of direct
charges to earned surplus.
Several of the annual reports of the past few years have commented
upon a group of accounting cases that arises in the administration of
rules X-17A-3 and X-17A-5 under the Securities Exchange Act,
governing securities brokers and dealers. As has been noted, most of
the difficulties encountered in this field of regulation are due to the
large number of small firms and the fact that many of the required
audits are performed by accountants unfamiliar with the Commission's
requirements and apparently not well trained in the improved procedures of brokerage accounting and auditing practice. During the past
year the Commission's staff, through correspondence and through direct contact by regional office representatives, continued to devote
considerable time to improvement in this area. In most cases it was
apparent that inexperience rather than deliberate evasion was the
cause of the unsatisfactory reports filed. There were a number of
cases involving certifying accountants, however, in which, although
formal proceedings under rule II of the rules of practice were not necessary, the audit work failed completely to approach generally accepted auditing standards and required that informal action, usually
warning or admonition, be taken.
The various changes by the Commission in its forms are described
in the preceding sections discussing the administration of the various
acts. There were no material changes affecting the work of accountants although of interest was the elimination of the well-known Form
I-MD and the extension of Form 10-K to annual reports pursuant to
both sections 13 and 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act.

COMMISSION

DIVISION OF OPINION WRITING

The Division of Opinion Writing aids the Commission in the
preparation of findings, opinions, and orders promulgated by the
Commission in contested and other cases arising under the Securities
Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Holding Company Act of 1935, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the Investment
Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
statutes provide for a wide variety of administrative proceed1~
which require quasi-judicial determination by the Commission.
Formal opinions are issued in all cases where the nature of the matter
to be decided, whether substantive or procedural, is of sufficient importance to warrant a formal expression of views.
The Division of Opinion Writing is an independent staff office
which is directly responsible to the Commission. It receives all
assignments and instructions from and makes recommendations and
submits its work to the Commission directly. It is headed by a director, who is assisted by an assistant director, supervising attorneys,
and a staff of drafting attorneys and a financial analyst.
While engaged in the preparation of opinions assigned to the Division of Opinion Writing, the members of this division are completely
isolated from members of the operating division actively participating
in the proceedings and it is an invariable rule that those assigned to
prepare such an opinion must not have had any 'prior participation
m any phase of the proceedings with respect to which the opinion is to
be prepared. Commission experts are from time to time consulted on
technical problems arising in the course of the preparation of opinions
and findings, but these experts are never individuals who have participated in the preparation of the case or testified at the hearing.
The director or assistant director of the Division of Opinion Writing, together with the members of the staff of the division who are
assigned to work on a particular case, attend the oral argument of
the cases before the Commission and frequently keep abreast of current
hearings. Prior to the oral argument, the division makes a preliminary review of the record and prepares and submits to the Commission
a summary of the facts and issues raised in the hearings before the
hearing officer, as well as in any proposed findings and supporting
briefs, the hearing officer's recommended decision, and exceptions
thereto taken by the parties. Following oral argument or, if no oral
argument has been held, then at such time as the case is ready for
decision, the Division of Opinion Writing is instructed by the Commission respecting the nature and content of the opinion and order
to be prepared.
In preparing the draft of the Commission's formal opinion, the
entire record in the proceedings is read by a member of the staff of
the Division of Opinion Writing_and in some cases he prepares a
narrative abstract of the record. Upon completion of a draft opinion
and abstract of the record, and after review and revision of the
opinion within the Division of Opinion Writing, they are submitted
to the Commission. If the study of the record in the case by the
Division of Opinion Writing has revealed evidence of violations warranting a reference to the Attorney General for criminal prosecution, or has disclosed the desirability or th~ 'need for any changes in

These

SIXTEENTH

ANNUA,L REPORT

161

administrative procedures or techniques, appropriate recommendations are made to the Commission at the time the draft opinion in the
case is submitted.
The draft opinion as submitted may be modified, amended, or completely rewritten in accordance with the Commission's final instructions. When the opinion accurately expresses the views and conclusions of the Commission, it is adopted and promulgated as the official
decision of the Commission. In some cases concurring or dissenting
opinions are issued by individual Commissioners who wish to express
their separate views on matters covered by the opinion adopted by
the majority of the Commission. In such cases the Division of Opinion
Writing is occasionally instructed to prepare drafts of such concurring or dissenting opinions and confers respecting them with the
individual Commissioners involved, submits drafts directly to them,
and makes such modifications and revisions as are directed.
The findings of fact, opinions, and orders adopted and promulgated by the Commission serve as an aid and guide to the bench and
bar. With minor exceptions (e. g., certain opinions dealing with
requests for confidential treatment) all are publicly released and
distributed to representatives of the press and persons on the Commission's mailing list. In addition, the findings and opinions are
printed and published bic the Government Printing Office in bound
volumes under the title' Securities and Exchange Commission Decisions and Reports."
The creation of the Division of Opinion Writing as an independent
staff unit in 1942 was based on the view that the fair exercise of the
Commission's adjudicatory functions in many types of cases made it
appropriate that it be assisted in that function by members of its staff
who were independent of units engaged in investigation or prosecution of cases. Originally initiated as a matter of Commission policy,
the desirability of this arrangement was subsequently given express
recognition in specific provisions of the Administrative Procedure
Act, which in certain types of cases requires that there be a complete
separation of function between quasi-prosecutory functions and quasijudicial functions. The existence of the Division of Opinion Writing
thus made it possible for the Commission, even before the passage of
the Administrative Procedure Act, to meet fully the separation of
function requirements contained in sections 5 (c), 7 and 8 of the act.
The Commission, through its revised rules of practice, has sought
to provide a flexible J?rocedure which will be suited to the needs and
desires of the participants in the proceeding before it, as well as
guarantee to them the procedural safeguards required by the general principles of due process and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act. Thus, at the request of some participants, the Commission has in many cases availed itself of the assistance of the Division of Opinion Writing in the preparation of its findings even though
separation of functions was not required by law.
Further, under rule In of the Commission's rules of practice, the
moving party may, subject to a contrary determination by the Commission, specify the procedures considered necessary or appropriate
in the proceedings, with particular reference to (1) whether there
9l58fl--51----1~

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

should be a recommended decision by a hearing officer; (2) whether
there should be a recommended decision by any other responsible
officer of the Commission; (3) whether the interested division of
the Commission's staff, or only the Division of Opinion Writing
may assist in the preparation of the Commission's decision; and
(4) whether there should be a 30-day waiting period between the issuance of the Commission's order and the date it is to become effective.
Other parties may object to the procedures or specify other procedures, but in the absence of such objection or specification of additional procedures they may be deemed to have waived objection to
the specified procedure and to the omission of any procedure not
specified.
In addition to its primary function, the Division of Opinion Writing is also given assignments of a general nature which are not inconsistent with the objective of the separation of the investigatory and
quasi-judicial functions. Thus, the division has been assigned continuing joint responsibility with the officeof the General Counsel in
dealing with problems arising under the Administrative Procedure
Act. It has also been given the responsibility of preparing a compilation of administrative decisions and other authorities under the
various statutes administered by the Commission.
The Division of Opinion Writing assists the operating divisions
of the Commission in the preparation of opinions in certain uncontested cases where participation by the operating division in the
decisional process is proper under the Administrative Procedure Act.
In some instances members of the Division of Opinion Writing are
assigned to assist the Officeof the General Counsel in connection with
court appeals taken from Commission decisions initially drafted in
the Division.
Some of the more significant opinions issued by the Commission
during the year are commented upon in this report under the discussions of the various statutes.
FOREIGN FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC MATI'ERS-THE

INTERNATIONAL

BANK

Registration statements covering $230,738,915 of securities issued
by foreign issuers, private and governmental, were filed during the
fiscal year 1950 under the Securities Act of 1933. About $190,000,000
of these securities were issued by governments; and about $175,000,000
of these governmental issues emanated from Canada.
Upon the outbreak of World War II United States national securities exchanges suspended dealings in all securities of German,
Japanese, Italian, and other axis origins. Shortly thereafter the
Commission, after consultation with the Departments of State and
Treasury, requested that brokers and dealers refrain from effecting
transactions in these securities. Following the filing of a registration statement by the Republic of Italy in December 1947, covering
an offer of exchange for outstanding dollar bonds of the Kingdom
of Italy and certain municipal and corporate obligations, the Commission withdrew its cease-trading request as it affected Italian
securities.

SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT

In recognition of the interest of United States bondholders the
Commission has consulted with the Departments of State, Treasury,
Justice, and with the Armed Services on the questions involved in
the eventual resumption of trading in German, Japanese, and other
former Axis issues. Events which have taken place since these bonds
were suspended from trading have been reviewed. The uncertain
status of prewar dollar obligations of Germany, the lack of a peace
treaty, and the substantial dollar obligations it had incurred during
the period of occupation have been noted.
Through the supreme commander of the Allied Powers the Commission has (in consultation with the Ministry of Finance of the
Japanese Government) endeavored to get current information filed
with respect to the status of Japanese dollar bonds which were outstanding prior to the war. The Japanese Government has expressed
the intention of complying with the Commission's requirements for
the filing of data so that United States investors will be fully informed
as to the status of these bonds. The public availability of reliable
information of this kind is a necessary condition of any resumption
of dealings in the bonds.
The Commission has continued its representation on the staff committee of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary
and Financial Problems and has continued to cooperate with other
agencies concerned with the development of the Government's foreign
economic program.
The Commission has also contributed to the development of the
President's Point IV program for the provision of technical assistance
to and the encouragement of private investment in underdeveloped
countries. It has participated in studies relating to the revival of
private foreign investment for developmental projects. It has also
consulted with the Department of State on the inclusion in Treaties
of Friendship, Commerce and Economic Development of clauses intended to protect investors in foreign securities.
The Commission, as a member of the Board of Visitors of the
Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, Inc., continued consultation
with the Department of State on problems referred to the Board by
officers of the Council.
The Commission has during the year had discussions with representatives of several foreign governments on the laws, regulations, and
procedures applicable to the issuance of and trading in foreign securities in United States capital markets.
By amendment to the Bretton Woods Agreements Act securities
issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the International

change Act of 1934.1S The Commission in consultation with the
National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial
Problems is authorized to suspend the provisions of this amendment
at any time.
Pursuant to regulation BW, adopted by the Commission under
the amendment to the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, the bank files
with the Commission information comparable to that which would be
required if its securities had been registered under the Securities Act
of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934:. The amendment
requires the Commission to include in its annual reports to Congress
such information as it shall deem advisable with regard to the operation and effect of the amendment, and in connection therewith to
include any views submitted for such purpose by any association of
dealers registered with the Commission. The Commission has received no views from such association of dealers.
In January 1950, the bank refunded $100,000,000 of its outstanding
10-year 2% percent bonds by selling an issue of serial bonds in the
same amount. The 2% percent bonds, originally issued at par in 1947,
were replaced by a 2 percent issue and the refunding bonds were originally sold at a premium resulting in a net interest cost to the bank of
1.92 percent.
The refunding bonds were sold at competitive bidding. Syndicates
consisting of investment houses, securities dealers, and banks, with a
wide geographical distribution, participated in the bidding. The
winning syndicate consisted of 37 commercial banks and 99 securities
dealers located in 25 States and the District of Columbia. In all,
bidding groups had an aggregate membership of 393-0f which 63
were commercial banks and 330 were securities dealers.
The bank made available to .bidders and to participating dealers
copies of a prospectus relating to the new serial bonds giving information about the bank's structure and operations and including audited
financial statements. The bank thus gave effect to representations
made by it in connection with the adoption of the amendments to the
Bretton Woods Agreements Act which exempted securities issued and
securities guaranteed as to principal and interest by the bank. In
connection with the adoption of this legislation its proponents had
Section 12 (2) provides for civil llabillties for sales of securities (whether or not registered) made through material misrepresentations and omissions. Ilowever, securities exempted by section 3 (a) (2) of the Securities Act do not fall within the proviSions of section
12 (2). Since the amendment to the Bretton Woods Agreements Act requires these
securities to be deemed exempted "within the meaning of" section 3 (a) (2), the e1fect of
that amendment is to eliminate civil liability pursuant to section 1ll (a).
81 The amendment
to the Bretton Woods Agreements Act requires that securities issued
or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the bank shall be deemed to be exempted
within the meaning of section 3 (a) (12) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The elfect of this exemption is to take these securities out of the purview of rules fixing
margin requirements and of rules relating to borrowings on securities by brokers and
dealers. As exempted securities. these securities may be traded on exchanges without the
formalities of reglstratton or literal compliance with information requirements or other
exemptive provisions.
Brokers or dealers doing a business exclusively in the bank's exempted securities and
other exempted securities, would not be required to register with the Commission.
Section 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act makes it unlawful to use deceptive or
manipulative devices, in contravention of ruies and regulations of the Commission, in
connection with the purchase or sale of secnritie&--whetlier or not registered on a securities exchange. Pursuant to this provision the CoIllJu1ssionhas adopted rules which apply
whether or not securities are exempted.
Recent litigation has emphasized the poss1billty that these rules a1ford civil relief as
well as a basis for criminal action.
The exemption of the bank's securities does not dect the operation of this provision.

A fuller discussion of the operations of the bank is contained in the
second special report of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems (May 1950).
Since this issue is the only issue of the bank's bonds effected since
enactment of the amendment the Commission does not, in this report,

ADVISORY

AND INTERPRETATIVE

ASSISTANCE

The Commission has continued to make freely available to the public
the informal advisory and interpretative assistance of its professional
and technical staff, on matters arising under the statutes. Correspondence, conference, and telephone inquiries are handled by staff experts
familiar with the problems involved. It is impossible to estimate the
number of inadvertent violations forestalled as a result, or the amount
of time that goes into work so intimately related to the regulatory
duties of the Commission.

Under five of the acts which it administers-the
Securities Act of
1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and the
Investment Act of 1940-the Commission is authorized to grant confidential treatment, upon application by registrants, to information
contained in reports, applications, or documents which they are required to file under these statutes. Under the Securities Act of 1933
the Commission has adopted rule 580, which provides that information
as to material contracts, or portions thereof, will be held confidential
by the Commission if it determines that disclosure would impair the
value of the contracts and is not necessary for the protection of investors. The other four statutes, in general, empower the Commission
to hold confidential under certain conditions any information contained in any reports required to be filed under those statutes. Disclosure of information confidentially filed under the latter statutes is
made only when the Commission determines that disclosure is in. the
public interest.

STATISTICS AND SPECIAL STUDIES

In general, the statistical activities of the Commission relate to
(a) data of general application on groups of companies subject and
not subject to the legislation administered by the Commission and
(b) operational data derived from officialfilings with the Commission.
The purpose of the latter studies is to organize and present in meaningful form the masses of information filed with the Commission.
Saving Study

The Commission continued its series of quarterly releases on the
volume and composition of individuals' saving in the United States.
These releases show the aggregate volume of individuals' saving as
well as the components contributing to the total, such as changes in
securities, cash, insurance and consumers' indebtedness, etc. These
data have been extremely useful in the determination of fiscal policy
and as a measurement of the inflationary potential.
Financial Position of Corporations

The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce, continued the joint series of quarterly releases on the plant and equipment expenditures of United States business other than agricultural.
Shortly after the close of each quarter these releases present industry
totals on the actual capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated expenditures for the next two quarters. In addition a survey
is made at the beginning of each year of the plans of business as
regards expansion during that year. These data have provided a
useful index of present and future activity in the capital markets and
of business in general. In view of the volatile nature of capital
expenditures and their relation to the level of production and employment, the series has been of considerable importance for business
management and in the formation of government policy.
The series of quarterly releases on the working capital position of
all United States corporations exclusive of banks and insurance companies was also continued. These releases show the principal components of current assets and current liabilities and an abbreviated
analysis of the sources and uses of corporate funds. These data are
important in measuring the liquid position of the corporate segment
of the economy taken as a whole.
The Commission, together with the Federal Trade Commission,
continued the joint series of quarterly industrial financial reports.
These reports developed as an extension of the working capital series
and present a complete balance sheet and an abbreviated income
account for manufacturing corporations as a whole. In addition the
data are shown for various size groups of corporations and for minor
mdustry groups. The financial report program includes data on
manufacturers' profits, which are extremely important in the formulation of a tax program and renegotiation policy. The data are basic
to any appraisal of corporate financial position and any analysis of
corporation finance and the capital markets.

Capital Markets

The Commission has also continued its monthly series on new
securities offerings published in the Statistical Bulletin, and a quarterly series published together with a brief analysis in release form.
These data show the volume and character of all securities offerings
in the United States, both registered and unregistered, public offerings, and private placements. Collateral studies based on these data
have been undertaken from time to time pursuant to the Commission's
needs and requests from other branches of the government, and the
public. These included a study of the cost of flotation of privately
placed securities and a survey of issues offered under regulation A.
Operational statistics (in reality organized and segregated data on
a basis necessary for an understanding of the over-all facts revealed
by filings with us) are regularly collected with respect to the following matters and, except for those marked with an asterisk are
regularly published:
Registration statistics.
Underwriting statistics.

During the fiscal year 1950, a limited appropriation required a
reduction-in-force of 60 employees. Further staff reductions resulted
by allowing positions left vacant through resignations to remain unfilled. The 998 employees on duty as of June 30, 1950, represents a
reduction of 129 from the total of 1,127 as of June 30,1949. During
the last 5 years the Commission's average employment has dropped
from 1,204 during the 1946 fiscal year to 1,043 for the fiscal year just
ended.
The division of personnel is responsible for the administration of
the Commission's personnel program. Its regular work embracer
placement and separation; job evaluation and classification; employee
relations and services; training; operation of various committees and
boards such as the Committee of Expert Exammers (which conducts

168

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

functions were carried out with a staff of 8 employees-a ratio of 1
personnel employee per 130 Commission employees.
In addition, the division of personnel is responsible for the conduct
of preappointment character investigations, leave administration and
accounting, retirement counseling, and the maintenance of an emergency medical unit staffed by a registered nurse. Four additional employees are assigned to the division of personnel to carry out these
functions.
While the volume of appointments and other personnel transactions
was considerably below normal during the fiscal year, the reductionin-force and related developments created many personnel problems.
For example, every effort was made to assist employees released in the
reduction-in-force in locating suitable employment. One of the major
personnel problems was that of allocating and reassigning available
personnel to achieve maximum operating efficiency throughout the
Commission. In the sustained effort to preserve vital services, employees were interchanged, reassigned and shifted from unit to unit
as the pressure of work dictated. Supervisory officials cooperated in
this effort by releasing sorely needed employees to units where the
work program was at the moment the most critical.
Just prior to the beginning of the fiscal year the Bureau of the
Budget's personnel records system was installed. The system was
tested during the entire fiscal year and has contributed substantially
to the efficient operation of the personnel program. Under the system
paper work and record keeping are reduced to a bare minimum, conserving time and money for the more productive phases of personnel
administration.

PUBUCATIONS
Public Releases

Releases of the Commission consist primarily of official announcements of filings under and actions taken pursuant to the several acts
which it administers. These include notices of filings, hearings,
orders, decisions, regulations, and related matters issued by the Commission. The Commission has endeavored to improve its service and
to effect economies in connection with its mailing lists by (1) a reclassification of releases enabling persons to select releases on a particular subject without receiving nonrelated matter and (2) by issuing
digests which set forth briefly the subject matter of the more voluminous releases. This procedure avoids the full-scale distribution of all
releases except to those persons who are sufficiently interested to make
a special request therefor.
The announcements issued during the 1950 fiscal year included 33
releases under the Securities Act of 1933; 193 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934; 754 under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935; 170 under the Investment Company Act of 1940; and 4
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In addition, nine releases
were issued concerning the Commission's activities in corporate reorganization under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, and four releases
were issued under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. The following
breakdown of the releases for the month of June 1950 is fairly illustrative of the general nature of releases issued throughout the year:
Announcements
of filings, orders for hearing, and notices giving opportunity
to request hearing______________________
Interim and final decisions and orders______________________

55

The balance of the Commission's releases were of an informational
nature, the following having been issued during the year: seventy-five
announcements of publication of reports on corporate survey and
statistical studies; 76 reports of court actions ill injunction and
criminal prosecution cases initiated by the Commission; and 5 miscellaneous announcements regarding appointments of Commissioners,
staff officials, and related matters.

I The purpose
of column I Is to show the number and amount of securities admitted to dealing under the
various bases for the admission of securities to dealing on exchanges under the act.
(Issues exempted from
registration under sec. 3 (a) (12) of the act, such as obligations of the United States, States, counties, cities,
and United States-owned
corporatrons, are not shown In this table.)
Each security Is counted once under
each basis for its admission to dealing.
Thus, a security which is registered on 2 exchanges and also admitted
to unlisted trading privileges on 3 exchanges would be counted once under "registered"
and once under
"admitted
to unlisted trading privileges."
Because of such duplications,
column I is not totaled •
• The purpose of column II is to show the unduplleated
total of all securities admitted
to dealing on all
exchanges.
Each security is counted only once, and the elimination of the duplication In column I is made
in column II in the order In which the various bases for admission to dealing is given above.
, Includes securities for which the Oommlssion has granted, by general rules, temporary exemption from
registration for stated periods and under certain conditions, such as stock Issues of certain operating banks
and securities resulting from modification of previously listed securities •
• Includes 8 bond issues In pounds sterling In the aggregate amount of £16,808,740.
This amount in
sterling has been excluded from the amount m dollars given above.
