Sir I
I have the honor to transmit to you the Tenth Annual Report of the
Securities and Exchange Commission~in accordance with the provisions of
Section 23 (b) of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934~ approved June 6~
1934~ Section 23 of the Public utility
Holding CompanyAct of 1935, approved
August 26~ 1935, Section 46 (a) of the Investment CompanyAct of 1940,
approved August 22~ 1940 and Section 216 of the Investment Advisers Act of
1940~ approved August 22~ 1940.
In addition to reviewing the principal developments of the past fiscal
year~ the report includes a ten-year survey of the Commission's work. This
sw'vey sets forth the results of the Commission's operations under the various statutes committed to its charge. At the end of a decade it seemedmost
desirable that the Commissionshould render to the Congress such an account
of its activities.
Because of space limitations no attempt has been made to
detail the entire development of practices and policies as refiected in our
orders ~ rules and regulations as they have becomeestablished and exist today.
Since this course has been followed in the hi-storical exposition contained in
the report~ I think it only proper to point out that the survey is one of
results and not one of step-by-step development. In reading these pages one
which
should bear in mind that they do not describe all of the difficulties
have been encountered or all of the problems which remain unsolved. While
I do not wish to minim;ze the iJIIportance of the results obtained during the
ten years of operation under these statutes,
I should not like to give the
impression that no mistakes have been made. Where they have been made, we
have endeavored not to repeat them.

Let me assure you that the Commissionwill continue to review the
steps already taken and~.in dealing with new problems as they arise, will
exert f1Veryeffort to reach sound conclusions and results and perfect its
administration of the tasks Congress has assigned to it.
Respectfully,

Ganson PurceLl.,
Chainaan.
THE p~mENT
OF THE SENATE~
THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES~

Sufficient progress has been made to indicate both the practicability
and the beneficial effects
of ccupl1ance with the s1mp1.i:ticationrequirements of the Act. or course the CCIIIIlission
will
not order dissolution or any holding ccupany 1Ih1chholds together what can realisticaJ.ly be regarded as a system the continued existence or which is justified by" genuine economicor physical
eonsiderations •

Under this program cCllllplex
capital structures are being replaced by simple capital stru~
tures.
Holding c~
debts are being paid off, rislq' holding ccupanypreferred stocks, nth
their huge accumulations or di videIld arrearages, are being converted to CCIIIIDon
stock so as to
permit once again a now or income to the security holders. But what is more importanli, the
holding canpanies are going thrOUf:1la shrinking process. '!hey are being reduced in size because they must slouf:1lorf their seattered holdings, a:ld their security holders are receiv1ng,
either in exchange or as liquidating dividends, the CCllllD011 stocks or:sound operating ccupanies.
This is a factor or great significance both to the operating ccupanies themselves and to the
investors whothought they had an equity interest in the utility industry but found that all
they had 'WaS a speculative interest in a holding company. Under these conditions in the years
to come, the operating utility industry will have a greater ability to raise equity capital on
a sound basis to finance its eveI'-grOlrlngneeds; and the investors whofurnish that capital
will receive their dividends direct, without being subjected to the eJq>enseand the risk of supporting an outmodedholding cOOlp8DY'
organization. Also worthy of mention is the fact that
managementand supervision fees paid by the operating utility subsidiaries have been reduced many'
millions or dollars annually.
In addition to the program or reorganizing the holding CCllllpanies,
the COIIIIIission,acting
under the Holding Compan;y
Act, has passed upon the issuance of more than $6 billion of securiUnder the applicable standards of
ties of registered holding c<Dpani.esand their subsidiaries.
the Act, this afforded the opportunity to blprove the financial structures and policies of the
operating utility companies. Inflation is being taken out or their balance sheets. Their debt
is being reduced by" every legitimaw means to establish c~ative
debt ratios.
Depreciation
accruals have been increased and their depreciation reserves are being built up to good health.
Amongthe more blportant benefits haw been the ~s
taken by the Camn1ssionto eliminate
banker domination of utility caopanies. One important measure to accanplish that result was the
adoption by the COOIIIIission
in April 1941 of a ru1e requiring canpetitive bidd1ng in the sale of
public utility securities.
These benefits are helping to build a better future for the operating utility companies, their investors and their consumers.
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy .Act
Under a provision in the Securities ExchangeAct, the Camnissionwas directed to makea
study of reorganization camnittees and to report its recOllll1endations
to Congress. The CCIIIIIission's report on this matter, in eif:1lt volumes" deserdbed serious abuses in the functioning of
these camn1ttees as well as other defects in existing reorganization procedures. These disclosures gave impetus to a reform of the National Bankruptcy Act in 1938. Under that legislation" the Camnissionhas the duty to serve as adviser to United States District Courts in connection with proceedings for the reorganization of debtor corporations in JIhich there is a substantial public interest.
It participates as a party to these proceedings, either at the request
or with the approval of the courts. It renders :independent expert advice and assistance to the
courts with respect to plans of reorganization.
Of primary ~rtanC8
is the COJIIIl1ssion's
assistance in the financial rehabilitation of debtor canpanies and in the formulation of reorganization plans which will provide fair and equitable treatment to the various creditors and other
security holders and which will assUre that the corporations 1rill. emergefrCD bankruptcy in a
Sound financial ccmd1.t1on. Fran. September 1938 to June 1.944, the CCIIIII1ssion
participated in 243
reorgapization proceedings under Chapter x.
Another consequeDCeof the CClmnission'
s investigation of reorganization procedures was the
enactment of the Trust IDdenture Act or 1939. Prior to 1939 most or the average indenture was
devoted to excUlpating ,the trustee.
Th18 Act a:1ms to bring all indenture trustees up to a high
level or diligence and layaltyaDd to place theIIlin a better position to protect security
holders. The II88nS adopted is a requirement that bcmds, notes, debentures and s1milar debt securities exceeding $1,000,000 in principal amountmq not be offered for sale to the public
unless they are issued. UDder a trust indenture which conforms to spec1.tic statutory standards

CC!IP8D.T Act of 1940

In the years 1936 to 1940, the CoDm1ssianmade an extensive study of investment trusts and
e1mUar cQllpan1es as IJ1rected in Section 30 ot the Public utility Holding CClllpau,y
Act. The in"feBtigation c<mf1rmedwidespread S11sp1cionsconcerning existing abuses and revealed case attar
case in which investors I .taDds had been used to serve the selfish interests of investment CaapalQ"
prcmoters. The CClIIIIII1ssion
t s studies
1Dd1c ated that the honest and respectable elements in the
1nve8tment trust bua1neS8 reeogni.zed that these abuses had also cast c.ti.scred1t upon their opera-tiCl18 and they joined in urging the passage of remedial legislation.
Accordingq, the terms and
provisions of the Investment C<:IIIp8IV
Act were worked Ol1tin conference by representatives of the
COIIIIIissionand or the investment trust industry and. the Congress. '!be Act passed both houses or
Ccngress without a dissenting vote.
As more fuJ..4 set forth in Part VI er this Report, the Act provides that investment canpanies IIIDSt register with the COIIIII1ssion;
their affairs JDIlSt be conducted in accordance with the
applicable provisions or the Act; and. various transactions,
including transactions between
affil1ates~ are prohibited ar made subject to apprOV'alby the CCllllllission. The CCllllllissionalso
is authorized to apply to the Federal courts far orders removing or suspending from office
d1.rectars~ officers~ and other fiduciaries of registered investment canpanies 'Whohave been
gu:Uty of gross misconduct ar gross abuse of trust.
The CClIIIIII1ssion
has exercised the authority
in a IIWDber of instances.
At June 30, 1944 there were registered with the Commission371 innatment companies having eatimated assets aggregating appraximateq $3 billion.

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 was enacted at the same time as the Investment Company
Act. This statute prOVides far the regLstration of all persons engaged in the business of giving
investment advice, requires investment advisers to make full disclosure of their interest in
transactions executed for their clients~ and makes unlawful practices lIhich consitute fraud ar
deceit.
At June 30~ 1944 there 11'81"8 registered with the CCIIIIII18sion
719 investment advisers.
The Ccmnissiont s eJq>erience in the administration of the Investment Advisers Act over the
past four years impels the conclusion that it cannot be enforced effectively' in its present form.
The cases of Robert J. Boltz and Albert K. Atk1nBon~outlined in Part VII of this report, illustrate the type of fraudulent activities
in wbich certain unserupuJ.ous investment advisers are
able to engage at present without affording this Commissioothe slightest overt evidence of their
occurrence. The Ccmnission is unable to detect or prevent such activities
principally' because
it lacks the power to iDBpect the books and records ot inmstment advisers-a
power which it has
in the case of bmJlcers and dealers UDd8r the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. To remedy this
s1gnal weakness as well as other related weaknesses in the Investment Advisers Act~
 the Commission
8Ubm1tteda report to the Congress on January 31~ 1945 recommendingcertain amendmentsto the Act.
Since the substantive provisians ot the several statutes are interrelated
in many ways, it
has been feasible to effect a high degree of standardization and uniformity of forms, procedures,
and interpretations.
Far example, as more tully c.ti.scussedin the Camu:i.ssion'sNinth AmJuaJ. Reopcnot~ -the CCIIIIIIi8sion
has effected a canprehensive simplification
of a number of registration
and
reporting requirements to eliminate duplicate filings by canpanies subject to more than one Act.
lJi:l1.torm
regulations have been prescribed as to the form and content of financial statements
tued UDderthe Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act and the Investment Compau,y
Act.
S1DIilarly uniform practices, interpretations
and forms apply' to proxy solicitations
under the
Securities Exchange Act, the Holding Canpany Act, and the Investment CompanyAct; this is al80
true as to ~t
indentures under the Trust Indenture .Act and the Holc.ti.ngCtlllpaDyAct. Further
adm1nistrative advantages stem from the uniformity of procedures, law and interpret&ation under
the reorganization provisions of Chapter X, Section 11 ot the Holding CompanyAct and SectiCll 25
or the Investment Compan;y Act.
In the adoption ot rules, regulations, forms, and accounting principles and policies, it is
the practice of the Cc:mDiasionto submit them priar to adoption to all interested persons and
imi.te their criticiams ad suggestions.
This procedure 1s followed provided the subject matter

Often such matters are discussed with those affected ar interested 1n informal.

disposition of issues raised.

Most of the cases which the Commission
decides involve applications by private parties
seekiDgpe1'IIIissionto undertake or contirme specified activity, or seeking exemptionfrom requirements imposedby the Acts or rules and regulations thereunder. The Commissionalso decides issues in various proceedings initiated by it pursuant to statutory direction, and it reviews certain actions of a registered association of securities dealers.
In all cases to be decided by it, the COIIDissionissues to the parties a notice and order
for hearing swmnarizingthe pertinent facts which are then before it and delineating the issues
that appear to be involved. Unless confidential treatment is required, the notice and order
for hearing is madepublic and provides that any interested person mayseek leave to be heard
or intenene.
Hearings are held bef'ore trial exami nars designated by the Commission. The trial examiner.
have no other function than to preside at hearings and in certain Cases to file an advisory report. Theyare instructed to and do observe strict impartiality.
In all cases the parties and
the interested division of the Commission'sstaff;where it takes a position, are afforded opportunity fo file exceptions to a trial examiner's report, to file briefs and requests for
specific findings and to present oral argumentto the Commission.
Wherethe interested division of the COlIIIII:ission

the Commission
will normallyavail itself of the assistance of the division in the preparation of findings and opinion. However,where the division has taken an adversary position,
and in other cases in which the Commission
considers it desirable, the Commissionemploysthe
assistance of its OpinionWriting Office, which reports directly to the Commissionand functions independently of the division wb1chbas participated in the proceedings. After thorough
analysis of the evidence and the contentions of the parties, the Commissiondirects the preparation of findings and opinions in which the Commissionstates its decision and its reasons f'or
it. All final orders of the Commission
are subject to judicial review.

The COIIIIIIission's
files have becomea tremendousreposi'tory of information with respect to
the corporate enterprises of the nation. This information is digested by representatives of
financial and statistical
services, banks and insurance cOJllpaDies,
1IIves'bnenthouses, industrial
corporations, membersof stockholders cOlllll1tteesand by individual investors, and is passed on
to the public in IBmerousways. The COIIIII1esion
itself issues to all whoare interested statistical releases and reports of surveys. At the request of a numberof goVernment
war agencies,
the Com1seion recently pnblished a tour-volume rJlport on the profits and operations of American
corporations, and other work is being done on similar projects.
The Commission
also issues
quarterly releases on savings by individuals and on the working capital position of corporations
in the United states.
The accumulationof financial information and the services of technical
experts on the CC8l18sion's staff are available to and have been frequently employedby the
Co~ress. In addition, the Congress has availed itself of the personnel of the Commissionin
connection with numerousinvestigations, the most important of whichwas the 1IIvestigation conon which the COIIIIIIission
was represented.
ducted by the Temporary National EconomicCClIIIIII:ittee
--':::::Dur1ng the tiret decade of its activities,
the Commissionissued more than 2,000 formal
orders under the several Acts, and while all the Acts provide for judicial review of COIIIIIIi.ssion
orders, cmly'1OOpetitions for review have been filed.
Of these 84 resulted in either denial
of the objections raised on the merits or dismissal ot the petition by stipulation or on motion
of the petitioners.
'fOedecisions in three concluded cases set aside the COJIIIIIisslon's
orders
in whole or in part and thirteen cases were pending at the end of the past fiscal year. In
addition to the proceedings for judicial review of eOlllP1ssionorders, the record of civil actions in Federal district courts instituted by or against the Cc..1ssion (including Cases in

(xv)

which the Cozmnissionappeared as intervener or participated as amicus curiae} comprised more
than 500 cases, of which only 10, or less than two percent, resulted in decisions adverse to
the Commission.
An outstanding result of the enactment and administration of these statutes has been the
establishment of a higher standard of ethics in the handling of other peOple-ISmoney. New
standards prevail in the business of inducing investors to part with their moneyand in the business of managingthat moneyonce it has been t'ntrusted to a particular enterprise.
There now
prevail new concepts of fair dealing, of adequate disclosure and of the duties of managementand
insiders.
The general acceptance of these ethical standards by" the business communityis reDected not alone in the policies and outlook of those SUbject to the Commission's'jurisdiction,
but it is also evidenced in ma.ny respects in the practices of businesses not within the jurisdiction of the Commission

Proposals for Amendments
to the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934
In 1940 bills were introduced in both Houses of Congress to amendthe Securities Act of
1933.
The House Committeeon Interstate and Foreign Commerce
requested the Commissionto
commenton these bills.
As a result of this request, and nth the approval of the chairman of
that Committeeand the chairman of the Senate Committeeon Banking and Currency, the Cozmnission
undertook to study thoroughly with representatives of the securities industry and others the
advisability of amendingboth the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities ExchangeAct of
1934.

Y

In the course of this study the Commissionconferred at length with 11epresentatives of the
Investment Bankers Association of .America,Inc., the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc., the NewYork Curb Exchangeand the NewYork Stock Exchange. The views of all the regional
stock exchanges were also invited, and proposed amendmentswere discussed in detail with representatives of thirteen of those exchanges. In addition, the Commissionsought and received the
views of executives of corporations which had had experience in registering securities with the
Commission,executives of many life insurance companies, and numerousindividuals from all parts
of the country.
The results of this comprehensivestudy were submitted to the cCllllllitteesof the two Houses
All of the proposals madeeither by
in a report filed by the Commissionon August 7, 1941.
the representatives of the securities industry or by the Commissionwere then canbined in a comprehensive committee print for purposes of convenience.

Y
'J/

As to ma.ny of the proposals the Commissionand the representatives of the iildustry were in
agreement. In the area o£ disagreement, however, were someproposals which the Commission0pposed as serious threats to the protection of the investing public and as a retrogression
toward evils which had impelled the enactment of the two statutes in 1933 and 1934.
The nature of the proposals as to which there was disagreement was varied. For example,
peraaps the two most important suggestions under the Securities ExchangeAct involved the regulation of proxy solicitations under Section 14 and the provisions of Section 16 governing trading by corporate insiders.
On one hand, the two NewYork exchanges proposed.extending the
coverage OIO those two sections general13 to the securities of large national corporations not

of the securities industry (including those exchanges) urged the repeal of Section 16 (b), which provides for the recapture of
profits made by insiders .from trading in the securities of their companies.
The HOIl8eCcmnittee on Interstate and Foreign Commercebegan hearings to consider the proposed amendmentson October 28, 1941. The hearings were conducted cont1.nuous~ until interrupted
by the outbreak of war on December7, 1941. Reconvening in January, the hearings were terminated
during that month.
The proposals were then referred to a subcommittee of the House Committee
and no further action was taken up to the close of the session.

PART I
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
The Securities Act of 1933 provides for f'ul1 disclosure of pertinent information regarding
securities public~ offered for sale in interstate commerceor through the mails, but does not
confer upon the Commissionthe power to approve or pass upon the merits of any security.
The
Act is also designed to prevent misrepresentation, deceit and other fraudulent practices in the
sale of securities.
Issuers of securities to be public~ offered and sold in interstate
connnerceare required to file registration statements with the Commission. These registration
statements must contain specified information on the proposed offering and are available for
public inspection. An integral part of the requirements of each statement is a prospectus
setting forth in condensed or summarizedform the more essential information contained in the
registration statement. The Act provides that the prospectus must be made available to investors to whomthe secur1t1.-esare sold.
ENACTMENT
ANDSCOPE
OFTHESECURITIES
ACTOF1933
The reasons for the enactment of the Securities Act ot: 1933 are stated in the Presidentls
message to Congress on March29, 1933, as follows:

"r recommendto the Congress legislation for Federal supervision of traffic
in investment securities in interstate commerce.
"In spite of ~

state statutes the public in the past has sustained severe
losses through practices neither ethical nor honest on the part of manypersons
and corporations selling securities.

"Of course, the Federal Governmentcannot and should not take any action which
might be construed as approving or guaranteeing that newly issued securities are
sound in the sense that their value will be maintained or that the propertie s l'Ihich
they represent will earn profit.
"There is, however, an obligation upon us to insist that every issue of IlBW
securities to be sold iil interstate .commerceshall be accompaniedby f'I1ll publicity
and information, and that no essenti.alJ.y-iJDportant element atteI¥iing the issue shall,
be concealed from the buying public.
.
"This proposal adds to the ancient rule of caveat emptor, the further doctrine
Ilet the seller also beware. t It puts the burden of telling the whole truth on the
seller.
It shou1d give impetus to honest dealing in securities and thereby bring\
back public confidence.
"The purpose of the legislation I suggest is to protect the public with the
least possible interference to honest business.
"This is but one step in our broad purpose of protecting investors and
depositors. It should be followed by legislation relating to the better supervision
of the purchase and sale of all property dealt in on exchanges, and by legislation
to correct unethical and unsafe practices on the part. of officers arid directors of
banks and other corporations.
"Whatwe seek is a return to a clearer understanding of the ancient truth that
those whomanagebanks, corporations, and other agencies handling or using other
people's money are trustees acting for others.'
Following the first WorldWar, the Americanpeople purchased corporate securities in \1J1precedented amounts. During the period from 1920 to 1933 approximately $50,000:000;,000of new
issues were sold to Americaninvestors.
In a majority of eases the public purchasers were not
turnished adequate information upon which to base an informed judgment to buy or not to buy.
By'1933, some$25,000,000,000 or 50 percent of those seourities had becomeworthless.
state blue sk;y l.a1rs, which were on the statute boolas of practically all the states, had. not
f'ully met the situation, since it was difficult for a state to protect its citizens from the

-2depredations of UDScrupulouspromoters operating across state lines in interstate commerce.
Even if the l1mi tat ions of the state's own statutes and of the commerceclause of the Federal
constitution presented no obstacle to the prosecution of such a promoter, he ...as physically
Accordingly, responsible
outside the state's jurisdiction and extradition was seldom feasible.
federal protection of investors in corporate securities, supplementing that afforded by the
state blue sky' authorities, was an essential need.
As Louis D. Brandeis had emphasizedso vigorously twenty years earlier, those who managed
corporations were managing other people's moneyand those whoere seeking De'II' capital were
seeking other people's money. There arose an insistent demandthat, in order to reduce hazards
to investors, the fiduciarY. character of the financial process be accorded legal recognition.
So, whenPresident Roosevelt asked Congress, as part of the administration's program of reform,
to enact the Securities Act and the Securities ExchangeAct, he initiated a series of conservative steps to cope with an unhealthy situation that had long festered and could no longer be
ignored.

The Securities Act,often referred to as the Iltruth in securitiesll act, was designed not
only to provide investors with adequate information upon which to base their decisions to buy
and sell securities, but also to protect legitimate business seeking to obtain capital through
honest presentation against competiti.on .!rom crooked promoters and to prevent fraud in the sale
of securities.
At the sametime its purpose was to encourage the productive employuentof
capital which had been frightened. into hoarding, and to aid in providing employmentthrough the
restoration of buying power. The Act was administered by the Federal Trade COJJDD1ssion
from
May27, 19~3, the date of enactment, until september 1, 1934, whenresponsibility for its enforcement was transferred to the Securities and ExchangeCommission.

REGISTRATION
The principal objective of the Securities Act is to protect investors by requiring a f\l1l
and accurate disclosure of the material facts regarding securities offered for sale in interstate COJllllerce or by the use of the mails. In order to accomplish this, the Act provides that,
before non-exemptsecurities maybe offered or sold to the public through the mails or in
interstate commerce,a registration statement must be filed with the Commissionand must become
effective.
In general, governmentand munici.pal securities and the issues of banks, railroads,
and cooperatives are exempt fran the provisions of the Act.
In order to register securities the issuer must file a registration statement on the particular farm prescribed by the CCIIIlIl1ssion
as appropriate to the tJpe of security proposed to be
offered. Whena registration statement is filed it becomesa public documentdesigned to set
forth all the material facts known to the issuer and the underwriters nth regard to the company
and the securities to be so~d. These include, amongother things, statements with regard to the
character, size and profitableness of the business, its capitalization, the purpose of the
issue, options outstanding against securities of the issuer, remuneration of officers and directors, bonus and profit-sharing arrangements, underwriters1 commissions, and pending or
threatened. legal proceedings. Certified financial statements must be included. In order that
investors ma.y have in convenient form the basic material contained in the registration statement, the Act also requires that they be .furnished a prospectus containing at least the more
1JIIportantinformation in the registration statement. In addition to providing the public information on which to reach an informed judgmentwith regard to whether or not to purchase securities, the registration statement and prospectus serve as a record of the representations made at
the time the securities 1Iere sold, and thereby sjmpli1'y'the prob~emof proof in any legal pr0ceedings which ma.y arise with regard to whether the registration statement or the prospectus
contains untrue or misleading statements or aDits material information.

Experts were drafted from specialized. classes of issuers to assist in the preparation of
forms and rules suitable to the specialized needs of their particular fields. It has been the
Cammission'sestablished practice from the outset to submit every proposed registration form to
those persons to whomit would apply and to seek their commentsand criticisms.
Through this
system improvementhas been made from time to time in the process for registering securities.
It has been the constant aim of the Commissionto devise additional ways of siJDplifying the
mechanics of registration that could be madeeffective without foregoing the protection of the
public and investors.
It should be beme in mind, honver, whenit is asserted. that scmeof the
di8cl.osures required appear to be needless:Q' searching, that the evaluation of a corporate security by the p1Jbl1c is difficult under the DI08tfavorable circ1Dll8tancesand it is rendered

-3unneoess~
hazardous if it must be done without all the relevant facts.
It is not a simple
thing to draft, a registration
form to meet the needs of vast corporations which are not siJllple"
whi.oh have ~icate
capital strucutures" scores of subsic:l:iarycompanies and far-flung and
varied business activit:1.es. Late in 1942 the Commi.ssion
eff-ected a comprehensivesiJapl1f:ication
of a mrmbe1"
of registration and reporting requirements under several of the statutes" including
a DeW general form for registration of commercial.and industrial corporate securities.
This
form" B-1" permits the fi.ling of the prospectus as a principal part of the registration statement" thus el1miDating muchduplication between the prospectus and the registration statement
proper.
The examination of a registration statement by the Commiasionlsstaff does not involve and
is not concerned with an appraisal of the merits of the security as an investment since the
Commissionis not authorized to and does not pass judgmentupon the soundness of any security.
apparently unsound issues can be registered and sold provided the

does not direct the flow of capital or try

gauge the risk.

However"it is authorized by Section 8 of the Act to issue an order preventing or

does not .resort to it except in
those cases where there has been a definite or intentional effort to conceal or mislead.

statement.

In the interest of good admjnj stration" fair treatment of registrants,
and mjnjnmminterference nth busineSS" a procedure not specifically spelled out in the Act was adopted early in
its administration.
Registrants are informally advised of any material misrepresentations or
omissions as promptly as possible after the statements are filed, thus affording an opportunity
for the fi.ling of correcting amendmentsbefore the statements becomeeffective.
Throughthis
-letter of deficiencies. the Commissionis able to advise the registrant of the information that
must be corrected or supplementedin order to meet the disclosure standards prescribed by
Congress. Another informal procedure that has proved useful is the pre-filing conference in
which representatives of registrants and underwriters discuss problems in connection with the
J'rOpo8ed filing with the Commission
IS staff for the purpose of determining in advance what types
or methods of disclosure -1I'OU1d be necessary under the circumstances of the individual case.
This informal methodof handljng cases has injected an element of .f'l.exibility into the registration procedure which has proved 80 satisfactory that it has not been necessary to issue a stop
order since 1941.

The time required to exmn1neand clear a registration statement depends largely on whether
a siJaple or complexsituation is involved. The original Section 8 (a) of the Act required a
twent~
'Waiting period after fil.1ng before the registration statement could becomeeffective.
lloreover" any amendmentfiled prior to the effective date starts the twenty-day period running
&neW' unless the Commissionaccelerates the amendment
by dating its filing back to the original
f1l:ing date of the registration statement. The principal objectives of the waiting period are
to give the public an opportunity to absorb the information in the prospectus or registration
statement and to get array from the hasty methods of distribution previously in vogue which
pract1caJ.J3 CCllllp8lled minor distributors and dealers to makecommitmentsblindly.

DeSS

The CCDIIiss1.on
has endeavored to adapt its procedures to the accustomedpractices of busimenand dietrilmtors of securities in so far as this is consistent with the intent of

Congress and the protection of investors. Whenthe COIIIIJIi.ssion
found~ therefore, after a study
of the D88ds of the business~ that a twenty-day waiting period after the filing of amendment.s
would" in many cases, involve an unnecessary hardsh1p~ it adopted the policy, when amendments

On August 22, 1940~section 8 (a) 1I'8.S amended,nth the support of the Commission,to give
the Commissiondiscretionary authority to accelerate the effective date under certain circumstances lI'1thout regard to the origiDal t1rent~

statement or such earlier day as the Ccsrmission m y detenains but the Comiasion is required t o
give due regard t o such matters as the adequacy of the information respecting the issuer nfiich
has previously been made public and the ease d t h which the rights of the holders of the secur i t i e s t o be issued can be understood. The C d s s i o n cooperates with registrants i n expediting
registration as much as possible consistent with the public interest and the protection of
hvestors. Registrants who are able r e a d i l y t o meet the standards of the Act and the rules of
the Commission obtain effective registration of their securities in substantially l e s s than
twenty days a f t e r filing.
Since Section 5 of the Act prohibits offers or sales t o be made prior to the effectiveness
of the registration statement, issuers and underwriters ware, a t f i r s t , reluctant t o send out
any information t o potential investors during the waiting period for fear such circulation muld
be construed as an offer t o s e l l securities. Early in i t s historg, therefore, the C d s s i o n ,
in order t o make infomahion available t o potential investors, published s m a l opinions of its
general counsel to the effect that distribution of information contained in the registration
statement prior t o the effective date of the registration statement would not constitute an
i l l e g a l offer provided it were very clearly explained that the circulation was not intended a s
an offbr of the security. This has resulted i n the more or l e s s ccnmon practice of underm'iters
and dealers circulating, prior t o the effective date of the'registration statement, the socalled "red herring" prospectus which derives i t s name from the practice of printing i n red
l e t t e r s either diagonally across o r along the mar& of each page a clear stateoosnt that the
document is not intended as an offer of the sscurity and directing attention t o the prohibitions
i n the Act against offers prior t o effective registration.

At the sametime, 213 supplementary'statements of actual offering price were filed as required by Rule 970; and there were 11 instances where registrants voluntarily filed supplemental financial data.
EXEMPTIONS

Securities of the following issuera are exempted from registration under the prov;1.aionsof
the Securities Actl The United states, 8'lJY state, territory, municipality or polit1cal subdivision thereof, a national bank or banking institution organized under the laws of 8'lJY state
or ten'itory or the District of Columbiaand supervised by a state or territorial
banking commission or similar official; railroads the issuance of whose securities is subject to approval
by' the Interstate Commerce
Commission;persons organized and operated exclusively for re
religious, educational, beQ8Volent, fraternal, charitable or reformatory purposes and not for
pecuniary profit; building and loan associations and farmers' cooperative associations as
defined in specified sections of the RevenueAct. Securities issued in the following transactions are also exemptedfrom registration; securities which are part of an issue exchangedby
an issuer with its existing security holders exclusively where no commissionor other remuneration is paid or given for the solicitation of the exchange; securities issued in exchangefor
one or more outstanding securities, claims or property interests, or partly in such ~e
and partly for cash, where the terms and conditions of the issuance thereof have been approved
by a court or regulatory body of the United states or arty' stat.e lIhich is authorized to approve
the issuance after a hearing upon the fairness of the tenns and conditions of the offer at
'$ich all parties have a right to appear; and securities which are part of an issue sold ~
to persons resident within a single state or territory where the issuer of such securities is
incorporated in and doing business within such state.
In addition, the Act provides exemptions fran its registration and prospectus requ1.remeuts
for transactions by 8'lJY person othe:r than an issuer, undenIriter or dealer} transactions by an
issuer not involving ~ public offering; and dealers' transactions made more than a year after
a registered offering except in situations where the dealer is performing the functions of an
underwriter of the securities.

'!/ These

amendmentsinclude 4S6 classed as lIpre-effect1veft and 248 88 lIpost-effect1vell I and do
not take into account 361 others of a purely formal nature classed 88 IIdel.ayizlgn ameDdments.

y

?6 of the above ammal reports and the 250 quarte:r~ reports were f1led pursuant to
section 30 of the Investment CompaD.y' Act of 1940 also.

-6Moreover,section 3 (b) of the Act gives the Commissionauthority to exemptfrom the
registration requirements any class of securities issued in an amountnot exceeding $100,000,
subject to such conditions as the Commissionmayprescribe. In accordance with this section,
the Commissionhas issued rules and regulations which enable an issuer to sell securities
without registration in an amountnot exceeding $100,000. These rules merely require the
filing of a br-ief letter of notification with the Commissionat least 24 hours prior to the
offering, together with copies of any prospectus proposed to be issued in connection with the
offering.
Private Placements
For the ten-year period ended June 30, 1944, $22,272,641,000 of new corporate securities
were offered for cash in the United states.
Of that amount, approximately $14,757,530,000 or
66.3 percent were registered, and nearly $7,515,000,000 were exemptfrom registration under the
Securities Act. Slightly over half of the exempt securities were privately placed, and most of
the balance were issued under the authority of the Interstate COJIDIlerce
Commission.
The substantial amountof corporate bond issues sold privately to institutional buyers in
recent years is attributed by somecritics of the Securities Act to a desire on the part of
issuers to avoid the registration requirements of the Act. In the Commission'sopinion,
however, the real causes for the growth of private placements will be found in the unfolding of
certain broad economicforces totally unrelated to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. They include the combination of a great expansion in the assets of legal reserve
life insurance companieswith a material decline in the volume of corporate bonds available for
investment. It was primarily the resultant pressure of institutional f'unds for investment
which led to the large increase in private placements. Moreover, as a result of the decline in
interest rates in recent years, coupled nth increasing individual incometax rates, high grade
corporate bonds have been less attractive to individual investors and the market for corporate
bonds has been predominantly amonginstitutional
investors. Since 1941, whenthe Commission
adopted its rule requiring competitive bidding in the sale of securities by registered public
utility holding compan:iesand their subsidiaries, the relative volumesof private placements of
utility securities has greatly declined.
small Financing

As a meansof facilitating
small financing, representatives of the securities industry
have urged that the present exemptionlimit of $100,000 be raised and the Commissionhas given
serious consideration to the suggestion. In the hearings before the HouseCommitteeon Interstate and Foreign Commerce
in 1941 on various proposals for amendingthe Securities Act of
1933 and the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934, the Commissionstated that it would not object
to raising the exemptionlimit specified in Section 3 (b) of the Act to $300,000, if the previsions giving the Commissionauthority to :imposeterms and conditions essential to protect the
public interest and the interest of investors were retained.

y

The exemptionpermitted by Section 3 (b) of the Act is not complete exemptionfrom all
provisions of the Act. It is limited by express provisions in Section 12, which :imposescivil
liability on persons whosell securities in interstate camnerceor through the mails by means
of untrue statements or misleading omissions, and in Section 17, which makesit unl.mrful to
sell securities by such means or by other types of fraud. Each of these sections by its own
terms is applicable to transactions regardless of whether the securities involved have been
exempted under Section 3 (b). The principal effect of a section:3 (b) exemptionis to permit
the sale of securities on the basis of a less complete disclosure than that required by the Act
in the case of a registered security. Moreover, civil liabilities
wil1 be incurred only by the
seller and the person controlling the seller, while in the case of the sale of a registered security, the full and fair disclosure described in the Act is required to be madeand the civil
liabilities
of Section 11 run against all the persons specified in that Section. This latter
sanction against practically all persons concerned in the distribution of a security is one of
the most important of implements in carrying out the policy of the Act, since it results in a
concerted effort on the part of all concerned to provide full and fair disclosure of the
character of the securities offered.

'J/ On January

6, 1945, senator Vandenburgintroduced 8.62, to amendSection 3 (b) of the securities Act of 1933, as amended,so as to permit exemption of security issues not exceeding
$300,000 from the registration provisions of the Act.

-7It has been urged that the proposed amendmentto broaden the exemption permitted by'
section 3 (b) will be helpful to small businesses that seek financing through public offerings
of securities and for that reason the Commissionhas concluded that it merits a trial.
Yet the
Commission'srecords of the cost of smaJ.l flotations of issues indicate that the major part of
and only a relatively small part
such costs is compensationto underwriters and distributors,
is represented by other expenses, :inCludingthose affected by registration requirements. This
would seemto indicate that the registration requirements of the Securities Act have very
little to do nth the high flotation costs of small issues.
Statistics showingthe flotation costs of equity security issues of small companies during
the period from January 1, 1938 to June 30, 1944 are presented in AppendixTable 2. There are
included all common
and preferred issues filed separately for primary distribution by companies
haviDg less than five million dollars of assets, other than issues of investment trusts and
extractive industry companies. The &&ysis showsthat the total flotation costs of equity
issues of companiesreporting less than one m:i.ll:i.on
dollars of assets amountedto 21.6 percent
of the expected gross proceeds, which included 19.7 percent as compensation to underwriters and
dealers and 1.9 percent for other expenses. Comparablefigures for the companies reporting
assets of between one and £ive million dollars were 15.6 percent total flotation costs, which
included 14.0 percent as compensationand 1.8 percent £or other expenses.
Of course only a part of the "other expense" category is attributable to registration.
Such expense items as issuance taxes, registrar' 8 fees, trustee' 8 fees, the cost of complying
nth State securities laws, and the cost of printing certificates and the preparation of
underlying documentssuch as charter amenchnents
and mortgages must be paid even though securities proposed to be offered are exemptfrom registration.
Furthermore, even though registration were not required, there would in most cases be certain fees for legal and accounting
services and expenses for the preparation of selling literature.
It seems clear, therefore,
that any measure designed to diminish that portion of the 1.8 or 1.9 percent "other expense"
figure attributable to registration costs alone maynot afford very substantial relief to enterprises that must pay in addition from fifteen to twenty cents out of every dollar as commission to underwriters for selling their securities.
In connection with security issues for which exemption from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933 is provided by the COJIIIDission's
rules and regulations promulgated
under Section 3 (b) of the statute, there were filed with the COIIIIIIission
during the past fiscal
year a total of 427 Letters of Notification, pursuant to Regulation A, and 209 amenchnents
thereto, representing an aggregate offering price of $21,933,994 of lIhich 40 Letters of Notification with an aggregate offering price of $1,413,252 related to offerings of oil and gas
leases and securities of companies engaged in various phases of the oil and gas business.
During the past year also the Commissionreceived and examined362 Offering Sheets, filed pursuant to Regulation B, and 376 amendmentsto such Offering Sheets, relating to fractional
undivided interests in oil and gas rights.

-8CHANGES MADE IN RUIES

DURING PAST YEAR

The principal change in rules and regulations of the Commissionadopted under the Securities Act of 1933 during the past year consists of amendmentsto Rules 5-04 and 12-06 of
Regulation S-X. On December22, 191.2the Commissionadopted comprehensive amendmentsto Regulation S-X designed to simplii'y' -and shorten reports required to be filed by registrants by
permitting under designated conditions the omission or partial omission of certain schedules.
The CODIIIissionlsexperi.eooe with those amendmentshad not been entirely satisfactory.
The
revisions of December9, 1943 are designed to secure with a m:i.ninu:m burden and expense certain
information deemedessential relating to property, plant, and equipnent. While the rules as
amendedcall for the filing under certain circumstances of information with respect to
property, plant, and equipDent not previously required, the new requirements relating thereto
are less than those existing prior to Deceui>er22, 1942.
As amended, Rule 5-at. permits the omission of Schedule V, Property, plant am equipment,
of such assets at both the beginning and end of the period does not exceed 5
percent of total assets (exclusive of intangibles) and if neither the additions nor deductions
during the period exceeded 5 percent of total assets (exclusive of intangible assets).
The
amendmentto Rule 12-06 provides, that, in case the additions and deductions columns are
omitted from Schedule V, as permitted by Note 3 of Rule 12-06, the total of additions and the
total retirements and sales shall be given in a footnote to the schedule.

Corporations so as to eliminate unnecessary and obsolete matter and to clarii'y several of its
instruetions.

ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE

The enforcement of the statutes which it administers is, of course, one of the Commission's
most important functions.
Prior to the reorganization of its staff in 1942, this duty was performed by a separate Legal Division. Since the reorganization, the enforcement of the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 has been condueted by the Office of Counsel to the Corporation Finance Division. That office also investigates violations of Seetions 14 (a) and
16 (a) of the securities Exchange Act of 1934, governing the solicitation of proxies and the
disclosure of stocldloldings of officers, directors and more than ten percent owners, the
various disclosure requirements contained in the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the Investment CompanyAct of 1940, Section 10 (b) of the securities ExchangeAct of 1934 and-Rule
X-10B-5thereunder, prohibiting fraud in the purchase or sale of securities, and of Section
12 (h) of the Public Ut.ility HoJ.dingCompa.11Y
Act of 1935 wh:1.ch prohibit.s polit.ical contributions by utility holding companies or subsidiaries.
The enforcement of these provisions and
the litigation wit.h respect thereto are diseussed under the respective Acts.
Enforcement under the securities Act of 1933 is generally of a twofold nature, i.e.,
prevention of fraud and the enforcement of the disclosure requirements.

the

Section 17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933 makes unlaw1'u1 the use of 8:n7 misrepresentations or fraudulent schemes in the sale of securities.
A very considerable part of the Commissionl s litigation involves injunctive actions to restrain violations of this section. For
example, in S.E.C. v. Timetrust, Inc., 39 F. Supp. 145 (N.D. Calif. 1941), an :injunction was
obtained where representations were madethat Timetrust certificates were similar to a savings
sccount, whereas the solicitation to purchase such certificates was merely a device for selling
Bank of America stock on the i.natalment plan. 4/ In S.E.C. v. Investors ~icate

-9deta1led description of this case will be found under the discussion of the Investment
COIIIp8Dy" Act of 1940.
The

disclosure requirements have been discussed in somedetail above.

Whereit appears

attar investigation that any of such requirements has been or is about to be violated, the

necessary action is instituted by the CClIIlIIIisaion.
It may be noted at thi.s time that Section 23
at the securities AC'tof 19.3.3(as well as Section 26 of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934 aId
section .35 at the Investment CCJllI.P8IlY
Act of 1940) prohibits any representation that the COIIlIIlissian has passed upon the merits or given approval to any security for which a registration
statement has been filed.
Wheresuch statements were made, the Commissionhas :instituted the
necessary injunctive action to halt such activities.
The provisions of the securities Act authorize the Commissionto refUse to pe:rnd.ta registration statement to becomeeffective if it appears on its face to be :incompleteor inaccurate
in any material respect, and empoII'erthe Commissionto issue a stop order suspending the effectiveness of any registration statement which at any time is found to include any untrue statement of a material faC't or to omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleadiIlg. These provisions of the Act have been
construed by the courts in several iJIIportant cases.
In,Jones v. S.E.C., 298 U.S. 1 (19.36),
a majority of the SUpremeeourt (Justices Cardozo, BrandeisanaStone dISsenting) held that the
C<lIIIIII8DC8JJInt
of stop order proceedings by the COIIIIIIission
prevented Jones' registration statement 1'rom ever becomingeffective and that amee none of the securities sought to be registered
had been offered or sold there was no public interest lIhich could be prejudiced by its withdranl in accordance with Jones' request.
On this basis the Court held that the Caomission had
erred in denying withdrawBl of the statement. This decision has been considered as l.arge];:r
limited to the procedure wh1ch the SUpreme Court deemedproper for the COJIIIIIiIlsion
to emp1o,y' m
connection with the suspension of the effectiveness of registration statement8. In a J.at.er
case in 19.39,Oklahoma-TexasTrust v: S.E~
100 F. (2d) 888, the C1rcuit court of AppeaJ.s tar
the 10th circUli tJNIjriillliiS1i 8l'.f1i'medan
r of the COIIIIli.ssion
suspending the regist;r&tioD ~
securities because of traudnlent misstatements contained in the registration stateMnt. There
it appeared that all of the securities registered had been sold prior to the CODlllSDC8lll9nt of
the stop order proceedings and the Trost contended that under the authority of the Jones case
the COIIIIIission
had lost its power to isl!R18a stop order. The court dist1ngui.shed tlii'"'JOnes
case, however, on the ground that here the public interest would be prejudiced by perm'IitIiig
the registrant to withdraw its registration statement. Immediateand subsequent purchasers of
the securities were entitled to be apprised of the fact that the registration statement, a
matter of pllblic record, upon wh1ch they" had relied, was false and misleading, and to have the
benefit of the civil liability provisions which gave them various remedies for the losses 1Ibich
they sustained on the securities.
In other cases the courts have hel.d that a stop order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement is not reviewable by the courts after it
bas been lifted upon the filing of amendmentsin accordance with the stop order (Austin Silver
Co. v. S.E.C., 1.S.E.C. Jude Dec. 7.32, App. n.c,; 19.39), and that an order aeIij1Dg a

cooclnsion of the heariJIg then penctiDg in connection with the stop order proc~s
is me~
1nterlocutor,y and not reviewable under the Act (Resources Corporation v. S.E.C., 97 F. (2d)
788, C.C.A. 7, 19.38).

!if!

The queS\;ionof the enforceability of contracts relating to the issuance or sale of securities which have bot been registered. as required by the Securities Act has been considered in
two cases. In Frost & Co. v. Coeur d'Alene Mines C0airation, .312U.S• .38 (1941), the SI1p1emB
Coart held that an option to sell securities iii V10lat on of the securities Act was not void
and could 1.awfu1ly" be the subject of an action for damagestor its breach. In that case the
CClIIIIl1ssion,
withOl1ttak:lng ersy position as to the disposition of the particu1ar case, ft.1ed a
brief as amicus curiae in the SUpremeeourt, urging that, as a general proposition, the
question ihS1iliersuch agreements should be enforced ought to depend upon whether or not in
the circumstances at the particular case the public policy in favor of the protection at ~
vestors would be served ~ hindered by enforcing the agreement between the parties.
In a later
case, Judson v.

So" too" in llerger }lines Co;poration v; Grismer" 137 F. (2d) 335 (C.C.A. 9, 1943), it was held

In such situations,

The subpoenaing of witnesses and documentary evidence in the course of investigations
instituted
by the Caumission has resulted in nearly 50 legal actions brought for
the most part by the COIIIIIission for the purpose of obtaining judicial
enforcement of the subpoenas and in a few cases against the Commission for the purpose of enjoining enforcement of
the subpoenas.
The Jones case discussed above was actually a suit by the Commission to obtain

the Second Circuit, which upheld the CCDIIIissionls right to obtain judicial en:forcellmlt of the
subpoena in that case.
AlthoUgh the Supreme Court reversed the judgments of the courts below,
for the reasons previously stated, it did not disturb their holdings sustaining the constitutionali1;yof

v. Perldns, 317 u.S. 501, in which the Supreme Court held that the secretary

plainly incompetent or irrelevant.
The circumstances of the Penfield case have brought to the fore a lI8akness in the Commisinvestigation
procedUre 1dli.ch was undoubtedJ.y not foreseen by the framers o£
sionl s statutory
'the Commission's Acts. Although the COIlDIIissionwas doubtless given the power to conduct investigations
.for the purpose o.f discovering whether viol.ations of the Acts have occurred, in
order to provide a 1aw-en.forcement. weapon that would be more effective
than the CUIIilersome

procedure, it has been the Commission's experience,
drawn fran the
Penfie1d case and other cases" that suspected wrongdoers d.esignedJ:y may seek to ~
the discovery of their viol.ations by forc:ing the Commission to go through lengthy court proceed:ings to
obtain enforcement of i'ts subpoenas.
The decision in 'the Penfield case :iJ.l.ustrates the pr0blem. As 'the coart pointed ou1;, the Commission began an inveStigation

and the Ccwp1inri.on1I'8S obliged 'to apply to a .federal district
court for an fmforcemen't order,
which 1I'8S issued on October 15, 1942. The enforcemen't of that subpoena disclosed a hitherto
unknown rela'tionship
between Penfield and Bourbon Sales.
The Commission fcnmd'that Penfield
had been acting as agent for the Bourbon Sal.es Corporation in sel.llng bo't1iJ.ing contracts
through the mails 'to persons to whomBourbon Sal.es or PenfieJ.d had previously sold whiskey
and that Penfield had subsequently sold i'ts own bot'tl1ng contracts through
warehouse receipts
The Commission also 1earned .for 'the first time 'that
the mails in exchange for such receipts.
stock of Penfield was being so1d to the public through 'the mails in exchange for bottling .contracts previously issued either by Penfie1d or Bourbon Sales.
On April S, 1943, the CClIIIDission
expanded i'ts investigation
to name the Penfield C~
and 'to cover the sale of Penfield
stock.
On April 9, 1943, a duJ:y authorized
officer of the Commission served a subpoena dnces
'tecum upon one of Penfield's
official.s
requiring the produc'tion of specified i'tems conta:rnea in
NIiHe1dl s books and records.
Penfield refused to compJ:ywith 'the subpoena and the COIDIIli8sion
was again obliged to resort to a federal distric't
court for i'ts enforcement.
The district
court issued an order enforcing the subpoena on June 1, 1943. The appeal to the Nint.b Circui't
Court of Appeals followed, and on June 30, 1944 it affirmed the district
court's enforcement
order.
Shortly thereafter
the mandate o.f the Ninth Circuit was stayed to pennit the Penfield
Company'to apply to the Uni'ted S'tates Supreme Court.
Thus more 'than two years had el.apsed and the Commission had not been able to obtain
certain facts sought; in its investiga'tion.
The .fact 'tha't prosecutions
are barred three ~ars
after the offense, makes i't apparent 'that such d.e~
may often prevent proper enforcemen't of
the law. 6/ A possible remedy for this si'tuation would be an amendment to the general sta'tu'te
of limitat'ions
'tolling the statu'te for the period during which an administrative
investi~aUon
is in progress with respec't 'to enforcement. proceedings or at the very least whi1e proceed1ngs
to enforce subpoenas are pending in 'the courts.
As an of.fshoot 'to SaDe of the above types of actions are the cont.empt actions brougb't by
the Ccmn18sion .for viol.ation of court decrees.
These actions have been chiefly for disobedience

Confidential reports of such investigations have been fol'll8.l'dedto the White House.

Thousandsof compIajuts are received from the public each year in addition to matters
brought to the attention of the Commissionby the several state securities officials, Better
Business Bureaus and other federal and state authorities.
All of these receive carefUl attention and where it appears that the statutes have been violated, an investigation is instituted.
The bulk of the investigative work is performed by the ten regional offices which are strategica.1ly located in financial centers throughout the country. Whereviolations have occUlTEld
legal action is instituted by the CODmIission.Such action may be either civil or crindnal.
The civil actions consist primarily of actions for injunctions aga:inst the continuance of the
violations.
Such actionS are instituted in the appropriate United states District Court and
permanent injunctions are obtained in the great majority of cases. These are usuaJ.ly preceded
by preliJni.nary injunctions, and in instances where serious and immediateviolations are
threatened, by a temporary restrsJ.ni.ng order. During the la-year period ended June 30, 1944,
the COIIIIIIi.ssion
had instituted a total of 508 civil proceedings and disposed of 478. Permanent
injunctions had been obtained against 1,057 firms and iOOividuals. Of 516 terminated cases
brought by or against the COIIIIIlission,
it was successful in 98%of them, only 10 cases being
adversely decided.

Recognizing the advantages to be realized from cooperating with other federal and state

Because of the techn1caJ. nature of securities representing oil and gas interests and the
knOlrledgenecessary in order properly to apply the statutory requirements to
offerings of such securities, the CClIIIIIission
established, on July 1, 1936, a separate Oil and
Gas Unit. It also adopted separate regulations, under Section.3 (b) of the Act, providing
exemptions
from registration for offerings of securities of this character not in excess at
$lOO,ooo. The Oil and Gas Unit admjnisters these regulations and registration statements

ASSISTANCE

Fromits inception, the Commissionhas realized that the technical nature of the statutes
by it requires the maintenance of an interpretative
and advisory service to provide attorneys and the general public with prompt advice concerning problems arising under
thOse statutes.
These requests embracea wide variety of subjects and often involve inliricate
factual situations.
A knowledgeof the legislative history of the statutes and the application
of the statutes to practical business situations is required of the attorneys engaged in this
work.
administered

Many of the general inquiries pertain to smaJ.l business enterprises seeking capital.
The
Commissionis fully aware of the problems confronting such concerns and endeavors to assist
them by furnishing upon request detailed advice as to the procedure for registration and the
possibility of exemption from the registration and prospectus requirements. The more complicated situations are studied and an opinion by the Counsel to one of the Divisions is rendered
as to the applicability of the various statutes administered by the Commission. These opinions
are gener~
sought by care.ful attorneys and securities houses in situations which might involve duties under the various Acts. Counsel's opinions are not rendered with respect to
possible private civil. liabilities
since the Commissionhas no jurisdiction over these matters.
Although a caupilation of interpretations has been prepared to assist in according uniform
treatment in recurring situations, the great variety of problems has DOt made it feasible to
publish a glossary of annotations. Nevertheless, a numberof interpretations of general
application bave been madepubl.ic in release form as opinions of the Counsel to the Division
stind"i staring the statute to which the interpretation relates.

One of the problems frequently presented for interpretation is whether or not a stockholder
whointends to offer a security to the public tl>.roughan underwriter is in "control" of the
e~
lIhich has issued the stDck. If a control relationship exists the securities may be required to be registered under the Securities Act. As there is no fixed. statutory definition ot
.control" ~ the determination o.tten depends on a study of all the facts relating to the history
and operation of the colllp8DY'~
its officers and chief stockholders, and their bwJinese affiliations. If there is a dispute on this question, the only way to settle it is to go to court,
tor J while the COJIIII18sion
has the power of investigation, there is no provision in the statute
tor administrative proceedings to reach such determination. During a recapitaliZation or reorganization the question is frequently asked at lIbat point when, as, and if issued trading in

- 15 the new securities maybe commenced. Various types of option agreements and trusts for the
benefit of close relatives give rise to questions with respect to the duty of an officer,
director or 10%equity stockholder of a listed companyto file reports pursuant to the Securities ExchangeAct ahOiring changes in the bene£iciaJ. interest of such officer, di.rector or
10% stockholder in the securities of the listed company.
In order to assure uniformity, the offices of Counsel to the Corporation Finance Division
and Counsel to the Trading and Exchange Division review the interpretations
rendered by" the

staffs of the ten Regional Offices of the Commission. The NewYork Regional O£f1ce alone
handles about 20,000 inquiries a year which it receives from attorneys, brokers, investnent
companiesand other membersof the public.

PART II
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

The Congressional investigations and hearings in 1<)34had demonstrated that widespread
aDd i'lagrant abuses, including the excessive use of credit, existed in the securities markets
which materially impaired the economic use.t'ulnes8 of these markets and which adversely affected
the stability
and orderliness of the economic life of the nation, precipitating,
iJltensifyiDg
and prolonging emergencies in that area.
In order to insure the maintenance of fair and honest
securities markets, and to prevent the undue use of credit, the securities ExchangeAct of 1934
promulgated. It is designed to eliminate manipulation and other abuses in the trading of
securities both on the organized exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets, which together
constitute the nation's facilities
for trading in securities; to make available to the public
iDformation regarding the condition of corporations whose securities are listed on any national
securities exchange; and to regulate the use of the nation's credit in securities trading.
The
authority to issue rules on the use of credit in securities transactions is lodged in the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but the adrn1 nistration of the rules and all provisions of the Act is vested in the Commission. The following is a rmri.8tr of the major phases

was

of the COJIIIlIi.ssion'
s administration

of the Act.

REGULATION OF EXCHANGES AND EXCHANGE TRADING

Registration

of Exchanges

Section 5 of the Securities ExchangeAct of 19,34requires that all exchanges in the United
States either register with the CODIIIIission
or obtain exemption trom such registration.
Accordingly, the Commission's first task under the Act was to set up the machinery for registering
securities exchanges and for handl :fng applications for exemption.
Pursuant to the Act, 28 exchanges have filed applications for registration as national
securities exchanges, practically all of them filing in 1934. Before granting registration to
certain exchanges, iIwestigators were sent into the field to examine them, and reports were
filed by trial exami.nersbefore whQlll hearings were held. In connection with these applications
for registration,
the constitution, b,...laws, and ru1es and regulations of each exchange were
examined and analyzed. Moreover, as the statute required, agreenents were obtained tram each
exchange to complywith the provisions of the Act and a.rrsr rules and regulations thereunder, to
enforce compliance with such provisions by its JDSJIbers"80 far as is within its power, and to
supply the Commissionwith copies of amendmentsto its rules.
In confomity with the provi ..
sions of the Act" each exchange was also required to include in its rul.es provision for the
disciplining of JDeDi>ers
for conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade,
and to declare that any w1.l.lful violation of the Act or the Rules or Regulations adopted
ttlereunder shall be considered :inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.
On October 1, 1934, 22 exchanges were registered as national securities uchaDges. Three
exchanges were registered on later dates after baring operated as exElllpt exchanges for perioda
of time. These latter were the StaDdard stock Exchange of Spokane, the C1rlcago curb Exchange
Association"

and the San Francisco

Vining Exchange.

S1nce OCtober 1., 1.934, Jll8rgere and disso1.utions have redl1ced the number of registered
excbqes to 19. The Buffalo Stock Exchange, Denver Stock Exchange, Chicago curb Exchange A8sooj.~t1on, and NewYork Real Estate securities Exchange" in that order, we.re granted permission to

Section 5 of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934 provides that exemptions tram registration ~
 be available for an exchange when the limited volume of transactions renders it unnecessary and impracticable to require registration.
Pursuant to this provision, 22 exchanges
have applied for exemption since 1934. Ten exchanges have been granted permanent exemption
from registration as national securities exchanges: The Honolulu Stock Exchange, Milwaukee
Grain and Stock Exchange, Ilinnesota-st. Paul stock Exchange, RichmondStock Exchange, Wheeling
stock Exchange, Co1oradoSprings stock Exchange, seattle Stock Exchange, Sta.rxiardStock Eltchange of Spokane, Chicago Curb ExchangeAssoc:IAtion, and San Francisco Yining Exchange. The
last three subsequently becameregistered exchanges and the MilwaukeeGrain and Stock Exchange
and Seattle stock Exchangesubsequently suspended operations as securities exchanges, thus
leaving but five exempted exchanges.
)lost of thE. remaining exchanges 'll'ithdrewtheir applications and dissolved. These exchanges
were typically small, bad a J.1mited numberof members,and had brief trading sessions.

cases, the quotations arrived at and published on these exchanges were s1mi.lar in character to

committees to insure a fair representation of the membership, and the suspension, expu1.sion, and discipJ.ini.ng of membersor such exchanges."

Y

This repo!'t was made on January 25, 1935.
Numerousother studies have since been made
whi.ch r..J.l be referred to from time to time below.
As a result of the Commission's recommendations; as well as on their own initiative,
the
various exchanges have made ma.I\1 changes in their rules, practices and organization which have
been refiected in amendmentsto their application for registration or exemption. The exchanges
have fUed, on an average, about 230 amendmentsand supplements to these applications each
year during the past ten years. Each of these amendmentsand supplements has been studied and
~ed
for its effects upon the public 1r.terest and its compliance with the relevant regulatory provisions.

The facts regarding the admj n1stration of the NewYork Stock Exchange which were disclosed as an aftermath of the

was elected on June 30, 1938.
This reorganization provided for direct representation
of the public on the Board of Governors
and increased the representation
of exchange firms doing business with the public.
It greatly
simplified the administrative
structure,
reducing the number of standing committees from 17 to 7.
It created a paid president, who must be a nonmembe:r,and executive staffs were created to carry
out functions formerly conducted by the Governors sitting as committee members.
The NewYork stock Exchange's constitution
was amended on January 1, 1939, to classify as
"allied membersll all general partners of memberfirms who do not individually hold seats on the
exchange. This resulted in an extension of the exchange's direct disciplinary
powers to such

too, provided for three governors not identified with exchange members to sit as representatives
of the general public.
The fact that a thorough revision of exchange administration had been long overdue was
illustrated
not only by the Whitney cag'e, which involved the NewYork Stock F.xcbange, but also
by the so-called Cuppia case, involving the NewYork Curb Exchange. In the latter
case, the
COJIIIII1ssion
reviewed disciplinary
proceedings of the NewYork Curb Exchange with respect to
violations of the exchange's ruJ.es by various of its members, including J. Chester Cuppia. 2/
Cuppia, a leading memberof the NewYork Curb Exchange and active in the exchange government,
had for a long period violated an important provision of the exchange constitution
prohibiting
the splitting
of commissions. For eight years, Cuppia pursued the demoralizing practice of
soliciting
floor brokers, whomhe was in a position to favor with a share of his firm's extensive business, for rebates of their commission.
The practice was not confined to one or two floor brokers but was pursued on an extensive
scale and went unchecked until a falling out between Cuppia and one of the brokers led to
litigation.
It was only then that the NewYork Curb Exchange's Business Conduct Committee
undertook to investigate
the practice.
The investigation
took place in 1940, after the New
York Curb Exchange had determined to reorganize but before the reorganization was completed.
Although .cuppia and his associates were found guilty of the charge of coJlllllissionsplitting~
the punishments provided by the constitution
for such an offense were not invoked. Cuppia was
permitted to sell his seat and resign from the exchange. Punishment of his associates was
confined to a private reprimand.
In the course of the Businness Conduct COJIIII1
ttee' s investigat1on~ various members made
deliberate and proven falsifications
to the COJIIIII1.ttee,
an offense punishable by suspension or
expulsion.
Again, punishment was confined to private reprimand.

All ot the exchange's proceedings were conducted with the utmost quiet and a complete
absence or publicity.
Indeed, so greatly concerned was the exchange with the possibility that
Pllblicity might be harmful that William J. Plate, the memberwho had instituted the litigation
which lIbroke" the case, was severely condemned,in his first appearance bei'ore the Business
Conduct COIBittee, tor resorting to the courts and not to exchange arbitration.
The Ca.1asion' 8 investigation of the affair disclosed facts which the Business Conduct
C~ttee'8
1Jmlstigation had tailed to unearth and tor the first time implicated a numberof
other aembers in the ccsdssion-splitt1ng
practice.
In the light of these facts, the NewYork
Curb Exchangestiftened its disciplinary practice by expelling five ot the brokers involved.
The CODI1asion,in its ~eport of the case, said:

-This COIIIIII1ssion
cannot help but question at least the efficacy ot the Curb's investigatory
procedure. The subsequent handling of this case by the Curb also compels us to doubt the
adequacy ot its disciplinary procedure."
The report concluded:
"Existing legislation gives this COIIIIIIission
no express power to compel compliance nth
exchange rules.
The record in this case, as well as its experience in the Whitney case,
convinces the COIDl1ssion,that in order that the public interest be safeguarded, there
should be appropriate power tor it to take direct action where an exchange fails to enforce
its own safeguarding rules of such 1JIlportancethat their violation entails the penalty or
8U8pensionor expulsion. II
On August 7, 1941, as a part of a joint program of the Commissionand the industry for
to the securities Act of 1933 and the Securities F.xchangeAct of 19.34, the CommisameDdJllents
sion proposed 8118ndmenta
to Clauses (1) and (3) ot Section 19 (a) ot the latter Act. These
proposals, which have never been acted on, would empowerthe Collllllissionto suspend or withdraw
the registration of an exchange for tailure to enforce compliance with the exchange's rules
and would _power the COIIII1ssion
also to suspend or expel an exchange memberfrom his exchange
tor wilful violation of an exchange rule which SUbjects a memberto suspension or expulsion.

The Whitney Case and Brokers' Solvency
On Karch 8, 19.38, it was announcedfrom the rostrum of the NewYork Stock Exchangethat
had been suspended for insolvency. Whitney, senior
the firm or Richard Whitney & CClIIlJl8ll3'
partner of the f1rmJ had been a memberof the exchange since 1912. He had been a memberot
the govem1DgcOlllllittee of the exchange cont1nuously since 1919 and its president from 19.30 to
1935. At various t1Jles, he had been chairman ot the COIIIIitteeon Business Collduct, a trustee of
the Gratut1y FuDd ot the exchange and a director of the Stock Clearing Corporation, and had held
IlUIIerouB other positions of 1aportance and responsibility.
His position, prestige and power
were eDhancedb7 the tact that his brother, GeorgeWhitney, was a partner of J. P. Morgan&
CClIIlp8Il1' •

Investigation disclosed that the tirm had been insolvent for at least three and one-halt
)'ears. The tirm's insolvency had resulted largely from the personal speculations of Richard
Whitaey in ventures entirely wsrelated to his brokerage business and involving such widely
and JIl1neral colloids.
To meet the need for funds in
diverse products as applejack, peat ~,
these ventures, Whitue1' began m.appropriatiDg a customer's securities as far back as 1926;
beg1Dn1Dg in 19.36JBdsappropr1ations becamehis regular practice. 3/ Eventually, Whitney
misappropriated Dot only the securities- of his customers but also 'those of the exchaDge's
Gratuity FaDd, or which he was a trustee.

'J/ Shortly

after his suspension fro. the exchaDge, RiehL--dWhitney was arrested on two separate
returned b7: a HewYork state grand Jury charging him with grand larceny in the
tirst degree. He pleaded guilty t-o these 1ndic::tments am was sentenced on April llJ 19.38,
to an 1ndetel"lll1nate tera of the to ten years on each 1ndietment.
lDdictamts

-20In the last four months prior to his 8U8pen8ion, Whitney's need for funds to cover cOlllDl1tIn
ments was so great and so continuous that he negotiated ill loans aggregating $27,361,500.
addition to borrowing from commercial banks, he borrowed from exchange members, member firms and
partners of member firms on at least 42 occasions.
On at least 21 occasions, he made futile
efforts to negotiate loans from individuals or firllls connected with the exchange.
including a former president,
Many persons highly placed in the exchange administration,
were mrare of Whitney's financial
difficulties
for a considerable t1me before his suspension.
TIro partners of J. P. Morgan & Companywere also aware of Whitney's embezzlement of Gratuity
Fund securities.
Adhering to an UDIIJ'itten code of silence,
none of them reported his knowledge
to the exchange authorities.

!tI

These circumstances,
coupled with the fact that no disciplinary
action was taken by the New
York stock Exchange against RlA;baJ:d Whitney until :March 1938, made it apparent that there should
be a reconsideration
of the adequacy of the then existing machinery of the exchange for the
supervision and surveillance
of its members. The COIIIIIissionand the nn Jllanagement of the
exchange jointly considered the entire problem. Round-table conferences were held by ol'fic1als
of the Conmd.ssionwith officers and representatives
of the NewYork Stock Exchange, and certain
of that exchange.
These conferences, begun in June 1938, were continued
other representatives
and l'all.
Although the statutory
powers of the CODIIII1sat frequent intervals
during the 8UDIIIElr
sion were also reexamined in the light of the Whitney case, the discussions
primarily emphasized
the need of the exchange to be more vigorous in the enforcement of its own rules and the regulation of its members.
The Board of Governors of the NewYork Stock Exchange approved on October 26, 1938, a program

the exchange all substantial

between official.s

Weekly information as
to underwriting positions was also to be filed with the exchange by its members.
The program provided also that the exchange was to undertake to study the feasibility
of a
central securities
depository which the President of the exchange had then anticipated
could
serve as the first
step toward the ultimate formation of a "Central Trust Institution."
Such
an institution
would constitute
a depository into which customers' credit balances and securities could be p:llced in such a manner as to remove them from the hazards of brokerage insolvencies.
Follcndng the disclosures
or the Whitney case, the creation of such an institution
had been proposed by Willlam O. Douglas, then Chairman or the COllllll1ssion.
Somemonths later,
the President of the exchange appointed a cOJlllllittee of non-members to
study the broad problem of adequate financial
protection to customers, and particularly
the
of a "Central Trust Institution."
On August 31, 1939, the coJllllittee
question of the feasibility
published its report,
5/ urging a IlUJIlberof detailed improvements in brokerage practice but
made it
expressing the view that certain objections to the suggestion for a central institution
Jlany or the specific recOllllllendations were reiterations

funds and equities in the hands of brokers and dealers
or day-by-day trading for their own account.

The Whitney case gave rise to a suit by former customers of Richard Whitney & Company against
the New York Stock Exchange to recover damages allegedly sustained as a result of the exchange's
failure to enforce its rules governing the conduct of its members. 6/ The Commission filed an
amj.cus curiae brief in that case, taking no position on the facts but pointine out that the New
York Stock Exchange, as a national securities exchange, is under a duty to enforce its own
rules, that civil liability may exist as a result of the breach of a statutory duty even if the
right of such action is not specifically granted under the Act, and that the purpose of the Act
is to protect investors not only against abuses in security market transactions but also against
insolvent and embezzling brokers. The court's decision established the legal liability of the
exchange under such circumstances although it held also that the plaintiffs in the suit were
unable to prove damages.
Not content with the adequacy of the measures adopted by the exchanges for the protection of
customers' securities, the Commission promulgated two rules in November 1940, Rules X-8C-l 7/
and X-15C2-1 under the Securities Exchange Act, governing the pledging of customers' securities;
the two rules are substantially identical. 8/ Generally speaking, the rules prohibit brokers and
dealers from risking their customers' securIties as collateral to finance their own trading,
speculating or underwriting ventures. First, brokers and dealers are forbidden to commingle the
securities of different customers without the consent of each customer. Second, a broker or
dea.ler may not commingle customers' securities with his own under the same pledge. And finally
a broker or dealer may not pledge customers' securities for more than the total amount which
such customers owe him.
This rule was followed in November 1942 by the adoption of Rule X-17A-5 requiring brokers
and dealers to file with the Commission annual reports of their financial condition. This rule
arose out of the request of representatives of the i~ustry for assistance from the Commission in
t.he development of uniform financial statements to be used by all members of the security industr.r for reporting their financial condition to regulatory bodies such as the Commission, the
various state commissions, national securities exchanges, and the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. It was the consensus of everyone who worked on ,the subject that the
most feasible way to get a uniform statement would be for the Commission to promulgate a rule
and adopt a form which others might adopt. After extended conferences with representatives of
all the interested bodies, a form was agreed upon and is now in use.
Margin Regulations
For the PIl-"'POse
of preventing the excessive use of credit for the purchase or carrying of
securities, the Federal Reserve Board was directed by Section 7 of 'the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 to prescribe rules and regulations on the extension and maintenance of credit on

promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are designated by an "X"

by a number designating the chronological order of the particular rule in relation to other
rules adopted pursuant to the same section and subsections.

Section 8 (c) of the Securities Exchange Act gives the Commission authority over "any member
of a national securities exchange, or any broker or dealer who transacts a business in securities through the medium of any such member." Section 15 (c) (2) applies to brokers and
dealers who use the mans or any instrumentalities of interstate commerce to effect over-thecounter transactions in other than exempted securities or commercial paper. In order to give
'thewidest possible coverage to the new mea8U1"e8 for protecting customers' securities, it was
deemed advisable to promulgate rules under both sections.

-22registered securities.
Under this section the Board adopted Regulation T governing the extension of credit by membersof national securities exchanges aDd brokers or dealers transacting a
business in securities through such membersj and Regulation U which governs 19811S by banks for
the purpose of purchasing or carry1ng stocks registered on a national securities exchange. The
COJIIIIIission
cooperated closely with the Board in the formulation of these regulations.
AIthough the Board formulated these rules, the CoJlllllissionhas undertaken to conduct routine
inspections of the books and records of brokers and dealers for the purpose, amongothers, of
assuring proper compliance with Regulation T. During the initial stages of this work the
ts inspectors were directed largely to studying the effect of such
efforts of the COIIIIIl1ssion
regulation on the extension of credit on registered securities aDd assisting dealers in arriving
at a better understanding of the requirements of Regulation T. Later these inspections were
directed toward the enforcement of the Regulation and of the rules and regulations promulgated
by the Ce-aiasion.
In the first several years, most margin inspections are of firms which
were membersof national securities exchanges since finns in this category more cOllllllOnly
extend
credit on securities than do others. However, beginning in 1938 more emphasis 1I'8S placed on
the inspection of non-memberfirms and the inspection of memberfirms was left largely to the
ts
exchanges. This 11'88 in conformity with the COIIIIIl1ssionpolicy
of delegating to exchanges insofar as practicable the supervision of their own members.
The margin requirement proviBions of the Act were held constitutional
in a criminal case,
United States v. McDermott,d1seussed in the section on cr1minal proceedings.

Inspections of the booka and recorda of over 4,000 .firms have been madeduring the la-year
period through June 30, 1944. liuerous violations of Regulation T have been found. Where
these violations were ot a Jd:nor nature they were merely called to the attention of the firm.
aOll8ver, where these violations have been more serious, other remedial steps have been taken.
The cooperation or exchaDges in this enforcement activity has resulted in a number of discipl.1nary actions by the exchanges against memberfiJ'lls for violations of Regulation 'l'. B7
~ement,
the exchanges report such cases of d1sciPl.inar7 action periodically to the
Cc:adssion.

Trad1Dg Rules ReCOJl\lllended
to the Exchal!ges
Early in 1935 a comprehensive esurvey was undertaken by the Coadssion ot the activities
of specialiats, fioor traders aDd odd-lot dealers on the Jew York Stock Exchange and the New
York Curb Exchange aDd of trading on other exchaDges. On the basis of this study' sixteen
suggested rules tor the regulation of trading on exchanges were formulated and in April 1935
these were sent to all natioual securities exchanges with the CCIIIIId.ssionts
recCllllllendationthat
th8T be adopted as exchange rules.
This coarse pendtted greater flex1b1l1tJ' in the adaptation aDd _dpd n1stration of the rules according to the varying circwll8tances ot each exchange
and 1I'8S parauant to the Ce-issionts
pollcyor permitting the cooperation of the exchanges in
their own regulation to the greatest degree possible.
The rules placed certain restrictions
upon trading for their own account by membersof
national securities exchanges.
These restrictions
included a prohibition against effecting
transactions which are excessive in view of the financial resources of the JDeIIberor in view of
the market for the secur1t;n a prohibition against joint accounts in which both membersaDd nonmemberswere intereeted, without the prior approval of an exchangej and a requirement that
transactions effected tar joint accounts and interests in joint accounts be reported to the
exchange. I:oreoqr, -.bers

specialiat.
S1m:1larrules were proposed to govern the conduct of odd-lot dealers.

All national. securities exchanges adopted the rules either in their entirety, as recQIlmended, or in a form JDod1fiedto meet the individual trading practice of some of the exchanges.
Short selling
Problems relating to short selling received particular attention from the COSIIIII1.ss1on
after
its organization in 1934. It was not until the sharp drop in stock prices in the fall of 1937,
however, that an opportunity was afforded to study at first hand the elfects of short selliDg
in a rapidJ,;ydeclining market. The study made at that time included a detailed analysis of
transactions in twenty selected stocks traded on the NewYork Stock Exchangeduring two
separate periods in September and October 19'Yl.
As a result of this studY', the Commissionissued Rules I-lOA-I, I-lOA-2, and 1-3B-3,
effective Februar;y 8, 1938. The effect of these rules was to prohibit any short sale of a
security except at a price above the last preceding sale price. Odd-lot transactions and
certain round-lot transactions of odd-lot dealers were exemptedfr<lmthe rules.
On February
10, 1938, the Commissionexempted certain short sales on a domestic u:change effected for
the purpose of equalizing prices between that exchange and .another national securities exchange. On April 8, 1938, certain short sales effected in arbitrage transactions between
securities were exempted.
In order to check the adequacy-and effectiveness of these rules, the COIIIIIIission
conducted
another detailed study of the trading in the S8118 twenty stocks during the period of price
decline f'rCllll lIarch 2l to April 2, 1938. Following the study, and upon the recOllllll8ndationof
the NewYork:Stock Exchange, the CClIIIIlission,
effective Jlarch 20, 1939, JIIOdi.t1ed the short
sell1ng rules 80 as to permit short Jales at the price of the last sale instead of above the
last sale price, provided that the last sale price 1IU itself higher than the last different
price which preceded it.
The rules were further amendedali that time to exempt certain short
sales made 1n the course of international arbitrage.
~pecial Offering

P1aDs

Prior to the enactment of the 5ecur1ties ExchangeAct of 1934 distributions to the pu.blic
of' large b10cks of stocks which were listed on exchanges were frequently- accompaniedby a
man1palation of the market. The object of such JD8l1ipnlationwould be two-fold-to raise the
price of the security and to stbmlate activity to the point where a demandwould be created
large enough to a1lowr the sale of the offered security.
Af'ter passage of the Act, a method
waa developed and widely used whereby- ca.paratively large blocks of listed stocks 1I8re
di8tributed to the Plblic over the counter. These blocks, which emanated f'roIII estates,
1.nvestllent ccapan1es, corporate officials and others, were offered to the public through
organised distributing groups after the close of the exchange market. The offerings were
u.oat 1.Dvar1ab1y made at 3:00 p.m., iDl""diately after the close of the exchaDgemarket, and the
securities 1mol.ved were offered at or about the closing exchange price on that day. )lost of
these offerings were ccmpleted prior to the opening of the I181'keton the succeeding dan it not
cc.pleted by that tt.,
they were unall7 withdrawn. Since I118111ber

'!'he'" York Stock Exchange and NewYork Curb Exchange, concerned with the gronh of' ltoff-the-boardlt sales of securities which had trading privileges on
their respective noon,
sought for ways and M8D8 to facilitate
offerings of comparatively
large blocks of stoclc directly on the noors of their respective exchanges. In 19.41, after
I1UII8rou conferences with representatives of the Co.dssion, the .special offeringn was evolY8d.

by the 'lrading and
Exchange Dirle1011 on Secondary D1etl"ibut.1ou of Exchange Stocks,. published by the C~sdon on FebrnarT 5, 1942.

-24On February 6, 1942, the Commissionamended its Rule X-IOB-2 to permit special offerings of
blocks of securities
on national securities
exchanges where such offerings are effected pursuant
to a plan filed with and declared effective by the Commission. Brieny,
these plans provide
that a special offering may be made when it has been determined that the auction market on the
floor of the exchange cannot absorb a particular
block of a security within a reasonable time
without undue disturbance to the current price.
The offering is made at a fixed price which is
set within the framework of the existing auction market. Membersacting as brokers for public
buyers are paid a special commission by the seller which ordinarily exceeds the regular commission.
Buyers obtain the securities
without paying any commission. Full disclosure is made to
the buyer of all of the details relating to his purchase, including the commission paid to his
broker by the seller.
Pursuant to the terms of the exemption, the Commission declared effective as of February
Similar action was taken subsequently with respect to plans of six other exchanges. These plans varied in minor respects
from one another and from the NewYork Stock Exchange plan.
The plans of the San Francisco
Stock Exchange, NewYork Curb Exchange, Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Detroit Stock Exchange,
Chicago Stock Exchange, and Cincinnati Stock Exchange were declared effective to that order.
Several exchanges have since amended their original plans in the light of experience.

14, 1942, a plan submitted by the NewYork Stock Exchange.

The first
special offering was effected on the NewYork Stock Exchange on February 19,
1942. Since that time, through June .30, 1944, a total of 182 offerings have been effected ORthat exchange involving 2,325,582 shares at a value of $68,406,000.
During the same period a
total of 23 special offerings have been effected on the other exchanges having plans.
These
ofrerings involved l4l,253 shares having a value or $2,019,000.
In the year ended June 30, 1944, special offerings were erfected on only four of the
seven exchanges with special offering plans, the number of such offerings totaling 80. Data
with respect to these offerings appear in Appendix Table 6.
The "Multiple Trading Case"
Section 19 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 empowers the Commissionunder certo alter or supplement the rules of an exchange in respect of certain matters,
if the exchange itself
refuses to make such changes. The only proceeding under this section
was instituted
on January 2, 1941. In this case, the Commission served notice on the NewYork
Stock Exchange of a hearing on the so-called "multiple trading rule" of that exchange.

tain conditions

Over the years, various regional exchanges had developed so-called "multiple trading"
methods for effecting transactions
upon their noors in securities
which also were traded on the
NewYork Stock Exchange. By these methods, the prices established on the floors of the regional
exchange are determined by the prices on the floor of the NewYork Stock Exchange as reported
upon the ticker of the latter exchange. In this connection, various members of the NewYork
in
Stock Exchange who also are members of the regional exchanges have undertaken to participate
"multiple trading" by setting themselves up as odd-lot dealers or specialists
on the regional
exchange noors in the issues in which such trading is effected.
The NewYork Stock Exchange,
by interpretation
of Section 8 of Article XVI of its constitution,
barred its members
from such activities.
The staff of the Trading and Exchange Division undertook an analysis of
the effects of the NewYork Stock ExchangeI s action and recommendedto the Commission that the
exchange be required to rescind its action.

Registration
of the securities
of six issuers was ordered tennina:ted by the COIIlIIIission

There were 6 such proceedings pending at the

Early in 19.31 Missouri Pacific (YOP) entered into contracts
to purchase certain securities
and an additional
$4,.369,062, the latter
for a consideration
of $15,965,201 plus interest,
amount'to be derived from the income and liquidation of part of the securities.
Moreover, even
if the Interstate
CommerceCOIJlIIIission
withheld approval, lIOPwas to be liable for the purchase
price, to the extent that a sale of the securities
after II>P's failure to complete the purchase
resulted in the seller receiving less 'than the price at which MOPhad agreed to make the
purchase.
No attemp't was ever made by IDP to obtain the approval of the Interstate CommerceCOIIIIII1JJ.o

of the securities

Financial statements filed in 19.35 by WP in support of its application

opinion of the Commission, the contingent liability

the financial
and operating conditions
of MOP,registration
of its commonand preferred stock
was ordered withdrawn unless its application
for registration
and annual reports were appropriately
emended within 30 days. MOPfiled the appropriate amendments and the proceeding was
dismissed.
The Hollander case was concerned, among other things, with whether Puder & Puder, who
cert1:fied the financial
statements of A. Hollander &: Son,
were independent of the registrant. The record indicated that certain important items had been hamled in a questionable
manner in financial
statements prepared for the public record in contrast with complete and
accurate explanation of the iteDlS in an audit prepared for private distribution
to registrant's
management and to banks and other financial
institutions
but not made available to the public
security holders; that two principal members of the accounting firm and their wives owned substantial amounts of stock of the registrant;
that one of the Puders,
through various brokerage
for Jll8Jli)ersof the Hollander family and had
accoun1;s in his name, had effected transactions
helped a Canadj an oompanywhich was owned entirely by three members of the Hollander family to
conceal its market operations in the registrant's
stock.
In addition the Puders had loaned to
and borrowed .tram the Hollanders.
The Commission found Puder &: Puder were not independent
public accountants with respect to financial statements filed by the registrant
and registration of the Hollander stock was ordered withdrawn unless, within 90 dayB, the issuer filed
amendments making the public record accurate and complete, mailed a copy of the Commission's
opinion to each of its stockholders of record, and undertook to file quarterly reports which
effected during the
would be available to the public summarizing the material. transactions
preceding three months between the registrant,
on the one hand, and its officers

and the controlled corporations

The company complied with the

Proceedings, In the Matter of Transamerica Corporation. were commencedby the Commission
on November 22, 19.38 by the issuance of an order for hearing under Section 19 (a) (2) of the
securities
Exchange Act of 19.34 to determine whether Transamerica Corporation had failed to
comply with certain sections of the Act and the rules, regulations
and forms promulgated
thereunder and, if so, whether it was necessary or appropria'te to suspend or withdraw the
registration
of Transamerica stock on the NewYork, San Francisco and Los Angeles Stock Exchanges upon which exchanges such stock is registered.
On January 16, 19.39 public hearings

-28began on the above order and cont1nued with some interruption until Yarch 28, 1939, on which
date they were inde1'in1tely adjourned for the purpose of enabling the Commission's staff to
examine the relevant books and records of Transamerica, the latter companyhaving offered the
Camn1ssionaccess to such books and records.
Wh1le DUJllBrouB auditing investigations had been made of brokers and dealers charged with
violating the securities Exchange Act of 1934, this was the first case of any magnitude in
lIh1ch the Cc:muiss1onmade an independent. investigation of the affairs of a compan;y
having securities listed on a national securities exchange. The examination, which ~s made at the
offices of Transamerica, principally in San Francisco, involved approx:iJDately40 companies for
a period of several years and required the semces of a rmmberof meDbersof the Commission's
starf for more than sa months. As a result of this examination, the Commission,on NoveDber
22, 1940, amendedits order for hearing and public hearings were resumed on Deceni>er9, 1940
and cont.iJmed until December16, 1940 when once again they were indefinitely adjourned.

W

On llarch 10, 1941 agreement was reached by representatives of Transamerica and the Commission as a result of lIhich Transamerica filed, on September 29, 1941, certain amendment.s
to its
order was amendedto eliminate the items
application for registration and the COJIIIll1ssion's
affected by the amendments. Thereafter, representatives of Transamerica and the Commission
-.ere engaged in preparing stipulations of facts as to the principal issues and on November29,
1943 public hearings were resumed on those charges in respect of which stipulations were not
arrived at. The hearings were completed on February 4, 1944 and the case is under consideration by the COJIIIIis8ion.
From time to time, the Commissionhas found it necessary to amendits rules and regulations
under Section 13 of the Act in order to provide for the publication of more timely or more
OIl
deta1led infor-.tion with respect to the affairs of the issuers of registered securities.
.July 7, 1944, the CCIIIIlissionannounced the }romulgation at Rules X-13A-6(e) and X-15C2-2. i'ba
DBW ru1.es were based largeJ.y on the trading experiences in the stocks of several l1qaor __
facturers which had recently declared dividends payable in whiskey. They were intended to prevent potent.ia1 abuses in trading before adequate information was avallable as to the nature and
amount of the whiskey to be distributed.
Rule X-13A-6(e) provides that, whenever a companywith a security registered on a national
!Securities exchange declares a dividend or distribution in a form other than cash or securities,
it shall promptly file a telegraphic report with the Commis~ionJcontaining a full and accurate
description of the contemplated dividend or distribution.
If the Commissionfinds that -the
available information with respect. t.o the contemplated dividend or distribution is inadequate to
permit investors to make a proper appraisal of the value of the security, it may exercise its
authority under Section 19 (a) (4) of the Act to order a temporary suspension of trading in the
security on the exchange on which it is registered, peIding the availability
of more adequate
information.

OWNERSHIP REPOlll'S
Prior to the enactment of the securities Exchange Act, profits from nSU1'8 thing" speculation
in the stocks of their corporations were more or less genera1.ly accepted by the fiDancia1.
communi.tyas part of the emolument.for serring as a corporate officer or d1rector notwithstanding
the flagrantly 1nequitable character of such trading. Partly to cope nth this situation and
partly to inform other stockholders as to the transactions of insiders, Section 16 of the securities ExchangeAct provides that (1) each officer and director of a corporation whose securitiee
are registered, and each beneficial owner of more than ten percent of 8rr¥ class of registered
equity security, shall file with the Comm:1.8sion
and the exchange initial
reports showiDg his
holdings in the company's equity securities and reports tar each 1IIOnt.h thereatter in which

'l:!!/ Sectn"ities

and Exchange Act R~l.ease No. 2718.

-29changes occur in his ho1d1ngs; and (2) profits
obtained by B.n¥ of these persons !'rom transactions cC8p1eted within SU: months in equi.ty securities
of corporations with which they are so
associated may be recovered by the corporation or by any security holders in its behal1'.
The latter provision 1B based on the po1nc1p1e that the confident1al
information
which a COl'porate 1Dsider automatically
obta1ns by T1rtue of his position belongs. in a real sense. to the
corporation,
s1Dce he acqujred. it confident1al1y
in his capacity as an oftic1al
or principal
stockholder
of the corporation.
There 1B DO doubt but that short-term trading by :insiders has
becaE Yer7 mnch less cC1lllllOn than ~01"II!rly.

 31Non-managementstockholders may also have included in the managementts f11XJQ" solicitixlg
material the text of a proper proposal which they intend to submit to the meeting 88 well 88
a briet statement in support of the proposal.
Under this requirement" it is DOlonger possible
for the managementto vote proxies obtained from security holders in opposition to a proposal
of minority security holders" without first affording the body of security holders an 0pportunity to decide 'ilhether the minority proposal should be approved or disapproved.
The Commission's proxy rules under the securities
Exchange Act were first brought ~are
the courts in Securities and Exchange COIIIIDission
v. O'Hara Re-Election CClmIIlittee,28 F. Supp.
523 (D. Mass." 1(39). There the court pre' 3m3 narUi eDjo1ri8d a p~
cCiiliiilitt88from using
. the mails to solicit proxies from stockholders by means of letters
or solicitation 1dUch djd
not cCllDp1y
with the rules promulgated by the cClIIIIIIission
under authority of the statute and frail

exercising

proxies thus obtained at the annual meeting of the corporation.

In another case" im'olving the American Beverage Company"16/ proxy material distriblted
by the managementin connection with an election of directors hi({ falled to disclose tllav the
president" a majority stockholder" had given an option on his stock to a th1rd person with
knotrledge that the holder of the option intended to assume control of the corporation to its
detriment.
The Commissionin an amicus curiae brief" 'IIithout going into the mer1u of the
private lit~ation"
argued that the prox;y material used had not met the di8cloSlU'8 requ1rements
of the COIIIIDissionls
prcac;yrules, and this vieW'1I8S upheld by the lower court, 1Ih1chgave judgment for the plaintiff.
On appeal the judgJDentof the lower court was revers8d without" h0wever, disturbing the ral1.ng as to the disclosure which the CClIIIIDission
deemed to have been required by the prox;y rules.

Recentq" in an election contest between the management and an outside group of stockoholders of Certa1.n-Teed Products Corpcration" the Commission participated in various state and
federal. court suits 1JJstituted by the opposing parties to contend that the management" ~
solicited proxies Wlder the COIIIIIiseion

to elect a board of directors" cou1d DOt properly direct its pro:x;yagents to retrain .from
attending the corpcrate meeting in order to avoid harlDg their proxies counted tor the purpose
ot dete~
whether a quorum existed.
The llt~ation
culminated. in a state court decision
uphol.<l£ngthe Commission's view.
Thereafter, the managementIS prox;y agents a1itended the
adjourned corporat.e meeting" the voting at lIh:ich resulted in the defeat of the managementls
ncminees aDd the elecUon of the directors proposed by the outside g1"Ol1p.

From its experience in reviewing ~
filings, the CCllllDissionhas been able to obtain a
broad vjew of the effect and operation ot 11;21 rules.
For exsup1e, during the tiscal ,.ar ending
June 30, 1944, the statf of the Commissionexmn1ned prEll1m1nary and definitive mater1al with
respect to some 1501 proz:y solicitations.
ot these, 1472 were made by the management or the
corporation and 29 by security holders not connected with management. It is the CClIIIIDission's
concl.usion that the rules have already made a contrib1Ition to a revitalization
of the democratic
process in the conduct of corporate affairs.
The protection received by inveators under 1iheee
rules and the opportunities afforded them for active participation
in the aftairs ot the CCDpany maywell be the occasion for the deve10plllent among stockholders themselves ot the leadersnip necessary for turther advances along these l1De8.

question to duties substantially equivaJ.ent to those which would arise if the security were
duly listed and registered on an exchange. These duties arise frcxJ Sections 13, 14 and 16 of
the Act, deal.ing respective~y w1:thcorporate reports, solicitation of proxies and :insiders'
trading. Section 12 (f) provides further, hc.sver, that such terms and conditions need not be

investors would nevertheless best be served by approval of the application.
At the close of the period covered by"tM.s report unlisted trading privileges had been
granted under Clause 3 to five equity securities, all of them preferred stocks. 31/ At that
t1me six consolidated applications were pending which had been filed by the New TOrkCurb
Exchange. Theywre the t1rst Clause 3 applications to involve commonstocks and they were
opposed by the National Association of securities Dealers, Inc., an association of over-thecounter brokers and dealers registered with the COIIIIIission
under Section 15Aof the Act. On
February 19, 1945, the C<mIIDission
handed dorm an opinion :in which it considered at length the
provisions ot Clause 3. 32/ The opinion concluded that, absent duties substantially equivalent
to those imposedby sectIOns 13, 14 and 16 of the Act, a Clause 3 application could be approved

single application which 1188 approved, that reJ.at1ng to the common
stock of Northern Natural
Gas Company,the Commissionfound that, by virtue of Northern's status as a holding company
registered under the Public utility Holding C<>mpaDy'
Act of 1935, the test cr "substantially
equivalent duties" was completely satisfied except for the prohibition of short sell:ing by
officers, d1rectors and J.o.t stockholders (Section 16 (e» and the :insider trading provisions of
Section 16 generally as to 10% stockholders (as distinct fran officers and directors).
Northern's only ~O% stockholder was itself a registered holding company,all of whose sales,
short or othend.se, were BUbject to the Ho1d:ingCompany
Act, and compliance with the prohibition
against short sales was 1mposedupon the officers and directors of Northern by a condition in
the Commission'sorder. As to the other five applications the Commissionfound that there was
failure to meet the test of "substantially equivalent duties" to a greater or lesser degree and
that the Exchangehad not made out a sut.f1ciently exceptional case to justify waiver of the
requirements.
As of June 30, 1944, the numberof stock issues admitted to unlisted trading on the several
national securities exchanges under Clause 1 was 908 and the numberof bond issues so admitted
was 173. Of these, the I1UIIIber
of stock issues not listed and registered on any other national
securities exchangewas 453, and the numberof bond issues was 151, comprising respectively
382,436,.309shares and $1,357,978,046 principal. amount of bonds. About 80.4 percent of the 453
issues and 8L9 percent of the shares were traded only on the NewYork Curb Exchange; 3.3
percent of the issues and 8.5 percent of the shares were trarled on this and other registered
exchanges; and the remaining 16.3 percent of the issues and 9.7 percent of the shares were
traded o~ on the other registered exchanges. All of the 151 bond issues, with the exception
of 4 small issues, were traded only on the NewYork Curb Exchange. Canadian stocks and American depositary receipts tor foreign stocks comprised 105 ot the 453 issues and about 37 percent
of the shares) nearly all such stockB are listed and have their principal markets on Canadian
or British stock exchanges. A few of the issues are those of' companieshaving other issues
listed on registered exchanges.
The reduction, since June 30, 1937, in unregistered securities admitted to trad:ing privil.eges under Clause 1 bas been substantial" amountingto 284 stock and 399 bond issues. This has
occurred partly through the dissolution of several stock exchanges and partly through reorganizations, recapitalizations and consolidations ot issuers.

THE SEGREGATION STUDY
Pursuant to section 11 (e) of the securities Exchange Act ot 1934, the COIIIIII1Bsion
conducted
a study ot and prepared a report to the Congress on the teasibility
and advisability
of the
complete ~!~gation
of the fUDctions _ot dealer and broker-tbe
eo-called -segregation

Through the med1U11l
of special report torms which the CCIIIID18sion
devised tor the purpose,
detailed analyses were II8de of the trading activities
of members and partners of membersof the
HewYork stock Exchange and the HeIr York Curb Exchange during the period fran June 24, 1935 to
December21, 1935. S1Jpplemental information with respect to trading practices on other

-40In the developaent of the program, the C0aai8sion 1D8tltuted a series of weekly reports,
begjJming with the week ended April 4, 1936, on the voluM of tradiDg in stocks by excbange
members. Through the cooperation of the NewYork stock Exchange and the NewYork Curb Exchanp,
reports were turn1shed weekly of the daily volume of all parchues and sales made for their CJml
account by specialists,
odd-lot dealers and by other JIIlIIIberslIhUe on the noor and wbll8 ott
the noor.
This series alao provided, tor the first time, figures on the total round-lot
leu-thanvolume ot trading in stocka on the two exchanges as d1atiDgaiahed from the 8OIII8What
complete volume reported by the tickers.
Beginning with the week ended september 9, 1939, tor
the NewYork stock Exchange and Januar;r 13, 1940, for the NewYork CUrb Exchange, t1gures on
the total short sales ot stocks, except sales exempted from restriction
by the C9JmD1ss1.on's
rules, were added to 'this series of published data.
As another part; of the program and to further the CClIIIIIII1ssion'
s policy of affording the
ot their own JII8JIben,
exchanges an opportunity to cooperate in regulatblg the trad1ng activities
the COIIIIDiasion
in February 1937 sent to all national securities exchanges a series of suggested
rules des1gned to put into effect the recODllll8Ddation
of the nSegregation Report" that trading by
membersof the exchange and firms and their part;ners be fu11.y margined at all ~s.
In
_
essence, the rules require Dl8Dlbersof the exchange to deposit at the close of each trading dq
an amount which wou1drepresent su.ff1cient margin, under the tel'Jl1l!l of the Federal Reserve
Board's Regulation T, for the marh". position taken by the memberduring the trading dq.
In lIarch 1937, the Comm:1ss1on
acted to effectuate another of the proposals contained in
the segregation Report concem1ng membertrading.
Tb1s took the form of an interpretation
by
the Director of the Trading and Exchange Division of the specUllst rule adopted in 1935 on the
recQDlllendationof the CODIIiasionby all exchanges having a specialist system. The interpretation BOUghtto makemore 8pec1f1c the general lUIitations 1Ib1chhad been placed upon
speeiaJ.ists' tradiDg by the earlier rule.

STABILIZATION AND JlANIPULATION
Sections 9, 10, and 15 of the Securities E:lcbange Act of 1934 prohibit or empowerthe COIIlmission to prohibit manipulation and to regulate manipulative devices. Section 9 of this .lct
prohibits certain specifically described. t01'llB ot manipulative activity.
Transactions which
create actual or apparent tradiDg activity or 1Ih1ch ra1ae or lower prices, if they are effected
for the purpose of :inducing others to blQ' or sell, are declared to be unlawtuJ..
certain
practices designated as "wash sales' and "matched orders" effecte4 tor the purpose ot creating
a false or misleading appearance of active trading or a false or misleading appearance with
respect to the market for a security are declared to be illegal.
Persons selling or offering
securities for sale are prohibited from d18seminat1ng fuse information to the effect that the
price of the security will, or is likeq to, rise or tall because of market operations
conducted for the purpose of ra1BiDg or depressing the prices of a secur1 ty. Persons selling
or purchasing securities are prohibited from. making false or misleading stateusnts of material.
facts, with lmowledge of their falaity, regarding securities for the purpose of 1nducUlg the
purchase 'Jr sale of such securities.
sections 10 and 15 empowerthe Commissionto adopt rules
and regulations to define and prohibit the use of new forms of manipulation which the CCIIlIIII1asion
might encounter from t1me to t1me. Honver, there is one type of activity, c~
reterred to
as "stabilizing," which is not prohibited ~
 .!! by the Securities Exchange .lct but is left to
regulation by the COJIIlIiss1on.
Pursuant to statuto17 authority, the Commissionhas adopted rules and regulations to aid it
in carr;y113gwt the expressed 1dll of Congress. The three above-mentioned sections, as augmented by rules and regulations, attt8pt; to free the security markets from artificial
1Dtluence.,
thus 1n8uring the ma:1ntenanceof fair aDd. honest mar1c8tsand allow1ng prices to be eBtabU8bed

charged. The case was remandedin order that the Commissionmight determine, in its discretion,
whether its order should be modified. After reconsidering, the Commissionagain ordered
Wright's expulsion from the various exchanges on which he held membership, and the order was
subsequently affirmed on a second appeal.

!!E/

During the years of the Commission
I s operation,
the Commissionand its staff have rendered
formal and informal opinions regarding the anti-manipulative provisions which have aided in the
elimination of artificial
and fictitious
forces responsible for excessive market activity and
umrarranted price changes. It is believed that the Commission'svigilance, together nth this
gradual process of education of persons 1nvolved in security deal1ngs, has effectively curbed
pool operations and large-scale manipulations.
During the period between July 1, 1934 and June 30, 1944, the Commission's staff conducted
1,137 "flying quizzes." In a large numberof cases, manipulations were "nipped in the bud" and
in many' cases references of the activities were made to the Department of Justice or to the
exchanges 'Wheresuch securities were traded. During this sameperiod, the Commissioncommenced
166 formal. :investigations resu1ting in many instances in injunctions, jail sentences, and suspensions from activities as security dealers.
One of the outstanding cases in which the Commissionsought an injunction to restrain
persons from violating various provisions of the Securities Exchange Act involved the dealings
of the firm of Torr & Co. in the stock of the Translux Daylight Picture Screen Corp. listed on
the NewYork CUrb Exchange. The Commissionsued to enjoin the secondary distribution of that
a,tock on the exchange on the ground that the defendants had employedmanipulative practices to
%raisethe market price of the stock to a point at which it might profitably be distributed to
the puplic and bad employedtipsters to reconunendthe purchase of the stock without disclosing
their .;inancial interest.
The District Court sustained the constitutionality
of the antimanipuhtive prov1si.ons of the Act as a v&lid exercise of the federal power and issued a
preliJn1nary injunction.

On appeal, the second Circuit Court set aside the preliminary injunction issued by the
District Court on the ground that, although the defendants had not halted their practices until
after the CCIIIIll1ssis>Ji's
investigations had begun, they had stopped before the hearing on the
preliminary 1njuDction, and it did not appear that there was s.rry likelihood of renewed violation in the fUture. !if! However,following the hearing on the merits before the Dist~ct Court,
a permanent injuDct10n was granted which the dei'endants accepted without further appeal.

!J3/

The problem raised by the Torr and several other early cases arising under the Securities
EltchangeAct of 1934 and the SecurIties Act of 1933 as well, as to whether and under what eucumstances the Commissionis entitled to an injunction on the basis of evidence as to violations
which have ceased before the fUing of the complaint, was considered by the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the S1xt;hCircuit in otis & Co. v. Securities and ExchangeC01!Dllission.In that case
the Court of Appeals held that the trIal court did not lack authority to issue an injunction
merely because the defendant had discontinued the prohibited activity before the Commission
brought suit, since, as the court observed:

aA dealer who smr the challenge of his activities that is implied in an investigation
lfOuld probably discontiJ:lue them pending the investigation.
It would seldom, if ever,
be possible to show that a dealer was engaged.in or about to engage in prohibited
acts or practices when suit began, since the necessary investigation
aJJrays have 'WBrD8d the dealer to desist.. 43/

-43Although the Securities Exclumge Act contains a general prohibition against manipulation,
it does not prohibit certam lc:iJlds of manipulation. Thus, Section 9 (a) (6) forbids the
"pegging, f:ixi.ng or stabilizingll of security prices 0%JJ.y if in contravention of such rules and
regulations as the COIIIIIIission
mayprescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest

The Senate Committee on BaDk:1ng and Currency in discussing
the regulatory powers conferred on the Commi.ssionstated a

In November1943, in order to assist underwriters and distributors of securities to adhere to the provisions of the Securities ExchangeAct, two releases were issued by the Trading

The Releases have had a salutary effect in providing the securities !Dd1lst17

OVER-THE-COUNTER REGULATION
The Orlginal statutory Provisions and Their Adm1D1stration
As orig1nally enacted, section 15 or the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934, dea11ng with the
C01IIIII18sion'8
poer to regulate the -over-the-ccnmter markets, was couched in the most general
and broadest terms.
It stated.

alt shall be unlawful, in oontravention of such rules and regulations as 'the Commiseion
mayprescribe as nece8S8.17or appropriate in the public interest and to insure to
investors protection comparable to that provided by and under authority of this title
in the case of national Securi.tie8 exehanges, (1) for an;r broker or dealer, singly or
with any other person or persons, to make use of the malls or arry means or instrumentality of iJxterstate cOlllll81"Ce
for the purpose of making or creating, or enabling
another to make or create a market, otherwise than on a national securities exebange,
for both the purchase and sale of any security (other than an exemptedsecurity or
cOlDlll8rCial
paper, bankers' acceptances, or CQIIIIl8rCial bills, or unregistered securitis s the market in which is predomi nantl;y intrastate and which have not previously
been registered or l1sted), or (2) for aIq' broker or dealer to use any facility of an;r
such market. Such rales and regalati0D8 fDIq' proride for the r~tion
of all transactions by brokers and dealers on any such marDt, tor the registration with the C~
mission of dealers and/or brokers ma1dJJg or creating such a market, and for the
registration of the securities tor which the;y makeor create a market am mq make
special provision with respect to securities or specif"ied classes thereof listed, or
entitled to unlisted trading privileges. upon any exchange on the date of the enactment of this title, which securities are not registered under the provisions of
section 12 of this title."
In contrast to other areas in which the CODID1ssion
cClllllSnced
its administrative duties in
June 1934, there were little or no reliable data concerning the scope or nature ot the abuses
to which the directives of Section 15 of the Securities ExchslIgeAct of 1934 were intended to
apply. The long legislative history of the Securities Act of 1933 provided a rich source ot
information concerning the practices of underwriters and the evils encounterecl in connection
tdth public offerings of new securities.
The hearings betore COIIIIII1tte~
of Congress and the
Committeereports on bills to ~gulate securities markets, resulting in 'the enactmeul;of the
securities ExchangeAct, con:lia1neda wealth of basic data concerning the practices and abuses
1Ihich had perD:lated the exehaDgemarkets during the preceding decade. But, as to over-the.
counter markets, the legislative history ot the securities ExchangeAct y:lslds l1ttJe iDtormation and sheds little light on the directifts of Section 15 relating to over-the-counter regulation, beyond the obvious facts that unique opportunities tor abuse existed in that market aDd
that regulation ot exchange markets made necessary the regulation ot couut.er markets, since
bus1Des8tends to now fraa regulated to uuregulated areas.

Exchange Act

It 1dll be recalled that Section 15 or the securities Exchange Act of 1934 as origina1ly
to adopt rules and regulations p1'OV1ding for
enacted speci.f:l.cally author:lsed the CClIlIDi8sion
the registration
of securities for which over-the-counter dealers made or created. •
 market.
I..l:though the COIIIDi.ssion
recognized from the beginning that registration
of over-the-counter
securiti.es Wjl8 extremely desirable, i.t rea1iZed that such registration
involved vastly greater
difficulties
than the registration
of ove:t-the-eounter brokers and dealers.
This problem was discussed at length by the CClllllissionin its "Report on Trading in
securities upon Exchangesll, transmitted to Congress on January 3, 1936, pursuant; to
Section 12 (f) of the securities Exchange Act of 19)4. In that report a J1UIIber of suggestions
were considered for achieving the registration of' securities which were traded exclusively in
the OV8:t-the-eoUIIlier
market as well as those which were admitted to unlisted trading privileges
upon certain national securities exchanges. The COJIIIIission
did not rec<:JllDlend any of these
suggestions as the solution f'or the problem. It presented them to Congress in the hope that
public discussion thereof would make judgDent as to the desirability
of the various suggestions,
both by Congress and the COlIlIIIission,
more certain.
Following the JMld ng of' this report Congress
adopted one of the suggestions contained therein by enacting Section 15 (d) of' the securities
.Exchange,Act of' 1934 which provides in part:
UDlisted

llEach registration
statement hereafter f'i1ed pursuant, to the securities Act of 1933, as
amended,shall contain an underta.lrilJg by the issuer of the issUe of securities to 'Which
the registration
statement relates to file with the COJIIIIission,in accordance with such
rules and regulations as the COIIIIIIi88ion
may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in
the public interest or f'or the protection of investors, such supp1eIIIentary and periodic
information, documents, and reports, as may be required pursuant to section 13 of this
titlB in respect of' a security 1:iBted and registered on a national securities exchange;
but such UDdertaldng shall becaDe operatiTe only if the aggregate of'feriDg price of'
such issue of securities,
plus the aggregate value of all other securi"ties of such
issuer of the same class (as hereina.ft;er defined) outstanding, canpu.ted upon the basis
of such offering price, amounts to $2,000,000 or more."
The provisions of' this section have served to make available to investors periodic information concerning JII8.Dy issuers of securities 'Whohave registered under the Securities Act of 1933.
Nevertheless there are JII8IIY securities now dealt in in the DVe:t-the-eounter market concerning
lIhi.ch very little
public information is available 8IJ3'Wbere. Moreover, there is substantial
evidence that the DDIIlber
as well as the importance of unregistered securities dealt in in the
ove:t-tbe-eounter market has increased in recent ~ars.
The problem of obtaining adequate information on cmn-the-courrt.er securities is being actively considered by the CClIIIIDission.

At the same ~
that it adopted section 15 (d) ~ the securit:les Exchange Act, the 74th

of subsection (c) 1Ihich makes unlawfu1, in over-the-counter transacdefinite by the 8D8C~
tions, the use of manipulatiw, deceptive, and other :fraudulent devices and contrivances, and
grants to the CCIIIIIi8sioD
the authority to de.f1De such devices and contrivances.
While the
criterion of affording to iJNestars in these JBBrkets protection caaparable to that provided in

pbysical.1;y frClm the Act, the hiator,y of subsequent 8DlBndD8nts to
section 15 shan that it 1188 the intent of Cougresa that this etandard should DBVertheless be

Two years later, section 15 (c) of the securities
Exchange Act 1188 amended.
The 81118Dd11e
extended the COIIIIII1Ba1onI
s ponrs 80 that it was not ~
empowered to def'ine and prohibit acts
of :fraud and deceit in the over-th&-Couuter markBts but was also emponred to prescribe means
reaso~
designed to prevent such acts, except it exempted securit1as 1I8re 1m'OJ.ved.
The
ro1.e-tDa1dng pClII'erof the ca.i8s1on was also mended to afford protection against fictitious
quotations and safeguards with respect to .t1DanciaJ. responsibility
of over-the-counter brokers
and dealers.

The decline in the DlJIIIber ot inspections in 1943 and 1944 is due largely to limited
personnel aud to the II88d to shift 1nspection personnel to the exami nation or reports of
fiDancial condition filed under Rule X-l?A-5 during each of the last two fiscal. years.

It is worth noting that on only three occasions bas it been necessary' to institute
in United states Di8tr1ct Court tor mandator,- injunctions to compel firms to make their
and recorda available.
In each case consent judgments were obtained.

Doug the most serious violations ot l.a1r discovered in the course of 1nspections are cases
invo1-dDg the 8ale of securities by dea1ers to customers at prices 1Ih1chbear DO reasonable
The doctrine that it is f'raudul.ent tar a dealer to
rel.ation to the prevailing market. price.
sell securities to custoJDers at prices bearing no reasonable relation to the preva1li:cg market.,
without disclos1ng the market, was first established in a proceeding in which the registration
ot Duker &: Duker was revoked;
in a 10ng series ot subsequent proceedings invo1v1ng s1m1l.ar
business conduct, the CamD1ssiOn
has reiterated and c1.ar1f'ied the law in such cases. ixJl In
substance, the holding ot the CCIIIIII1ssion
is that spec1a1 obligations upon the deal.er ?row f'ran
certa1n 1Dherent characteristics
ot the business ot dealing in securities.
The deal.er holds

He cu1tivates his custaDer's trust and confidence in hill and invites
rel.1aDce 011 biB 8k1ll and honesty. That there is an inherent representation that he will dea1
:tairly is plain f'rcm the con1'1dentia1 relationship which he establishes,
and the very price at
which be se11s or buys a security, in the absence of express representation to the contrary,
carries with it the implied representation that the price is close1y related to the current
I118rket. The duties ot the dealer, under such circumstances, are not to be measured by the s..
zUl.eB which aw17 to 8l1Il'IS 1ength bargaining; he is b01md to higher staDdard8 because ot the
UD1que position which he occupies.

This ri8w ot the doctrine ot .fraud has bean applied ch1etly in cases invo1ving trandn] ant

but nth some lIIOd1f'icationsit 11'88 a1so applied in a revocation

membershipin the HASD. 0Il:q two of these orders have been taken to a Circuit Court of Appeals
for review, and in each case the Commission's order has been affirmed. ~

Co.,

The most significant case was an appeal. by' Charles Hughes &
Inc., from a Commission
order revoldDg its registration for violating the securities ExchangeAct. In this case, the
COJIIIIi8sion'
s application of the fraud doctrine to sal.e8 of securities at prices bearing no
reasonable relat1.on to current, market prices 1188 subjected to jud1.cial review for the f'irst
time. 63/ The Conwrh's1.on had tound that this finl had viol.ated the fraud provisions of the
Securitres Act and the Securities ExchangeAct in its dealings nth certain lIOJIml customers to
whomit had 8Ol.d securities at prices from 16.1 percent to 40.9 percent in excess of the prevailing market, withoUt.disclosing the prevailing market prices to them. In i1;&opinion the
Camn1ssionsaid:
"In the eett1ng in:which

respondent effected

the toregoing

and other transact1.ons

'Withthese customers, the approach and entire conduct ot respondent were intended
to induce an atlllosphere of trust and confidence, of lIhicb the respondent took
gross

advantage

••••

"Fundamental
to the issue before us is the premise that any person, regardless of
his kno1rledgeor the market or his access to -.rket information, is entitled to
rely on the 1mpl:1ed representation, made by" a reg1.stered dea1er in securities,
that customers will be treated fairly. n
The Circuit court sustained the Commission's order on an independent interpretation
ot the
statutes and the ea-1asion's
rules.
In reaching i1;&conclusion, the Court did not have recourse to the doctrine that the consistent and contemporaneousconstruction of the statute by
an administrative body'should control unless plainly erroneous. In its opinion the Court said:
"An ovel'-tbe-eounter firm which activel:y sol1cits customers and then sells them
securities at prices as far above the market as were those 1Ihich petitioner
charged here JIII18t be deemed to commita fraud.
It holds itself out, as competent
to advise in the premises, and it should disclose the market price if sales are to

1

.'i'

be made substantially above that level.
Even considering petitioner as a principa1 in a simple vendor-purchaser transaction ••• it was stlll un4er a speciAl. duty,
in view of its expert knoIrledge and preferred advice, not to take advantage of i1;&
custanera' ignol"llDll$ of market conditiona. The key to the success of a1.l of petitioner's dealings 1IU the confidence in itself which it managed to instlll in the
customers. Once that confidence was established, the failure to reveal the markup pocketed by" the firm was both an omission to state a material fact and a
fraudulent derlce. Whennothing was said about markst price, the natural implication in the untutored minds or the purchasers was that the price asked was close to
the market. The la1r of :h-aud knows no difference between express representatiol1 on
the one hand am implied misrepresentation or concealment on the other ••••

"

Concluding that the Commissionhad "correctly iJIterpreted its responsibilities
to stop such
abusive practices in the sa1.e of securities,the Court placed special. emphasis on the 1mpol'tance of price in securities transactions.

@ The

Commissionbecame a party in other litigation,
however, brought by GuarantY' Underwriters, Inc., in an attempt to stop hearings in the proceedings instituted under section 15
in August 1942 against that companyto deterud.ne whether its broker-dealer registration
should be revoked and whether the firm should be BUBPended
or expelled :from membershipin
the NASD. This litigation,

On Novaber 27, 1933, the President of the United states, ectiDg pursuant to the prov1s1ons ot the Ilati.oDal Indu8tr1al Recovery Act, awroved a Code ot Fa1r ~t1UOD
tor
investJll8IIt baDkere.
'fbi8 code embraced al1 brola!trs and dealers who transected
business in the
over-the-counter
II8l'ket. By an ameDdDmt to the Code approved by the President on :March 23,
1934, certain rules ot fair practice became a part thereof. After the National 1Ddustr1.al
of the inRecovery Act was declared uncoostituticmal. in the spring ot 1935, representatives
dustry discussed with the CoaD1ssion the f'easibllity- of a new organization
of over-the-counter

sought to be attained by
the Code of Fair Cgapetit10n by regul.at1.Dg brokars and dealers
in a manner oamparab1e to the

On J8DI181"T 5, 1938, the late senator ValOlMlT :introdIIced 1J1 the senate a bill, join~

 S4The major portion of the NASD'sactivities
has been devoted to raising the business
standards of over-the-counter brokers and dealers.
In that connection" the NASD
adopted Rules
of Fair Practice which" amongother things" prohibited certain unfair and fraudulent acts and
required various disclosures under certain circumstances. In general" the fraud and disclosure

To enforce its Rules of Fair Practice" the NASD
has put into operation a method providing
for the annual questionnaire examination of the business practices of each of its members. By
the close of the fiscal year" this program had resulted in the institution
of more than 330
formal disciplinary complaints against members"the majority of which were concluded by the
imposition of a penalty such as censure; fine" suspension or expulsion from the membership. A

Another phase of the NASD'swork has been devising a Uni!onn Practice Code designed to
eJ.:indllate disputes and misunderstandings bet1reen members. For the most part the Code gave
sanction to practice" custom and usage in technical matters such as deliveries of securities"
computation of interest" claims for dividends or interest and simiJ.ar matters.
Early in its history the Association concerned itself with the development of uniform
methods for the compilation of over-the-counter quotations for newspaper publication which
theretofore had been handled in different ways in each locality.
The Commissionhas had recent
occasion to study and cr~cize
the I1Ethodsemployedby the Association in this field and has
advised the Association that" in its opinion" improvement in the character of such quotations
is both desirable and necessary.
Discussions between the Commission's staff and the Association' 5 National Quotation Committeewere in progress at the close of the tuca! year.

broker to buy the ward LaFrance shares in the over-the-counter markBt for WardLaFrance' 8
account. Shares were obtained £rom the company'8 stockholders at prices ranging £rom approximately
to t6 a share. None of the stockholders who soJ.d their shares was advised that Ward
LaFrance was the ultimate buyer. Nor were they told of the negotiations to sell the controlling
shares at approx:iJllately $45 a share, or of the proposal to liquidate Ward LaFrance at a figure
which lfOUldgive shareholders $25 a share on liquidation.
AlBowithheld from them 1I'8S the fact
that the company's earnings had improved since the last pnbJ 1sbed statement from $2.75 to
$15.75 a share.

There 1I'8S a clear necessity for the issuer and those in control to make timely and
adequate disclosure of these facts.
The Commissionstated that the purchase of securities
under such circumstances unaccompanied by appropriate disclosure constituted a violation of
Rule X-lOB-S.

Whenthe C~sion
brought these facts to the attention of the parties involved, arrangements were madeto pq the stockholders who had sold their shares the difference between
$35.98 per share and the price they had received in selling their shares. Such payments
amounted to approximately $165,000.
While this is the only case aris1.ng under Rule X-lOB-5 in which the CommissiQnhas issued
a public release, others have occurred and the number of alleged violations is increasing.
llthough the Commissiontook no action in several such cases when rescission 1I'8S extended
shareholders by the violators of the rule, the need for more drastic action to prevent violatiOns of this type is becoming i.ncreas1Dgly apparent.

 59The realization" by banking" engineering and promotional interests of the variety and
magnitude of the ..available gains and emolumentsof contro~ led to a race for the acquisition of
utility properties, in the course of which prices were driven up to fantastic leve~. 2/ Holding cClllpanyexpansion was stimulated in maJ:V instances" on the cme:hand by investment bankers
whowere eager for ccmnissions and profi-ts in the sal.e of securities" and on the other by holding cClllpanypromoters who desired to increase the sources fram which they collected fees for
managementand engineering serrlces.
It has been estimated that, from 1924-1930" utility holding companies noated some $5 billions of securities" the great bulk of which went not to build
or 1mproveutility properties" but to purchase aJ.ready outstanding voting securities of operating utility caupanies.
Part of the to~
represented the securities issued by super holding
cOllIpanies"such as the United Corporation" which was organized in 1929 by J. P. Morgan& Co.,
Drexel & Co." and Bonbright &: Canpany"Incorporated.

'J/

By 1932, according to the data presented by the Federal Trade Commission"the holding companies had obtained control of the great bulk of the electric and gas utili ties of the country.
Of the electric power produced (privately owned plants) in the United states in 1932, the
operating companies controlled by the eight largest utility holding companysystems generated
72.7%. Of the national production of manufactured and natural gas, the holding companysystems
accounted for 66.4% and 25.3%" respectively.
Of the trunk line mileage ot natural gas pipe line,
four bolding companies controlled 56.3% and 15 holding companies controlled 80.3%. !tI

Among the subsidiaries in the holding companysystems were .companies engaged in one or more
of a variety of enterprises--coal mining" production, refining, and transportation of 011; wood,
coal and oU retailing; foundries; textilis;
farming" irrigation" orchards; taxicabs; ice and
cold storage; tOIling and lighterage; real. estate, finance and credit" water, street rail.ways"
railroads" bus transportation" and te~ephone canpanies. Obviously the reasons for p~ing such
heterogeneous collections of enterprises under a camnoncontro~ did not have to do with functional interdependence or witb operatiilg economies.
The scramble of rival. bolding companysystems to acquire loc~ operating utilities
also
impeded the deve~opmentof integrated systems. In this connection" the Nation~ Power Policy
Camoittee

found:

"The grOlfth of the bolding cCllllp8Uy
systems has frequently been primarily dictated by
promoters I dreams of far-nung power and bankersl schemes for security profits" and has
often been attained with the great waste and disragard of public benefit which might be.
a:pected from such motives. Whole strings of companies with no partic~
reation to"
aDd often esBeilti~
unconnected.nth, units in an exiSting system have been absorbed
frail t1me to time. The prices pa:id for additional units not only have been based upon inflated values but £requentlJ" have been run up out of reason by the rivalry of contending
systems. Because this growth has been actuated primarily by a desire for size and the
ponr inherent in sue" the controll.ing groups have in many instances done no more than
pq lip service to the principle of b1J11d1ngup a system as an integrated and econom1c
whole" lIhich might bring actuaJ. benefits to i-ts canpcment parts from reated operations
aDd unified management. InsUwl" they have too tZ9quently given us massive" overcapitalized organizations of eur-increasing
complexity and Bte~

of investment and these devices are 1:1kerlse reponsible for many of the present .financial di.f.ficulties of holding ccmpanysystems. These cClllplexovercapitalized structures resulted
in huge losses to American investors and the bankruptcy of many holding companySYstems.

Write-ups were sometimes based on appraisals made by' closely at.filiated
interests,
frequently on sketchy evidence. Very few of them were subject to any check by' governmental
8l1thority. They were usually based on an est:imate of what it would cost to reproduce the pr0perty. That application of the doctrine Of~
v. .Ameshas cost American investors many
mUlions 0.1" dollars.
In the first place,
v • .Ameswas not authority tor the consideration
of reproduction cost in anything except ra: e cases, and in the second place, even in a rate
case, it was but one of several elements to be weighed. Write-ups alone, or excessively
pyramided structures al.CQ8, were highly dangerous .financial practices,
but their canbination
could have no other eftect thaD catutrophe.
The -t,pic&l holding c<llllp8Di1.~
consists of pyramids ot cClllpani.es, as well as of wram1d8
of.. aecur1.ties within a cClllpaDy,~ all X'eBting chiefly on the CCllllllOD stocks ot operating COlDpanies. The pyramids are held together by'the stock of the top holding c~.
'!be debt securities and preferred stock of the systems are held by' 'the public.
This technique aftorded a
JII8X1mn1D area of economic control. with a minimum
of investment.

Y

The pyramiding device resulted in the highly 8P8Culative quality attached to the holding
caupany securities through "leverage" known as "trading on the equity" or lithe lilting power of
other people' s money'I. ABa result ot leverage small changes in the earnings of the underlying
cc.paniea beccae Jlago1tied into large changes in the earnings applicabl.e to holding cCllllpaDiY
securities} during the 1929 bocm, the profits thu8 appeared to be huge but 'Whenthe bocm co1lapeed, leverage worked in reverse and III8IJY holding cCIIlpaniesand their subsidiaries were forced
to detault on their obligations and to cease dividend payments to stockholders.
The cClllplex
capital structure al.so aftorded many opportunities for the manipulation o£ accounts and finances,
and tor diversion of pro.fits or l.osses through iDtercClllp8D;Y
channels, to the detriJDent ot inveetora and or the public.
The corporate pyramids had the turther etfect of enabling holding

the standards of Section II (b). To a ~

large extent, Section ll'results
in the Holding ComP8D1'Act being self-liquidating,
for, as utility companiesare freed from holding companycantrol, the Commissiongenerallly loses jurisdiction over them under this Act.
The problem of conformingthe electric and gas utility holding companiesto the requirements
of Section II (b) is a task of great magnitude. Progress under Section II was slow in getting
underway. Although the statute was enacted by Congt"essin August 1935, the Cormnissionwas
directed to enforce the integt"ation and simplification provisions only ". • • as soon as practicable after January I, 1938." In the intervening period holding companieswere given an opportunity to take voluntary steps to complywith Section ll.
However,the companiesdid not avail
themselves of that opportunity but chose instead to test the constitutionality
of the Act. After
of the registrarthe decision of the SupremeCourt in Ilarch 1938 upholding the constitutionality
tion provisions, the COIIIIIliss.1on
gave all holding companiesa further opportunity to ~t
to
the COIIlIII:ission
their plans for voluntary compliance. Theyresponded to the Commissi-on'sinvitartion by submitting tentative plans which on examination were clearly impractical and not in
conformity with the statute.
In general their plans amountedto little
more t..hanattempts to
justify the retention of existing scattered holdings.

It thus becameclear to the Commissionthat compliancewith the Act could be achieved only
by the institution
of affirmative proceedings, pursuant to the statutory direction in Section
II (b). Accordingly in the spring of 1940, the Canmissioninstituted integt"ation proceedings
with respect to nine major utility helding companysystems and corporate simplification proceedings nth respect to three major systems. The two classefl of proceedings are interrelated,
since action taken to cauply nth the geogt"aphicalstandards mayalso .facilitate corporate
simplification, and steps taken in the direction of corporate simplification may serve to
eliminate substantial problems which would otherwise require determination in proceedings under
Section II (b) (i),
Onceproceedings under Section II are instituted by the COIIIIIlission
(or are initiated by the
filing of a volUD'haryplan), full hearings are held in which all interested parties are given
the opportunity to present evidence and voice their views be.fore the COIIIIlission. On the basis
of the record before it and the contentions madeas to the applicability of the la1r to the facts,
the Comission issues its findings and opinion and order. All such orders are subject to .f'ul1
judicial review in the federal courts.
The CCllllllission'
s decisions to date under Section II (b) have clarified most of the improblems which arose under that section. In the ColumbiaGas & Electric
Corporation 87 and The United Gas Improvement~

cases, the cc:mnissionheld that gas and
electric ut1t1ty cOlllpaniescannot be considered8S0gether
constituting a -single integrated
public-utility
system" nthin the meaningof the Act. Thus a holding companymust satisfy the
requirements prescribed by Congress for the retentian o.f additional systems it it desires to
retain both an electric and gas utility system.

In a subsequent case, En~S
Public Service Companyand its Subsidiarz Companies,10/
the Ccmnission's opinion settle<1e
most important interpretative issue arising UDderSectron
II (b) (1). The caDp8D1'
had contended that it was not precluded UDderclause (b) of Section
II (b) (I) .fromhaving one integt"ated system in Virginia and states adjoining Virginia, and
another in Texas and states adJoining Texas. Intel'l>reting clause (B) in the light of its
legislative histar;y, and in the light of other provisions of the statute, the CClIIIIIIission
concluded that additional systems are retainable under clause (B) only it they are located in the
state or states in which the principal system operatea or in states adjoining thereto.

In addition to the divestment o:r companies, as such, the tables shovrthat 78 other subsidiary companies have sold parts of their electric,
gas and non-utility properties for a total consideration of $92,000,000. The greater part o:r these properties are no longer subject to the
Act.

Reference is made to Appendix Table 18 which lists the subsidiary utility and non-utility
companies~ the control o:r which must be divested by their respective parents under Section
11 (b) (1) orders outstanding as o:r June 30, 1944. By virtue of these orders, 17 holding canpanies must divest themselves of their control over 196 subsidiary cCtllpanieshaving aggregate
total assets of $3,887,000,000.
In a number o:r holding companysystems, there are holding companies lIhich are merely
pyramiding devices and perform no useful function.
Many o:r these have already been ordered
dissolved after appropriate Section 11 (b) (2) proceedings. Table 19 in the Appendix lists the
holding companies which havB been ordered to dissolve or liquidate under Section 11 (b) (2)
orders outstanding as of June 30, 1944. The tabulation includes 14 holding companies and shows
that 11 of these companies have 229 utility or non-utility subsidiaries with total assets of
approximately $3,946,000,000.
The

Carrying Out of Section 11 Orders

Section 11 (c) provides that all orders o:r the Commissionunder Section 11 (b) should be
complied with lfithin one year except that an additional year may be obtained upon a showing o:r
due diligence.
If tJ1e companydoes not voluntarily comply with the order, the Commissionis
empoweredunder Section 11 (d) to seele the aid of a United States District Court to enforce the
order. Under Section 11 (d) the Court may take jurisdiction
and possession of the companyand
its assets, may appoint a trustee, and may enforce a plan to meet the Section 11 (b) order, 1!'
the plan has been approved by the Commission.
It was Congroesst intention, however, to encourage the various" holding companysystems to
comply with the Act voluntarily.
For this reason Section 11 (e) provides that a companymay
:rile a voluntary plan with the Commission, that the Commissionshall approve the plan, after
a public hearing in which investors are encouraged to voice their views, i:r the plan is found
necessary to effectuate Section llr (b) and fair and equitable to the affected persons, and that
on the request of the compa!JY
the Commissionmay seek enforcement of the plan in the courts.
The courts are required to enforce section 11 (e) plans if they are found appropriate to effectuate Section 11 (b). and fair SlId equitable.
Thus, security holders have the protection o:r
findings as to the fairness and equity of plans by both the COIIIIIIission
and a United States District Court.
llany plans for complete or partial compliance 1I1th Section 11 have already been approved
the COII'IDdssion
and have been or are being CODSUJIIIIated.
Ya1:Jy JDQresystems have fUed plans
which are currently being considered by the C<DD1ssion,and a number of other holding companies
are discussing with the CCIIIII1ssion'sstaff drafts of plans which they have prepared. The fUing, approval, and consummationof these plans represent major achievements in the financial
and operating reorganization of 'the American utility industry.

approved .4B of these plans" frequently after securing necessary modif'ica11 (e). The CClJJllli.ssion
tions; 19 were withdrawn or dismissed" 3 were denied" and 45 were pending before the Commission
in various stages of completion. In addition a great number of steps have been taken to meet the
standards of Section II nthout the filing of Section 11 (e) plans. Thus" tor example" in certain cases there have been divestments by holding companies of underlying securities without
the filing of Section 11 (e) plans to effectuate the divestment.

In SC1118 cases where Section 11 (e) plans have been approved by the Commission, the companies are unable to carry them out without obtaining a court order. The Act permits the COIIIDission
at the request of the companies to go to court for the purpose of obtaining enforcement of such
plans. court orders have been entered enforcing Section 11 (e) plans tiled by COIIIIIUnity

As has been said, security holders are not required to accept Section 11 (e) plans unless
they are f'omxi fair and equitable by both the Oommissionand a United States District Court. In
determining whether plans -are fair and equitable the Commissionhas sought to entorce the intent
of Congress that Section 11 should not have the effect of destroying values for arry security
holder;, that it should not cause any portion of the legitimate investment interest of any security holder to be given to another. Two principal types of cases in which this problem has been
before the Commissionare those involving the relative rights of preferred and caumon.stockholders and those involving bond or debenture holders whose securities are redeemable at the

option of the company.
In the first type of case" the COIImIiss1on
has held that where a cClllpanyis being reorganized
or liquidated under Section 11" fairness and equity require that the commonstock be permitted
to participate :in the reorganization where it has a legitimate investment interest in the holding
cOllllpaay,and but for the necessity of 1dnd1ng up the compan;yunder Section 11, it lrOU1d be in a
position to receive earnings in the future.
If', therefore, on a dgoing concernd basis" the COlDJIIOD stock has an equity,
the Commissionprotects this valuable right f~
and does not permit
the Section 11 order to have the effect of maturing the liquidation claims of the preferred
stock.

The principle that fair and equitable plans shOllld not cause any class of securities to
sacrifice valuable rights and conter a windfall on anOther class is also illustrated
in the premiumcases. In DWlYcases the carrying out of Section II requires the retirement of bonds and
debentures. For example" if a holding companyis ordered to wind up it obviously cannot continue
to have bonds outstanding, and the bonds must be paid to conform to the standards of Section II
(b). Similarl¥, if a companyhas to be reorganized on such a basis that there is a substantial
debt reduction or indeed the elimination of all of its indebtedness, the standards of Section
II (b) require retirement of the debt. In a number of cases where bonds or debentures were
being retired in the course of such plans to meet the standards of Section II (b) the Commission
has held that such retirements are not voluntary and that the bonds or debentures are not entitled to the call premiumspecified in the indenture as payable in the event of a voluntary
redemption. The COIIIIIIission'

District Courts in a number of cases W and have been Upheld by two United States Circuit Court

-68The "Deep Rock- Principle

W

In the -Deep Rock" case,
the SUPreJ!18
Court held that under the circumstances there
present, a parent corporation could not participate
on the same basis as the public security
of a subsidiary,
and that the parent I s debt c1aims IIII18t be subholders in a reorganization
ordinated to the publicly-held
preferred stock of the subsidiary.
One of the principles
derived fram the decision is that this restriction
or subordination appli.es where a parent is
guilty of mismanagementor unfair treatment of the subsidiary.
As a principle of equity this
is simple of statement, but in practice it has been found that each case where the issue arises
presents a caoplicated set of facts requiring careful analysis.
Since one of the cardinal. abuses
which led to the pasaage of the Holding CompanyAct was overreaching by holding companies in
their dealings nth their subsidiaries,
the CClIIIIIIissiOll
examines every situation
with care to
ensure that the public security holders 1dll be protected.
In man;y situations,
plans filed by Cc:a:paD1es
under Section 11 have given recognition to this

principle.
For example, Empire Gas and Foel CC8Jl8DY
had outstanding a large amount of preferred stock in the hands of the pIlbllc.
It was indebted to
its parent, Cities Service Company, in the SIBOmltof more than $100,000,000. Empire had been
incorporated by Cities in 1912 and had been cOIlt.inuously dCllinated and controlled by it.

between Cities and Empire raised serious doubts as to the validty and proper rank of the huge
debt claim of Cities.
After consultation with the C~ssion's
staff, Cities agreed to a plan
whereby the pIlblic Preferred stockholders of Ellpire received new debentures of Empire in an
amount equal to the par value of the preferred stock plus accumulated unpaid dividends, and
Cities'
$100,000,000 of intercompany debt c1abls against Empire were made junior to those new
debentures. 26/
It is noteworthy that although the market price or the preferred stock o.f Empire was $57.50
per share the day before the proceedings were CaDllletJCed, the preferred stockholder could have
sold the new debenture he received for $157.00 ilIIaediately after the plan was put into effect.
Elimination

of Inequitable

Distribution

of Voting Ponr

An important effect of Section 11 (b) on operating companies is the requirement that necessary steps shall be taken to ensure that the corporate structure of an operating companydoes
not involve an inequitable distribution
of voting power among its security holders.
One of the
evils against which the Act was directed, was control over operating caopanies by
significant
holding companies which had a disproportionately
smal1 equity investment in the operating company. Frequently in holding company systems an undue portion of the capital of the operating
utility
caopanies was raised by selling bonds and preferred stock to the public and the holding
companypaid little
or nothing for the COlllllOn stock which had voting control.
In considering what steps should be required to cure situations
of that kind, and in passing
on voluntary plans designed to bring operating coapanies into conformity with Section 11 (b) (2),
the Commissionhas been faced with the problem whether the inequitable distribution
of voting
power might not be cured simply by giving voting control to the preferred stockholders or bondholders of the operating company and leaving the security structure otherwise untouched. After
careful consideration,
the Commission determined that half measures of that type would not solve
the problem, for such plans would not be feasible.
Over-eapitalized
operating caopanies which
are so top-heavy with senior securities
that it is inequitable for the camnan stockholder to have
control, have structures which impede the raising of new capital,
and obstruct regulation.
Furthermore, it is f1nanciall~ unsound to have a campany controlled by a senior security with a
limited dividend cla.:1Ja,for then the more jlmior securities
would be pmrerless to protect themselves.
The COIIIIII1.ssion
determined that when an inequitable distribution
of voting power is
to its excessive senior securities,
the
attributable
to an operating company's bad structun,
proper remed1" ma.Y 'ftll be to change the corporate structure and reduce the high a:mount ~ senior

Jack80nville Gas COIIIp8DY,
an operating subsidiary of American Gaa and Power COIIlpaD1',
had
and debentures outstanding in amounts great~ exceeding JacksOItV1lle Gas' properties.
The maturity of the debt was nearing and the compaDy'
filed a Section 11 (e) plan providing for
the iS8U8DCe
of' new bonds in greatly reduced amounts, and common
stock; the bonds and stock
were to be distributed to the company's creditors in a fair proportion and the old stock which
was admit~
worthless was to be cancelled. There was no doubt on the facts that the deplorable corporate structure of Jacksonvill.e Gas Com,pany
caused an inequitable distribution of voting power amongits security holders, for its creditors who had the sole interest in the c~
pany, had no voice whatsoever in its management. It was equally clear that merely giving votes
to the bondholders aDd debenture holders would leave the companyas sick as it ever was, and
wou.l.dnot be a feasible solution of the companylsproblems. The Commissionaccordingly approved.
the plan and at the compaD¥'Srequest applied to a United states District Court for its ppproval

was soundly reorganized
and the public at large.
in a mannerbeneficial to all of its security holders, and to cOIlSllDlers
Under the procedure available in Section U, the court order approving the plan was entered
within four and one-half' months from the time the Commissionmade application to the court to

investors.
Thus" their investors have acquired securities close to the "rails" instead of the
highly speculative holding companysecurities.
In both holding companiesand operating companies" there are many instances where the effectuation of plans of corporate simplification to
complywith Section 11 (b) has permitted the now of dividends to investors whohave not received any incomefor "!IaIlY years. In manyother cases holding companieshave retired their
senior securities by cash payments. Pursuant to the requirements of Section 11 (b) (1) many
holding companieshave been reducing the scope of thei.r operations" thus reducing a concentration of economicpowerwhich" as Congress found" had reached dangerous proportions.
In all of these situations investors have been fully protected. Thus, before Southern
Colorado PowerCompaRY"
an operating subsidiary of Standard Gas and Electric Company"
filed its
recapitalization plan with the COlIUIlission"
its preferred stock was selling at $32 per share;
after the Commissionapprovedthe plan the stock was selling at $60 per share and by the time
the District Court's order was entered also approving the plan and directing its enforcement"
the stock was selling at $70 a share. The United Gas ImprovementCompany"a registered holding
company"divested itself of its holdings in Philadelphia Electric Company
and Public Service
Corporation of NewJersey (which companieshave combinedassets of $1,,200,,000,,000)
by distributing these holdings plus cash to U.G.I.'s own preferred and common
stockholders. Just before the
plan was filed" the market price of U.G.I. common
stock was about $4 per share although as in
the case of most other holding companystocks the break-up value of the shares was substantial ly
greater than that amount. Since the plan proposed to eliminate a large portion of this discount
by transferring direct ownership of certain of these investments of U.G.I.'s common
stockholders" the common
rose to $6 per share immediately after the plan was filed and just before
the distribution of the securities to stockholders the common
stock sold at $9-7/8 per share.
Jlanyinstances of similar benefit to investors as a result of the enforcement of Section 11 are
available in the COlIUIlission's
files.
Investment analysts such as Standard and Poor's have long pointed out that "there seems
little justification for any fear that holding companieswill be forced to dispose of properties
at inadequate prices or to take any action that would adversely affect true values." Standard
and Poor's" Moody'sStock Survey and Barron's frequently publish studies showingthat holding
companysecurities sell at substantial discounts on their liquidating values. In its publication "The Outlook" for June 7" 1943" Standard and Poor's state:
"Holding Company
stocks have bemf1ted from integration or liquidation plans filed
with the SECin recent months •••
Since utility holding companystocks normally sell
at a discount from their liquidating value (just as do investment trust equities) the
filing of liquidation plans has caused the price of securities involved to advance
sharply to approximately those values.
"This was the experience of the common
stocks of Federal Water and Gas" National
Power& Light" Niagara HudsonPower and United Gas Improvement"all of which have lately
filed integration plans" as well as the preferred stocks of Standard GaB & Electric and
United Light & Power. Many of these issues more than doubled in price with the announcement that liquidation or integration of the holding companywas planned • ••
Additional
utility halding companieswill probably file integration or liquidation plans" which

Similar expressions concerning the beneficial effects of Section 11 have been madeby a number
of holding companymanagements.

-71REGULATION
OFSECURITY
I~
The control over security issues given to the CCllllllission
under the Act in Sections 6 and
7 is an important part of the statutory aim to restore the utility industry to full financial
health. 28/ These sections are well designed for the achievement of these objectives. Section
7 prescribes qualitative standards in regard to proposed security issues and changes in prioriIn brief, the
ties, preferences, voting poweror other rigp.ts of outstanding securities.
C<mDissionmaynot permit the issuance of a security if the terms and conditions thereof are
detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors and consumers; if the proposed
financing is not necessary or appropriate to the efficient operation of, the applicant's business; if the proposed security is not reasonably adapted to the earning power or security
structure of the declarant; if the fees, commissions,etc. paid in connection with the issue
are not reasonable. The Comnissionmaynot permit changes in priorities,
rights, etc. of
outstanding securities if it finds that such changes are detrimental to the public interest or
the interest of investors and consumers. Any order permitting a security issue maycontain
such terms and conditions as the Ccmmrission
finds necessary to insure compliancewith the above
standards.

SUbject to the COIIIDI1ssion's
powersto impose "such terms and conditions as it deemsappropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and consumers"Section 6
(b) directs the Commissionto exempt from the requirements of Section 7 an issue and sale of
securities which has been expressly authorized by a state cammissionof the state in which the
issuer is both organized and doing business and where the securities are solely for the purpose
of financing the business of the issuer.
These provisions l1m1t the Commission'spowers over
security issues where a state cOJllDission
has full authority over the subject matter and where
the other ccmditions for exemptj.onare met. In granting a Section 6 (b) exemption, however,
the Commission
is empowered to imposeterms and conditions appropriate in the public interest
even where state commis~onapproval has been secured. As discussed in a later section of .
this report, the Comm1ssion
usually consults with state commissionswith regard to the imposition of terms and conditions in Section 6 (b) cases.
The determination of whether a particular security issue meets the standards of the Act
demandsaccounting, engiheering, and legal skills, togethe1"with an expert lalowledgeof public
utility financing. While insisting at all times upon adherence to the standards of the Act,
the Commissiondoes not approach security issues with a rigid set of requirements applicable
to all situations.
It considers one of its major functions to be that of helping companiesto
meet the requirements of the Act. For example,where the terms of a proposed security issue,
as initially filed with the Commission,fail to meet one or more of the statutory standards,
the Cammissiondoes not simply refuse to permit the declaration concerning the issue to become
effective, bu1; seeks to strengthen the terms of the issue to a point where investors and consumers receive the protection afforded by the safeguards of the Act. This work is done largely
around the conference table and in informal meetings with the company's officials and its
financial and legal advisers.
In a great numberof cases, conferences precede the formal filing of the issue with the
Commissionand here the companyand the Commission
work out the t-erms of the issue to meet the
requirements of the Act. For example, adequate maintenance and depreciation charges, restrictions on dividends, effective voting rights for preferred stock in the event of default in
dividends, limitations on the future issuance of securities having a preference over the proposed issue, e11m1nationof conflicts of interest of indenture trustees, correction of accounting practices, and similar matters, have been worked out informally, both before and after
f111ng. In many instaooes, it has been possible to promote the rehabilitation of a weak: company and to convert a speculative issue into a more conservative one.

?:!y The Senate Cammitteeon Interstate Commerce,reviewing the proposed holding companylegislation stated that the intent of Sections 6 (a) and 7 was " •••
to give the Commission
continuous supervision over the revampingof ho1din&-Company
systems to meet the requirements of Title I looking toward the establishment of financially sound and economically
integrated units and the avoidance of injury to investors and consumers." Sen. Rep. No.

-72Balanced Capital Structures

,'
I,
"

jG
I

A. major objective of the Commission'sregulation of security issues has been to achieve a
balanced capital structure with a substantial amountof cammonstock equity. A balanced
capital structure provides a considerable measure of insurance against bankruptcy enables the
utility to raise newmoneymost economically, and avoids the possibility of deterioration in
service to consumers if there is a decline in earnings. Since, by and large, the utility industry has been characterized by an excessive Bm01Ult
of debt and other senior securities, the
Commission'sregulatory efforts under Sections 6 (b) and 7 have been in considerable part devoted to reduction of these senior securities and the increase of the cammonstock equity.
In someinstances, conditions have been attached requiring that the interest savings fram refunding or a certain amountof net earnings be reserved to redeem outstaniing debt. In other
instances, the Commissionhas required the inclusion of sinking fund provisions whereby the
issuer agrees to devote annually a stated amountto retirement of bonds or to property addiIn still other instances, the objective of debt reduction has been achieved by financtions.
ing through the issuance of securities nth short-term serial maturities.
Equity F:l.naneing

As a corrective measure, the Commissioninsists that, wherever possible, more cammonstock
equity be built up to improve the capital structure of those companieswhich have a high ratio
of bonds to (a) "capitalization"
and (b) net property, adjusted for write-ups.

'?l!

Onemethod of increasing camnonstock equity has been to require the conversion of open
accounts, bonds, or preferred stock held by the parent c~~l
into camnonstock of its subsidiary. 'JPJ Whenthe Appalachian Electric Power Company
lY .refinanced its bonds and preferred
stock, its parent, American Gas and Electric Company,madea $30,670,000 capital contribution
to its subsidiary.
This was accomplished by the surrender of an open-account advance and preferred stock with the provision that $22,500,000 of that amountbe placed in an appropriate
reserve to be available for possible adjustments to fixed capital accounts and depreciation reserve. The principles of the Deep Rock case
established by the SupremeCourt of the United
States have given considerable impetus to the conversion of senior security holdings into commonstock.

W

A numberof holding companieshave increased their equity investments in their subsidiaries
either by outright cash contributions or the purchase of additional common
stock. An additional
method of increasing the cammonstock equity is illustrated in the 'i'{estPenn Power case. }]/
That companyissued and sold common
stock to the public to finance needed property improvements
rather than increase the proportion of senior securities in its structure as it proposed to do
in its initial application to the Commission.
Elimination of Inflation

in Property Accounts

In passing upon security issues the Commissionhas consistently required that the securities proposed to be issued be based upon actual sums invested in utility property and not
''watered'' assets.
The Securities and ExchangeCommission,like the State Commissionsand the
Federal Power Commission,has required the elimination of write-ups and other inflationary
i.tems from the plant accounts, either by direct write-offs or by an amortization program. In
this connection the operating utility subsidiaries of registered holding companieswrote-dOl'lI1

Depreciation Accruals and Depreciation Reserves
Correct accounting for "depreciation" is especially important in public utility enterprises because of their relatively large investment in depreciable fixed property. The understatement or overstatement of depreciation distorts net operating income and gives a misleading
picture of the financial condition of the enterprise; investors are given an illusory and false
impression with regard to earnings coverage, earned surplus and the depreciation reserve.
Prior to the adoption of revised systems of accounts for electric and gas utilities
in
1937, which provide specifically for depreciation accounting, the retirement-reserve methodof
accounting for property retirements was in general use in the electric and gas utility industry
with the sanction of most of the regulatory agencies having jurisdiction.
While a sound use of
the retirement-reserve methoddid not preclude adequate accruals and did not, of course, alter
the fundamental nature of depreciation, many companiescharged amountssufficient to provide
for only a little more than current property retirements and did not take into account the
depreciation currently accruing on the property which continued in service. That practice was
not only inherently deceptive but, because of the growingneed for capital, it resulted in the
issuance and sale of a considerably larger volumeof securities than otherwise would have been
necessary. It is nowgenerally recognized that adequate provision for depreciation is essential to the protection of the interest of investors.
of inadequate depreciation,
To protect new and existing investors against the ill-effects
the Commissionhas insisted upon certain protective measures. In the case of inadequate depreciation reserves comingbefore the Commissionin connection with security issues, the Commission has attempted to makeup for the mistakes of the past in a numberof ways. In certain

 74contain certain protective provisions. In most financing cases the obligor has been required
to set aside, annually, a fixed percentage usually 15%, of its gross operating revenues for
maintenance, replacements, improvements, or other property additions, or for the reacquisition
of bonds issued under the indenture. In somecases, the requirement as to depreciation has
been measured in terms of f'ixed property. Such portion of' the stipulated minimal amountas is
not expendedfor these purposes is required to be deposited with the Indenture Trustee. Subsequently accumulated earned surplus is restricted to the extent that operating expense has not
been charged with the stipulated amountof depreciation and maintenance. Frequently, earned
surplus as of the date of the issue is "frozen" for dividend purposes. The CollllJl1ssion
also
requires that plant and property acquired with funds arising from depreciation accruals shall
be "funded" -
 i.e.,
shall not be madethe basis for the authentication of additional bonds, or
for the release of cash deposited with the Trustee, or for the purpose of sinking fund
requirement8•

The insistence of the COlllJlIlission
and other regulatory authorities upon more adequate depreciation practices have materially strengthe~d the operating utilities.
It will be observed
from the following table that the accumulated depreciation reserves have been built up from
an average of 10.05%of property in 1938 to 17.53%in 1943, and that the annual depreciation
accruals have risen from 1.72% o£ property in 1938 to 2.28%in 1943. nJ

It should be noted that the increased depreciation requirements like many other restrictions
1mposedin connectd.on with proposed security issues, do not require an actual outfiow of cash.
On the contrary, their effect is to increase the amountof cash retained in the business.
BondIndentures
The principal financing mediumof utilities
has been the corporate bond secured by an indenture of mortgage upon the plant and property of the obligor. The ready market and 1011'
yield ~
 of utility bonds are doubtless to be attributed to the security conferred by a
modern indenture and to the protective margin of earnings and assets over and above the claims
of bondholders resulting from an increased common
stock equity.

Until the enactment of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935 and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 the terms of indentures were largely determined by the holding companies and
affiliated investment banking interests.
The experience o£ the depression led to the enactment
of the Trust Indenture Act, the primary purpose of which was to require the trustee to assume
a more active and responsible function in enforcing the terms of the indenture, and to prevent
the designation of a trustee if a connict of interest would result.
In addition to applying
the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, it is the practice o£ the Commission,in connection

utility indentures are almost invariably "open-end". The additional (equally ranldng) bonds
that mayin the future be issued under the indenture, usually unlimited in absolute amount, are
related to the additional property acquired by the obligor. Old indentures permitted the issuance of bonds in principal amountequal to 70-80%of the "fair value" of additional property;
under current practice as reflected in Commissiondecisions the max:ilnum allowed has been 60%of
the cost or fair value, whichever is less, of net additions to fixed property. Net additions
are required to be defined carefully in order to assure, amongother things, that property
which has been purchased by funds generated from depreciation accruals shall not form the basis
of additional bonds. The issuance of additional bonds is also conditioned upon a conservative
interest coverage requirement. To prevent dilution or dissipation of the pledged property it
is, of course, necessary to incorporate adequate provisions respecting maintenance and depreciation, the nature of which has been described above. Sink1ng fund provisions have been generally
required, particularly where satisfactory ratios cannot be obtained at the time of the issuance
of the securities for which the COIIIIIIission's
approval is sought.
Preferred Stock Protective Provisions
The abuses associated with the issuance of preferred stock by holding companiesand operating caopanies are evident from the huge losses suffered by investors in these securitiez.
These
abuses have been so serious that they have led to a public policy, as expressed in Secticm 7 (c)
of the Act, against the issuance of preferred stock except under limited circumstances. Where
preferred stocks have been permitted to be issued by the Commission,it has insisted that the
articles of incorporation contain various protective provisions.
These usually- consist of the right to elect a majority- of the board of directors in the
event of default in the paymentof four quarterly- preferred stock dividends, and certain voting
rights in connection with the following matters: the issuance of short term debt in excess of
prescribed amounts, mergers and consolidations, the authorization of any-class of stock ranking prior to or on a parity with the outstanding preferred stock, the amendment
of the charter
to change the express terms of the preferred stock in any substantially prejudicial manner, the
issuance ot authorized bllt unissued preferred stock and increasing the amountof authorized but
unissued preferred stock. In addition, the Commissionhas required that the charter limit the
amountof initially authorized but uni8sued preferred stock and contain certain provisions with
respect to the paymentot common
stock dividends which will reasonably safeguard the interests
of the preferred stockholders.
Securities Issued under the Holding Company Act
For the period November1, 1935 to June 30, 1944 approximately $6,015,000,000 of securities
were perm1tted to be issued by the Commissionpursuant to the provisions of Section 6 (b) and 7.

Of this large volume of security issues new or additional financing accounted for only'
some$268,470,000 or 4.5%. The bulk of new construction has been financed by the use of cash
derived from. depreciation accruaJ.s, amortization of debt discount, amortization of account 100.5
(plant acquisitions) and other non-cash charges to income, and retention of profits.
There is
little question but that the conservative financial practices required by regulatory authorities, including this Commission,contributed substantial.l:y to the ability of the utilities
to

finance the new construction needed for the war program.
Refunding issues accounted for approximately 68% of the securities issued during this
period. 10Ifer moneyrates and an improvedcredit situation, due to more conservative financial
policies, en$led most of tbe utilities
to rerum their bonds and to a considerable extent to
refinance their preferred stocks on very favorable bases. The "cost to companyttof money
obtained on long term utility bonds of the best investment quality has been as low as 2.58%and
the like cost of preferred stock capital has been as lOW'as 3.85%. In someinstances utilities
which ref'unded at the beginning of the period of 101f8rmoneycosts have refunded a second t1Jlle
and achieved further savings in IIlODeY' costs.
Of the total amount of securities sold, operating utility companieshave issued
$5,143,119,542 and registered holding caupanies only i8'72,048t375. Of the $268,470,000 of Il81f
financing the issues of holding ccapanies accounted for only' '1,555,134. The financial posit.ion of the holding companieshas been such that relatively few have been able to effect refunding operations.
Their bonds and preferred stocks frequently carry rates of 6%to 8%. The
holding companieshave not been a substantial source of capital for their operating utilities
and the credit enjoyed by'the operating utilities
of even moderate size has been substantial.l:y
better than that of most holding companies.

This great mass of security issues was cleared thrOllf1Pthe Comm1ssian,an the basis of
a great many'individual applications and declarations~ llJ each of which required a careful

COMPETITIVE BIDDING
On April 7, 1941, the COIIIDlission
adopted Rule U-50, requiring competitive bidding in the
sale of securities
by registered
public ut1lity holding companies and their subsidiaries.
The
rule, applicable both to new security issues and to the sale by holding companies of portfolio
securiti .. , prescribes public invitation
of sealed bids.
Certain transact10ns are specifically
exeapt, including securities
sold for less than one million dollars;
securities
issued pro rata
to existing security holders pursuant to e.ny preemptive right or privilege or in connection with
anyliqu1dat1on
or reorganization;
and loans of a maturity ot ten years or less, where the lender
is a tinancial
institution
not purchasing for resale and no tinder's
fee or other negotiation
charge is to be paid to any third person.
In addition,
there is a general prov1aion tor exemption
trom cCl8lpetitive bidding by order ot the COIIIIIission.

securities
inPrior to the adoption ot Rule U-50, the customary method ot selling utility
volved a sale by the issuing corporation to an undarwriting SJIldicate at a pr1ce determined by
private negotiation with the principal or so-called originating
undenrriter.
It was an
established
polic,. of investment bankers not to compete 8IIIOng theJllSe1ves tor the securities
business of any issuer which had a continuing investment banldng relationship
with a particular
firm.
Similarl,., with very few exceptions, the issuing corporation made no attempt to seek
cOilpetitive bids or to "shop around" tor better terms than those otfered by its customary banker.
In SOll8 cases, -.oreover, there was a clearly traceable affiliate
relationship,
SQII8times extending over a considerable
period ot t1:me, between the originating
underwriter aDd the issuer.
In
tact, SOll8 of the underwriters had been promoters ot SC*8 ot the .ajor holding c~
systeu.
As a result ot these conditions there was a definite
absence of free competition in the underwr1t.1ng of utU1.t7 aecur1.t,. issues.

Many replies
were received and were anal1Zed by the Commission's staff.

In December 1940 the Public Utilities
Division rendered its report to the Comm1ssion
fol'llla1l,. recOlllllending the adoption of a competitive bidding rule. 40/ Copies of that report were
distributed
to registered
holding companies, state and Federal regliIatory bodies, and to a broad
list of investment baDkera and dealers, both direc1;17 and through the Investment Bankers Association and the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc.
In distributing
the report,
written cOIIIIIl8nts
were invited,
following which numerous responses were received.
The Commission
then called a public conference to consider the recCllDlendedrule and public discussion continued
for four and one-halr da,.s.
The conference was attended by approximatel,. 200 persons from every
part of the country, including two members of Congress, investment bankers, securities
dealers,
and representatives
of other governmental agencies.
Four members of the CO!IIIIl1.ssion
were present
were expressed on the question, both in the
at all t1Jles. All abades of opinion, pro and ~,
written responses and at the conferences.
After we1gh1Dgtbe evidence and considering all aspects of the problem, the Commission
concluded that there was no ....,. short of competitive bidding that would afford. it satisfactory

In the three-year period ending June 30, 1944, 59 public utilit,.
issues in the aggregate
aount of approxiaatel,.
$960,000,000 were sold competitively under the procedures specified in
Rule U-50. PertiDent information concerning the results
of competitive bidding under the Rule
is presented each year b,. the Commission in a report eDtitled "Securi t,. Issues of Electric and

42/ It _,. be noted that except in one or two instances,
insurance companies
and other institit1ona1
investors have not submitted bids for issues sold pureuant to Rule U-50.

there has been a substantial. decrease in the relative

PROGRESS IN SERVICE CCllPANY REGULATIOfl
One of the most serious ot all the holding c~
abuses 1I8S the exploitation of their
operating subsidiary cOlllpaDiesthrough umrarranted service fees, cOBl1asions, and other charges.
These charges, dictated by the holding companysitting on both sides of the table, in nowise
represented bargains freely and openly arrived at by the subsidiary on the basis of the lowest
cost in a competitive market. Prior to the passage of the Act, and particular17 of Section 13 of
the Act, the annual profits made from subsidiaries by ho1.d1.Dg
coapanies ran into JDal11" lIIillions ot
dollars annnaU,.. While 80M of the service tees were earned, there were aauy more cases where
the charges were either exorbitant or cClllp1etelyspurious. Service charges were general17
operating expenses ahead ot interest on the books ot the utility companies, and were deductible
in computingthe tair rate ot return. In JIUUJY instances they were capitalized and found their
way into the rate base. Theywere in the nature of a special dividend to the holding company
disguised on the books of the operating COlllpany
as an operating expense or as a capital charge.
The electric Bondand Share Company,for example, in 1930, collected total service tees
charges from its operating public utility companiesamountingto $l4,057,m, or 26%ot the
holding cOllp8Dy"stotal gross inCOJlle
ot 154,3S?,000, and in 1931 collected service tees totalling
19,870,312, or 30% ot its total gross income ot 132,560,000.
These service fees were charged to
the local operating companiesby the. holdiDg CoapaIQ" aaDag8llelltin flew Yorktor alleged services

Duriog the years
1919 to 1929, the .ervice c~
in the system collected $36,990,000 froa the operating cospanies. The net incomefor this ll-year period, after deducting expenses, was in excess of
117,1)4,000.
In 1927 alone this managementcaapany collected over 15,000,000.
aDd

Section 13 ot the Public Utility Holding Company
Act was designed to retain the benefits
but to end the abuses of servicing relationships.
It provides that holding companiescan no
laager pertora services or constz:uction work tor, or sell goods to, any operating companyror a

-80are thus enabled to follow closely the expenses of these companiesand their charges to
associate operating companies.
The rules and regulations adopted by the CODIIII1ssion
permitted the continuation of central
service, sales and construction contracts provided these were pertoI'llledby a subsidiary of the
holding cCllllP8llY'
or a mutual service cOlllJl8l1Y',
that is one which is ownedby the companiesbeing
serviced. The standards of the Act required that these contracts be performed at cost, fairly
and equitably allocated, that the transactions be necessary ones for the benefit of the companies
receiving them, and that they be performed e.fficiently and economically. Procedurally it was
required that the proposed methods of operation and conduct of business of the companiesengaged
s scrutiny for approval or
in the performance of 'these contracts be submitted to the COJlIIIlission'
disapproval as warranted.

Whenthese companiessubmitted their proposed methods of doing business several difficult
in disposing of these .easea, There had been no
problemswere confronted by the C<DD1ssion
uniformity in practices amongthe various systems to serve as a basis of comparison. The
functions to be performed by the service companywere described in broad and general terms,
mak1ng it almost impossible to identify the specific transactions to be performed for specific
system companies. The costs of these organizations, generally, were billed to the system companies on a percentage of gross revenues or a percentage of const~ction costs.
With the experience gained in these early cases it becameincreasingly apparent that a substantial portion of the amountscharged to operating companiesshould be borne by the holding
company. The Commission'sproblem then was one of determining what holding companycosts
actually are and requiring that these costs be paid by" the holding companiesand thus eliminated
as an item of expense to the operating cOJllpanies. This problem presented difficulties
because of
the cOlBlll1ngling
of holding companyand operating companyactivities in the central organizations.
In a series of proceedings initiated by the Commissionand in connection with the consideration of cases wbich had been pending for sometime, the COJIIIII1ssion
dealt with this apparent
shifting of ho1d.1ngc~
expenses to the operating companies. In essence the cond!tion confronting the COIlIIII1ssion
in these cases, in greater or lesser degree and in one form or another,
was the use by the holding companyof common
officers and ellployees between it and the service
companyto supervise in its owninterest the daily operations of the operating companies and
the passing on to those companiesof the _jor portion of the cost of such supervision. The
questions at issue were whether or not it was possible to allocate such expenses between the
holding companyand operating companies"fairly and equitably" pursuant to the requirements of
Section 1) (b), and whether, in effect, the holding companywas not in reality rendering
services tor a charge to its operating subsidiaries in contravention of Section 1) (a).
In its opinions with respect to these cases, the Commissionestablished the broad principle
that compensationand collateral expenses of all holding companyofficers, directors, and employees
must be borne directly by" such holding companies and could not be shared with their controlled
service companies and thus passed on to the operating companies. In other words, the Commission
bas taken 'the position that operating companiesshould not be asked to pay the cost of the control
activities ot the holding company.
In the case of Ebasco Services, Incorporated, 43/ the system service companyof Electric
Bond and Share Company,it appeared that six of BoJ'and Share's directors and principal
executi'Yeofficers held identical positions in the service companyand received portions of their
compensation.f'roa both of these cCllllp8llies.The Commissionheld that the functions of ~he principal executives as officers of Ebasco were comm1ng1ed
with their !'unctions as officers of BOMand
Share and that 1t 11'88 an "almost impossible and wasteful task" to ascertain what segments ot the
services of each of the cOllll1On
officers were for Ebasco and hence properly included in the cost
to the sen1.ce c~,
and what part was for Bondand Share and therefore chargeable only to it.
After the Ebasco decision, numerousservice companiesvoluntar1.ly adjusted their practices
to confora to the opinion of the C<BII18sion.!!!!/

-81'lbe At1aDUcm1l1t7 Serrice Corporation case (formerly the utility llanagementCorporation),
a _tal _rilee ~

iii '£hi baoclated Gas and Electric Corporation System, presented many
ec.plex1t1es due to the replac_nt
of the Hopson management. The trustees, prior to the final
diapoaition ofth1s case, had -.ade _terial
changes resulting in substantial annual reductions in
charges to the operating coapanies. For instance, whenthis companyfirst filed for approval,

It reported eerrice fees or $4,868,191. Subsequent revisions of its operations had reduced these
as to whether the servfees to $1,940,805. However,the issue was st111 'before the COIJIII1asion
ices pertol'Ed b;y this company were not essentially ho1d1ngcompanyactivities.
As a result of
the proceedings before this CCBII1ss1on
and the review of these transactions as related to the
lew Yorkcoapanies b;y the Public Service Commissionof NewYork, the latter Commissiondenied
approval of the proposed contracts.
This resulted in the complete elimination of this canpany
as a service company. The technical staff formedGilbert Associates, Inc., an independent COllIpany, and under the proposals subm1
tted to this Commissionproposed that all future business
would be obtained on a competitive basis from the operating companies. All of the holding compmv- tmlctiona, with their related costs, were transferred to the system holding compaldes,
thus reducing IIllter:lal1y future annual charges to the operating companies.

-82companiesfrom the absentee control of holding companies, thus permitting them to be regulated
more effectively by the state.
This fundamental purpose of the Holding CompanyAct - the
facilitating
of State regulation - underlies the COIIIIIIission's
efforts to 1I'Orkcooperatively
with the various State COIIIIIIissions
in the administration of the Act.
The protection of state regulation is specifically provided for in several sections of the
Act. For example, certain issues of securities by registered holding companiesand their subsidiaries are exemptedby Section 6 (b) from Section 6 (a) if they have been approved by the
State Commission,subject to such terms and conditions as the Securities and ExchangeCommission
maydeemappropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.
Certain security and utility asset acquisitions are likewise exemptedunder Section 9 (b) from the
provisions of Section 9 where they have been approved.by a state Commission. Moreover, the COllImission lII&y
not authorize security issues ~ect1on 7 (g)J or the acquisition of assets ,LS'ection
10 (f)l unless applicable State laws have teen complied with. Section 8 prevents the ownership
of both electric and gas utility properties in violation of State law, while Section 20 (b)
requires that accounting standards established by the CClIIIIlIission
shall not be ineonsistent with
the provisions or applicable state law.
A numberof specifie sections or the Act renect the Congressional intent that the COIIIIisSection 19 of the Act,
s10n's 1I'Ork
...hould be coordinated nth the work of State COJIIIIl:1Bsions.
for example, expressly prov1des that in any proceeding before the Commission,the Commission,
in accordance nth such rules of practice as it mayprescribe, shall admit as. a party any inter.sted State, State CCIIIIJII1ssion,
municipality or any political aub-division of the state.
Pursuant
to this provision, the COII8issionuniformly notifies interested State COIIIIII1esioDS
of proceedings
before it wh1chma:r affect the 1I'Orkof such cCllllllliasion.Ifany State Commissi~ have taken
advantage of this provision and have intervened in proceedings before the CCIIIIIlission
and in these
and other cases there has been an interchange of ideas and information between the Securities
and ExchangeCommissionand the State COIIIII1ssion
concerned. In one instance, although there is
no speci.f'ic statutory authority for joint hearings by the COJIIIIlission
and a state COlIIIlission,a
and the Public
joint hearing 1ra8, in fact, held by the Securities and ExchangeCClIIIII1ssion
Ut1l1ties CClIIIIII1ssion
of the District of Colambia.

su

Section 18 of the Act places at the disposal of the State COIIIIIissions
the investigatory
poor of the Securities and ExchangeCOBIIiasionin regard to the business, financial condition,
or practices or registered holding cOllpaDiesand their subsidiaries and Section 18 (a) authOriHS
the C~sion
to II8lce available to state Ca.1ssioD8 the results of its OIID investigations
Mde pursuant to the Act. Pursuant to this and other provisions or the Act, the COIIIIIII1sl!l1on
waa
requested OIl September 19, 1942 bT the Public ut1l1ties COIIIIIII1ssion
of the District of Columbiato
UDdertake an investigation at the variOl18 relationships between WashingtonRailway & Electric
Cc.paD,J"
and the North American Oc.paD;y, its parent. The investigation was completed in accordance
with the request f4 the DUtrict of Colubia C~ssion.
The Securities and ExchangeCoam.ssion, through its jurisdiction
over intra-system service
charges, has been in a position to render signi.ficant assistance to State Commissionsin this
field, and such assistance, in fact, has been reDdered in several notable instances.
Under
is authorsection 13 (d) of the Act, the Com.1ssion, upon the request of the state CClIIIIIIission,
bed, after notice aDd opportunit7 for hear1.ng, to require by order "a reallocation or reapportiODMDtof costa amongmember.cOllpaDiesof a lIII1tual service ccapany if it finds the existing

Corporate Integration and Simplification

The most significant litigation under the Holding CompanyAct since the Bond and Share case
was the group of review proceedings involving the constitutionality
of the corporate Integration
and simplification provisions of the Act (Sections 11 (b) (1) and (2».
In 3 of these cases,
filed by the North AmericanCompany,United Gas ImprovementCompany,and Engineers Public Service
Company,W the Second and Third Circuits and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
in unanimousdecisions upheld the constitutionality
of Section 11 (b) (1), 56/ while the
constitutionality
of Section 11 (b) (2) was similarly sustained by the Firstand Third Circuits
and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia57/ in review proceedings instituted by
AmericanPOlrer& Light Companyand Electric Power& Lignt Corporation (one case), CODDIlomrealth
& Southern Corporation, and Central and Southwest Utilities
Co. 58/ In addition to upholding
the constitutionality
of Sections 11 (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2), these decisions have affirmed, in
virtually all respects, the Commission'sviews as to matters of statutory interpretations.
To assist holding companiesand operating subsidiaries in achieving voluntary compliance
with the corporate simplification and integration provisions of the Act, the Commissionhas, at
the request of companiesconcerned, instit~ted 15 proceedings in federal district courts under
Section 11 (e) of the Act to enforce and carry out voluntary plans of reorganization previously
approved by the Commissionas fair and equitable and necessary to effect the corporate simplification and integration provisions of the Act. In these cases involving CommunityPower and Light

 86Commission's orders approving section 11 (e) plans have been upheld by the courts with respect
to both holding companies and operating subsidiaries.
In these proceedings the settled practice
of the courts has been to consider the plan solely upon the evidence presented before the Commission, and to consider new evidence only for the purpose of detendning whether it could and
should have been considered by the COIIIIId.saion.In addition, the CORdssion, in a nwaber of
cases, has passed upon, pursuant to Section 11 (f) of the Act, plans of reorganization of holding companies and subsidiaries in proceedings under Chapter I and fOl'ller Section 7TB of the
Bankruptcy Act.
A corollary to the reorganization of hold1ng companies and their subs1d1ar1es under the
Holding CompanyAct is the COJIIIIl1ssion'
s determination to prevent holding companies from escaping
the requirements ot the Act by liquidating under state procedures. 'Ibis policy of requiring
that the reorganization of holding companysystelll8 shall be in accordance with plans which are
fair and equitable and comply with the purposes of the Act is illustrated
by the Commission's
and i ts subsidiary, North American Light &
injunction suit against The North American C'lIJP&DY
Power Company,to prevent Light & Power from dissolving or liquidating under state law. The
case was ultimately dismissed by stipulation and the liquidation ot Light & Power is proceeding under the Act.
A ComParableproblem has arisen in several cases wherein stockholders of registered
holding companies in process of reorganization or liquidation under the Hold1.DeCompanyAct have
filed derivative actions in state and tederal courts, asserting cl.a.1mseither on behalf of the
companyin reorganization or in the interest of one or more of its subsidiaries.
These suits
have generally been based upon charges of corporate waste, alleged iaproper acts of the company
through its directors and officers,
and other caUI!IeS
of action geDera11y tallixJg in the category
of breaches of fiduciary duty. The COJIIIII1ssion
has taken the position that where a fair,
equitable pnd feasible plan of reorganization cannot be effectuated without considering and
giving effect to such causes of action, they should properly be asserted as claims in the Commission's reorganisation proceeding. To protect ita jurisdiction,
the COIIIIIIission
has intervened
or appeared as amicus curiae in certain of these civil cases to request that they be dismissed
or stayed pending deterililii8tion ot the issues in the COJIIII1ssion
I s proceeding.
The courts have
recognized the importance of having this type of litigation
adjudicated in the context of a
complete reorganization proceeding and have, in the exercise of judicial discretion, stayed the
cases before them. Typical ot these cases are Dederick v. The North .AlIIericanCompany(D. N.Y.)
and illinois
Ian Power Companyv. North .AlIIericanLight & Power Co. (D. vel.). 60/
In cases arising out of the COIIIII1ssion
IS Section 11 (e) proceedings a number of novel and
highly significant issues have been raised and settled in accordance with the views of the Commission. For example, thoroughgoing reorganizations of operating subsidiaries have been sustained
upon the premise of correcting an inequitable distribution of voting power in the subsidiary,
pursuant to the last sentence of Section 11 (b) (2). Jacksonv1ll.e Gas C~

Judicial ReviewProcedure

Act have resulted in settling important
Judicial opinions in cases under the Holding COIIPBDY
general questions bearing upon the conduct of the Cc.dssion' s proceedings and the rights of
"aggrieved" persone to obtain judicial review of Ccmmdssionorders. One such question related to
the proper _thod of disposing of two or acre petitions fUed in different circuit courts to
review the same or parts of the S8a8 order issued by the C0IIIII18sion.Relying upon the statutory
provision that the court in which the C~ssion
sball fUe its transcript of record shall have
exclusive jurisdiction to aff1rll, modify, or set aside the C~sion's
order in whole or in
Part, the C~8sion has contended that whentwo or more petitions for review are fUed in
different courts the Coaaission JIIllstdetenl1ne which review proceeding w1ll best serYe the pI1blic
interest and file its transcript in that court, thereby giving it exclusive jurisdiction over
the Commission'sorder. The procedure has been judicially established that petitions tiled in
courts other than that in which the CODII1ssion
rUes the transcript of the record are to be
diSlll1asedunless the petitioners desire to interYene in the proceeding before the court which
has been given exclusive jurisdiction over the COIIIIIission'sorder. To protect the rights of such
petitioners, there has been developed.the judicial procedure of trans.f8rr1ns and transmitting
to the court of exclusive jurisdiction the petitions for review filed in the other cOUl'ta.
lIore recently the analagous question has arisen as to the disposition of petitions for
review fUed by stockholders of companiesdirectly or 1nd1rectly dfected by the Com1ssion' IS
orders UDderthe Holding Caapa11\Y
Act. The C~ssion
has been upheld by revining courts in
its contention that before a stockholder can claim to be ftaggrievedW by the COIIII1ssion'
s order
his petition .nst show that he has complied with the general rules applicable to stockholders'
derintive
actioba, i.e., that he has ude a deaand upon his corporation to rue a petition for
review and that the corporation has refused to do so for improper reasons.

aapect.s of Section 11 at the close of the past fiscal year follows: 72/

Electric

Bond and Share Company

Electric Bend and Share is the largest system registered under the Holding CompanyAct. The
parent, Electric Bond and. Share Company(Bond and Share), controls five major subholding companies:
American & Foreign Power Company,Inc. (American Foreign), American Gas and Electric Company
(American Gas), American Power & Light Company(American), Electric Power & Light Corporation
(Electric), and National Power & Light Company(Natioflal).
OnMay9, 1940 the COJIJIIl1.ssion
instituted Section 11 (b) (2) proceedings directed to Bond and
Share and certain of its subsidiaries.
73/ On August 23, 1941 the Commissionfound that National
served no useful function, that it servea as the central tier in a pyramid which enabled Bond and
Share to control the National System with practically no investment, and that it violated Section
11 (n) (2) because it constituted an undue and unnecessary complexity in the Bond and Share
system. As a result National was ordered to dissolvf.>. 74/ Considerable progress has been made
in getting National's affairs in shape for liquidation.--All
of its bonds~
retired through
the use of cash on hand and its preferred stock was e]~m1nated :.hrough a voluntary exchange of
commonstock of Houston Lighting & Power Companyand by sale of the remainder of the Houston
stock and the use of the proceeds together nth treasury cash to retire the remaining National
preferred stock at $100 per share plus accumu.lated dividends. The last of the preferred stock
..-a:a retired in January 1944 pursuant to an authorization of the Commissiondated January 4,
1944. 75/ The principal assets remaining for disposHion are the commonstocks of three operating companies: BirminghamElectric COIIlpa.IIY,
Carolina Power & Light Company,and Pennsylvania
Power & Light Company.
OnAugust 5, 1942 76/ the Commissionacting under Section 11 (c), granted National an
extension of one year .tr'Om August 22, 1942 for cOD1J>l+ance
with t.he order of dissolution but
conditioned its action upon National's filing plans for resolution of the voting power and
accounting problems of its subsidiaries.
Such plans have been fUed by National. Arter
several amendmentsthe plan filed by Carolina Power & L1&htCompanywas approved by the Commission on Decemberu, 1943. 71/ Sim~ilarl the plan for BirminghamElectric Companyas
amendedwas approved on Karch ~, 1944. 78 In both of these cases the operating cOJD.P8l11.es,
through capital contributions by Natio
and accounting and voting power adjustments" were
able to conform their accounts and structures to the standards of the Act so as to be re~
for disposition.
Final action has not been taken nth respect to Pennsylvania Power & Light
Companylargely by reason of uncertainty as to the classification
of the accounts of that company. An order to shOircause with :respect to that company, directed toward a disposition of its
accounting problems, was instituted by the Federal Power COJIIIII1ssion
on Dec~mber17, 1943. At
the close of the past fiscal year" this proceediJlg was pending.

on which the
Court has not yet acted.
The Commissioninstituted
proceedings under Section 11 (b) (2) and various other sections
of the Act directed to .Americanand 1ts subsidiary, Florida Power& Light Company(florida), on
Jul.,. 10, 1941. lswes were raised as to the distribution of voting power amongthe security
holders of Florida, the existence of large amounts of write-ups in its accounts, and the validity
aDd rank of the $22,000,000 of Us debentures held by' American. On September 17, 1941 respondents
fUed a refinancing plan, in part to _et the allegations in the Comission's order for hearing.
The utters
were consolidated am hearings were held. Prior to the final determination of the
case by the COIIIII18sion,
honver, American and Florida submitted amendmentsto their previous
proposal.
The proposal as so 8J118nded,
lIhich provided for substantial adjustments to the accounts
of Florida, the surrender b,. Americanto florida as a capital contribution of $17,000,000 of the
debentures held b,. it and certain other securities, and the retirement of all publicly-held
securities at their contract prices from treasu.r;y cash and the proceeds of issuance of DeW
securities, 11&8 approved by' the COIIIII1ssion

On November15, 1943 AmericanfUed an application and declarat:t:on with respect to the conversion of its outstanding stock, consisting of $5 and $6 preferred stock and COIIIIIOIl stock into
a new cc.oon stock. The cC?JRP8D1

Associated Gas and Electric

Company

The CCBDission, on September 4, 1941, instituted a Section 11 (b) (1) proceeding with
regard to the Trustees of Associated Gas and Electric Corporation (Agecorp) who controlled,
175 subsidiaries of which 68 were public utilities
as defined by the
directly or indirectly,
Act. To meet the issues raised by the Commissionthe Trustees proposed to create out of the
system four groups of properties to be disposed of as units in the liquidation of Agecorp. One
of these four groups of properties is located in Florida and Georgia, while the other three are
in NewYork, Pennsylvania and NewJersey.

On August 13, 1942, the Commissionissued an order requiring the Trustees to divest themselves of all interest in a long list of utility
and non-utility
companies, reserving for fut~re
consideration questions relating to the composition of the groups of properties as single integrated systems, additional systems, and permissible non-utility businesses. 116/ The Trustees
filed a petition for leave to file an amendedsupplemental answer relative to'the retainability
of certain additional properties and companies in each of the four groups. On February 17, 1944,
the Commissionpermitted respondents to file the amendedsupplemental answer and adduce additional
evidence in regard to the issues thus raised.
On February 3, 1941, the Commissioninitiated

Gengas ~and
'proceed1Dgs. After the close of the fiscal year a revised plan was filed jointly by Agecorp and
Gengas. 120/ This plan provided for the distribution by Gengas of certain assets among its public
securit7 holders, after which there would remain no claiIts against Gengas except those held by the
Trustees of Agecorp who proposed to turn in all their securities of, and claims against, Gengas
and receive in exchange an entire issue of new commonstock.
Hearings on the joint plan have
been completed and the matter is under advisement.

Section II (b) (2) proceedings were directed to Virginia Puhlic Service Company,a subsidiary of General Gas and Electric Corporation (Gengas), on August 12, 1941, raising, amongothers,
the issue as to whether the voting power was fairly and equitably distributed amongits security
In answer to these proceedings, Virginia filed a Section 11 (e) plan which, after
holders.
modification, was approved by the Commissionon November2, 1943. 121/ Subsequently, however,
on April ~, 1944, the Commissionissued an order granting applicatrons and whereby, amongother
things, Virginia was merged with Virginia Electric and Power Company,a subsidiary of Engineers

On June 14, 1943, a thoroughgoing reorganization
plan was filed jointly by the Trustee of
Associated Gas and Electric Companyand the Trustees of Associated Gas and Electric Corporation. 126/ The plan, filed pUrsuant to Section 11 (f) of the Act, was designed. to extricate
these cOiipanies from bankruptcy proceedings which have been pending since January 10, 1940 in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of NewYork under Chapter X of the
Bankruptcy Act and to compromise and settle the respective rights of the security holders of
the t ...o companies to the assets nominally held by Agecorp alone. Extensive hearings ...ere held
and oral argument heard.
On April 14, 1944, the Commission entered an order approving the
plan. lZ7/ After the close of the fiscal year, the plan ...as also approved, pursuant to Chapter
X of tneBankruptcy Act, by the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New

On September 30, 1941, the COlIIIIIission
instituted
proceedings under Section 11 (b) (2)
with respect to NewEngland Gas and Electric Association (Negea), a registered holding company.
Subsequent to the close of the hearings but prior to a final order of the Commission, the
Trustees of Ageco and Agecorp and a subsidiary company in the Associated system instituted
suits
1...'1 both a state court and a federal court, in Massachusetts against Negea. The suit in the state
court involved consideration of the status of indebtedness, in the amount of $14,583,2$0, which
bad been cancelled in 1930 through the issuance by Negea of equity securities.
The suit in the
fecieral court involved an accounting for alleged profits received by Negea in, and resulting
from, the transfer of certain stock and indebtedness of Electric Associates, Inc. from Agecorp
to Negea in 1932.

It appeared to the Commission that the subject matter of the suits against Negea were
rglevant to any determination of a proper allocation of securities
under any plan of recapitalifurther proceedings
zation of Negea. Hence, On Fe1n'u.ary17, 1943, the Ca.dasion instituted
under various sections of the Act, including Secti~ 11, for the purpose of determining (1)
nether,
and to ...hat extent, the Trustees of Ageco and Agecorp and its subsidiary had valid
ozla.imsagainst Negea, and (2) in the event that any claiJlB ...ere deemed to be valid, the rank or
such clai:as in relation to the claims of pnbllely-held securities
of Negea. 128/
The issues in this matter ...ere subsequently broadened to include consideration of whether
and to what extent the Trustees of Ageco and Ageeorp, and their subsidiaries,
have claims
against Negea for unjust enrichment as the result of anr transfers or diversions to Negea of
assets of the Associated system. Hearings in the JIIlltter have been completed and argument was
heard. At the cl08e of the fiscal year, the COIIIIIl1ssion'sfindings and opinion and order were

Commissionbad misinterpreted the so-called "incidental business clause" of Section 11 (b) (1).
The Court intimated also that Engineers must be given a further right to designate the principal
integrated utility
system Which it desired to retain.
Both Engineers and the Commissionfiled
petitions for writs of certiorari

The United Corporation

On July 28, 1941, the Commissioninstituted
proceedings under Sections II (b) (1) and
11 (b) (2) with respect to The United Corporation, and consolidated such proceedings for hearing
with United's Section 11 (e) plan filed in March 1941. In its plan, United proposed to reduce
its holdings in each of its statutory subsidiaries to less than 10 percent of the outstanding
voting securities when such reduction would be advantageous in the opinion of its management.
Pending such reduction, United proposed to refrain from voting the securities without the prior
approval of the Commission. The predominant portion of United's portfolio comprises the common
stocks of four holding companysubsidiaries:
The United Gas ImprovementCompany,PUblic
Service Corporation of NewJersey, Niagara HudsonPower Corporation, and Columbia Gas & Electric
Corporation.
On August 14, 1943, after extensive hearings, the Commissiondisapproved United's
plan, and, pursuant to Section 11 (b) (2), ordered that United change its existing capitalization
to one class of stock and cease to be a holding company. 163/

provided for the exchange of substantially
all of its holdings of the commonstocks of PhiladeJphia Electric Companyand De1alrare Power & Light Companyplus cash for approximately one-hali of
its outstanding preferred stock. 164/ The plan was subsequently amendedto provide for the

the capital stock of Consolidated. The latter stock was then distributed to the commonstockholders of Standard Oil as a dividend and subsequent to such distribution,
Standard Oil was

the C~s1on
approved a cCllllpl'8hensive-pIan of reorganization
of Laclede Gas, involving, among
other th1Dgs, a substantial reduction in the debt of Laclede Gas, the elimination of preferred
stock arrears, the conversion of its outstanding preferred and commonstocks into a single class
of stock, and the divestment by Ogden of it.s int.erest. in Laclede upon consummation of the reorganization.
The CCBIIIl1ss1on
also approved that portion of the plan which provided for the discharge
and satisfaction
of the compa.ny's bonds by pa,ment in cash of their full principal amount but
without the premium payable in the event of voluntary redemptions, the Commissionfinding that
the retirement of the bonds was not IIvoluntaryt' but was due to the compulsion of section 11 of
the Act. The order or the Ce:-dssion approving the plan was confirmed in an opinion handed down
on August 25, 1944 by Judge Hulen of the United states District Court for the Eastern Division
of the East.ern District of Missouri.
Since certain of the holders of such bonds had indicated
their intention to appeal fran the CODIIission and the Court's decision in regard to the nonpaYJlBDtof the redempt;ion premiums, Laclede Gas, in order to consummatethe plan while such
appeals were pending, amended the plan to provide for the deposit in escrow of sufficient
funds
to pay such prem1UJ11S in the event that it should be ultimately determined that the premiums were
due and payable.
By order ~ted December 2, 1944, the Commissionapproved the plan as so

Lone star

Gas Corporation

On March 4, 1942, the CODIIII1asion
instituted
proceedings under Section 11 (b) (1) with
regard to the Lone star Gas holding company sytem and consolidated such proceedings with a plan
filed by Lone star under section 11 (e) providing for a comprehensive system reorganization.
By
order dated OCtober 22, 1942 the COIIIDi8sionapproved such plan and directed Lone Star to divest
itaelf' of its interests
iJt CouncU Bluffs Gas Company,Northern Natural Gas Company, and the
Oe1YeSton and El Paso Gas properties of Texas Cities Gas Company. Prior to the past fiscal
Jear Lone Star effectuated the .. jor portion of its reorganizaion program including the mentioned
diveat.ents
and dur1Dg the year COD8UJllll8.ted
the remainder of its plan. 179/

As a result or the effec~tiOn
of its Section 11 (e) plan, Lone star's
operations are now
confined to an integrated natural. 'gas system, including production, transmission and distribution
fac1l1ties6
Its corporate structure has been greatly simplified; the Delaware holding company
(Lone star Gas Corporation) has been eliminated, and, in place of five operating subsidiaries,
the SJBtem now consi,sts of a single transmission and distribution
company (Lone star Gas Company,
a Texas corporation) which has only one subsidiary (Lone star Producing Company, also a Texas
corporation) operating all the production fac1l1ties
of the system. Lone Star's capitalization
nOlrconsists only of bank 108IUland a single class of commonstock.
In addition, pursuant to
its plan, Lone star eliminated approxi:mately $20,000,000 of questionable items from its combined
property accounts.
The companywas the first major holding company system to comply completely
wi,th section 11 (b) and is nOlrno longer subject to the Act as a holding company.

PART IV
PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS
UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKijUPTCY ACT. AS AMENDED
Ji

!

1

Chapter X o.r the Bankruptcy Act~ as amended in 1938~ affords appropriate machinery for the
reorganization of corporations (other than railroads) in the Federal courts under the Bankl
ruptcy Act. The CCXIIIIl1asion
s duties
under Chapter X are~ first~ at the request or with the
&ppl'OV'alof the court~ to act as a participant in proceed1ngs thereumer in order to provide~
for the court and investors~ independent~ expert assistance on matters arising in such proceed1ngs~ and second~ to prepare~ for the benefit of the courts and investors~ formal advisory reports on plans of reorgan1zation submitted to it by the court in such proceedings.
The Commission has DOright of appeal in arq such proceeding~ although it may participate in appeals
taken by others.
COMMISSION FUNCTIONS

UNDER CHAPTER X

The 5ecur1ties ExcllllTJg8 Act directed the COIlIIIl18sion
to make a study and investigation
of the activities
of reorganization committees in connection with the reorganization or persons and properties and to report the results of its study and its reeommeDdationsto Congress.
The eight parts of the report prepared by the Commissionunder that directive are:
"strategy
and Techniques of Protectift
and Reorganization Ccmmitteesn~ "Committees and Conflicts of
Interest",
"CClIIIIII1ttees
for the Holders of Real Estate Bonds" ~
 "Committees for the Holders of
lIUn1cipal and Quasi-llUnicipal Obligations" ~
 "Protective Committees and Agencies for Holders of
Deraulted Gove1'Dlll8ntal
Bcmds"~ "Trl18tees under Indentures. ~
 "lIaDagementPlans Without Aid of
Comm1ttees"~
 and nA SUmmary of the La1r Pertaining to EquitY"and Ba.nkraptcY"
Reorganizations and
of the CCImD18eion's
Conclusions and Recommendationsn•
The report brought to light a multitude of abuses, of which man;y people bad. been more or
less aware in a general way, that 1I8re injurious to investors and incompatible with the public
interest.
EmphasiB was placed upon the fact that reorganization
and protective committees~
1Ih1chwere supposed to mobilize security holders for group action for their own best interests,
1I8re .frequently fo:nped, controlled and used by insiders to protect or further their own interests instead.
These disclosures gave impetus to a reform of the National Banlcru.ptcy Law
in 1938 and to the enactment of the Trust Indenture .lct of 1939. Representatives of the CQIDJliaaion assisted in drattiDg this legislation and testified before Congressional COIIIIII1ttees
in
support of it.

Corporations in f1DaDcial distress are placed under the custody of Federal courts in order
tbat creditors JJJJq be held off and the corporation enabled to continue in operation until a
plan of 1'1naDc1al readjustment can be effected, or until it is determined that DOplan is possible.
In JIIBJV' cases~ a reorganisation that assures the continuation in business of the corporation may be more desirable tor creditors in realising on their cl.a:1:msthan immediate
liquidation.
Section 77B, passed in 1935 as an amendmentto the Bankruptcy Act, had signally improved
e:.d.n1Dg reorganization macbine17 but had DOt remedied certain fundamental defects.
It conta.ined DOetfectiT8 provision for a disinterested analysis of the causes o.r corporate
tailure or for an estimate of the honesty and competence of management. The section stipulated
that a reorganisation plan should not be approved unless found to be fair ~ equitable aDd feasible bat prorlded no etfective procedure for maJdng the information necessary to such a finding
available to either the judge or the securitY' holders.

previoueq

On June 22, 1938, Pres1d8nt Rooaev8J.t apprond the comprehensive revision of the BankrIlptcy Act, referred to above, 1Ih1ch is known as the Clumdler Act after its sponsor, former
CongreS8llBD Walter C. Chandler of Tennessee.
Chapter X of this Act succeeds section 77B and
etrects. number ot 1mproV'8IIi8I1ts
in the reonanization
of corporations (other than railroads).
Chapter X requires, in each case inYolviDg"a corporation ot substantial
size, that a disintere8ted truatee ~ appointed to be primari.q responsible for the operation o.r the business,
to probe and enJ:iiate the C8UHS of the debtor's failure, to appraise the ab1l1tyand fidelitY'
of its ~
aDd to be responsible tor the formulation and fillDg of a plan o.r reorganizatioD 1Ih1oh will .. t the test of 1ntol"Ed judicial scrutiny.
If approved by the judge ~ the
plan is subI1tted to the security bo1.ders for approval or rejection.
'

- JJY7 Cbapter X places two respcms1b1lities upon the Commissionby providing (1) that, if requested by the judge or on its own initiative
if the judge approves, the Commissionsha.11 be a
pert;1.ci.pant in proceedings thereunder in order to provide independent, expert assistance and
(2) that the judge shall, if the indebtedness of the debtor exceeds $3,000,000 and may, if the
1DdebtedDessdoes not exceed that amount;, submi.t to the COIIIIllission
for advisory reports all
plans of reorganization which the judge deems wortby' of consideration.
In practice, the services reudered by the CClIIIII:iss1on
UDder these two provisions of the Act are complementary.
The role of the Cammiss10nUDder Chapter X differs

trom that under the other Acts pursuant
the proceedings, hold its 0Im
haarl:ogs or adopt rules and regulations, but acts, as the representative
of investors and as an
a1.d'to the court, in a purely advisory capacity.
It has no authority either to veto or to require the adoption of a reorganization plan.
It has no authority to remer decisions on any
or the other issues in a proceeding.. '!'be facilities of its technical staff and its :iJllpartial

to wb1ch it operates in that the C<lDmiss1on
does not initiate

in a b:i.gbly C<lIIIp1exarea of corporate

la1r and finance.

To aid in attaining these objectives the Commissionhas stationed qualified staffs of
1aII;yers, accountants and analysts in its regional offices, where they can keep in close touch
lIith all hear:ihgs and issues in the proceedings and with the parties,
and be readily avajJab1e

during the year, in 9 of which

As of June 30, 1944, the COlIIIIIission
was actively participating
in 106 reorganization proceed:i.ngs involving 131 companies (106 principal debtors and 25 subsidiary debtors) with stated
assets aggregating $1,'729,317,000 and stated indebtedness totaling $1,098,914,000. AppeDd:1x
Table 16, Part 1classifies
these debtors, together with their assets and 1Ildebtedness, according to their respective industries,
and Appendix Table 16, Part 2 distributes them according to
the size of their respective indebtedness.
Upon becomillg a party to a reorganization,
the Commissionimmediately begins to obtain and
analyze all available i.nf'ormation concerning the debtor and its affairs.
It assembles essential
information with regard to the physical and i'1nanc1al condition of the company, its past operating performance, the reasons :for its :f1nanCial di:fficult1es,
the quality of its management, and
the approximate value of its properties.
This information is obtained from several sources:
the trustee,. and the various interested partieS:1 the books and records of the company, witnesses
examined in court, and the independent research of the analytical staff of the Commission into
general economic factors affecting the particular :i.ndustr;y and the competitive conditions faced
by the company.
As a party to the proceeding the Commissionis represented at all important hearings and,
on appropriate occasions, IDes legal and analytical DI8JIIOranda
in support of its views with respect to the various problems ar1a1ng in the proceeding. Of equal, if not greater, importance,
however, is the regular participation
by the Commission's attorneys and ~s
in informal
conferences and discussions with the parties in an endeavor to work out solutions to problems
in advance of formal hearing and argument. In this way the .COJIIII1ssion
has often been able to
bring facts, arguments or alternative suggestions to the attention of the parties, wh1ch they
bad not previously considered, and parties have otten been prompted thereafter to lIIOdif7 their
proposed action.
In general, the CCIIIII1ssion
has found these informal round table d1scu8sions
an effective means for cooperation aDd of great valuq in expediUng the proceeding.

There is a multitude of diverse questions with 1Ih1.chthe CCllllllissionis concemed as a party
to a Chapter X proceeding. A fetr of the more important _tters
which have arisen are discussed
in the following paragraphs.

Problems in Adm1n1stration of Estate
An important part of the activities
of the C<lllDliss1on
relates to the indepeDdent trustee.
The independent trustee bas the duty of eXElm1ning
into the history of the debtor, ascertaining
its fiIlancial and managerial problems and 1'uture prospects, and fol"lllUlat1Dgthe plan of reorganization.
In addition, such trustees bear the priJDar;y reapons1b1l1ty :for the operation ot
the business during the reorganization period.
It is therefore obvious that the success of the
reorganization depends largely upon the thoroughne88 aDd II1dll with which be perf01"ll8his duties.

lJitllout in srq way usurping the .functions or controll1Dg the activities
of the tl'Wltee the
COi!llDi.ssion
is able to be of considerable ass1st8nce to h1m. In addition, the Camnissionls
presence has emphasised for trustees and their counsel the 1mportance of their 1'tmctions and the
necessi.ty that their duties be performed -dth thoroughness, :1Ddependenceand efficieDcy.
As an essential
element in the proper conduct Of reorgam.ations,
the statute prescribes
certain standards of dis1nterestedDeslS 1Ih1.chJIll18t be met bT trustees appointed UDderChapter x.
In the light of these standards the Cam1ssion carei'ulq examines the qual1i'ications of trustees.
In several cases sufficient
evidence of conflicting interests was developed to warrant an appearauce by the CCIIIIII1ssion
betore the judge for the purpose of urging the removal of trustees.
In JIlOstof these cues the trustees either resigned or were removed by the court attar bearing.

Undertbe statute the court can, in 1UIIl8WI1 cues,

designate

as an additional. trustee an

officer, director, or employee ot the debtor, but ~
for the purpoM of u8istiDg in the
operation of the basiness.
The CClIIIIII1ssion
bas urged that. this 8hcu1d be doDe on:q in tb8

exceptional case and has, in several instances, taken the position that the appointment of
an additional trustee was unnecessary. The Camnission has also undertaken to prevent the encroachment by the additional trustee upon the functions of the disinterested trustee.
For
example, the Commissionsuccessfu1.ly objected to the participation by the additional trustee,
in one case, in the preparation of the trustee's report under Section 167 and, in another case,
in the preparation of a plan. Likewise, the Camnission's objection to an order 1Ihichwould
have deprived the independent trustee of the power to participate in the operation of the business was upheld. Although the additional trustee may be a memberof the old management,the
Commissionhas urged that such appointees be free from interests adverse to the estate.
Th18
position was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in an appeal in
lIh1ch the Commissionparticipated in proceedings for the reorganization of Realty Associates
Securities Corporation.

?:I

The Commissionhas at all times urged fUll compliance with Section 167 (5) of the Act
which requires the trustee to report to the security holders as to his investigation of the
property, liabUities,
and financial condition of the debtor, the operation of its business and
the desirability of the conti.mlancethereof.
It is felt that such reports are necessary not
only to enable the security holders to make suggestions for a plan but also to give them the
necessary information for determiniJ::lgthe desirability of accepting proposed plans. The Commissionl s staff has often consulted with trustees upon problems arising in connectdon'Withthe
preparation of such reports and has been able to provide trustees with information useful in
carrying out their duties. For example, as the result of its E:Xperiencein reorganizations the
Commissionhas been in a position to offer advice to trustees and to courts on such matters as
the scope of the investigation to be made by the independent t,:-.lStees or by accountants hired
by them.

The iJIlportaneeof Co thorough 1nvestigation by the trustee is manifest and the Commission
has called the attention of the trustee, or the court, if' necel:lsary, to any omissions in this
respect.
For example, in the proceedings for the reorganization of Central States Electric
C0alriSation the Commissionurged that a more detailed investigation of possi6lS causes of action
ag
t the former managementbe made. On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit sustained this position.?:/
The Circuit Court also held that the possibility that
statutes of lilIIitations might be pleaded as a defellBe to suite brought by the trustees was not
sufficient ground for denying the :...:questedinvestigation since an exami nation might disclose
facts which would prevent the rumU.ng of the statutes, suit might be brought in a Federal court
of equity where it 18 extremely doubtful that the state statutes would be followed, and, in any
event, the statutes might not be pleaded as a defense. The Court agreed with the Commission
that the investigation ought not to be denied because opposed by a committee of debenture
holders in view of the rights of preferred stockholders; they too had contributed capital to the
corporation which was seeking reorganization and had a vital in1;erest in ~ recovery that m1ght
be had in behalf of the corporation from those whohad mismanagedits affairs.
In another case i.nvolving the pr0vi.8ions of Section 167, the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit adopted the views urged by the Commissionand recognized the responsibilities of a reorganization trustee to make a thorough examination of the financial worth of an individual 'Whowas a personal guarantor of the debtor's bonds and who apparently was also indebted
directly to the debtor.
The court upheld the subpena of books and records relevant to this

In several instances the Commissionhas independently undertaken to investigate into aDd

trustees or to the Court. As a consequence the public investors in lII8JV' cases have benefited

as particularly
concemed with the problem ot the s011citation of assents of security holders to plans of reorgaD1sation prior to appronJ. of SllChplan8 by the courts.

Accordingly, the Commission in a number ot cases objeoted
to s011citations prior to the oourt.s consideration and approval ot a plan. L:1lanrise, the COD1II1ssion bas taken the position that a security holder retains the right to accept or reject a
p1.an of reorganization
in accordaDce with the procedure provided by the statute despite the fact
that the security holder has deposited his security with a protective committee under a deposit

Activities

with Resl'!<?tto Allowances

The Commissionhas taken an active part in the matter of allonnces to the various parties
for services rendered and expenses incurred in the proceeding. In making allowances the courts
seek to protect the estate from exorbitant charges" while at th~ same time providing equitable
treatment to the applicants for allowances. The COJIIID1.ssion
has been able to provide considerable assistance to the courts in this matter.

The Commissionitself receives no a1lonnces from estates in reorganization and is able to
present a wholly disinterested and 1mpartiaJ. view. The Comm:i.ssion
has consi.stently tried to secure a limitation of the total compensation to an 8DIO\UJt which the estate can feae1bly' pay. In
each case the CODDD1ssion
also makes a ~ful
st~
of the applications of the various parties
to the end that unnecessary duplication of services shall not be recompensed and that compensation shall be allocated on the basis of the work done by each claimant aDd his relative contribution to the adminiBtration of the estate and the formulation of a plan. With these objectives
in mind the COlIIII1ssion
DJJq undertake to make specific recamnendations to the courts where the
COIIIIIli.ssion
bas been a party throughout the proceeding and is thoroughly .tam1
J j a.r with the activities
of the various parties and all significant developoents in the proceedings} in other
cases where it bas entered the proceeding at an advanced stage the CommissionDJJq undertake to
advise the court general:l3 as to the reasonableness of the requested amounts.
The Commissionparticipated in JIlBDy appeals concerning allowances where important questioaa
were involved. Illustrative
of this phase of the COIIIIIission'swork are cases involving Section
249 of Chapter X. In otis & C~

INSTITUTION

OF CHAPTER X PROCEEDINGS

The Commissionhas striven for a liberal interpretation of the provisions of the Bankruptcy
Act so that the benefits of Chapter X may be made :1'u.lly available to security holders in accordance with the spirit and intent of the statute.
For example, in Brook1~ Trust COJIIf~ v .
R. A. seiat2" Holdings~.,
B/ the Commissionurged that Congress ill nded to gJ.vepersons
noldiiig c
against 'the property of the debtor, as dicttiinguished fre::. claims against the
debtor itself, the right to file an involuntary petition UDderChapter X. The district court
Bustained this position and the Circuit Court of AppeaJ.sfor the Second Circuit affirmed.
The possibility that the investor safegu.arde of Chapter X might be nullified by an
improper resort by a corporation to proceedings under Chapter XI arose soon after Chapter X became effective.
It was the Commission'Sopinion that only the provisions of Chapter X were
properly available for the reorganization of corporations with securities in the hands of the
public and that Chapter XI was the proper med.1um. for securing arrangements or compositions of
unsecured indebtedness by individuals or corporations with no public investor interest.
The
Commissionintervened in a proceeding for an arrar.gement under Chapter XI filed by the United
states Realty and ImprovementCO!!IP8Dl.
wb:ichhad outstanding in the hands of the public 900,000
shares of stock and two series of debentures aggregating over $2,300,000. The debtor was also
liable as guarantor upon $3,710,500 of mortgage certificates.
The Commissionmoved to vacate
the order approving the debtor's petition and..to dismiss the proceeding. Uponappeal,
the
United States SUpremeCourt sustained the position of the Commission,holding that since the
provisions of Chapter XI were not adequate to secure to public :investors the safeguards
necessary for the coIl8UJlllll&tion
of a fair, equitable and feasible plan of reorganization and
since the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act contemplated that the reorganization of such debtors
should take place under Chapter X, the district court, as a court of equity, shouJ.d have dismissed the petition, thus relegating the debtor, if it were so inclined, to the initiation of a
proceeding under Chapter X. The SupremeCourt also held that the order permitting the Commission to intervene in a Chapter XI proceeding for the purpose of moving its dismissal was
properly entered.

that the petition had not been filed in good faith because the interests of creditors would be

In another case the COIIIIIIission

UNDER CHAPI'ER X

The ult1Jllate objective of a reorganization
18 the formulation and coIlSUUlll&tion
of a fair
and feasibl.e plan of reorganization.
Acco~,
the most iJIIportant function of the CODIUis"Jion
under Chapter X is to aid the courls in achieving this objective.

Fairness
In appraising the fairness of reorganization plans, the Commissionhas at all times taken
the position that fu11 recognition must be accorded claims in order of their legal and contractual priority, either in cash or new securities or both, and that junior claimants may par-

ticipate

only to the extent that the debtor's

properties

have value after

the satisfaction

of

prior cla1ms or to the extent that they make a fresh contribution necessary to the reorganisation of the debtor. Hence, a valuation of the debtor is necessary to provide the basiw for
judging the fairness 88 well 88 the feasibility
of proposed plans of reorganization.
In its
advisory reports, in hearings before the courts, and in conferences with parties to proceedings,
the COJIIIIIission
has consistently stated that the proper method of valuation for reorganization

purposes is pr1mari1y an appropriate capitalization

1mportaDce and eign:1f:l.canceof theee questions the COIIIIIIission
has made a caretal study of the
facts in situations 1Ibere they arise and on several occuions bas urged that the principles of
SDbordiDation or limitation to cost be applied in favor of the public iIIvestors.

aatters with si~tions

Fea8i.bility

A1thoagh the representatives of security holders .t'requen~ regard the fairness of the plan
as their pri.nc1pal concern, the provisions of the statute and the protection of investors' interests require also that the plan be feasible.
To be feasible, a reorganisation JII18t be

It _t

'the 8lttent to 1Ih1chcurrent reorganizations are attributable to lack ~ feasibilit;r

cases 8QIII9 ,ears hence, 1d.th its attendant expense and injury to investors, the CClIIIII18sion
urges

In this connection, the C<DIission is par't1calarq concerned 1d.th the adequacy' of working capital, the relationship of funded debt and

ADITISORY REPORTS

t"

Although the preparation ot an advisory -report is not the major part of the activity of the
COIIIIIIi.ssion
in any particular case, such reports, because of their wide distribution,
bulk large
in the minds of the public.
Generally speaJdng, an advisory report is prepared only in connection with a proceeding involving significant problems and a relatively large COJIJP8PY in which
the investing public bas a substantial interest.
Ap~tely
twenty fonual advisory reports
aDd several supplemental reports have been tiled.
Even though the COIIIIlIission
does not file a fOl'liJ81advisory report, it does, in all cases in
1Ibich it is a participant,
advUe the court of its opinion with respect to any plan of reorganization under consideration by' the court.
After the trustee has t1led a plan, the customar;y procedure calls for a bear1Dg at which
"this and any other plans that ~
 have been tiled are considered.
At this stage of the proceeding, the attorneys representing the Ccwpiuion are concerned primarily with getting into the
record sufticient data (1) to enable the judge to decide whether any proposed plan is worthy of
consideration and (2) to supply the tactual. basis tor the report of the COIIIDi.ssion.If the
judge finds one or more of the plans .~
of consideration, it or they ma:y be referred to the
CClIIIDI1Bsion
for report.
An advisory report provides the court with an expert independent appraisal of the plan indicating in dstail the extent to which, in the opinion of the Commission, it meets, or falls to
meet, the standarda ot fairness and feasibility.
After the report is filed and copies are made
available to the parties who have appeared at the proceedings, the judge considers the approval,
modification, or disapproval of the Plan. If the judge approves the plan, it goes to the security holders for acceptance or rejection accOlJlP8Died
by a copy of the judge I s opinion and a copy
of the report of the Commission, or a 8UJIID81'7 thereof prepared by the Commission. The report of
the Commission, therefore, while not biDding, aids both the judge and the security holders in
determining whether or not to approve a plan.

PART V
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE TRUST INDENTURE

ACT OF 1939

The Trust IDdenture Act of 19.39requires that bonds, notes, debentures, and similar securities publicly ofi"ered tor sale, sold, or delivered after sale through the mails or in interstate cCIIIIIIerCe,
except as specU~
exempted by the Act, be issued under an indenture which
I188ts the requ1rement8 of the Act and has been ~
qualified with the CClDIDission.The stand&t'd8 of the Act 0Iltla1r JIIBDY' provisions previously incorporated in indentures to exculpate the
trutee.
The Act is designed to iDBure that he will act on behalf of the bond or debenture
owners and to in8ure h1a cc:aplete independence of the issuer and the underwriters.
The prorleiODBof the Securities Act of 1933 and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 are so integrated that
reg:l.8tration pursuant to the securities Act of 1933 of such securities to be issued under a
trust indenture shall not be permitted to beCOJll8 effective unless the indenture conforms to
the specUic statutory requirements expressed in the Trust Indenture .Act of 1939. The indenture is 8UtaD&tic~ .qual11'ied. when registration becaDes effective as to the securities
them8eJ.ves.
EHACTYEN'1' AND SCOPE OF THE ACT

The Trust Indenture Act of 1939, approved August 3, 19.39, is the second or the two
ts
statutes which resulted trca the CClIDI1issionstud1"
and investigation of protective and reorganization CClIIIDittee8.It was designed to correct certain defects which had existed in
trust 1ndentures aDd to proride _ana whereby the rights and interests
of security holders
caD be aore errect1~
sareguarded. In order to accomplish tb1.s objective, the Act provides
that issues ot bood8, notes, debentures aDd s:llll:1lardebt securities exceeding one million
-dollirs in pr1Dcipal 8IIOUIlt, except certain classes wh1ch are specU1c~
8DIIlpted, mq not

The Ccadssion has no ~
with respect to the
eDtorc8lBlt of the provisiODB of the iDdenture.
Its cm.ly functiODBUDder the Act are to see
that the trustee 18 eligible and qualU1ed u provided in the Act aDd that the provisiClO8of
each indenture tiled tor qual1fieation conform to the prescribed statutory standards.
The Act
18 based on the theorr that, it the terms of the trust indenture provide adequate protection
tor investors, it is ap}4'OPl'iateto leave the enforcement of such terms to the bondholders
w1thoa.t the cont1Dn1Dgsuperv1BiClllof a governmental agency.
In order to asa1st appli.cants and their attorneys in meeting the requirements of the Act,
the CClDmias10n has made its statf available to discuss with them in advauce of the formal
filing any questions wh1ch may arise and has also encouraged the practice of submitting copies
ts
of proposed indentures ~at: informal preliminary examination. The COIIIII1ss1onstarr
also
cooperated with a group ot trust officers and attorneys famiJ i ar with trust :lndenture problems
aDd practices in the preparation of a so-called "model indenture" to conform to the statutory
provisions, which was printed and 18 in more or less general use. The COIIIIIIission
has also

Obviously, the tzoustee should not be

INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940

OF THE

The Investment C~
Act ot 1940 requires the regi8tration
ot and regu1atee :investment
in the business of investing~ reinvesting~ and
companies~ that is~ companies engaged ~

trading in securities.
The .Act requires~ among other things~ disclosure of the finances and of
the investment policies of these companies~ to aftord investors fUll and complete information
with respect to their activities;
prohibits such companies from changing the nature of their
business or their investment policies without the approval of the stockholders; bars persons
guilty of security frauds :from serving as ofticers and directors of such companies; prevents
underwriters~ investment banlrers~ and brokers .from constituting more than a minority of the
directors of such companies; requires managementcontracts in the first instances to be submitted to security holders tor their approval; prohibits transactions between such companies
and their officers and directors and other insiders except on the approval of the Commission;
forbids the issuance of senior securities of such companies except in specified instances; and
prohibits pyramiding of such companies and cross ownership of their securities.
The Commission
is authorized to prepare advisory reports upon plans of reorganizations of registered investment compan:ies upon request or such companies or 25 percent or their stockholders and to institute proceedings to enjoin such plans if they are grossly unfair. The Act also requires raceamount certificate
companies to maintain reserves adequate to meet maturity payments upon their
certificates.
ENACTMENT OF INVJSSTMENT CO.uPANY ACT
An important segment or the Commission's work since 1935 has been its st~

questionnaires and frOm field studies and public examinations of ~

companies. From the data
thus obtained, an overall report on iuvestment trusts and imestment companies and six supplemental reports were prepared and transmitted to the Congress together with the Commission's
conclusions and recOIIIID8ndations.

!I

The Act~ which 1188 approved on August 22, 1940 and became gener~
efrective on November
1~ 1940, 1188 eTolved !rom a bUl which was based upon the conclusions and recOlllllll9Odat1ons
of
the COIIIIIlission. The" -leg1slation~ as adopted, 1188 desired by the iuvestment trust industry
itself.
The terms and provisions of the compromise bill were worked. OI1tin coni"erence between
representatives
of the 1.Jldustry and the COIIIIII1ssion
with the app1'OT8l of the Congressional C~
mittees concerned. The industry recognized the existence of abuses and it joined in urging the
passage of the Act. It passed both Houses without a TOte against it.
BACKGROUND OF THE ACT

Investment trusts and investment companies are essent1al.JJ institutions
which prOTide a
mediumfor public iuvestment in commonstocks and other securities.
They have -:rorged as :important :f1nanc1a1 institutions
on4r within the last 20 years. 'By 1929 they 'h4'9 being created
at the rate of almost ODe a day- and the American public had iDvested altogether almost
$7,000,000,000 in iuvestment canpanies of all types.
Arter the market crash of 1929, the substantial losses suffered by' closed-end management iuvestment conq»n1es acted as an :l.mped1ment
to the fUrther distribution
of their securities,
and the rise of other types of companjes 1188
accelerated.
The open-end management companies and the unit iuvestment trusts rap1d:q increased
the sales of their securities
arter 1930. Although taee-amoant certificate
companies have been
in existence since lS94, the greater portion of their certificates
have ~n
sold since 1929.
Finally~ since 1930, periodic ~nt
plans have attracted
the savings ot a large number of 10divich1a1a in the lower income strata of the country's population.
The present assets of all
iDvestment compam,es have a value in excess of appra:dmately $2,000,000,000.
The securities
ot
such companies are owned by approximately 2,000,000 1DYestors throughout this country, probably
exceeding the number of investors in all other iDduetries except utility ho1d:1ngCOJDP8.Dl'
systems.

in Part XI under

-120Investment trusts and :investment companies are vital.ly associated with the national
economy. They conduct their business by the use of the mails and the channels of interstate
and foreign commerce. In numerous cases they conduct a substantial portion of their business
in states othel" than those 10 which they are incorporated or otherwise created.
Their security
holders are situated 10 every state and 10 several foreign countries.
A large portion of all.
corporate securities sold 10 this country are those of :investment trusts and investment companies.
Investment companies are aJ.so substantial purchasers of securities listed on nat10nal
securities exchanges" and their trading mJJ:1" have an important effect on the price movements of
securities.
The enterprises
subject to the control and i.n.f'l.uenceof :investment companies include banka"
insurance and mortgage financing companies" aviation and steamship companies" oU producing aDd
ref1n1ng compan:Jes" chemical companies" motion-picture producing and exhibiting companies" steel.
and rubber companies" food and food products companies" maPUf'acturing companies of all t~s"
department stores and other merchandising companies engaged in sales of their wares by maU
order and the channels of interstate
commerce.

A most significant
.tunction of investment compan1.esin relation to the immediate needs of
economy is their potential usetulness in the supply of new capital to industry"
In this connection" the Investment COJDP&DiY
Act

contains provisions IJec. 12 (e)7 authorizing investment coJDP,8D1es

which are usually completely
control of such funds offers

of the industry now from the very nature of the assets of investof such companies invariably consist of cash and securities"
assets
liquid and readily negotiable.
Because of these characteristios"
manifold opportunities for exploitation by an unscrupulous

management.

Since no specified amount of capital was required to organise investment trusts and cempanies, they were created and their securities were sold to the public 10 many instances by
irresponsible
indiv1duals.
Btokers, security dealers, 'investment bankers, and commercial banlat
were in a position to dominate the board of directors and control the managementof investment
companies; and thus" when they' were unscrupulous, to advance ;the pecuniary interest of their
other businesses at the expense of the investment compan1es they had organized and the security
holders.
The securities
Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 19.34have been ineffective to
correct abuses and deficiencies 10 investment companies; first" because the record is clear that
publicity alone" lIh1ch 10 generalis
the remedy'prov1ded by these acts" 18 insufficient
to
eliminate the abuses and de£iciencies which exist in investment companies,t. and second, because a
large number of such companies have never come under the purview' of these AQtis.

It is not meant to imply that most :investment trusts and investment companies at present
operating in this country were guilty of unfair practices or 1I'ere m:Jsmanaged. Nor is it me.
to indicate that progress has not been made by the I118J11bers
of the 1ndustr;y vol1llltari:Qr to
e11m;Jnate some of the major abuses and deficiencies,
and to improve generally standards of
practice.
However, virtually
every representative
of investment companies who appeared before
Act of 1940 conceded the
the subcommittees of Congress considering the Investment COIIIp8I1y
necessity for" and in .fact urged the i:IIIlIediate passage of, effective legislation
to regulate investment cOlllp8D1eJ!.

A distinctive

These plans are, in essence, devices for selling investment trust or investment colllp&n1'
securities on a perioc11c or 1nstallmen.t plan basis. The holder ot a perioc11c payment plan certificate
is entitled to recei'Y8 only'the asse1; value ot his certificate.

ts
The CClIIIIII18sionstudy
1nd1cated that "the lapse experience of investors in such securities
was high, particul.arly during the first and second years when the investor had no surreDier
value or a surrender value substanti.ally less than the total of the amount he had paid (although
the cert:lf1cates issued by' some of the face-amount companies provided for reinstatement w:lth
credit for the 8DlOlUIl; paid in). The so-called. .stretch-out.
practice of depriving the investor
pursuant to contract of ~
 interest return on his entire investment during any period in which
he has been in default was common. Furthermore, surrender values accrued only as of yearly
anniversary dates of the certLi'icates.
),{on~ payments less than a year and interest on the
last attained surrender value would not increase the surrender value above the preceding
anniversary date. As a result of the variety in regulatory provisions, of the many states in

GENERAL PURPOSES

AND PROVISIONS

OF THE INVESTJ.!ENT COllPANY ACT OF 1.940

The Act regulates three broad categories of investment companieSI Kanagementinvestment
campan1.es(both open-end and closed-end), face-amount certificate
companies and unit investment
trusts incl.ud1.ng those which issue periodic payment plan cert11'icates.
The objectives of the
Act, five in number, are, in the main, achieved by' affirmative statutory requirements or prohibitions.
By and l.arge the rule and regulation mak1ng powers of the COIIIII1ss1on
are cord'ined to
implementation of the affirmative requirements of the Act.
(1.) Honest and Unb1.aaed!!ar!agement
The Act prov1des for a degree of independence in managementpersonnel by'restricting

bankers, brokers, COJlllllercial.
bankers, principal. underwriters, etc., who may' have a possible bias
in the managementof the cOJllP8X1Y,

AmmiISTRlTION

OF THE IIVES'l'IIENT

COKPAHY M:r OF 1940

In part, perbaps because tbe statute was the result 01' a compromise, but in greater measure
because 01' tbe d1.ftrsity in the character 01' the companies it covers and the intricacy- ot the
probleu theT present, the .let is a complex and elaborate piece 01' legislation,
calling for the
use of a great T8rietT of acJm1n:Jstratift procedures and tecbn1ques.
The Act contains tlat
stat1lto17 prohibitions,
the violation
ot which may gift rise to either injunctive or criminal
proceed1nga in the courts} prorl.s1oDa which authorize the COIIIIIl1.asion
to institute
1njunctift

-1.24proceedings but the violation of which is not a crimi na] offense; requirements for filiDg
financial and other data with the Commission,which is then open to public inspection; requirements for the transmission of financial and other data to security holders; provisions authorizing the Commissionto render advisory reports to security holders; provisions authorizing the
Commissionto adopt rules and regulations in some circumstances for the purpose of giving content to statutory prohibitions which wouJ.dotherwise be inoperative and in other circumstances
for the purpose of relaxing statutory prohibitions 1Ibich would otherwise obtain; provisions for
administrative orders in proceedings initiated in somecases by the Collllll18sion
and. in other
cases by the companies or persons affected; and provisions for the further study of certain
aspects of iIIvestment companyoperations.
Most of these procedures have been employed in the
same or a comparable form in one or more of the statutes already administered by the COIIIID18sion,
so that no difficulties
have been encountered in fitting the administration of the new Act into
the fr8DIe'Work
of the Commission's previous practice.
The principal problems faced by the Commissionduring its administration of the Act can
are incouveniently be grouped into seven categories, namely, (1) determining which co~s
vestment companies subject to the Act and which are not iIIvestment companies or are entitled to
exemption; (2) the classification
of companies subject to the Act; (3) prescribing the information to be filed with the Commissionand that to be transmitted to security holders and the integration of the required information with that furnished under other Acts administered by the
Commissionso as to avoid duplication; (4) the administration and enforcement of those provisions of the Act which regulate the relationships and transactions of persons who are affiliated with iIIvestmant cQDP8njes; (5) matters relating to the distribution,
redemption, and repurchases of securities issued by managementcompanies; (6) reorganizations of investment companies; and (7) the treatment accorded certain special types of companies, such as unit investment trusts, periodic payment plans, and face-amount certificate
companies.
The "IDvestment Companyttconcept
Although the terms "iIIvestment compan;yt'and "1IIvestment trust" have been part of the
language of the financial communitY'
for some tjme, a ~f1nition precise enough to distinguish
them sharply from holding companies on the one hand and operating companies on the other did not
exist prior to the enactment of the Investment CompanyAct of 1940. The distinctive
feature of
the Act in this connection is its use of a quantitative or statistical
definition, expressed in
terms of the portion of a company's assets which are investment securities.
Thus the statute
provides, inter alia, that a compa.n;yis an "investment company"if it is engaged in the business
of investing, reiIIvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities,
and owns investment securities (defined to exclude securities of majorit~d
subsidiaries and of other investment
companies) exceeding 40 percent of its total assets (exclusive of GovernmentseCUX'ities and cash
items) •
 However, the Act provides machinery whereby the COIIIIIIission
may declare by order upon
application that a compaJ:l;T,
notwithstanding the quantitative definition, is nevertheless not an
investment compaIly. ThUS,companies that believe the application of the quantitative test would
unreasonably cause them to be classified as investment companies are given the OpPOrtunitY'of
obtajnjng administrative dispensation bY'showing that they are pr1marilyengaged in a business
or businesses other than that of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trad11:lgin securities, either d1rectly or through majority-owned subs1d1ar1es or through controlled companies
cODducting similar t;ypes of businesses.
Since November1, 1940 about
such applications have
been f11.ed. Knotty questions have been raised by these applications, including difficult and
complicated PrOblems of valuation especially with respect to the so-called 11 special situation-

'0

companies.

Such an application was filed on behalf of a company',Bankers Securities Corporation, whose
portfolio contained securities of companies engaged in a great variety of enterprises,
railroads, utilities,
banks, newspapers, insurance c<mlp8n1es,industrial companies of every kind,
hotels, apartment houses, retail establishments, department stores, and ma.n;r others. Extensive
hearings were held before a trial examiner, briefs were filed and oral argument was had before
the COJIIIission.

The compa1l;1
contended that it was primarily engaged in the real estate and department store
business because the bulk of its investments were in those fields.
Based upon the history and
operations of the c~,
its investments in special situations,
its statements of polic;y, and
other relevant factors, the Commissionconcluded not only that the record ~fore it .tell short;
of sustai ni ng the claim that the cOJDP&DiY
was primarily engaged in non-1nvestment co~
business but that the record demonstrated affirmatively that the applicant was organized and al~

-,

- 125 bad been operated as an investment enterprise.
The applicant appealed fran the order of the
CCIIIDission deD;ying the application to the United states Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third
Cil'cui:t. On November21, 1944 that Court unanimously: affirmed the COIIIIIIi8sion'sorder.

Persons

In order to iD8ure that the interests
of all classes of security holders are paramount in
the operation of :1mestment companies, the Act contains a number of provisions imposing l1m1tat10na and prohibitions with respect to the eligibility
and activities
of persons affiliated
with investment cmpanj 8S and the transactions of such aff'111ated persons with those ccep8n1es.
It 18 in relation to these provisions that the COJIIII18sion
is delegated some of its most
11IIportant adm1 n1strat1ve !'lmctions under the Act.

Elig1b1l1tyof

Officers and Directors.

First, there 18 the provision that a person J1JB7 not serve as an officer or director of or
perfora certain other !'lmct1ons for a regj.stered cQlllP8Di1
it he bas been convicted of certain
crimes imrolving security tralisactions,
or if by reason or 81m1lar m1scondl1ct bas been enjo1J1ed
fran specified activities.
1'he Commission is directed to give relief from those prohibitions
1IDderproper ci.rcums1oaDcesby order upon application.
Transactions with InYestment

C'?'5""'jes.

By far the JIlCst 1JIportant provision ccmcern1ng the actirlties
of affiliated
persoDS 18 that
1Ib1ch, with certain exceptions, prohibits a.rty aft1l1ated person, promoter, or principal underwriter of a registered CCIiiplUQ fran seJHng to, or ~
or borroring property from, the
investment c~
or 8DTcQlllP8Di1
it controls. The prob1b1t1on 18 supplemented by a provision
that the CciIID1as1on
sball 8DIIpt by order under appl1cat1on 8DTproposed tranBactions if en.dance establishes that its terms are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching, 8Dd
that it 18 consistent with the compau.y1srecitals of policy in its reg1strat,ion statement ...
with the general parpos88 of the Act. The disposition or such applications
requires a Dice
balance of con1'l1cting .factors 1Ih1.ch po1nta up the DBed in 8l1Chcases for the revi.eIr of a
8p801al1sed agency. On the 0118 band, in most of the 8ituati.oDs resol."V8d, there was the
I18C8ssity of a ~
datemiDation because the transact10Ds depended a great deal on IiIOV .....
in the aecur:l.ty markets. OIl the other hand, IIlUJl1 of the 18sues involved in the detend.nation of
rairness were of a ccapli.cated nature requ:1.rb!g the t'Ulle8t use or fin@Dc1al aper18Dce and a

ADatber such control is the power vested in the C~ion
to seek an injunction against
8DTperson for gross II1scandDct or gross abuse of traa1i in respect of an;y registered COIIIpRJJT
that such person serves in 8DTof certain designated capacities.
In one 1nstaDce, the CODIBisai.on believed that the manageaent of an 1nvestment COJIP&DlY, with knowledge that they 1nteDded to
dissolve such cOlllpllZl;T,
bad acqu1red substanti.al blocks of the COIIIp8DTls prere:aed stock fran the
public at a cost less than the value of that portion of the &Baets of the colllp811y"
to 1ddch such
stock would be entitled
on d1asol.ution.
At the suggestion of the Commissionthe ma.nagement
agreed to surrender to the cCllP8DlT
the stock they had acquired at a price equivalent to the coat
of such shares to the ma.nagement.
As a result,
the remaining holders of the COJllP8DlTIS prererred

b88ed upon the value of their u:oderlPDg assets and to agree to redeem them at priCes s:lm:Uar:Qbased. Prior to the ~
ot the Act, almost all open-end oompanies determined the market

assets at 3 p.m., the time of the closing of IIIOststock exchanges on

The selliDg price of the shares based on this cCllllP'ltation
re.1ned f'1xed until. 3 p.L cd the DeXt day when a new calculation was made.
The etrect of this

Plans of Reorganization.

In connection with any reorganization 3/ involving a registered investment compa.Dy,the Act
of proxies, consents, aDd
provides that copies of all. the documents ~evant to the solicitation
other types of action of security holders be fUed with or mailed to the COllIIIIission.The Act
also vests in the Commissiontwo functions with reference to reorganizations.
First, the
Commissionis authorized, if requested by any participating registered investment compa.Dy
or the
holders of 25 percent of any class of its outstanding securities, to render an advisory report
in respect of the fah'nus of arr:I plan of reorganization and its effect upon any class or
classes of security holders. Second, it may seek to enjoin the consummationof any such plan in
the courts on the ground that it is grossly unfair or constitutes gross misconduct or gross
abuse of trust on the part of officers, directors,
or other specified persons sponsoring the
plan.
With respect to the first - the power to render advisory reports on request - three such
requests have been received. In each case an advisory report 1mB prepared and distributed to
the interested security holders. The type of problem involved jn these reports is illustrated
by the first plan of reorganization presented to the COJJID18sion.,
The plan involved consolida'tion of 'two investment compen1esfollowed by' offers of the consolidated cOJDPBDY
to exchange its
securities for outstanding securities of three other investment companies which were thereafter
to dissolve.
The cc:ap8Diesinvolved were Standard Investing Corporation, International Equities
Corporation, Central Capital Corporation, Atlantic Securities C.:uopany
of Boston, and Beacon
Participations,
Inc. m of these compau1es1I8re affUiated and were the compouentC0mp8uiesin
a system of inveS"wnentcamp&Dies known as the Henderson Group. Standard Investing Corporation
aDd International
Equities Corporation were the consolidating companies, the other three the
dissolving conpau1es.
The complicated 1s8\188presented by this reorg~ation
can 'be 1Ddicated mereJ.y by' pointing
out the complu capital stru.ctures of the .companies (which created sharp conf11.cts of interest
8IIOng the holders of the various classes of securities)
and the types of assets wb1ch bad to be
valued (,as a ba818 for c:ieterm1niJJg the fairness of the treatment accorded by the plan to the
T&r1ous security holders).

-130It was indicated to the security holders that the Commissiondid not recommendor approve
the plan. The stated purpose of the Commissionwas to assist security holders in exercising
their judgmentwhether or not to accept the plan of reorganization.
It was, however, the opinion of the Commissionthat the plan, on the basis of certain specified assumptions, was
sufficiently within the lilnits of fairness to justify its submission to the security holders for
their consideration.
This function of the Commissionfills a long-felt need. It enables security holders who
often do not possess great financial knowledgeto obtain an impartial analysis of the effects of
a plan of reorganization on their securities, thus enabling them to arrive at an informed judgment as to the merits of the plan. It is important to note that although the Commissionhas
authority to submit advisory reports only when requested by the reorganizing COmpanyl s management or by 25 percent of its security holders, the existence of its power to seek an injunction
restraining a:ay grossly unfair plan of reorganization has resulted in the submission by investment companiesof several plans for informal consideration as to fairness before solicitation of
security holder approval.
Periodic Paym:;ntPlan Certificates

and Unit Investment Trusts.

As already 1.nd1cated, since these
8IIIa1l means, who frequently" default in
entirety from the early payments, will
ments lapse early. in the period of the

periodic paymentcertificates are sold to persons of
their payments, the sales load, if it is deducted in its
result in substantial loss to those investors whose paycontract.
The Act deals with this problem by providing
shall not be more than 9 percent of the total payments.
that the sales load on such certificates
Not more than one-half of this summay be deducted during the first year and the balance JIDlStbe
spread proportionately over the entire period of the contract.
Face .Amount
Certificate

Canpanies.

In di8cuss1ng above the different types of investment companes
i under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 it was indicated that amongthe chief problems presented under the Act by
face-amount certificate Companieswere those of certificate reserves and of selling methods.
Since Januar;y 1, 1941 (the effective date of the Act for this type of investment company),the
efforts of the Commissionin relation to this type of companyhave been directed mainly to the

enforcement of the reserve requirements and certain related provisions of the Act pertaining to
eligibility
of assets, custody of assets, and certain provisions relating to cash surrender and
loan values.
The Investment Company
Act of 1940 in its application to face-amount certificate companies
thus differs somewhatin concept from the Act in its application to the more CODDIlon
types of in'Vestmentcompany. A 'Very close resemblance to state statutes regulating life insurance companies may be noted. It is obvious, therefore, that in administering these sections of the Act
1mportant actuarial questions arise in addition to the usual legal, accounting, financial, and
selling problems. In its efforts to obtain cOlllpliancewith these requirements the Commission
bas devoted muchtime to conferences and correspondence, muchof it of a highly technical

nature.
An interesting variant to the face-amount certificate
company was found.in a numberof
states.
An insurance cClllp8.IJy
(usual.ly" a fire or easualty company)is organized under state laws
and an affiliated
companyorganised by the promoters of the insurance company. The affiliated
companythen offers to the public a face-amount certificate under the terms of 'Whichthe purchaser is to pay to the issuing company$1,200 over a Ie-year period in month13 or other
periodic imltallments, on the representation that at the end of the period the purchaser will
receive back in cash the total of his payments to the compa.ny
plus a specified numberof shares
of stock in the insurance company. These shares, under the plan, are purchased by the faceamountcertificate companyout of the earnings on the ~nts
of the installment purchasers to
the face-amount certificate companywhich are to be invested in various media. It is urged by
those enterprises that the plan not only returns all the principal to the investor but finances
the insurance companyand secures a w1cIe distribution of its stock which promotes good will.
While such companiesregistered under the Act, no companyof this type has yet revised its
structure s_othat it could comply fulJ;y with the provisions of the Act and proceed with its
sel.J.ing program. The sales of the securities of all companiesof this type have been discontinued pending compliance with the Act.

On July 2, 1943 the COlIIIlissionfiled a complaint in the United States District Court at
Minneapolis against Investors Syndicate~ Investors Syndicate of Amer1ca~Inc.~ and Investors
Mutual, Iric , , their directors, principal officers and certain key employees charging that they
had violated the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Invesu.nt
Company Act of 1940.
The corporate defendants are investment companies registered as 8UOhwith

charged that Investors Syndicate :induced its certificate

to reinvest in :MutualShares of Imestors llutual and in Series One certificates

charged that Investors Synd1cate~ as principal UDdarIIriter tor Inv'estors SyDdicate of .&Erica,

FollClll'ing the creation of the voting trust, the COlIIllisslonmoved the dismissal Of, the
action without prejudice as to the matters not encompassed within the terms of the judgment
entered on october lS, 1943 and an order of dismissal without prejudice 1I'a8 entered by the
Court.
On September 9, 1942, invoking for the firBt time the provisions of Section 36 of the Investment CompanyAct of 1940, the COlIIllisslonfiled an action in the United states District Court

at Kansas City, llissouri, against a face-amount certificate
corporation known as United Funds
~JIt
Corporation (hereinafter sometimes called United), 5/ its ot.1'icers and directors,
charging that since January 1, 1941 the individual defendants 1i'ad known that the reserves of the
corporation were not -sufficient to provide tor the payment of the outstanding certiticates
at
Jll&turit;y; that the defendants had been and -.ere inducing the certificate
holders to surrender
their certificates
for the cash surrender values, that this method of retirement 1I'a8 calculated
to cause considerable 108s to the certificate
holders and to enrich unjustly the directors and
officers who were the principal benefic1a1 owners of the preferred and cQlllllOn
stock of the ~
paDlf; and that these directors
and officers bad tailed to effect a plan ot l1quidation which
would be tair and equitable to the certificate
holders.
The COJIIDissioncharged that the individual defendants in committing such acts were guilty of gross m:18conductaDd gross abuse of

charged that the purpose of United's campaign was to improve the equity
stock of the companyby inducing certificate
holders to accept less than the amount of their
payments to United and to reliDquish the benefit of the proportionately greater improvement
as they proceeded to maturity ~
 thus relieving United of the
called for by the certificates
burdensomeobligation to improve its certificates.
The mechanics of this plan involvedJ in
partJ the switching of certificate holders iIrt;o other securities.
The District Court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the defendant directors
and officers from inducing or persuading holders of face-mnount certificates
to cash surrender
their face-amount certi£icates;
from making loans to certificate
holders; from retiring certificates either at the cash surrender value or at the face-amount thereof; and from receiving 8n¥

Commissionto participate in the bankruptcy proceedings as amicus curiae aDd the Commissionhas
acted in that capacity since such invitation.

ADMINISTRATION

OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940

The Inve8'tmelntAdvisers Act of J.940 requires the registration
of investment advisers, that

The OOlllll1.ss:1CD
is emponred to deny or revolce registration
of such advisers if they have
been convicted or enjoined because of misconduct in respect of security transactions.
The Act
also makes it unJ.awful. for investment advisers to engage in practices which constitute fraud or
deceit; requires investment advisers to discJ.08e the nature of their interest in transactions
executed for their c11euts j prohibits profit sharing arrangements j and in effect prevents
aa.~
at investment advisory contracts without the client's
consent.

The Imen-t
Advisers Act became effective lovember 1, 1940. Its enactment steumed

the investment adviser is a cOlllparativelynew institution

their investment advisory activities after 1930. As might be expected, registered investment
advisers are concentrated in the larger financial callDUllities. Approximately 85 percent are
located in eight states:
NewYork" CIlio, Jlichigan, Massachusetts, Permsy1vania"NewJersey,

The COIIIIlission'sduties with respect to registration
of investment advisers are substant1a1.ly' s1milar to its duties relating to registration
of over-the-counter brokers and dealers
under the Securities Exchange Act. The disclosures required tor registration
of investment
advisers, however, are somewhatbroader than those required in the application for brokerdealer registration.
Although the COIIIIlI1ssion
has no authority under the Act to pass upon the
qu.a1.it1caticms of an investment adviser, the Act requires an applicant for registration to disclose information concern:1ngthe education of the principals in the fim and information confor the preceding ten years, including, of course,
cerning all of their bus:iness affiliations
present business affiliations.
Canparable information is not required :in the application for
broker-dealer registratiCIJb except to the extent that brokers and dealers must disclose a tenyear history or previous connections in the securities business.
The added requirement
recognizes that professional qualifications,
although not a prerequisite to registration,
may
be material to investors who seek the services of :investment advisers.
The requirElllent that
such information should be available :in a public reQ~ .tollows the general disclosure
philosopb;f under~g
other Acts administered b;r the Com1ssion.

n Investment
Counselors", that is those registered advisers engaged ~
:in giving continuous advice as to the :1JIvestmentof funds em the basis o£ the 1Ddividual needs of each client and
who so state in their applications, generally charge either a fixed fee or a fee computed
at a certain percentage of the aggregate Talue o£ the assets managed. A number scale
their rates according to the size of the 1"uDd supervised.
IJ:mtstment advisers whose services cODSist ~
of un1t'ormpublicatiODS charge fixed subscription prices tor such publications.
The Act does not prescribe B't17 method for cc.put1Dg fees but it prohibits tees
c~ed
ema prof'it-shar1ng basis.

The CallDissiemis granted authority- to JUke 1Jmtst1gaUcma when it appears that the

F. W. Dyer, doing business as Empire Service Co., was enjoined from engaging in and continuing fraudulent practices by decree of United States District Court for the District
of Colorado, entered on January 3, 1942, on a bill in equity filed by the Commission. His
registration as investment adviser was revoked on February 27, 1942. Y On complaint of
the Commission,Frances J. Lubbewas similarly enjoined in March1943, by decree of United
States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois,
and a receiver was appointed;
the investment adviser registration and the broker-dealer registration of Lubbewere revoked on July 8, 1943. 3/ The registration of Petroleum Information Service, Inc., was
revoked on January 4, 1943;
the fact that its president, who also controlled the firm,
had been enjoined under the Martin Act in the State of NewYork from certain fraudulent practices established a basis under the Act for proceedings on the question of revocation of its
registration.

!J

The protections afforded under the Investment Advisers Act, however, are not so extensive
as those afforded with respect to the activities of brokers and dealers under the Securities
ExchangeAct, chiefly because the Advisers Act does not grant power to the Commissionto inspect books and records such as is granted under Section 17 (a) of the ExchangeAct. The
absence of such power limits the effectiveness of the Act With respect to protection of investors.
The Comnissioncannot, for instance, makeperiodic inspections to determine whether
advisers whoclaim in their applications that they do not accept clients' funds for investment or securities for safekeeping have truthfully reported the nature of their activities.
Neither can the Commissionmakeperiodic examinations to determine whether those advisers who
admit that they do accept custody of clients' funds or securities keep such property intact.
This anission leaves unsupervised and unprotected a broad field in the handling of investment
f'unds of the general public. The seriousness of the situation is illustrated by the following summariesof two of the Commission'sinvestigations.

21

(1) Albert E. Atkinson. In September1941, a memberof the COllIIlission'sstaff attempted
several times to makea routine inspection of the books of Atkinson, whowas registered with
the Commissionboth as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and as
a broker-dealer under the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934. Each time he was unsuccessful
because of Atkinson's absence. Whenfinally interviewed, Atkinson stated that he conducted
only an investIll8nt advisory business; that he had but five or six clients, each of 1'Ihom
paid
him an annual fee of $5,000; that he did not have custody of customers' securities or funds;
that he did not buy from or sell to the public as a dealer; and that he maintained his brokerdealer registration only so that it would be available to him ..men and if he should desire to
engage in the securities business. Furthermore, he stated that, since his sole function was
that of selling investment advice, he kept no books or records except a check book. Since
the Commissionpossessed no evidence to the contrary, and since under the Investment Advisers
Act it has no powers of inspection, the matter was closed.
Subsequently, information was obtained Which indicated that Atkinson's statements were
false.
A formal investigation was institlited by the COIIIIDission.Before its completion
Atkinson cOllllDittedsuicide.
The investigation revealed that he had had about 150 clients 1'Ihohad placed $1,700,000
in cash and securities in his hands, of which they received back approximately $1,100,000 for
an indicated 10s8 of $600,000.

(2) Robert J. Boltz. 1'he Boltz case broke a few days before the Investment Advisers Act became e.tf8Ct1ft. He Ii8Id operated an investment advisory business in Philadelphia for more than
thirteen 18&1"8, but had not been registered as a broker-dealer with either the Pennsylvania Securities C~se1OD or th1a C<mBission. About the middle of October 1940 representatives of the

PART VIII
THE COMMISSION'S

FIRST DECADE IN THE COURTS
INTRODUCTIOB

This review of the C0mmi88ion
f s first
ten years in the courts summarizesthe CaJIIlissionf s
efforts to effectuate the policies of the Securities Act of 1933, the securities Exchange Act
of 1934, the Public Utility Holding COIIIpany
Act of 1935, aDd the Investment CompanyAct of
1940.
Enforcemeni!of the prov1sicos of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 has been well-nigh entirely a matter of administrative procedure, with an
almost complete absence of court review or court enforcement.

!I

The greater portion of the CCIlIID1ssion'
s work in adm1 n1stering these statutes never reaches
the courts.
Thus, in the administration of the 1933 and 1934 Acts, general rules, opinions and
orders" interpretative
opinions, and full and free cClllDlDJ11cation
with the CCIIIlJI1ssion
and its
staff" enable all those concerned with the issuance and marketing of securities to avoid violations; while investigations,
and even knowledge of the prospect of investigation, deter as well
as disclose offenses.
In the adm1 nistration of the Holding COIIIpany
Act the day-to-day regulation of the activities
of holding ccmpanies is mamly a matter of licensing transactions which
meet the standards of the Act. Indeed, most of the COIIIm1Ssion
f s formal orders have not been
challenged in the courts, either because the orders granted the relief sought by the persons
who might have been aggrieved by an adverse order, or because what would otherwise have been
disputed issues were satisfactori1y
adjusted at the administrative level, before the orders were
issued. !hue, although the Camnis8ionhas issued more than 2,000 formal orders under the Acts,
~
about 100 petitions for renew have been filed, and appraximately half of those were dismissed on motion or stipulation of the parties betore decision on the merits.

Through the cases in lIbich it has participated,
the Camn1ssionhas obtained a basic set of
precedents interpreting its statutory powers and duties.
Manyof these cases have not ~
affected the Commission's own lrork but have also played a signif'icant part in the development of
general administrative and corporate lsIr.
lENERAL RESULTS
By June 30, 1944, the Caam1ssionhad instituted
S08 civil actions UDderthe Securities Act
of 1933, the 5ecur11iies Exchange Act of 1934, the Public Utility Holding CompanyAct of 1935,
the Investment Compan;y
Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. These were for the
most part actions in the federal district courts to enjo:1n apparent or threatened violations 01'
the Securities Act and securities Exchange Act; the balance included district court proceedings
to enforce subpoenas issued in the course of investigations under the Securities Act and the
Securities Exchange Act, applications to carry out voluntary plans of cOlllpliancewith the corporate integration and simplif'ication provisions of the Holding Company Act, and a small number
or miscellaneous legal proceedings. or these cases, 479 were closed and 30 1I8re still pending
at July 1, 19.44.

During the same period, l88 legal proceedings were lnstituted against the Commission. The
actions against the COJIIIIission
were principa1.ly petitions for review in the circuit courts of
2ppeals and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia of Commissionorders under the
Securities Act, the Securities ExchangeAct, the PUblic Utility Holding C~an,y Act, and the
Investment Ccmpany Act, aDd federal district court proceed1ngs to enjoin enforcement of these
Acts and subpoenas is8lled by the CCIIIIIi8sion in investigations thereunder; the rema1nder canprl.sed a small number of miscellaneous actions in state and federal courts against the C<lllDisnon or its officers. Of the foregoing actions against the CClIIIII1ssicm,
169 were olosed and 19
were still pending at J'Uly 1, 1944.

Y A detailed

review of the significant decisions has been given in the cAApters relAting to
each of the statutes admi n1stared by the Commission. .A. tabulation of the casea
1Ddicating the sections of the statutes involved is given in Appand1xTable 32.

-141In the private suits in 1d11chthe COIIDissionwas permitted to appear as intervener, and in
undertook to

of the Acts, to express its Vl8iii as to the reSPeCtive fields of
jurisdiction of the eClllDissionand the courts, and to obtain judicial interpretation of the Acts,
rules and orders involved in such suits, consonant with the public interest.

The record of civil actions in federal. district coarts instituted by and against the eOlllllission (including the intervener and amicus curiae cases) cauprises more than 500 cases, of which
ClI:lJ.y 10" or less than two percent, resU1tea iii adverse decisions.
In addition to these c~,
approx1lllately 100 proceedings for judicial revia of CQ1m1ssion
orders have been instituted in the circuit courts of appeals aDd the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia. Of these proceedings, which are actually original suits filed in those
normal1.yappellate courts, S4 cases resulted in either denUl of the objections raised on the
merits or dismissal. of the petition on motion or stipulation of the parties, ~ 13 cases are
still Pending, ~ aDd only 3 concluded cases have resulted in dec18ions settliig aside the CaDmission's orders in whole or in part.

'd

Y

The dismissal of review proceedings by stipulation or on motion of the petitioners (about 50
cases) is considered as a tacit upholding of the CQmIIissionlsorder, since in such cases the
effect is to leave the C01IIIlissionlsorder unreversed and required to be carried out.
Court orders affirming Commissionorders on the merits and, as lIell, those dismissing petitions for review on motion of the COIIIId.ssion
on legal grounds not going to the merits, are
considered alike as upholding the Commission'sposition" since in both situatiOl1S the result
is that the Camn1ssionls order finally stands unreversed. llotions to dismiss, not granted
by the courts, are not reversals, however, since in all such cases the court proceeds to
consider the case on the merits, and it is that final decision lIhich affirms or sets aside
the COIIIIlissionlsorder.

'JI One

of the 13 cases still pending is Engineer! Public Servi'Ce Companyv. S.E.C., 138 F. (2d)

936 (App. D. C., 1943), wherein a1.thougb.the major porticms of the CCllllllisSIQiiis

case is treated as peDd1ngsince the SUprema Court has granted certiorari
on the petitions of both the CClIIIIl1saion
and the ccmxpany.No action has been taken by the
Court, however, to set the case for hearing.

!!I

In Lawless v. ~,
105 F. (zs) 574 (C.C.A. 1, 1939), the court set aside a Ccmmd.ss1on
order which sought to grant relief requested by International Paper & Power CompaJ:J;y"~
although the comp8ZJ;f
11'88 not then registered
under the Holding CompanyAct.
In Charles. g. Wrigbt v • .2:bQ.., 112 F. (2d) 89 (C.C.A. 2, 1940), the court set aside a Cemmission oraer expelling lI'right £rail various securities exchanges for violaticm of the antimanipulation provisions of the Securities ExchangeAct. In a subsequent case, 1I'r1.Et v.
S.E.C., 134 F. (2d) 733 (C.C.A. 2, 1943), which is included amongthe S4 revia prociied1nge
wherein the CClIIIIDission
IS orders were upheld, the c1rc.uit court of appeala susta:1J1edthe CaDmission's order of eJqnilsion which 11'88 issued upon a rehear1ng of the same charges aga1nst
Wright.

In S.E.C. v. GhenerY Corooratiop. at al., 318 U.S. SO (1943), the SUpreme Court held that the
Ccmn:l
sdon had erred in relying on equity precedents tor its decision that; lII&llagersof a
registered holding cOllllp8nY
could not profit through a reorganization UDderthe Holding ComP8Dir Act nth reSPeCt to stock purchased by them during the course of the reorganization.
The CC8lissiClllla order was set aside and. in February 1945, the COIIIIIissiOll issued ita findings,
opinion and order reaffirming its prior decision.
At this writing, the time for review has
not yet expired. Tb1s proceeding is not treated as a pending case, since it is not pending
before a court.

BASIC QUFSTIOHS SETTLED
Fund8JW)tal., of 'course, to any consideration ot the COJIIII1ssion1record
s
in the courts is
the question of howthe courts have dealt with issues of constitutionality.
Only'the securities
Act of 1933, the 5ecur1ties ExchangeAct of 19.34, and the Public utillty Holding CompanyAct of
19.35have been challenged 011 constitutional grouDds, and, with the exception ot one case involTwas not a party,
ing the constituticmal1ty ot the Holding CompanyAct, to which the COJIIIIIis8ion
the courts have un1f'~
SU8ta1nedthe cCll1stitutional1ty or the provisions of these Acts in all
cases in which the question has arisen.
The registration,
traud and investigatory provisions of the Securities Act have been sustained in civil and crimina] cases by' the second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth and Tenth Circuit
Courts ot Appeals and numeroustederal district courts. The second and Seventh Circuits and the
Court ot AppeaJ.sfor the District ot Columbiaand several district courts have upheld the constitutionality
ot various provisions of the securities ExchangeAct. While the SUpremeCourt
has not undertaken to pass upon the constitutionality
ot any ot the provisions ot the Securities
Act or the Securities ExchangeAct, it has denied certiorari to review a numberof the decisions
of circuit courts of appeals upholding those Acts in civil and criminal cases.
With respect to the Public utility Holding CanpanyAct, the SupremeCourt has sustained the
constitutionality
of the registration requirements; the First, Seccmdand Third Circuit Courts
ot Appeals, the Court ot Appeals for the DiStrict of Columbia, and at least one tederal district
court has upheld the constitutionality
of the corporate simplification and integration provisions; and the Eighth Circuit has aftirmed on constitutional grounds a criminal conviction for
violatioc of the anti-politiaal-eontr1butions
provision of the Act. In three cases the Supreme
Court has granted certiorari to settle constitutional questions arising under the corporate
simplification and integration provisions of the Holding CompanyAct and two other cases are nor
pending on petitions tor certiorari.
None of these cases, hOW'8Ver,
has, yet been argued before
the SUpreme Court.

21 In civil

appeaJ.s frQD injunctions obtained by the COIIIIIlission.,
the occasional. instance of an
aff:lmance as to onl¥ sane of the defendants does not retlect tailure of the CaJIJl1ss1onls
eftorts to prevent violations ot the statutes administered by' it but is, rather, a decision
that tewer persons than origjnalJy considered had actually been proved to have participated
in the wrongful acts.

- 143 PART IX

CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS
DIe statutes adIII1D1Btered by 'the CaJEission provide tor the tranami.ss1on ot evid8DC8or
statutory violati0Q8 to the Attorney General~ who mq. in his discretion~ institute
appropriate
crhrlnal proceedings. As a matter of practice~ the Camnission, large~ through its ten regiClDal
offices, thOl'ougbJ.y'1n've8tigates all suspected violations and prepares detailed investigation

reports 1Ib1chgo to the Attorney General whenever the 1Dvestigations disclose a basis tor
criminal proceedings. 1Iben it is decided to institute criminal proceedings the CODIIIission
assigns 8l1Cbof its eIlDPloyeesas have participated in the ,investigation to assist in the preparation or the case tar presentation to the grand jury, in the conduct or the trial, and in the
preperat10n ot briefs on appeal. Where the investigation discloses violations of statutes other
than those administered by the Camn1ssion~reference is made to an appropriate federal or state
agenc;y.
Up t. June 30, 1944, 342 criminal cases were developed by the Camnission and prosecuted
by the Department of Justice, and a total of 2~3l6 defendants were indicted in these eases. 1/
the criminal cases llhich have been conc'lnded, ninety-five percent were successfully prose=
cuted as to one ar more or the defendants namedin the indictments.
In two-thirds of these

or

cases no trial 11'88 D8Cess&rybecause of the entry of a plea or guilty or nolo contendere.
Sixteen cases resulted in either dismissal of the indictments or in verdiCU-of not gulltyas
to all of the defendants.

In cases of appeals verdicts of guilty were reversed as to all defendants in only six cases.
nth respect to those six cases, however, the aovernment was successful in £ive cases in obtaining new convictions on retrial;
and while several nn appeals were taken they all resulted in
atfi:rmance or the convictions.
In f1rty-n1ne appeals verdicts of guilty were affirmed~ at least
_ to major defendants. Seven criminal eases are still pending in the appellate courts.

1'he C~sion's
1JInstigations have not been l1mi.ted to act1vities in and. about the great
t1nanciU centers, but haft extended throughout the nation. Recently, during the course of a
II1ngle fiscal year, cases were instituted
or tried in approz1mate~ forty of the federal district courts.
In 8117gi Ten year the cases UDder investigation or being prosecuted included
llatters affecting investors residing in each or the forty-eiEPt states.
Most or the cases developed by the Ccmn1.ssioninvolve fraud in the sale or securities.
!hese are prosecuted tar the most part under Sec tiOD 17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933,
aDd the reach of this statute is 1ndeed considerable, as has been shown, in view of the broad
det1Jdt1.cm'g1.vento the term wsecurity.w In the last fn YearS there has been a distinct increase in prosecut1aos UDder the securities Exchange Aot, particularly Sections 10 (b) and 15
(c). IraDT of the fraudulent sws were made possible, in part, by the.deliberate
failure of
the prcBOters to .tile reg:L8traticm statements and prospectus material with the Camnission, as
required b7 the 5ecur1t1es Act. Hence a large Dl1IIIber of the criminal eases also charge violaUcm or the regiatraticm prov1siOlD8or that Act -.hich appear in Sectic:m 5.
T!PES OF CASES

'the frauds and other statutGrT violations encOlDlteredby the CClIDIII1ssion
in its investigati0D8 UDder the various Acts are as varied as humanimagination and ingenuity can contrive.
JI8D,T
the caaea haft entireJy novel features 01' present a new wtwist- of one kind or another.
18 a rule, hOll8VV, the cases fall :Into eerta:in broad pattenl8, set out below:

or

(1) !JF!!8 r::ep88lltations.
The most eamnontype of fraud is the simple promotion
bued \1pOD express
resentations, which does not involve any of the complex and refined
devicea not 1DfrequentJ,y employed in securities seh81118s.The promotion of mining ventures,
usuaJ..q gold 1I1:Des, and the sale of oU and gas interests
.trequent~ present opportunities for
perpetrat101l of thia tJpe ot trawl. Thus, in the ease ot lfPite4 States T. Samuel J. :Mustain
et aJ.. (S.D.R.T.), three iDdiv1dual defendants and four corporate defend8Jllis, amongtne latta.
knoIm as CCIlt1.DentaJ.

cases inTolTing statutes

-144.traudu1ent sales of oil royalty securities.
In the course of such sales it had been false~
represented to investors that they were certain of a definite incClllEl
for lite if they purchased
the oil interests; that they could have their moneyback at ~
 time if not satisfied; that their
principal would be fu+J.y returned within two and one-hal.t years; and that the securities were
being purchased by banks.
The alleged fraudulent promotion is also encountered in the exploitation of so-called inventions. Thus" convictions have been obtained in promotions of a new type of revolving top
for COIIIlIlercial
buildings, United states v. Charles Thalman Rice, et ale (D.N.ll.), and of a
vessel said to be ca~le
01 atta:rnIiig speeds 01' 80 to 100 iDIies per hour, United states v. Mark
L. Gilbert, at ale (S.D. Ohio). An indictment is currently pending with respect to a pfnlesSdiaper promotion, United States v. Philip A. Frear, et ale (D.C.).
In a number of the mining companycases, securities have been sold by persons resident in
Canada and operating from across the border without compliance nth the statutes of this
country. The Commissionhas been cooperating with the state Department and the Department of
Justice in efforts to secure a treaty nth canada which would permit extradition from Canada of
persons violating the federal securities laws and cognate statutes.
The treaty was ratified in
the United States Senate in 1942" but to date it has not been ratified by the Canadian
Parliament.
(2) ItPonzi" Schames. This type of case, a perennial favorite of the securities swindler,
involves the pa;yment "profits" or -dividends" out of capital.
The apparent success of the
colloqu1~
venture makes the investor susceptible to further investment, a process SOIIIStilleS
described as "reloading. a The "Ponzi" system is a recurrent motif in fraudulent small loan cempany ventures.
Illustrative
of these cases is United States v. Dewitt T. s~son,
et ale
(S.D. Ga.), involving Standard System Investment Corp., a holding companyill ch haa obtiiined
control of a number of industrial loan companies operating in various cities in Georgia. Franinent business and professional menwhowere not aware of the schemewere persuaded to act on
the board of directors.
Actual control, hmrever, was exercised by Simpson and two associates,
whomade fictitious
book entries and paid dividends out of capital, despite lack of real earnings. All 'three were convicted in 1943, in Savannah, Georgia, for violatiOllS of the fraud provisions or the securities Act of 1933, snd for other statutory offenses.

or

The "ponzill method is SClll8t1meS employedin vending machine prcmotiOllS. Thus, in United
States v. Maurice A. Levine!{; et ale (D. ¥ass.)~ cigarette and peanut vending machines were sOld
to inVestors unaer a leas
aci arrangement whereby the prcmoters were to operate the machines
for the investors on a profit-sharing basis.
"Profits" were paid periodicaJ.ly out of capital
until the entire structure collapsed, leaving the victims with machines worth far less than they
had paid for them. Six defendants pleaded guilt}' in this cue.
(3) "Switch" SChemes. Someindividuals sell their vict1ms bona .tide securities,
thereby
cultivating their trust and confidence, and then persuade them tOCJrsPQii of their holdings and
t.o substitute securities which are frequently worthless.
In other cases the scbeme is to obtain lists of persons previously sold a security and then induce th8ll1 to accept a new security
in exchange. 'Ibis "switch" device was one aspect of the fraudulent schsae involved in United
States v. John Factor, et ale (N.D. Iowa), a bottling contract case, in which John (Jake 'the
barber) Factor
a group of confederates, operating througb lJDited Bottling and Distributing
Comp~, a Delaware corporation, defrauded some 250 investors to the extent of an est:iJDated
$1,000,000. The owners of lI'hisky warehouse receipts were :induced to exchange them.for bottling
contracts, by the terms of which lJDited Bottling was to hold the whisky until it matured, see
and tr8n8ll1it the profits, less a stated serrlce .tee, 'to the
to its bottling and distribution,
investors.
In a.number of instances, persons who did not OlD whisky warehouse receipts were
sold such receipts and then "sw:Ltched"into bottling contracts.
United Bottling was a ]Dere
paper organization, and the whisky warehouse receipts were sold or hypothecated as soon as possession was obtained. Eleven defendants pleaded guilty and received substantial prison sentences, Factor h1m8elf' being sent to the Federal penitentiary at LeaV8DllOrth
for a term of ten

ana

years.
(4) Front Jl~
Schemes. This device involves the exploitation of aaall business enterprises upon a pr
to procure for them needed f:inaDcing. Perhaps the IIOst iJIIportant of the
"froot money"cases developed by the Camnission was that of United States v. E. J. Hill, at aJ..

e

- 14S (N.D. (hio), steDlll1ng!rOJBan intensive 1nvestigatiCD ccaducted in cooperation nth the Post
Office Department aDd the Department of Justice.
It was disclOsed that, for approx1mate~ six
years, hundreds of enterprises or prospective entrepreneurs had been vict1mi~ by' the 0perations of this racket.
'!'be vict1Jls had been induced to ~
 advance fees estimated to total SC118
$1,000,000 for various services in connection with incorporation, reg:lstratiOl1, aDd the preparation of sales literature.
This was accOlllpl18hedby' false and misleading repreaent$iCD8 as to
of an adnnce
the ~1lity of the respondents to secure financing and capital upon the p~
fee; act~,
the investigation failed to disclose a single instqnce in which a share of stock
had been sold or a dollar of capital secured for the victims.
Ten persons were cOIIrlcted in
this case.
(5) Bucket Shope. This type of fraudulent activity was the subject of intensiTe enforceof the Ce-dss1on, and the -bucket shop- as such has becc:ae a CClllment work In the early ~
parative rarity.
'!'be schema consists of Pretending to purchase securities for a custcmler 011 a
fall p8i7JDeDt
or margin ~t
basis, with the broker del1berate~ faiJ.1ng to acquire the securities; in short, -bucketing" the transaction.
In the case of a margin purchase, if the price
drops the customer is -sold out- and the customer's ~t
is pocketed. If the customer pa;ys
in full, and the price drops, the security is purchased ~ delivered to the custcIDer. On the
othR hand, if the Price rises the customer is persuaded to sell out and invest in another
security.
The process is cont1mled until the customer 18 funds are depleted.
A considerable
number of convictions for -bucket shopll activity have been obtained.
Examples are UDited states
T. Tur1vas & Co., et ale (E.D. La.), and United states T. Harold J. Kattltlman, et al. (E.D. Jlo.).
(6) Investment Advice. Dishonest investment advisers range !rca tipsters with Winsiden information 'to spurious pUri8)oriS of purportedl.y iJlpartiaJ. i.nT8stment services.
In the recent
case of United St_tes v. John 11'. Hession (S.D.B.Y.), a railroad bond trader whowrote a column
which appeared as a regulir feature In a fi.naDciaJ. nenpaper was convicted for violations of the
fraud prorlaion.s of the securities Act of 1933. The 1nd1ctment charged that he had Pretended to
haTe -1nBide- 1nformatiCD derived frca a Qove1"Dlll8Dt
source concerning action to be taken by the
Interstate CClDmerce
CCDmissiCD
in ccanection with the reorganization of a certain railroad, and
that by the dissemination of this and other faln 1nforution he had induced widespread purchases
and caused a rise in the market price of the bonds.
Hession's appeal was dismissed.
Another type is epitomized by the case of United States v. Robert J. Boltz (E.D. Pa.).
Boltz, 8J1 investment counselor, was a member of the ph118d81ph1a bar and of that c1tyls most
exclusive clubs and institutions.
He used his 118M aDd poa1tiem to induce SaM 200 persons to
entrust to h11Ilmore than $2,500,000 in f\md8 and securities.
Contrary to agre8lll8Dtsnth his
customers, he ran a margin trading account, executed short sales, and used customers' funds to
speculate in securities and c~t1e8
for his CJIID account, with very large 108888 to the cuatClll8rS.
SUChwas the confidence engender8d b7 Boltz in his clients that when, in response to
1nqu1r;y !rom custCll8rs, Boltz said their funds were being used for his om purposes, the custcaera aslUlled he was mere~ jesting.
Boltz pleaded gai.lty to all coants of an indictment alleging rlolations of Sectiem 17 (a) of the securities Act of 1933, section 15 (a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 215 of the Cr1J1'fnalCode (mail. fraud).
He was senteDced to
twenty- years'1mpr1sODJll8J1t,
the longest sentence 8'f8r 1IIpo8ed UDder 8D7 of the Acts adm1n:istered
by' the ee-d.ss1an.
(7) Investment Trusts. Abuses in the 1.nTestmentCCBpaDy 1ndustry- led to the adoptiem of
the Investment C~
Act of 19~, as described else.here in this report.
Prior to that legl.slat1em, honmtr, the C<lmdas1CD

Vanipu1ation OIl
securities exchanges is specificaJ.1T outlawed by sec. 9 (a) (1) and (2) or the securities Exchange Act or 1934, aDd examples or successful prosecution under these sections are United states
v. GeOrge J. Vorr1san, et ale (S.D.B.Y.), which involved -rigging" of the market for the CCllllllOll
stock 01" BIG s8iidW1Ch Shops, Inc., on the Bft York Produce Exchange; United States v. Bo1"lll8Zl

Jlanipu1ation in the over-the-counter markets have been suceessf'ully prosecuted" under the

or S8lt Lake city, utah. Appeals are pending in the latter case.
anti-fraud

OYer-the-counter manipulation 11'&8 also involved in United states v. EdmondB. Bronson. et
ale (S.D.N.Y.), in which convictions were obtained in ccmnection with the sale of a mining cempanyls treasury stock at artificial
prices greatly in excess of the amount the canpany received
frcm those distributing the stock. The Circuit Court or Appeals for the Second Circuit sustained
the convictions on December14, 1944, holding that the sal.e or tre&SU1'7stock was, for practical
purposes, l1ke the sale of a 11811' issue, md that the practice ot charging prices tar in excess
or cat the ccapany was to receive was E !! a fraud on those to whomthe stock was sold.
(10) Broker-Deal.er Cases. While manipu1ation cases can and sometimes do involve brokers or
dealers, tJiey are not lliItid to such persons, and others have been successfully prosecuted for
manipu1ation. On the other hand, there are a DUJIlber of statutory offenses peculiar to brokers
and c:1ealers.
'l'hus, the hypothecation or custcaers' securities in contravention ot Sec. 8 (c)
or the securities ExchangeAct of 1934 was the basis for two convictions in lJD1tedstates v. E.
E. Morrison, at al. (B.D. Cal.), while violation or the margin provisions of that Act and
excessive trading in a discretionary custallersl account resulted in a conviction in United
States T. Russell •• McDermott(S.D. lild.).
The Circuit Court of Appeals tor the seTehth Circuit att1rmed the latter conviction in an op1J11onreported in 131 F. (2d) 313, upholding the
constituticmallty of the margin provisions. certiorari was deJ11edby the United states Supreme

Court in 318 U.s. 765.
Dar1Dgthe last fiscal year, convictions were obtdDed in United states T. Otto B.~
at
ale (lI'.D. Wash.), the t1rst cr1Jl1nal cue in lIbich fraud in the s818 of securities was ~ated
\iPcm sales by aeouri ties deal.ers to their CuetC1118r8 at pricea not reaaonablT related to the prevailing I18Z'ketprices, without appropriate disclosure.
Indictments based on the same theory or

PRACTICES

A notable deYe1.ClpIII8J1t
of the peat; decade in the field or 8CCOUD'tiJag
has been the growth of
a body of authoritative
literature
with respect to accoaa1dng pr1nc1pl.ea.
.it the t1JDe the C<mmssion 1I'8S established
there was no 1I8iY of determ:fning the propriety
or arsy accounting principle or practice
with any degree of filaallt)'" or authority.
In recent 18U'S" hOll8Y8r, accom:rting classifications
usued by'Tar1ous regal.atory agencies" the ee-d.8a1on's
accounting rules"
decisions and opiDions and ccapreheD8ive statements on 8CCounting pr1Dc1ples issued by' professional. accounting societies
have resulted
in the _stab] 1slwent or Dproved acC01D1ting standards
and have clarified
the applicat1an
or those standards to D1IIII8rOlUI questions em which accOUDtants

-149 had held divergent opin1ons for aany years.

Y

Tb1s progress 10 of the greatest significance
to persons lIIborely an tiDancial statements. The several Acts administered by the ee-d88im
have madepossible a turther contrib11tian - the expresa sanctions of these Acts have prorlded
an eftective means of securing general. adherence to the standards developed.

The CODIII1ssiClll
ha&s established requirements as to the tom and COl1tentot financial statements filed under the Securities Act of 19~3, the Securities Ex:chenge Act of 1934 and the Investment CtlmpaDy"
Act of 1940. 1Ihi1e these requirements are cauprehensive, they do not seek to
prescribe in every situation the accounting practices to be followed or the disclosures to be
made of bu8:1Desstransactions.
Instead the CcDm:ission
has required that genera1.l.yaccepted accoonting priDciples be followed in recording the II18ZlJ" transacticms not specifically covered by
its rules.
For the IlO8t pert the Ccadssim's accounting requ1r8Dents under these Acts have
been integrated 1Jlto a single regulation" Regulation S-X. This regulation" prcaulgated in 1940,
superseded the accounting requirements contained in the various individual report.ing forss and
has proved to be a most helpful simplification in the CCIIIa1ssion'sreporting requirements.
These accounting rules

and regulatiOl1s of the Camdssion have evolftd under the innuence
cases, and discussions and correspODdencewith registrants and. their
accountants. Sane of these cases hays been the subject of forma:l C<laDissiondecisions and mark
significant progress made in this decade. Inflated asset valuations" improper determ1nat1ons
of income, overstatements of contributed capital or accumuJ.atedearned surplus, as well as
other accounting 1mproprieties" have been fotmd in various cases f<maa1.l.ydecided by the CaIm1ssion. A comprehensive revieW' of these fcmul decisions 1IO\1ld not be feasible, but specific
mention should be madeof several cases in 1Ibich the COlIIIlissionfOlmdthat the financial statements lIere in large part II1slaading and deceptive devices employedfor the purpose of benefiting
persons in control of the reporting company-. In In the Vatter of Resources CorporatiOll InternationaJ.,
the registrant served as a mediumby lIh1ch the contrOll1iig officer 1r88 ab18 to unload i8i'ge amounts of bis holdings of the ccIIIp8Dy'sstock emthe public. The tinancial statements did not disclose the enormousproUts this officer was reaping frall these sal.es nor did
they adequately disclose the character of the in1'lated valuations which had been renected in the
balance sheet and which contributed to the carr,y1ng out of hi.a scheme. Another such case. was
In the )latter of .Associated G88and Electric 9aDpaDY. 3/ This caapany 1r88 the top holding CaDpan;y in a PUblic utmty holdhig cClllp8llY
syst_ which Uit1mately collapsed a!t$r finaDc1al
frauds had been cCllllll1ttedwhich cost investors m1llions of dollars and sent the pr1Dcipal perpetrator" HowardC. Hopson, to the penitentiary.
In ita decisiClll the ee-isaion severely
criticized the accounting practices that had been employedb7 the cc.pany in its financial statements for the years 1934 through 1937. '!be Cc.1s8ion felt that the principal purpose of these
financial statements was to .tify"
baffle, mislead. and conceal, and fOUlldthat the statelllents
failed to give any indication of the framulent truaactions that had been effected and the :Inconsistent and 1mproper accounting practices that had been folland.
Another case involving
fraudulent tinanciaJ. stateaents was that of JlcKessOll-Robbw,
in which a 'lIhol..ly fictitiOll8

-150In addition to its rules, regulAtions and decisions on accounting matters, the Commissicm
has authorized the issuance of releases in an Accounting Series to serve certain specialized
purposes. They afford a mediumfor making known to registrants and to the public established
COJIIJIissicm
poliey on particular accounting questions. Such policy determinations should not be
the privileged knowledgeof a favored few registrants or their advisers, but instead should be
made available to the fullest poSsible extent to all1fho have dealings with such an agency.
Accounting Series releases constitute the Commission'sprincipal instrument, other than its formal decisions and reports, for informing the public as to its basic policy in accounting matters.
These releases have also been valuable in dealing with specialized types of cases which are so
unusual or complexthat establishment of a general and infleldble rule is deemedinadvisable.
The discl.osure requirements o£ the CCIIIII1Bs1on
have also influenced the character of the
financial statements included in annual reports to stockholders. Thef 1nancial collapse in 1929
was in no small measure traceable to the fact that investors had been 1nadequate~ and, in mao;r
instances, 1ncorrect~ informed about the affairs or the com.paniesin "lIhosesecurities they were
investing. ADnual reports that had been furnished to stockholders were orten uninformative; but
o.rdinar~
DO other source of reliable
information was open to those not on the "inside."
The
Securities Acts were a direct result or this aystem of inadequate disclosure.
Another result was
that an increasing number or business men and accountants recognized the need for furnishing
stockholders with adequate financial information. The influence of these individuals has been
felt but it seems clear that the rapidity and pervasiveness of the improvementsin financial
reporting that have occurred in the past ten years have in no small measure arisen because fair~
 cClllpletefinancial statements bad to be filed public~ with the COlllIIIission.
The Public Ut1l1ty Holding CCllllp~AC,. of 1935 gave the C<lllllissionthe power to regulate the
accounting and record keeping practices of public utility holding companies and certain subsidiaries and affiliates thereof. Pursuant to this authority the Cammissionin 1937 promulgated
unif'orm systems of accounts for public utility holding canpanies and their mutual and subsidiary
sernce ccepanies. Until then, such companies had gener.all7 been free from regulation by State
or Federal utilities
co.a188iOO8. These systems of accounts represented a first step in attempting to introduce liniformity into the accounting o£ these canpan1es to the extent that they were
subject to the jurisdiction of this CClIIII1ss1on.
In adD1n1stering the Public Ut1l1t;r Holding Company
Act of 1935 the Commissionhas decided
m&n7 cues involving accounting problems of all degrees of caaplexity.
One of the most significant of these cases, accountingw:l.se,11'88 In the Matter of A880ciatecl Gas and nectric Corporation.
It was in this case that the C81ss1on IIrit d18cua88d at length the nature and
accounting implications of a quasi-reorganization, a procedure by 'llhich a company,amongother
things, eliminates a deficit in its acc11lll11ated
earnings and establishes a newpoint or departure for the accUJlllilat10nof an earned surplus account. other decisions of the CoIIIDiss1on
under
the Public Utilit;r Holding COIIlp8Il;r
Act of 1935 have deaJ.t with a great variety of accounting
matters, including the accounting treatment to be accorded imestJllents UDdervarious circum-

21

stances, proper accounting for f1xed property in mergers or otherwise.. and proper accounting
tor the const1tuent elements or capital stock and surplus.

Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the CCImD1.8s1C1l
is epowered to prescribe the
books and records that shall be kept by security' brokers aD:1 dealers and to require these persons to 1'i1e periodic reports.
In 1939, atter long study and consultations with a large number
of individuals and all interested organizations, the COIIIIII1ssicm
in collaboration with the State
blue sk;yc<llll1ssions devised and prescribed rules relating to the business records that IIlU8tbe
ma:lntained by' broker-dealere subject to its jurisdicticm.
.uso the CClIIIrl.ss101D
in 1942 pr<:lllulgated a financial reporting form for these f1rll8. Subsequently a mDIIber of state regulatory
bodies and national securities exchanges have either adopted th1a form or have indicated their
w1llingness to accept 1t in satisfaction of their reporting requ1reIIlents for brokers and deaJ..era,
thereby effecting a considerable saving in effort and expense for the reporting firma.

These requirements with respect to accountants' certificates
were, of course, mandatory in
certificates
filed with the Commissionbut were not at first generally observed in certificates
prepared for other purposes.
However, about two years 1ater the membership of the American
Institute
of Accountants voted in favor of eliminating this "doub1e standard" in accountants'
certificates
and adopted the substance of the Commission's requirements.
Subsequent to the McKessonease the Commission issued a number of decisions in which it
criticized
the auditing practices of particu1ar accountants.
Of these more recent eases the
and
two of outstanding significance were In the Matter of Resources Corporation International
In the Matter of Associated Gas and Electric Canpany. In the Resources case, decided in 1940,
the Commissionfound that a representative
of the certifying
accountants had at ODetime entertained serious doubts as to the 1egitimaey of the operations of the registrant
and had eamnunicated those doubts to the supervising partner of the accounting firm.
The Camuission found that
the certifying accountants faUed in the performance of their duties by not extending their
examination to res01ve these doubts.
The Commission also found that the certifying
accountants
were at fau1t in that they were aware of certain additional facts which were of IIlhterial significance to investors but which were not disclosed.
The COIIIDIission
also criticized
the accountant's certificate
furnished in the Resources
case.
The certificate
exempted from its purview all but $35,000 of assets out of total stated
assets of more than $9,000,000.
The Commissionhe1d that such a report is not a "certificate"
In 1939 the American Institute
of Accountants

adopted a similar position, stating that an accountant should not express an opinion on financial statements if his exceptions or reservations
are so material as to negative his opinion.
In In the Matter of Associated Gas and Electric Companythe Comm1ssion8evere:Q- criticized
the work of the certifying
accOJIDtants. The Call1llissionfound in this case that the audits were
inadequate in scope. Moreover, the opinions expressed in the accountants'
certificate
were not
clear and were so qualified by exceptions and explanations as to render those opinions nugatory.
As stated above, the COIIIII1ssion
11&8 of the opinion that the financial.
statements filed by the
registrant
were principally
intended to mystify, bafne, mislead and conceal.
The Camnission
went on to say that the audits and certificates
of the accountants did nothing to prevent the
accomplishment of that purpose.
The most recent developments in the fieM of auditing have related primarily to ne1l"and
serious problems that have arisen as a resu1t of the war. AJJ. concerned with auditing problems
are agreed that high standards of auditing procedure must be maintained and that the progress
recent1y achieved must noi! be lost.
A principal difficulty
has been the loss ~ most accounting firms of trained personnel to other phases of the war effort.
'Furthermore, a similar Loss
of accounting personnel by private business, frequently coupled with a large new VOlumeof war
work, has meant that internal accounting and auditing controls upon which the public accountant
must rely in many respects, have in many instances suffered and hence, with a smaller or less

- 154 STANIlA.RIS

OF PROFESSIONAL

CONDUCT

'The maintenance of high standards of professional conduct on the part of the public accountants whocertify financial statements is a matter or the utmost importance to persons who rely
on these statements. The reader of a financial statement has a right to eJq>ectthat the certifying accountant has done his work expertly and 1JnpartiaJ.ly and that his opinion as to the financial statements is forthright and unbiased.. Organizations of professional accountants have recognized the importance or high standards of professional conduct and have established. certain selfdisciplines for the purpose of protecting the interests of third persons and to help insure that
the accounting profession w1ll continue to merit the confidence and trust that has been placed in
it.
ODe cornerstone o£ proper pro£essional conduct is that the accountant shall be independent
or the client whosefinancial statements he certUies.
This view has long been held by many individual accountants but was explicitly introduced in the Securities Act of 1933 as a necessary
prerequisite t~ the certification of financial statements fUed under that Act. This need for independencehas also been given statutory recognition in the other principal Acts administered by
the CaDmission. The goal of such a principle is obvious - the accountant's opinion, if it is to
be valuable to the reader or financial statements, must be arrived. at objectively and expressed.
1mpartiaU,y •
The problem of deciding whether or not an accountant is independent in a g.iven case is orten
BlOstdi£ficult and has been the subject of a numberof releases and decisions. Sane persons have
contended that the fuiependenceof an accountant should not be questioned unless there is evidence
in the form of misstatements or omissions that his opinion is not honest and impartial.
The Commission, however, has viewed the requirement of independencenot only as a sa£eguard against conscious £aJ.sUication but aJ.so as a preventive or impalpable and Wlprovablebiases in the exercise
of his professional judgmentwhich lIlBiY arise as a result of incompatible interests or relationships. Consequently, the COIlIII1ssion
has found an accountant to be lacking in independence with
respect to a particular registrant 1£ the relationships which exist between the accountant and
the client are such as to create a reasonable doubt as to whether the accountant will or can
have an impartial and objective judgment on questions confronting him.

The CCIIIII1ssion
has not attempted to catalog all the relationships that are incompatible
with independence. However,the Camnissionhas indicated that it expects the cert1.fying accountant to operate as an otltside check on the accounting of managementto assure that the accounting
is accurate, COIIIplete and unbiased. Certain relationships have been designated as clearly inconsistent with this conception of the accountant's function. For example, an accountant who
has a substantial financial interest in a client can scarcely view that cc:mpany'sfinancial re- .
ports with an impartial f!fYe. Furthermore, if an accountant has been connected with a business
in a capacity such as a director, o£ficer, employee, or voting trustee, it is unlikely that he
will be able to dissociate himself :from those managerial activities and conduct an audit and
render a report that lIOU1d
be una££ected thereby. Consequently, the Camnissionhas stated in
its 1'Ules that relationships of this kind will necessitate a finding that the accountant is
lacldng in independence. !y
The Caumissic:nhas further clai'ified its concept of ind~ence
throllgh its decisions in
particular cases and by opinions expressed in Accounting Series releases.
There have been
several cases in which the CaJIIl1ssionhas £oundthat an accountant has taken over responsibUities that properly belong to managementand thereby has destroyed his independence. For example,
where the accountant p1~ a leading role in the original accounting determinations or his
client, his subsequent audit is in large part a mere rubber stamping or his own work and is not
an independent verification of management'srepresentations.
Likewise where an accountant has
actively participated in the formation and execution o£ managementdecisions he is apt not to
review with sufficient objectivity the management'sdisclosure of these matters in the financial
statements.

Also, the Camnission has indicated that the failure of an acoountant to discharge his responsib1l1ties in a professional mannermay be further evidence of a lack of independence. Acceptance of lDlVer1f'iedinformation f'urnished by managementas to the vaJ.1d1ty or propriety of
particular items, or the condoning or negligent overlooking of material aoissions or improper
disclosures in the financial statement has been held to cast serious doubt on his independence.
The COJIIIlission
has also said that an account-antwhois subservient to his client and "consistently submergeshis preferences or convictions as to accounting principles to the wishes of

his client is not in fact independent.
In .Accounting Series Release No. 22 the Chief Accountant of the CcDD1ssion expressed the opinion that an accountant who had been indemnified by
a registrant
against all losses or damages arising out of his certification
other than those
resulting freD his wiltul misstatement or omission, cannot be considered independent since such
an indemnification may raove or greatly" 'Weakenone of the major stiImlll to objective and \UlbilU!ed ccma1deration of 'the the problems encountered in a particu1ar engagement.
The CClIIII18sionin ita decisions has indicated a number of other relationships
that mq
de8troY' an accountant's independence.
For example, financial relationships which go beyond the
nOl"lll&1.
accountant-cl1ent
relationship
or which involve the accountant and responsible persons
atf1l1ated with his client,
maY'adversely" affect the accountant's
independence.
Also, it has
been held that the use of the accountant as a cloak to cover certain private business deaJ.1ng8,
or a continued disregard of an accountant I s protests against managementI s improper use of his
name in its reports mq be f'urther evidence of a lack m:r independence.
These formal decisions of the COIIIIIissionhave been supplemented by Accounting Series Release No. 47 which 8U1D1D8r'ized the facts in a number of cases in which informal rulings were
issued finding particular
accountants to be lacking in :f.ndependence.
The COIIIIII1ssion
has consistently
distinguished
the responsibilities
and duties of the accountant trOlll those of management. Relationshipll that destroy this separation of responsibility
or impair its effectiveness
will destroy or impair the accountant's
status as an independent expert.
Moreover, the CODIIIi.ssion
has from the first indicated that in deciding a question of
between accountant and client
independence, it will inquire into all the pertinent relationships
and will not direct its inquiry solely to relationships
existing in connection with the filing
of reports with the Camnission. This:last
proposition was made explicit by the adoption of a
rule to that effect in Regulation S-X. 13/ The decision to make Commission policy explicit
on
this point 'Wasprompted by cases in 'WhiChsignificant
information relative to particular
practices of management was set forth in statements filed 'With the Commission but was not disclosed
in statements otherwise made pUblic.
The Commission's release pointed out that complaisant accession to the wishes of management in such matters raises a Berious question as to whether the
accountant is in fact independent.
The Commission has followed the practice of bringing to the attention
of appropriate accounting Societies and state agencies each case in which it has publiclY' criticized

on national securities
exchanges at December 31, 1943. The results of the
Survey are being presented in two forms, individual industry reports and special statistical
studies.
The individual industry reports contain both combined and individual data for registrants from 1934 to 1943, inclusive.
Until 1942 most-reports of the Survey were made available to the public, but during the
past three years budgetary limitations
and the paper shortage have made it necessary to limit
di.stribution to government agencies engaged in furthering the war effort.
Copies of all public
reports, however, have been made available for general use and inspection in the offices of the
Commissionin Philadelphia and in the Colmllission's regional offices as well as in 540 depository
libraries.
Photocopies may also be obtained of all or parts of these reports at the regular
rates.
In addition to 175 published reports made publicly available, many special studies have been
made for the Commission and other government agencies, particularly
in connection with various
Amongthe more important reports contained in the Survey have been
aspects of the war effort.
studies of corporate profits and operations for the Price Adjustment Boards of the War Department,
Navy Department, Maritime Commission, Reoonstruction Finance Corporation, Treasury Department,
and the Contract Review Branch of the War Production Board and the Treasury Department's Bureau
of Internal Revenue; a special study" of the meat packing industry for the Office of Economic
Stabilization;
a study of remuneration for the Salary Stabilization
Unit of the Treasury Department; a study of ownership and control of foreign corporations for the Office of Economic Warfare; and a study of airframe manufacturers for the War Department Army Air Corps.
As part of the Survey, the Commission's staff is presently engaged in compiling data for
various government agencies covering the balance sheet data of 1,530 companies for five years,
at the request of the Bureau of Budget's Inter-Agency Committee on Financial Needs of Government
Agencies.

During the year 1943, the coverage of the Survey was extended to those corporations registered under the Securities Act or 1933 which file annual reports.
During 1944, the scope of the
Survey's studies was extended further to investment companies registered with the COIIIllission
unde~ the Investment CompanyAct of 1940.

Market Statistics

During the past ten years the staff or the Commissionhas developed a considerable body of
statistical
information on the capital market. Same of these statistics
have been camnented
upa:1 elsewhere in the text and summarized in Tables 1 to 4 of the Appendix, namely data on cost
of notation
of securities,
on the volume of issues registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
offered for cash sale in the United States, inclUding issues
and on all new issues or securities
not registered lfith the Cotmnission. In addition, studies have been made of the extent to which
actual sales of issues of securities
have varied from the amounts registered for sale.
Also
data have been gathered on retirements or securities,
which together with the stat.istics
on new
issues, have provided estimates of changes in the volume of securities
outstanding and in the
amount or saving by individuals directly in the form of securities.
In cooperation with other
public and private agencies, considerable data have been accumu.lated on the investment and market
performance or corporate bonds.
