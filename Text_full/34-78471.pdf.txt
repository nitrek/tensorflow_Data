EXTENSION ORDER

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has requested an extension
of time until August 15, 2016 to file its Opposition to Applicant’s Motion for Subpoena
(Opposition) in this matter. Counsel for FINRA has indicated that Applicant’s counsel
does not oppose this request. Extensions of time are disfavored. It appears appropriate,
however, to grant FINRA’s request for good cause shown. Therefore,
It is ORDERED that FINRA’s time for filing its Opposition is extended to
August 15, 2016.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Lynn M. Powalski
Deputy Secretary
