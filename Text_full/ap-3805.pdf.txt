File No. 3-16978

In the Matter of

RICHARD F. KENNY, IV, FINELINE TRADING

STAY ORDER

On April 22, 2016, this office received a joint motion to stay this proceeding pending
Commission consideration of an offer of settlement. Although the motion does not explicitly
state that the parties have reached an agreement in principle to a settlement on all major terms,
quoted provisions of Rule of Practice 161(c)(2) suggest that such an agreement has been reached.
See 17 C.F.R. ยง 201.161(c)(2).
Accordingly, the joint motion is GRANTED, and the proceeding is STAYED, subject to
compliance with Rule 161(c)(2), 17 C.F.R. ยง 201.161(c)(2), requiring that this office be notified
promptly if any of the requirements of the Rule are not met.
