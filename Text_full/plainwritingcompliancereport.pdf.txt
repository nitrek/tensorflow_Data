U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
Compliance Report on Implementation of the Plain Writing Act of 2010
April 13, 2016

Summary of steps taken by the SEC to implement the Plain Writing Act of 2010 (Act):
•

Lori J. Schock, Director, Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, was
designated as the Senior Agency Official responsible for plain writing.

•

We created an SEC webpage about our Plain Writing Initiative at
http://www.sec.gov/plainwriting.shtml.

•

We created an emailbox for public comments on the SEC’s plain writing efforts at
PlainWriting@sec.gov.

•

We provided information on the requirements of the Act to SEC staff agency-wide
and posted the information on the SEC’s intranet.

•

Approximately 150 SEC staff received training from representatives of the Plain
Language and Information Network (PLAIN).gov. In addition, from April 1, 2015
through March 30, 2016, over 180 SEC staff completed professional writing
courses that included a “plain language” component.

•

We posted training materials about plain writing from PLAIN and other
government agencies on the SEC’s intranet.

•

We posted information on the SEC’s intranet regarding the results of investor
testing commissioned by the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy to learn
about investor views on the usefulness of SEC disclosure documents. Plain
writing was at the top of many investors’ lists of preferences for disclosures about
financial and investment topics. Investors also indicated a preference for logical
organization, clear information design, and the use of visuals to aid
comprehension.
