Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate
and in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be,
and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of
1940 (“Investment Company Act”), against Oxford Investment Partners, LLC (“Oxford”),
and pursuant to Sections 203(f) and 203(k) of the Advisers Act and Section 9(b) of the
Investment Company Act against Walter J. Clarke (“Clarke,” and together with Oxford,
“Respondents.”)
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
A.

SUMMARY

1.
This matter concerns fraud and repeated breaches of fiduciary duty by
Oxford, a Phoenix based registered investment adviser, and Clarke, Oxford’s owner and
principal. In late 2007, Clarke faced severe financial problems and decided to obtain
money to address his difficulties by exploiting an Oxford client. Specifically, in March

2008, Clarke sold 7.5% of his ownership interest in Oxford to a client at a fraudulently
inflated price ($750,000). Indeed, in connection with this transaction, Clarke employed
several devices to artificially inflate the value of Oxford by at least $1.5 million, thereby
causing the client to overpay for the 7.5% interest in the firm by at least $112,000.
2.
Moreover, on two occasions, Oxford and Clarke recommended and placed
several clients in investments in which Clarke and/or Oxford had personal and pecuniary
interests without first disclosing facts giving rise to plain conflicts of interest relating to
these investments.
3.
First, in September 2007, Clarke convinced a client to fund a $116,000 loan
originated by Cornerstone Lending Group (“Cornerstone”). Similarly, in March 2008,
Clarke convinced two additional clients to invest $200,000 to fund another Cornerstone
loan origination. However, in each instance, Respondents failed to disclose that Clarke: (1)
co-founded and was an owner of Cornerstone; and (2) would profit from Cornerstone loan
originations. Within a few months of the loans being funded, the borrowers defaulted and
the Oxford clients lost their entire investments.
4.
Second, in November 2008, Clarke convinced four clients to invest
approximately $10,000 each in a privately-held company called HotStix, without first
disclosing that the owners of HotStix: (1) had ownership interests in Oxford; and (2) were
paid consultants to Oxford. Subsequently, HotStix failed and sought bankruptcy
protection, which resulted in the clients’ investment in the firm being marked down to zero.

Oxford Stix is a pooled investment vehicle that Oxford and Clarke created
in 2006 to invest assets of Oxford’s clients in HotStix, which was a privately-held company
in Arizona that provided golf club fittings. Oxford served as the investment adviser to
Oxford Stix, and four Oxford clients were members of Oxford Stix. In 2006, Oxford Stix
invested a total of $900,000 in HotStix. In November 2008, Oxford Stix invested an
additional $40,000 in HotStix.

Cornerstone Lending Group (“Cornerstone”) was a lending firm in
Phoenix, Arizona that Clarke co-created in 2007. Cornerstone focused exclusively on
“hard money” lending, which is generally considered to be sub-prime. At Cornerstone’s
inception, Clarke held a 30% ownership interest in the firm, and thus would personally
benefit from any profits realized. Cornerstone only originated two loans, which were
funded almost exclusively by Oxford’s clients. Cornerstone received points in connection
with its loan originations.

The Center for Wealth Management (“CWM”) is an entity that Clarke
co-founded in 1999 that offers financial planning courses through colleges and universities
in California and Arizona.

CLARKE FRAUDULENTLY INFLATED THE PRICE OF OXFORD
WHEN SELLING AN INTEREST IN THE FIRM TO A CLIENT
1.

In Late 2007, Clarke’s Acute Financial Problems Drove Him to Sell a
Portion of His Interest in Oxford

10.
In late 2007, Clarke decided to sell a portion of his ownership interest in
Oxford to raise money to address his deteriorating financial condition. As of Q1 2008,
Clarke was heavily in debt and was struggling to meet his financial obligations. Indeed,
Clarke was facing numerous financial difficulties in late 2007, which persisted and
worsened in early 2008.
11.
First, Clarke was paying mortgages on two homes – a new home he had
purchased in 2007 for $3.5 million, as well as his previous home, which he was unable to
sell. In the summer of 2007, Clarke’s mortgage payments ballooned as his interest rate
increased from 5.75% to 7%.
12.
Second, a number of “lifestyle” expenses (e.g., private schools, professional
tennis lessons and interior designers) also aggravated his personal financial situation. In a
January 2008 email, Clarke complained bitterly about being under pressure to find a
solution to his financial problems.
13.
Third, Clarke’s finances were strained by a legal settlement with Wachovia,
his former employer. Pursuant to the terms of this $400,000 settlement, as of January 1,
2008, Clarke was obligated to: (1) make quarterly payments of $10,000 to Wachovia; and
(2) pay an additional $130,000 by January 15, 2009.
14.
Fourth, Clarke’s purchase of an advisory firm was also a financial burden
that contributed to his inclination to sell a portion of his interest in Oxford. In connection
with this $600,000 purchase, Clarke executed an agreement whereby he agreed to pay
$30,000 per quarter in satisfaction of the purchase price.

3

15.
Fifth, when Gary Cluff (a co-owner of Oxford) became severely ill in late
2007, he approached Clarke about buying out his interest, which in turn caused Clarke to
look for sources of liquidity.
2.

In March 2008, Clarke Convinced an Oxford Client to Purchase an
Interest in Oxford on the Basis of False and Misleading Information

16.
In December 2007, Clarke asked Client A to consider purchasing an interest
in Oxford. During his conversations with Client A, Clarke asserted that Oxford had grown
dramatically, and that he expected such growth to continue, thereby increasing the firm’s
value. Clarke said that he was selling interests in Oxford to “expand his business” – e.g.,
by hiring employees and building out office space. Clarke also said that he was selling
interests in Oxford because he needed capital to add infrastructure to the firm in
anticipation of landing a large Indian gaming client. Additionally, Clarke told Client A that
the firm was so profitable that: (1) he had received $1.5 million in distributions in 2007;
and that (2) revenues in excess of $1.5 million would be distributed to Oxford’s other
owners in proportion to their ownership interest in the firm.
17.
In March 2008, Clarke sold Client A 7.5% of his ownership interest in
Oxford for $750,000. Neither Client A, nor any lawyer or accountant acting on her behalf,
performed any diligence relating to Oxford prior to the sale. To consummate the sale,
Client A and Clarke executed a document entitled Membership Interest Purchase
Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”), and Client A then authorized the transfer of $750,000
from her account to an account in the name of “Oxford Investment Partners LLC.”
18.
Within days of the transfer, rather than make the capital investments in
Oxford that he had mentioned to Client A, Clarke withdrew the money and used it to
alleviate his personal financial problems.
3.

Clarke Deliberately Inflated the Value of Oxford in Connection with
the March 2008 Sale of a Portion of His Interest in Oxford to Client A

19.
Clarke valued Oxford at $10 million in connection with the sale to Client
A. However, Clarke has failed to offer any documentation or plausible explanation to
support this valuation. To the contrary, Clarke deliberately employed three devices to
fraudulently inflate his valuation of Oxford. First, Clarke performed the valuation by
applying an excessive and baseless multiple to Oxford’s 2007 annual revenue. Second,
Clarke calculated Oxford’s 2007 revenue by quadrupling Oxford’s Q4 2007 revenue – the
highest of 2007 – and ignoring Oxford’s lower revenue numbers from the previous three
quarters. Third, Clarke added an additional and baseless $1 million “premium” to Oxford’s
valuation, which he claimed accounted for Oxford’s “amazing” growth trajectory.
20.
Clarke claimed that his $10 million valuation was based upon listings for
the sale of advisory firms published by a firm called “FP Transitions”, which performs
valuations of advisory firms and provides listings for – and other services related to – the
sale of advisory firms. These listings include the firm’s annual revenues, number of clients
and the owner’s asking price.
4

21.
According to Clarke, the listings prompted him to value Oxford at 3x the
firm’s 2007 revenues. Clarke claimed that, based upon the listings published by FP
Transitions during the 2007 timeframe, advisory firms were selling at between 2.5x and
3.5x annual revenue, and thus he was confident that he was “right down the middle” in
valuing Oxford at 3x its 2007 annual revenue.
22.
However, according to FP Transitions, in 2007 advisory firms sold at an
average multiple of 2.49, while the high multiple was 2.98 and the low multiple was 1.63.
Similarly, in 2008, advisory firms sold at an average multiple of 2.33, with a high multiple
of 2.74 and a low multiple of 2.33. Nevertheless, Clarke maintained that his review of the
FP Transitions listings gave him confidence that he was “right down the middle” in valuing
Oxford at 3x its 2007 annual revenue.
23.
Next, Clarke proceeded to calculate Oxford’s “2007 revenue.” However,
Clarke did so by quadrupling Oxford’s Q4 2007 revenue ($745,109), rather than adding up
the revenues from Q1 through Q4 ($637,622; $700,798; $734,457; $745,109, respectively).
Using this approach, Clarke calculated Oxford’s 2007 revenue at $2,980,436 – as opposed
to Oxford’s actual 2007 revenue, which was $2,817,986 (a difference of $162,450).
24.
Clarke then multiplied his inflated 2007 annual revenue figure ($2,980,436)
by 3 to get $8,941,308 (a figure containing $487,350 of inflation due to Clarke’s
questionable calculation of Oxford’s 2007 revenue).
25.
Finally, Clarke added a $1 million “premium” to his valuation of Oxford,
which he felt was warranted due to the “amazing trajectory” of Oxford’s growth. Clarke
attributed some portion of the premium to Oxford’s relationship with CWM, even though
CWM had operated at a loss since inception.
E.

RESPONDENTS FAILED TO DISCLOSE FACTS CONSTITUTING
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST TO CLIENTS
1.

Respondents Failed to Disclose Clarke’s Ownership Interest in
Cornerstone Prior to Advising Clients to Fund Loans Originated by
that Firm
a.

The Petra Luh Loan

26.
In September 2007, Clarke advised an Oxford client (“Client B”) to fund a
$116,000 loan to Petra Luh (the “Petra Luh Loan”), who intended to use the proceeds to
help fund a project in Arizona. Client B informed Clarke that she was uncomfortable with
the loan due to the questionable collateral offered, as well as the generally poor level of
documentation. Clarke responded to her concerns by stressing that any changes would
“kill” the deal and offering to “guarantee” her against any losses. In reliance upon Clarke’s
representations, Client B funded the $116,000 loan to Petra Luh. Cornerstone received
points in connection with its origination of the Petra Luh Loan. Additionally, Oxford

5

charged Client B advisory fees on the Petra Luh Loan, as it constituted an asset under
management.
27.
Prior to advising Client B to fund the Cornerstone loan to Petra Luh, neither
Clarke, nor Oxford, informed her of the material fact that Clarke had an ownership interest
in Cornerstone, and thus stood to profit from Cornerstone loans. Shortly after Client B
funded the Petra Luh Loan, Luh stopped making interest payments, and subsequently
defaulted. As a result of Luh’s default, Client B was forced to hire an attorney and incur
fees to foreclose on the collateral. To date, Client B has essentially lost the full $116,000
that she invested in the Petra Luh Loan. Additionally, despite his supposed “guarantee,”
Clarke has not reimbursed Client B for the losses she incurred as a result of following
Clarke’s advice to fund the Cornerstone-originated loan to Petra Luh.
b.

The Dannenbaum Loan

28.
Similarly, in or around March 2008, Clarke convinced two additional
Oxford clients (“Client C” and “Client D”) to fund a loan originated by Cornerstone to Ken
Dannenbaum (the “Dannenbaum Loan”). Specifically, on Clarke’s recommendation,
Client C and Client D each invested $100,000 to fund the Dannenbaum Loan. However,
prior to advising these clients to fund the Dannenbaum Loan, Clarke failed to disclose the
material fact of his ownership interest in Cornerstone, which received points in connection
with the origination of the loan.
29.
In June 2008, over two months after Client C and Client D funded the
Dannenbaum Loan, Oxford’s compliance officer revealed Clarke’s ownership interest in
Cornerstone to Client C, who then demanded a full explanation and stated that he was now
“uncomfortable” with the Dannenbaum Loan.
30.
Internally at Oxford, the investments that Client C and Client D made in the
Dannenbaum Loan were characterized as assets under Oxford’s management, and were
included in Oxford’s fee calculation. In or around December 2008, Client C and Client D
stopped receiving interest payments. Subsequently, in Q1 2009, Dannenbaum defaulted
and the underlying property went into foreclosure, essentially wiping out the investments
made by Client C and Client D.
2.

Prior to Recommending an Investment in a Private Company,
Respondents Failed to Disclose that the Company’s Owners Had
Ownership Interests in Oxford

31.
In November 2008, Clarke solicited several clients to invest through a
pooled investment vehicle in HotStix, a privately-held company, without first disclosing
Oxford’s relationship with the company’s owners – a fact giving rise to conflicts of
interest.
32.
Oxford Stix is a pooled investment vehicle that Clarke created in 2006 for
the sole purpose of pooling the assets of Oxford’s clients to invest in HotStix. In 2006,
four Oxford clients invested a total of $900,000 in Oxford Stix.
6

33.
After the Oxford Stix 2006 investment in HotStix, material transactions
occurred between Clarke and the owners of HotStix – Tim and Eric Crown. First, in May
2008, the Crowns purchased a portion of Clarke’s interest in Oxford, thereby becoming coowners of the firm. Additionally, in connection with their acquisition of an ownership
interest in Oxford, the Crowns executed a “Consulting Agreement” with Oxford, whereby
Oxford agreed to pay the Crowns at least $45,000 per year, purportedly in exchange for the
Crowns’ consulting services.
34.
Subsequently, in November 2008, HotStix asked its investors – including
the members of Oxford Stix – to provide additional capital to the firm. Clarke advised the
members of Oxford Stix to make an additional investment of $40,000. However, when
making this recommendation, Clarke failed to disclose the material facts that the owners of
HotStix: (1) were co-owners of Oxford; and (2) paid consultants to Oxford.
35.
Shortly after seeking additional funds in November 2008, HotStix failed,
sought bankruptcy protection, and the value of the Oxford Stix investment in HotStix was
marked down to zero.
F.

VIOLATIONS

36.
As a result of the conduct described above, Oxford and Clarke willfully
violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act by employing devices, schemes or
artifices to defraud clients, and engaging in transactions, practices or courses of business
that defrauded clients or prospective clients.
37.
As a result of the conduct described above, Oxford and Clarke willfully
violated Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 promulgated thereunder,
which prohibits fraudulent conduct by advisers to “pooled investment vehicles” with
respect to investors or prospective investors in those pools.
