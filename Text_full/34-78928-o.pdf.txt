File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of current and
accurate public information concerning the securities of each of the issuers detailed below
because questions have arisen as to their operating status, if any. Each of the issuers below is
quoted on OTC Link operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. The staff of the Securities and
Exchange Commission has independently endeavored to determine whether any of the issuers
below are operating. Each of the issuers below either confirmed they were now private
companies or no longer in operation, or failed to respond to the staffâ€™s inquiry about their
operating status, did not have an operational address, or failed to provide their registered agent
with an operational address. The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission also
determined that none of the issuers below has filed any information with OTC Markets Group,
Inc. or the Securities and Exchange Commission for the past two years.
